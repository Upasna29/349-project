It's so devoid of any identity that playing it hardly felt like I was interacting with a game at all. It's anonymous in the way that leaves you bored and begging the question why you ever decided to boot it up to begin with.\n\nThe gist of what you'll be doing is rotating road tiles to guide your little race car through checkpoints and finally the end marker. And that's pretty much it. Levels roll into each other with the presence and distinction of an antisocial mouse, meekly existing until you grind your way through to the next one which seems to be almost identical to the level you just played.\n\nI'll come out and say that I wasn't able to keep myself awake long enough to play through the entirety of Racer 8, so take this review as coming from someone that's only tasted a portion of the game. But if what I didn't see is anything like what I did, then I'll rest easy knowing I got out early enough before my brain melted from prolonged exposure to extreme doses of monotony.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","September 7, 2014","false","1.2"," 103 of 118 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","103","118","3","3"

Racer 8 is a budget shifting tile puzzle game where you must ensure that your racer makes it safely through a checkpoint and to the finish line. Each course is a mix of different tiles, curved tiles, three way turn tiles and a few crossroads. Think of a train on a track that can only go forward and rather than being the engineer, you're the one that ensures the track is laid out properly. If there's no track ahead, then you crash and need to restart the course again.\n\nI'll start off with the good. The game has pleasing, cute, simple almost cartoon in a way graphics. Everything looks sleek and uniform. You can purchase more cars and different paint jobs for them with the points you earn for racing. Each vehicle has its own stats for acceleration, deceleration and whatever 100% scr is. The game's help system could be a lot more informative than telling me what all of the menu icons are. Its all nice stuff that adds to the longevity of a game with at least fifty courses. Its sad that once a course is done, its done. There's no going back.\n\nBefore you get to challenge those courses, you face a practice map that's like the others. You do this before anything else in the game. Its best to jump in head first and there's nothing difficult at the start. Once you're done with that, you get to go into the main menu.\n\nSince Racer 8 has a rally car theme, its a race and that consists of fuel, speed, a checkpoint, a finish and what amounts to jewels to collect on your way. Once you've been on the track for a while, the checkpoint will spawn and you'll need to rotate tiles to get the vehicle through the gate. With that done, after a few more seconds, the finish line will appear. You'll need to mind your fuel though.\n\nWhile I enjoy puzzle games, these tile puzzle games are among my least favorite, but it takes more than a bad genre to make a bad game. Its the glitches here and there. Things as simple as using the menu. I can click on leader boards, settings and stats to see them, but the problem is, there's no way out of them without closing the game. There are interfaces that look like they should slide up or down. They have arrows indicating it, but there is no mouse wheel support, but more surprising than that, clicking the up or down arrows does nothing as well. Trying to purchase a new vehicle for 200 points when I had 200 points told me that I did not have enough to make the purchase.\n\nThen there's playing the game, you click a tile to rotate it left, your right click to make it rotate right. That's simple enough, but to make things more challenging, certain tiles go under construction, making them a wildcard, because they can turn into any different tile. I'm fine with that, its part of the challenge to avoid them, but there are other tiles that shift without me telling them to. There's no warning that they will shift, it just happens. Worse than that, there are a few times when the vehicle has been on the road, about to leave the tile to a road that's connected and it just crashes as if it was driving down a highway with no turns, no cars and then slams into an invisible wall.\n\nThere are no hot keys and to pause the game, you'll need to mouse click it. To control the racer's throttle, you'll need to click and drag it left to go slower or right to go faster. While faster might get you where you're going, it just takes your mouse away from the tiles it needs to be at. Tapping with a finger would be much better, but even then, you risk a tile rotating when you're busy messing with the speed. The further you drive, the faster the racer seems to go.\n\nTrees can obscure your vision of the course and tiles. Could you imagine if Tetris blocked out part of your screen? The game's camera is cumbersome. You need to click the camera icon and mess with a slider. The slider raises or lowers the camera and you can click and drag the camera around. It will always continue to look down on the map like its a chess board. Racer 8 is a touch screen for sure. A top down perspective would have been advantageous, but it would have taken away from the style the game has.\n\nEverything culminates in a bad game. A budget title with menus that force you to close the game, a less preferred genre in general with a problematic camera. Its difficult to recommend this game to anyone but tile puzzle lovers on touch screen devices. Even then, there are still issues to contend with.","September 10, 2015","false","1.1"," 33 of 36 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","33","36","0","0"

There are a few constraints presented that make this task more difficult, like a fuel meter, changing weather patterns & tiles that change on their own, albeit with prior notice. There are power-ups that you can obtain that will benefit you along the race, like mitigating your rate of speed & granting more fuel. There is also a shop where you can purchase useful boosts at the beginning of each race, with the coins granted from winning races.\n\nRacer 8 does nothing particularly well. The graphics, gameplay & sound are all very generic. There isn’t anything to hold your interest longer than a couple minutes at a time.\n\nThe only thing going for Racer 8 is that it is unique in the Puzzler genre, at least on the Steam platform.

The basic premise is this "puzzle" - a racing track - where the car moves around and you turn tiles to make a path to the finish line: not overly exciting, but a good time waster to have on your phone and are somewhere, waiting, and terribly bored.\nBut that’s about all this game is, and it should have stayed as a phone game.\n\nThe game’s graphics are decent, kinda cuteish, but definitely… generic. There’s nothing special about them, and it looks exactly like every other mobile game with cars.\n\nThe splash screen forces you through the tutorial even when you've already played the game and clearly don't need it (there is a skip button, but in mine it wouldn’t work at all). So you go through the tutorial, start playing, and then get 100 pop ups telling you the exact same thing the tutorial screen just did. Ugh! Interrupt my gameplay why don't you?\n\nAfter the first round alone it gets boring and repetitive, which you could have kind of guessed it was, though I had somehow hoped it might be a bit more exciting and that the levels would provide a bit of a challenge further on. Not quite so.\n\nThere are no graphic options, no sound options, not even volume options. In fact, there are NO options whatsoever. Even if it were to be a basic hi/low, on/off setting, you HAVE to have options in your game!\nTo top it off, the music was pretty awful (and it was super loud), so I had to mute my entire computer to play. Way to go.\n\nDefinitely steer clear from this one, unless it’s free again.","September 10, 2014","false","1.3"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","0"

Not as iconic as the first but definitely more versatile.\n- Slick retro graphics that are slightly improved and more vivid than the first. Soldier's missions also throw in a more hazy variety. And the last level...prepare yourself.\n- Cleverly written and delivered story that isn't shoved down your throat. In some ways it is open to interpretation, but it is more focused and clear than the original's narrative.\n- Interesting and engaging characters...whether you hate them or not (screw Manny Pardo though.

Nothing new as the system was good to begin with.\n- Upcoming level editor for near endless replayability and experimentation.\n- GOTTA GET A GRIP!\n\nCONS\n- Some levels have very annoying level design with an abundance of windows. Level design is NOT the same as the original. It is one of the key break-offs and differences actually. Maps are significantly bigger and that is bittersweet.

The idea behimd this game is that you click on tiles to turn the track so your rally doesn't hit a dead end and crash, instead keep the car going along until a finish line tile eventually appears. The problem however is that while you have the typical straights, curves and four way junctions, there are tiles that split in mutliple directions, for example one where you approach and can go left, right or straight and one where you go left or right. You have no control over which way the driver will go at these tiles. None. He will randomly go left or right or straight on a whim without any indication from the game as to why that direction was chosen. He'll frequently follow to the left and instantly crash rather than follow and complete path you made to the right. Without the co-driver bonus, you don't even know which way he will go until he actually does it.\n\nThe only control, the only gameplay element there is in this tiny, single concept game doesn't even work, leaving the game with nothing of value. How did the developer not notice this? Its the only thing in the game for christs sake and its bust. And if they did notice that a left/right/middle button is needed then they didn't even bother to do something. The developers should be ashamed of this game. More unnecasary crap on steam. More unnecasary crap on mobile.\n\n0/10","September 19, 2014","false","0.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Yes believe it or not, This is a puzzle game. Yiou are not racing. The only thing what you are doing is switching puzzle pieces of Road together so that your car (which is driving automatic) is able to ride on it. If a road is not connected it will Crash because the driver is stupid enough to keep driving forward in his slow pace. Which means you have to restart over.\n\nGraphics is bad.\nMusic is bad and annoying after awhile.\nCamera is bad.\nAble to pause the game.\nOnly left mouse button is required.\n\nOther things.\nHighscore is totally hacked.

You scroll through over-sized menu items by dragging the box up and down, ignoring the arrows which appear only to indicate you can.  The game starts windowed, and while a standard Alt+Enter grants you a less messy-looking fullscreen option, this only makes it harder to find the close window option, which you will want shortly after your first level.\n\nThe game itself gives you a puzzle, ala Pipe Mania (circa 1989), except where your little car needs to travel is not clear from the start.  In fact, you have to mess around waiting for objectives to appear, so planning in advance is an option available only to better games than this.  As far as I can tell, there are no differences in the levels (I admit to not having played that many, wishing to retain a semblance of sanity in order to write this review) although it was raining on one level which I'm sure was nice.\n\nA special shout-out has to go to the Auto-Pilot "upgrade", which makes assumptions about you wanting to hit walls and fail, so changes routes for you accordingly.\n\nAs a special treat, you can connect this game to your Facebook account.  The developers are clearly in touch with the demands of modern gaming, and should of course be applauded.\n\nFull disclosure: I got this game for free, though still feel a little over-charged.","January 13, 2015","false","7.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Of course the fun is only like 2-4 levels, then it starts to get boring, even if levels are harder to go. Unfortutanetlly 30 seconds wait for the first checkpoint to appear in the beggining of every level is pain in ♥♥♥. Basically you have to keep your car moving circles until checkpoint appears and after that just reach the finish.\n\nIt is a very monotonic game, all levels are barely changing, only something new is added. For example a track changer,which appears randomly and can duck (if you know what I mean) you up if you are not ready for it.\n\nI really don't think this is a life changing game, not even a time skipping game. More likely this is one of those games, who appear on the Google Play shop - PlayForFree - with ads while you playing, but game itself just sucks.\n\nSo here is the same completely smarthphone game, except you pay 4.99€ for all the ads you would get if you would play this on your smartphone.\n\n3/10","January 7, 2015","false","1.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Yes, this game is actually more of a puzzle than a racing game. You basically rotate roads so that your car can move through and reach randomly generated bonuses, checkpoints and the finish line. This game will more likely frustrate you rather than make you enjoy it, and the reason for me seems that it is because of the road textures. It is not easy to recognize whether the road you rotated will make your car go left or right, except if you buy the "power-up" to have a second driver and then it will tell you of the path. There's been a lot of hate about this game, but I think it's an overall good puzzle game. The reason why I do not recommend this is because it could be better, for a game that is not entirely 3D or anything. There are trading cards for this, and this is one reason to just play (aka idle) the game. If you had a chance to take it for free, then go ahead and try it. As for you who wish to buy it, there are better puzzle and/or racing games.","July 16, 2015","false","3.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

The game gives an attribute to "Creative UK."  The court agreed that the game besmirched the reputation of the UK.  The developers were levied a sentence of no less than 10,000 hours of community service, barring any programming service.  The publishers were instructed by the court to remove the game from publication and remove all content from the hard drives of the innocent.  The publisher is embroiled in an appellate court with little chance of reversal; nevertheless, your rights as a consumer may be adversely affected if you purchase this game.\n\nTL;DR $0.24 is too much. Take for free, farm the cards. You cannot give this game away on SG because it was dispersed for free.\n\nI played this because I have time to burn on a terrible tablet game:\n1st, windowed in a 1200x900.\n2nd, there is no map rotation except by dragging the mouse.  If you do not click on the narrow border, you will rotate a track tile or click off into a different application.\n3rd, tracks rotate only 1 direction--counter-clockwise.\n4th, the game has a mechanic of changing a track tile periodically to create panic.  This is a fine effect if warning were given 3 tracks in advance.  Instead, it warns you before you have a chance to change direction from the altered tile.  Then, the change happens 0.2 seconds before your car crashes on the changed tile.  If you are staring directly at your car, you have little chance of making a save.  If you are altering the path ahead of the car, there is no way to react to the  engine force-crashing the car.","July 9, 2015","false","3.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

I’m mean “Racer 8”? The thumbnail image is a collection of Micro Machine like cars plastered on a huge logo that looks like it’s right off a shelf at Toys R’ Us. Everything about it gives the vibe of a Micro Machine knock off. So what is Racer 8? It’s a tile rotating puzzle game.\nWas it my fault for judging this book by it’s cover and booting it up for the first time without looking at even a single screenshot? Absolutely. But I don’t care, this game was an outright disappointment. Not because it wasn't what I expected, I can learn to enjoy a lot of games regardless of my personal expectations, but even as a puzzle game Racer 8 is dreadful.\nBeing a driving/racing themed game it needs speed; contrasting this is the fact that a puzzle game of this nature need to be slowly paced in order to give the player a fair chance at being able to think through and solve the board. When you bring these two things together it just causes a train wreck. I would love to see a game bring such opposite concepts together in a very natural and appealing way. Racer 8 is not that game.","February 9, 2015","false","1.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

However, I am certain I have seen almost every aspect of this game to comment on it so I will be doing it anyway.\n\nThere is only one aim of this game - build faster than the car can drive. The car move on its own, and you are in control of the tracks on something similar to a chess board. You'll have to rotate the tracks to map out the route of the car. That's it. That's baiscally it. So, when they named the game Racer 8, I believe they are trying to bring two points across. One, the racer is your enemy. Two, the 8 is actually an infinity sign written the wrong way. Why infinity? Well, because the game developers are trying to make the game last till eternality with this little chessboard turning trick with a car in it!\n\nSeriously, don't touch this game unless you have a degree in civil engineering, and if you really do, go build actual roads instead.","January 18, 2015","false","0.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","2","3","2","0"

Basically I can't find an exit button on OSX version from the main menu, that's irritating. Typically I seldom give a fxck about bad games designed and sold on steam, with the exception of this hell which annoyed me a lot.\n\nAnd to this game, ahhhh I can't say please never buy it, but buy it ONLY in bundle from retailers like indiegala, even 90% discount in Steam is still worthless! Because after playing to level 10 I found it frustrating to get people looping in finding possible ways to the end without any meanings further, but not racing exactly! I'm fxcked up! Why should I be steeped into such bull shxt for trading cards! I'd play pipe connecting games instead of a load of so-called "racer" shìt! Game is amusing, at least make human beings fulfilled, or meat and drink to people but not let people do the same perishing action again and again, and who the hell want to get stuck in activity of redesigning faked roads? It's so devoid of freshness, yet badly supported on non-Windows platform.\n\nHey producer, why don't you introduce in-game purchase of the shop for buying those virtual items?

By that, you're half right, but also half wrong.  It's a boring puzzle game.  Didn't finish all 50 levels, but then again, why would I?   No achievements and all levels are pretty much the same thing.  (Stopped at level 11)\n\nYou're essentially playing pipe dream, only with a single car, tiles that randomly change on you, and a fuel meter that acts as your time counter.  Expect to crash often and don't expect victory to be satisfying.\n\nPros:\nGraphics look decent.\nMay tickle the fancy of those who are puzzle fetishists.\nCard drops to sell.\nNot bugged.\n\nCons:\nMonotonous.  (Same thing every stage.  Why have levels at all?)\nYou're going to use a slow speed for most of the game, even though you can increase the speed at any given time.\nYou click an option and the only way out is to reclick that same button (You'd think that pressing escape would be enough to back out...)\nCalling this game a "Racer" is false advertisement.\nOnly real difficulty (That is...the change as you progress) is the gas limit (or time limit) and blindspots.\nNo achievements (meaning no incentive for me to continue)\n\nAs a project developed by 3 guys and tested by 6 people, there is not much here to be "stellar" about.  At least the game isn't bugged, so I can't fault the devs there.  But the imagination here is lacking.\n\n\nPersonally, I don't really like it.    I only found it to be worth 18 minutes of gameplay (as of typing this review)....now to wait for the card drops....  But at least I got the game for free, so selling the cards will at least provide a profit.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=513126444\n\n2/10","September 5, 2015","false","3.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I actually had no idea what a 486 processor was. I had to google to find out. It turns out it is an Intel processor, that was released in 1989. Cool!\n\nThe i2 processor doesn't actually exist. And yes I did google it, just for the fun of it.\n\nDirectX 10 isn't needed, but at least they listed something that a)exists, and b)exists in the modern age.\n\nI'm fairly sure for the OS the train of thought was, 'huh, minimum OS...hmmm let's choose a random old OS....Ahh! XP! Perfect! Right, now onto recommended....hmm. Tough one. Let's choose a more modern OS....W7! Ah, perfect!"\n\nI say these things because the game is much like the specs. Not much thought given to the platform. From the start everything is 'touch', not click. The UI is classic mobile design. I don't actually know how to scroll down in the options. Clicking on the arrow doesn't do anything. WASD or the arrow keys doesn't do anything. The entire UI seems to be trial and error at times.\n\nAs for the game, it's fairly okay when it's not glitching and the car just stops and doesn't bother moving again. It's a decent little puzzle game, it's a shame you are bombarded with annoying notifications about something appearing on the map.

Dalin <leØKıng>","http://steamcommunity.com/id/leonidOFL/","64 products in account","Yes, the game is a puzzle, but the puzzle itself is very... what's the word... Oh yeah, "crappy". I have seen this kinds of puzzle on Miniclip ( for FREE! ) a lot ( and don`t make me search them, I swear I found over 5 kinds of games of this ).\n\nGraphics are loosy, the trees are made by some autistic kid , I guess. The quality of textures is simply ♥♥♥♥♥♥. They. Make. Me. Go. Blind.\n\nGameplay is ... Uhm... Wait, we have a gameplay over here? You just whirl in that muddy ♥♥♥♥ with your car looking to exit and if you do exit the game says "Game Over". That`s it. That`s f*cking it. You just have to stay how much possible in that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ roads are avoiding some random D-Calified Builders ( I mean, if the roads from my country we`re made as fast as those from this game, I would be really happy. ) trying to build new roads and the edge of the map.\nIf something is rebuilded right in your path makes you rage because , most of the time, you have to RE-DO everything or you crash.\n\nThe best part from the games was when I got the cards. That`s it. For real.\nThis game is somewhere near 0.49 EUR as it's best. If you pay more than you should on this, you are:\n- simply stupid\n- spoiled rich kid/♥♥♥ which have nothing to do with money\n- some charity guy which wants to help the Poor Developers\n\n\n* No offense to the Developers. I respect your work but it`s simply not enough for a 2014 ( 2015 ) game. Work your ♥♥♥ harder and make me think I`m wrong. Or other players which have some thoughts as mine.\n\n[tl;dr]\nRate: 1/5 *\nPros:\n- STEAM CARDS, yay.\n- It has a tutorial.\n\nCons:\n- No options to set the sound a little bit off or better graphics.\n- Even tutorial is hard and not constructive.\n- Graphics are... meh?\n- Gameplay is very meh.\n- Not original concept\n- Rage & Boring Simulator\n- Pickups spawns are chaotic\n- I still have no clue why the f^ck I`m in a truck trying to drive in some mud roads.\n\nIf you see me in the game, then It means I still try to complete that f^cking tutorial or I have nothing to do with my life.","December 25, 2014","false","0.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Those are the only pros I can think of. I know this is Indie game, but it looks like devs took no effort at all and attempted to create a game that is easy profit, easily sold to children.\n\nCons:\n\n-Poor mechanics/gameplay - As one of the reviewers said, it's "Water Pipes" kind of game, but car instead of water and road instead of Pipes. You can't predict if the car will go where you want it to go (or I'm just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I need to say I tried to complete level 2 for few hours. No effect). Also the "block changing" mechanic in this game isn't any challenge. It's just frustrating.\n\n-Graphics - It was released on Steam in 2014. I think I don't have to say much more.\n\n-Price - In my opinion, 5 euros is too much to charge for such a "game". Maybe 0 euro is okay, but 5 is definiately too much. For comparsion, for 5 euros you can get such RACING games as: Carmageddon,Crash & Burn racing, Stuntmania reloaded and much more. You can also find better FREE games on browser.\n\n\nSo, I can say it's not worth spending a dime on it. Get it for free as fast as possible, because no reason to spend money on it. Hopefully it will stay free forever or will become Free 2 Play.","December 26, 2014","false","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The car moves and you have to rotate the squares but by the time you manage to do it you are probably already late. I wanted a puzzle game and got a " causing anxiety", "need concentration" type of game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CrazyTerabyte/recommended/292380/","CrazyTerabyte","Denilson Sá","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CrazyTerabyte/","919 products in account","This is not a racing game. This is a puzzle game.\n\nThe car follows the track, and you can click to rotate each of the track pieces. Randomly, one piece will mutate into another one. And that's the entire gameplay.\n\nWhy am I giving a negative review? Because...\n* The camera angle is terrible.\n* It would have been better if this game was a 2D game instead. Instead, by making it a 3D game with a fixed camera angle, the game gets artificially more difficult and more confusing. (actually, you can slightly change the camera height by clicking on a button at the left side of the screen, but the angle is still terrible)\n* The extraneous graphic elements, such as trees and even clouds, serve no purpose other than trying to look good and instead obscuring your view.\n* There is no animation for the track rotation. It just instantly rotates 90 degrees.\n* You can only click with the left mouse button. So, you can only rotate tracks in one direction.\n* There are no options. It runs in a window with a fixed size.\n* It has built-in coins to implement some kind of progression grinding. For what? For more cars! And for paint jobs!\n* It has some kind of Facebook integration, but it does not work.\n* The music gets annoying pretty fast.\n* It looks like a mobile game that was quickly ported to PC without much thought. Heck, even as a mobile game it is not good.\n* The game progress is saved at the Windows Registry.\n* It is boring.\n\nThe PC Gaming Wiki lists some command-line options to change the resolution.\n\nI like the core gameplay concept, but I dislike this implementation. Avoid this game.","May 21","false","2.3"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"
