This is like Flappy Bird, only with a Tiki-Man with a wood problem.\n\nThis game is cheap as hell too. You could spend hours and hours of fun and frustratingly trying to pull your hair out just to beat your highscore or go even higher. This game is simply addicting. Once you get used to the controls and the overall rhythm of the chopping and when to avoid the wooden chainsaw of death, you can pretty much hit high score.

You get your money's worth. Three times.\n\nCONS:\n\n- The night background sometimes camouflages the wooden chainsaws, which can be very hard to see or avoid unless you concentrate real hard and look.\n- No other music other than the template music. (You can mute your sound and play something else though.)\n- Will frustrate the hell out of you, just like what Flappy Bird did to me.\n- Will make you kill your dog.\n- Might make you punch your computer out of frustration.\n- No multiplayer.\n- No leaderboards.\n- That freaking soundtrack.\n\n\n810","October 5, 2015","true","0.8"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

If the answer is yes then Tiki Man may be the game for you.\n\nGameplay\nOddly additive. It’s one of the simplest games you’ll ever play and that’s part of the reason it’s so playable. The basic aim of the game is to chop the tiki faces and avoid the tiki arms, it may sound easy but it sure isn’t. The game challenges you to play at pace and keep that pace going as the sections become more difficult.\n\nUnlocks\nWith four luscious tropical environments and sixteen Tiki Men to unlock there’s certainly a lot for you to earn but you’ll have to be a master of pace to get them all.\n\nStyle\nIt feels very much like one of those Flash Games you’d play at school when you thought no one was watching or when you’ve got a space couple of minutes. It’s by no means the most beautiful game but the look fits perfectly with the style of play, it doesn’t need to be anything more complex because it’s reflective of the simple, quick style you play.\n\nCompete with friends\nThere’s no multiplayer game modes or challenge your friends modes but that doesn’t mean to say you can’t compete with them. This game has a super simple leaderboard similar to Flappy Birds in which it sounds you your Best Score and your last score. So it’s time to get chopping and beating your friends high scores.\n\nPublished Blog Post[www.dabs.com]","August 27, 2015","true","1.1"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"
