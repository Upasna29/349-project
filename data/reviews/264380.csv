This VN tells the story about the residence of 7th floor Setsumi Sakura and her experience during the last moment of her life.\n\nThis game includes both the Narcissu 1st & Narcissu 2nd. 2nd being the prequel and 1st is the main story of Setsumi.\nThe 2nd tells the story of Himeko Sunohara as her life take a 180 degree turn when she was diagnosed with a diseased that can't be cured, thus she's moved to the 7th floor. Himeko used to work as helper in 7th floor so she kinda used to the situation, but then it all changes when she met Setsumi.\n\nNarcissu 1st set appx. 6-7 years after 2nd. The story is focused on the anonymous Protagonist (just think of him as us) who is terminally ill & Setsumi as both of them realizes their feeling of not wanting to die in the hospital or at home with their respective families. The two of them begin a long journey accross Japan until they find that place...\nNARCISSU\n\nI have completed the game 2 years ago and when I found this game on Steam Greenlight, I immediately vote it up as I think this  COULD BE first step of introducing the Visual Novel medium to the West. Currently the game is in Early Access but don't let that bother you because the story itself is completed & translated. I'm also part of the Closed Beta tester and I could say that Sekai Project did a good job of making the game engine compatible with Steamwork.\n\nDefinitely a must have if you are an avid VN player or you are interested in this medium, even after 2 years of finishing this, I still get  dem feels  moment :') a Masterpiece indeed!","April 25, 2014","true","21.5"," 485 of 526 people (92%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","92","485","526","6","9"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jfietkau/recommended/264380/","jfietkau","jfietkau","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jfietkau/","6646 products in account","This is a story of disease and suffering; of medication and adverse effects; of thoracotomy scars and cellular poisons; of the living who cannot help but to die and of the dying who cannot help but to live; of a resting place other than "on 7F" or "at home".\n\nUsually I would start a review with some sort of story hook, an attempt to use my own words to evoke the kind of atmosphere you can expect from the full experience, something to show you at a glance whether it could really speak to you or whether you would not connect with it at all. In the case of Narcissu 1st & 2nd, I feel that no matter how long I try, I will not be able to top the original summary by Insani (quoted above and throughout this review), the fan translation group that first brought Narcissu to English-speaking audiences. Instead I will just quote their writing where appropriate and dive straight into the facts myself.\n\nNarcissu and its sequel Narcissu Side 2nd are rather famous kinetic novels (meaning they have no branching story or player choices) with a strong legacy in the VN community. They are known for their use of minimalist visuals, mostly showing backgrounds with no character sprites or even just a gray void, with only very few character CGs inbetween. The soundtrack relies heavily on piano pieces, but also makes use of other instruments in some places, and features two title tracks with Japanese vocals. The engine shows its age in some aspects and does not have a fullscreen mode for example, but apart from that it has everything you'd expect, including save states and a soundtrack menu. As a reader, you have the choice between two different English translations or the original Japanese script, and you can opt to listen to the Japanese voice acting if you so choose.\n\nImagine what it would be like to have your entire life -- your friends, your family, your interests, your loves, your hatreds, your future -- all taken away from you in a single instant. Imagine a hard, lumpy bed, a noise-filled ward, the sharp sting of needles entering your flesh at all hours of the day, the indignity of being woken up just as you are about to fall asleep for incessant vital statistics measurements, the doctors whose names you don't know (but that's okay, because they don't remember your name, either; they just remember you as "the non-small cell lung carcinoma in room 6"), and your own name, your very own name, that you have just about forgotten.\n\nThen you might have some clue as to what it is like to be dying in a hospital.\n\nIt would be off the mark to describe Narcissu as an "emotional rollercoaster" since the concept would imply lots of ups and downs, but even though Narcissu ends on a bittersweet note of resolution, it is pretty much devoid of "up" moments. VN connoisseurs might note that this places it in the utsuge genre, everyone else seeking more stories like it now has a keyword to search by.\n\nThe story is about an unnamed young man who falls terminally ill. After all venues of hope are exhausted, he is moved to the hospice ward of the local hospital, where he meets a girl of about his age who conveys to him the unwritten rules of the inhabitants of the 7th floor, of those who are going to die. The two begin a series of awkward non-interactions that culminate in their decision to reject the dichotomy of dying either in the hospital or at home, which kicks off the main arc of the story.\n\nThe way that Narcissu hones in on its themes with every fiber of its being is both its strongest asset and biggest liability. Everything about it, from the background visuals to the character interactions, is teeming with the drabness that you would expect from a story about young people in palliative care, which is not at all a melodramatic "woe is me" caricature of exaggerated sadness and self-pity, but a cold collage of loss and hopelessness rooted in questions that no human should have to ask themselves, such as: What does it even mean to be alive if there can be nothing to look forward to? Both main characters' actions and non-actions need to be viewed through this lens to have any hope of being understood.\n\nIn that sense, Narcissu as a piece of literature is more demanding of your sense of empathy than many other games and visual novels: It could easily be misunderstood as a story trying to show "normal" people what it is like to be terminally ill by taking their hands and walking them through the experience, but in actuality it's closer to a slice-of-life story about people who are terminally ill, that asks you to make the necessary mental steps towards those people on your own if you wish to understand them. In short: This story isn't written for you, it's written for its main characters.\n\nOne example that I can give without veering too far into story spoilers is Setsumi's attitude towards the protagonist. She initially comes across as standoffish and rude, and there's the tacit expectation of a pivotal moment where she finally starts to open up so the "proper" story can start, but that moment never comes. Where a less patient or empathetic reader might leave the story unsatisfied, we can instead take the opportunity to examine Setsumi's behavior with her medical situation in mind, and ponder the way that human relationships develop. Most of us go through life every day making small passing connections to people, but only once in a while do we meet someone we like enough to allow ourselves to be vulnerable around them (which takes courage) in hopes of forging a lasting connection that we can depend on in the future. But what, then, if there quite literally is no future? Suddenly there is no point in opening up to anyone new. Why bother taking the risk of potentially getting hurt if we will not live to see the reward?\n\nThe novel doesn't spell these details out to you, it asks you to understand the characters on the basis of their actions. Questions like why having a goal is suddenly such a big deal to the protagonist are left up to interpretation. The combination of strong characterization (which if you've seen my previous VN reviews you already know I am crazy for) and partially unapproachable writing is not for everyone, especially not if you are looking for light entertainment, but there is a lot of substance to it for people willing to make the effort.\n\nIn summary, Narcissu is a great visual novel that can be genuinely rewarding to read, but is ill-suited for those of us with short attention spans.\n\nThis is a story of so many things.\n\nBut most of all ...\n\nThis is the story\n\nof a girl whose heart was standing still\n\nand a boy whose breath was being stolen away,\n\nboth of whom die.","April 25, 2015","true","4.9"," 218 of 236 people (92%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","92","218","236","9","12"

Plus, hey, it's free, so it's hard not to recommend.\n\nThe nitty grittyNarcissu is a kinetic novel released by the doujin circle Stage-Nana in Japan and published here on Steam by Sekai Project. The story rotates around young people from the 7th Floor (the hospice ward). That is, people whose death has been decided. Without saying much as to the plot, I feel like the novel eloquently covers some heavy subjects: What are the things one has to do before dying? Faced with an unavoidable demise, how might people react to take back independence lost and march vibrantly toward their final act? How does one smile at the end, and how do those left behind smile after?\n\nGameplayFor people who have experience with visual/kinetic novels, this section is probably unnecessary, but for the unintiated:\nA visual novel generally works like a 'Choose Your Own Adventure' book with graphics, music, and sometimes voices. The "player", usually in the guise of the protagonist, makes choices throughout the story that affect the plot. However, Narcissu 1st & 2nd are Kinetic Novels, so they have no choices and very little player interaction aside from a click or press of the enter key to advance the text (though autoplay is actually the default setting for Narcissu Side 2nd, and the author mentions in the notes that he himself sees it more like a movie). Personally, I'd describe it as a long minimalist cutscene with save, load, and backlog options. The game itself is much closer to a novel or a reading experience than a game, and this, no doubt will be what turns a lot of people off from Narcissu, if not the genre as a whole.\n\nAnswering common questionsLength?\nNarcissu was about a 3 to 4 hour read for me. Narcissu Side 2nd (the included prequel) was 5 to 6 hours. Understandably, it might be a lot of reading for some, but both games are neatly divided into chapters, and the save feature works like a bookmark that you can use at any time.\n\nOrder?\nNarcissu was released in 2005, and Narcissu Side 2nd was released in 2007, both are included in this release, and I read them in the release order. However, Narcissu Side 2nd is actually a prequel to the events of the original Narcissu, and in the notes for Narcissu Side 2nd, the author suggests reading them in chronological order.\n\nReplay Value?\nThat probably depends on the player. The original Narcissu was kind of an experiment in minimalist storytelling for Stage-Nana, so it was released in both voiced and unvoiced versions, as the author wanted to see how the voices changed people's impression of the work, and subsequently Narcissu Side 2nd is presented similarly. An interesting mirror of that for this release is that two different translations are included: one made with the intent to localize the novel smoothly into English, and one made with the intent to replicate the phrasing of the original as faithfully as possible and paint a mental picture close to what the original author intended. Though I'm writing this review after just one reading, I can see how this approach would add replay value, and I intend to revisit Narcissu after it stews on me a bit.\n\nWhy is this free?\nNarcissu is a doujin (or fanmade/amatuer) work and was released for free in Japan. When Sekai-Project announced this Steam release, they said that in the spirit of the original release, Narcissu on Steam would be "As free as Steam would let it be," so here we are. With that said, don't take the lack of a price as a reflection of quality, because, quite frankly, there's no rule stating that professionals can't do doujin works. The music and voices are especially standout in this release, and a few of the voice actresses have both anime and game roles to their credit.\n\nConclusion (finally)\nWell, I put it at the top for a reason...\n\nThis is an excellent release that feels like a labor of love on the part of the author. To me, it stands as a great experiment in minimalist storytelling (especially in the original Narcissu, where I found myself endeared to the characters even with next to no background given about them). Though the novel (and the genre) may not be for everyone, if this feels like your kind of thing, and you have the time to give to reading a great story, I can't not recommend it.","November 30, 2014","true","10.8"," 72 of 83 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","72","83","2","0"

You don't have to navigate, survive, move, do anything at all. Consider it a Visual Novel with no decisions points at all. Think of it as listening to a story.\n\nOne playtime of N1 is about 3-4 hours, and N2 approximately double of that. (Notwithstanding the time spent crying) Although the game allows you to save, I suggest taking a Saturday afternoon to finish your first playthrough in one sitting. I wouldn't finish N1 and N2 in a single day though, as both are very emotionally draining.\n\nThe music is powerful. It complements the game really well, and is a good setting for the mood. The theme musical piece of N2 is just beautiful, although very painful if you understand the meaning of the lyrics. This is especially more so when you consider Himiko's background. There are only about 10+ song tracks per game though, and each song track is not perticularly long, so you may observe that the music gets repetative after a few hours. The VN offers a choice of voiced and unvoiced version, in Japanese. I love the voice acting. The tone was well done, and you can feel the personality and emotions of the characters through their voices. It was actually painful for me to listen to it, as though someone who was really hurting was there, right in front of me.\n\nThe graphics isn't bad, but neither is it great. There's no animation throughout the entire game, it is just a series of largely nondescript scenery artwork. It probably would have been rather weird without the art, though.\n\nThere's nothing much I can say of the story without being too spoilerish, so really, just try it out for yourself. Narcissu is a very though provoking piece centering on the topic of death, mainly on the process of dying. I'll not touch on the points raised, leaving the story open to your own interpretation. The writing transported me into their world, made me internalized their emotions as though I was the one actually going through everything. This is a real tear-jerker, although I'm glad its not because it wants to be a tear-jerker. That is to say, the storyline is not written such that it becomes a sad story, rather, the message behind the story generally evokes sad feelings in people.\n\nI've came across people who complained that the story behind N1 was too linear. (I must admit, I was an idiot for missing the blatently smoking Chekov's gun at the beginning) This is not a detective mystery novel, and to put an unexpected twist ending would go against the point of the game. N2 is significantly longer than N1, but touches on more topics as well. It is the prologue of N1, giving more details of unexaplined things which happened in N1, and giving more depth to Setsumi. Even so, it is a distinctly seperate story from N1.\n\nAfter finishing N2, don't close the game just yet. Go back to the main page, as you've unlocked a short Epilogue/Acknowledgements. It is concluding section from the author, giving us what the ending after N1 would turn out to be.\n\nIt would be good to read the game notes too, especially the part about translator's disambiguation of the two translation versions and the choice of voiced or unvoiced versions on which to choose for your first time. For my first playthrough I used a voiced version of Agilis' translation and did it in the order N1 followed by N2. Although the author  suggested playing it in the chronological order (N2 before N1), I recommend going through N1 first. There were limited information about the main character Setsumi, and her backgrounds in N1; I felt this actually helped to focus the story onto the important points. For those who don't like the slight confusion of not knowing the main character's background, go with the author's suggestion.","December 10, 2014","true","86.2"," 31 of 36 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","31","36","2","0"

All of them residents of the 7th floor, the floor for one to await for their turn... to die.\n\nFirst, its probably better to explain what is Narcissu 2nd, while it's the second game, in reality it functions as a prequel to the first story. While both stories have different points of views, the person connceting them, and the main pillar, is Setsumi, a 22 year old girl (15 on the prequel).\n\nOn Narcissu 1st, the story is about a boy (Yuu Atou, although his name is never revealed on both games) who meets Setsumi, a girl who doesn't wants to die neither at home or on the 7th floor.\nNarcissu 2nd is about the encounter between Setsumi and Himeko, a woman on her twenties, cheerful and full of energy, who is currently residing on the 7th floor.\n\nWhile the autor says that in his opinion the playing order should start with the 2nd, I started with the 1st (hadn't noticed that before completing the first game), and with that, I can say that playing the 1st first, and then the 2nd, gives the feeling of "so that's how it happened", and it helps to see better some connections between both games. If one decides to start with the 2nd, in my opinion I think it will give a better connection with Setsumi and probably more emotional impact (although it still gives you one whatever game you decide to start first).\n\nIt's surprising that a free visual novel is so well built, the first game isn't fully voiced (and on an important note, both games HAVE NO CHOICE, which isn't very frequent in visual novels), the second one is fully (or 99%) voiced, and has better art. As for the OST, i liked it, most of it had a sad tone and managed to help deliver the emotions needed. All of this in about 12 hours of content.\n\nAs for the story itself and the characters, it gave me the feels...\nThe importance of ones death, and life, and how it affects the other.\nOf those who have been left behind, and kept going.","February 7, 2015","true","6.2"," 32 of 38 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","32","38","0","2"

Three are misconceptions and the latter… deplorable.\n\nNote:  This has been completed as a review with abstract views, especially due to the game's grave theme.\nThis is worth your time, especially as an F2P game (you're missing out)!\n\n* Semi-spoiler alert.\nDoes not contain extensive storylines but will hint at certain basic aspects of the plot which could spoil gameplay a smidgen.\n\n* TL;DR – A straightforward and conclusive review can be found at the bottom\n\nDeath of the young affects everyone    Be ready as the very private and personal events of death will unfold before you. It will not drag you to hell or kill you from boredom if you take the time to read it properly. It does a superb job of taking out the gut-wrenching and leaving minimal scars. Whenever young people die in a similar context I am reminded of the anime series, Anohana (あの日見た花の名前を僕達はまだ知らない。) which I strongly recommend whether you like anime or not as it talks about the issue of loss and death for young adults as is done through Narcissu. It's a theme which requires more love from modern literature and media emphasis. Sharing more consistency with Narcissu is John Green's novel, The Fault in Our Stars (there is also a film) so that may give you an idea of the amount of heartache and satisfaction Narcissu may offer as a sad but worthwhile read.\n\nReminiscent of the best 90s Japanese romance mangas but thankfully reads minus the drama overdrive    Closer to the likes of previously noted, popular modern young adult novels, Narcissu is oddly empowering as many stories like it are even for mature adults. You are a young girl without much time to live but still plenty of life left in you. It is down-to-earth and focuses on realism despite its medical inconsistencies so no character is perfect and there is no right or wrong on the perception of life, death and suicide. Even the religious slant in Narcissu 2 refreshingly had no bias or distortion. I recently played The Cat Lady, which is a beloved game on Steam also deeply based on death and suicide. But it had several points where equality disintegrated in a beaker full of acid-ridden negativity (you'll see the logic behind this if you play the game). On the other spectrum, Narcissu, like its title, is honed to a emphatically personal experience in a much more positive way without losing force.\n\nThe idea of freedom and choice within a world that lacks it    Loss and pain through the death of a loved one is excruciating as well as highly disorientating. Looking back on several personal experiences, it feels distinctly like falling through limbo. It is the most earth shattering and realistic inevitability that could ever happen to any living soul. So it is my belief that many people understandably dislike any variation of such a storyline which hints death and desolation with no escape or way to "win", especially due to the likely sense of powerlessness it makes the player/reader undergo. But this is about your death. One of the main protagonists, you, are a terminally ill character dealing with the side effects of knowing you are dying and your physical being broken down. For those inclined to avoid dealing with thoughts of death, this is a basic and comfortable visual novel to imagine the decisions you may fall upon in the face of death and urge you to grow up from being afraid of thinking onwards to that deep, impending dark hole you're walking towards.\n\nThe absence of interaction in-game, does not detract from the interactivity out of game     Every time I come across a documentary feature or visual novel, I weigh the chances I will find it boring. It's the expected outcome of short films, documentaries, software and visual novels currently available on Steam due only due to the superficially stark contrast they display from the average fully interactive game. Time and time again, I am proved wrong to have ever fretted as sitting in front of a computer screen and clicking through a story is just as culture-driven within its own universe as any game can be and offers the reader a multitude of emotions from which most will benefit from as entertainment. The graphics may be uninspired, the art cute but barely existent, and the translations could have been better (fantastic for F2P) yet you can tell it’s brilliant writing. With any type of reading, nothing beats a smashing story. That very story and the telling of it is what Narcissu excels at. I ended up interacting more deeply with other people who have played this game more than I have through other veritable games. Narcissu is lightly philosophical and a fantastic excuse for a soul-searching expedition.\n\nTL;DR & Basic details    TL;DR - Narcissu 1st & 2nd both bring light to saying goodbye to your life prematurely, on an extremely personal level in the form of a visual novel that lacks visuality/aesthetics and is more towards a breezy but splendid read.\n\nBasic details - Depending on a person's reading proficiency, this will take you approximately 5-6 hours to read through 1, 2 and the epilogue once. There are two versions of translations available for the first instalment but only one for the second. I personally found the first translator smoother (especially as it has both 1 and 2, but I read the second translator's version as well) but try both for a few pages to find your own preference. There are also voiced (Japanese) and unvoiced versions. Narcissu 2 has much more voice acting than 1 which only has the bare minimum. Decide which heightens immersion for you. Just as it is with audio books, some will dislike the voice acting (well done and professional). Having studied Japanese for a while and understanding a portion of what is said made reading much swifter. Narcissu 1 is a favourite for many so if you'd just like to read one, that's what I'd recommend. I can only imagine how wonderful it would be to read the original Japanese text as the descriptive writing is first-rate.\n\nConclusion    Ultimately, our protagonists are fighting the fight just like the rest of us. Our instincts to live, and the restrictions we are faced with (death, illness, suffering and loss), ends in discovering choices within those boundaries and our insignificant existences with bound limbs, to instead jump towards the metaphysical freedom and something much more dazzling than any other sign of human existence.\n\n\nEdited for typing error.","April 30, 2015","true","5.1"," 22 of 23 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","22","23","0","2"

It was made with the NScripter engine.\n\nNarcissu -Side 2nd- is the prequel to the visual novel Narcissu, produced by Stage-nana. The game serves as a prequel to the first game, the plot revolves around Setsumi, the female heroine from the original visual novel, and the people and circumstances that formed the character presented in the first game.\n\nNarcissu 2 is set about six or seven years before the events of the original Narcissu, while Setsumi was still just a regular outpatient living at home near the hospital. We meet Himeko, a former 7th floor helper at the hospital. Cheerful and full of energy, no one expected that she would one day be a patient in the same ward that she had spent so much time volunteering at. One summer day, while Setsumi was going to the hospital for an examination, Setsumi meets Himeko, and a long summer begins…\n\nFEELS. This game is wonderful. The story touched my heart.

Truly amazing with it's beautiful story and emotional plot.\n\nIt is one of the best works stage-nana had to offer so far in my opinion. The Ending will leave you in mixed emotions, sad, happy, relief and etc. You bet your ♥♥♥ you will have connections with the characters, the characters were pretty good and the main character was believable but there are barely any characters in this novel since it's focused between 2 characters so don't think this is a harem where you will bang every single girl nope instead you will have romance with this emotionless girl, not really love but you will see their mutual likings and views towards life and the situation they are in. I Highly reccommend this to anyone who loves beautiful things although this game was lacking in eye candy since only few pictures were given here to aid your visual needs so you'll have to use your imagination most of the time AND you can never miss out the soundtrack! The Soundtrack really fits the atmosphere and gives you an intense feeling! Kudos to the people in charge of the soundtrack, truly Amazing.\n\nNow for the 2nd installment for this game, Man.... *Sniff* In my opinion this was the most powerful, it was the prequel for the whole story focused on Setsumi Sakura and Himeko Shinohara, it was truly amazing and beautiful and really really Unforgettable. Himeko Shinohara is a very likeable character that becomes ill after a bit and the climax to this was really memorable left me thinking for days. You should witness and experience it for yourself because there are literally no words for me to describe it.\n\nOverall this was a good Visual novel, I repeat "Visual Novel" There is no gaming in this only interaction in browsing the different sections of the scripts most of the strength is given in the story.\n\n9 / 10 Story\n6 / 10 Art\n9 / 10 Soundtrack\n\nRECCOMENDED SO HARD THAT YOU HAVE TO PLAY THIS GAME, IT'S FREE SO GOOOOOOO It's worth your time :D","October 7, 2014","true","8.6"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","17","18","0","0"

It is an enjoyable, albeit tearful story about two kids slowly dying to unnamed illnesses.\n\nFans of the genre take note this 'game' isn't like other VNs on Steam. While it has it's moments for making you grin, I should warn that it is, at its heart, a depressing story - not everyone's cup of tea. Having said that I found it artfully executed, tasteful (no excessive sex references or anything of the sort), and a welcome change in mood from other games in my possession.\n\nI don't want to give away the plot, for it is short. What you can expect is a minimalist approach to story-telling - images of scenery and hospital interiors, quiet and terse dialogue, simple yet beautiful characterisations. It has a lot going for it, making it a worthwhile purchase in my mind. The only problem I had was trying to figure out who the protagonist was at certain points in the story, which may have been intentional.\n\nThere is also a beautiful mystery if you don't stay attentive, in the form of whether the story-teller is male or female. I only recently learned I had it wrong, but once again this may have been intentional. It may have worked even better had there been no evidence at all, leaving the reader to come up with whatever they prefer.\n\nSo sure, it's not your typical visual novel. It isn't interactive in any way. There are no branching possibilities, no choices to be made for different endings. But it does have a lot of things that do work - quality artwork, a decent musical score, and a plot that, in my mind, rivals some of the best short stories and novellas out there today.

There are no carefully detailed character portraits or meticulously crafted scenes. There are no branching paths or any choosing of one's waifus. The minimal-ness is even outright stated by the creator (in the Notes) to be intentional, so as to encourage the reader to visualize for themselves the scenes as they play out. Don't go in expecting this to be something it isn't.\n\nThe presentation seeks to evoke the atmosphere of a movie and does so effectively with its use of its (somewhat small) soundtrack, transitions, and screen layout. I recommend just turning on auto-play and watch (or, more accurately, read) the events of the story unfold, just as you would a movie.\n\nIt shouldn't need to be said that the main characters of these stories, Setsumi and Himeko for Narcissu 1st and 2nd respectfully, will die. There are no miracles or magic cures, no cheap ways out of their respective predicaments. It is with this in mind that the story really is at its most impactful; two people whose lives have been cut short, due to no fault of their own, and what they do with the precious few moments they have left. There is no angst here, no tantrums or curses or moping or complaining, as the two have long since come to terms with their soon-coming deaths. Instead the focus is on their actions and passing on what little they can to those they will soon be leaving behind. Narcissu 1st focuses more on the person who is dying, their experiences and choices as their death slowly approaches, while Narcissu 2nd focuses on the people around that person, those who will be invariably left behind. The two stories never felt like they were meant to be tear-jerky and never made any cheap stabs at my 'feels'-glands, all tears shed were well-earned by the writer (and translators!).\n\nFrom a technical standpoint the game itself works fine, if at times a bit wonky. I had a problem where holding down 'ctrl' caused the game to skip forward to the end of a chapter and leave me stuck at the chapter select. Also, I remember seeing a couple of typos here and there.\n\nIf you made it this far and like what you've read I cannot recommend this game any more highly, I liked it enough to the point of writing this long-♥♥♥ review as soon as I completed it. Also it's free, so you really have no excuse.","March 10, 2015","true","4.8"," 22 of 29 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","22","29","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/recommended/264380/","Twistorian","Twistor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/","4382 products in account","This horrible, horrible visual novel made be cry! As its intention was evoking emotions, it did the job.\n\nLet's get down to business (I will keep this spoiler-free). Narcissu visual novels (VN) are not strictly games: they have no interactive parts whatsoever. You can just click away and the story continues linearly with no choices. Even the achievements are just reading the novels to their ends.\n\nNarcissu (both of them) is a story about people living with a terminal disease. Note the emphasis. It's a highly emotional and tragic story, with death being a constant theme. Nevertheless, the characters lives are what's important.\n\nCuriously, the type of the disease is left unrevealed in all cases, emphasising the life of the person instead of the sickness. At all times the story follows one of the protagonists from their perspective, revealing what goes through their head. (Most) Protagonists and some important characters have voice-overs for their dialogue. Scenes are covered by nice, melodical piano songs and occasional other instruments.\n\nApart from many other visual novels, the visuals are very simple: usually there's just a serene scene that depicts the place where the events take place e.g. a kitchen or a countryside. There are very few scenes with people. The style didn't appeal to me strongly. However, I think that at important (i.e. dramatic) times the scenes were well done.\n\nA couple of things about 1st and 2nd novels separately. In my opinion Narcissu 1st begins slowly, with the protagonist being admitted to a hospital and angsting away there. In Chapter 1 it seems like nothing is happening and frankly I was bored while reading it. Fortunately, in half-way through Chapter 2 it finally begins happening, so be sure to endure until that time. Narcissu 2nd is better in this respect as it has a branching story line from the beginning with several characters.\n\nWhile both VNs are originally Japanese, there are fortunately two English translations of Narcissu 1st. The Agilis translation (the one I read thoroughly) has rather lot of typos and in some small parts it is left unfinished. To me it felt rather clunky. Only afterwards I briefly checked the gp32 translation and it turns out gp32 is a more polished and "proper" translation to English than Agilis. Narcissu 2nd has only Agilis translation to English that was fortunately a lot better and more polished than the one in Narcissu 1st.\n\nFor me, Narcissu 1st was 3-hour read and 2nd a 5-hour one. While it's possible to skip through the story by pressing CTRL for achievements, I can recommend reading through the story: it's an emotional and even revealing experience to issues and thoughts of people suffering from difficult diseases. As such, it provokes one to think about life perhaps from a new perspective. To me, that makes it worthwhile a read.","May 17, 2015","true","8.4"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","16","20","0","3"

I saw it finally was released and decided to download it immediately. I then sat down and beat the 1st 'side'; and decided to write my review (also apologies if it is vague, I wanted to avoid spoilers, and this is my first in depth review I wrote).\n\nThis visual novel is quite amazing in my opinion; it really brought emotion out of me, something most movies, games, and books cannot do (although there have been one or two games and books, and a handful of movies).\n\nThere aren't too many images used, but what images are used are amazing looking, and are very beautiful. The dialog is very descriptive, and it is translated amazingly.\n\nThe music score/soundtrack to this game is just as amazing as the rest of this visual novel; it fits in perfectly, and both sets and amplifies the mood, making the scenes much more powerful. (The soundtrack is available for purchase, and i recomend picking it up if you have the money)\n\nThe impact this game left on me is strong, I even cried at the end [I know; I’m a dork ha-ha] because of its depressing... but strangely satisfying and even somewhat happy ending (I know this seems like a contradicting statement; but it will make sense when you beat it).\n\nI whole-heartedly recommend this to anyone who enjoys visual novels, great stories, or emotionally charged entertainment; best of all is that this amazing experience is free.

Thought provoking, with tender and human moments, this novel brought tears to my eyes more than once and at the end it was a story i was glad to have heard (read).\n\nMy one and only dis on this would be the graphics. Don't get me wrong, they were nice, but they were lacking a bit. I feel they could have put more into the "visual" aspect of this novel. For example: the empty cars and grey screens.

The soundtrack mainly consists of melancholic instrumentals, which goes very well with the mood of the story. A story about living life meaningfully even when you know your time is almost up; sometimes, you have to let go of the things/people you truly love. The artwork may be simple/limited, but it says a lot.\n\nThis is my 4th Visual Novel (after Everlasting Summer and before Voices from the Sea) and it inspired me to look for more visual novels.

Told in 2 parts, Narcissu 1st and Narcissu 2nd (which actually narrates the events that occurred before Narcissu 1st) both bring out the feels in you.  You will not only come to feel that you are just someone who is filled with anguis, pain, and hopelessness after being diagnosed with life-ending disease but worse than that is experiencing the loss of the love and acknowledgement of your very existence as a homo-sapien by the people who are very close to you or those that share a special bond with you.\n\nYou may choose from many translations and having the characters be either voiced or unvoiced which is very nice.  The art style is very minimalistic but is quite effective in portraying the setting and conveying the concurrent mood to the reader.  The audio tracks are also excellent and noticeably alters the ambient setting in a dynamic fashion to which later events may be foreshadowed when combined with powerful imagery.  Both novels are broken up into chapters which also make it very easy to locate and resume from the last checkpoint; and not mentioning a save function that allows continuation from any point in a chapter.  The cream of the crop in terms of enriching user experience, in this review at least, is having the ability to auto-advance text with no manual mouse-clicking necessary.\n\nAll-in-all you can be sure to possibly shed a few tears along the way--so prepare some cleanex before you dive in. Even if you arent easily perturbed, emotionally-wise, you can still be surprised by how the novel project its powerful elements upon you to a resounding degree which easily invoke feelings of sentiment for the character.  it is, in essence, very touching text-wrapped journey that recounts the tale of a girl who is passionate about cars and her tireless endeavours in seeking true freedom and the gift of life.","June 21, 2014","true","12.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Even though the characters are simple, they are consistently believable and interesting enough to make you care about them.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/katobytes/recommended/264380/","katobytes","KatoBytes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/katobytes/","87 products in account","*Updated for Fixed Achievements.*\n\nWow, just where the hell do I even begin with this one? I have to put two novels under retrospect this time around, so here I go, I guess.\n\nNarcissu 1st & 2nd are a pair of novels centering around individuals cursed with the life of disease with their stories opaque with sensitive subjects such as solitude, misery, and death. It is apparent that these games are rather low budget but such qualities are negligible upon considering the heart that was applied ever so sincerely in every part about it. Again, these are two novels you're getting here (for free, too), ergo the review is divided into two, for each of the games/novels.\n\n--Narcissu--\n\nThe first Narcissu title follows a nameless protagonist that just recently became admitted to his hospital's 7th floor after being a normal patient for a while. His patient bracelet shifts to a white color as he is informed that no further treatment can be provided for his illness, thus his transfer after the recognition of limited time left in his life. There, he meets the silent, 22 year-old woman named Setsumi (severely underdevloped. Like, loli physique, so just call her a girl, really) and seeing how he is a resident of the top floor, she informs him about the fate of dying soon after 3 temporary discharges. After gazing at the lounge's television with this girl for a considerable amount of time, both decide that they both despise the atmospheres of their home and the hospital, and the protagonist then, simply put, steals his dad's silver coupe. Without a destination, they commence their 15 day travels with nothing other than a couple thousand yen, a driver's license, and pajamas. A little nitpick I had with all this is that it is never, not even in the second game, disclosed what exact illness these two might be suffering from, but after everything's all said and done it won't really matter.\n\nUnnecessary synopsis over, we can now proceed to the core of this game, which is the characters themselves. While both Setsumi and the protagonist themselves are "not particularly" intriguing, the creator did an excellent job ammending this issue with the stong relationship development between them. You can see this as you read through the eight chapters of this novel, as each day you feel as if these two people are gradually learning more about eachother as they confront certain predicaments along the way, thus strenghtening thier bond. However, the tender substance that most readers are anticipating resides around the later half of the game, where the matters of social exclusion and lack of self confidence come to fruition, as we see them illustrated in both Setsumi and to some extent, the protagonist. As a matter of fact, this novel comprises of several lines that left me bereft of anything but pity for these characters. Perhaps it can leave some close to tears. On the contrary, I am not afraid to state that the ending was not in any way good. I won't spoil anything but it is filled with such ill-resolve it still leaves an unsettling taste in my mouth.\n\nIt is also imperative to know that the Narcissu series belongs to a subgenre called kinetic novel which is frankly put, devoid of any choice-making segments, just plain reading. Some may argue that this is therefore not a game and, well, that's a completely plausible statement. But it's here on Steam, so it must be a game, right? I might as well call it one...\n\nThough this is composed of generally exceptional writing, the "visual" qualities of the game are objectively not as commendable in any respect. The pictures displayed while reading, as you can see in the store page's gallery, stay within this narrow bar that takes a while to get used to. This could probably be overlooked if most of the time the bar wouldn't be gray, black, or white most of the time (Oh yeah, this novel takes one hell of a liking to that). Very seldom the game would show off one of the characters, and you'll be looking at unimaginative background pictures, a car, or a bed. Worse yet, this is also a recurring problem in the second game! Maybe, just maybe this was done with intention to preserve the minimalistic bearing the game has going for it, but I would still constitute it as lazy to some extent. The music is on the other hand surprisingly good, with two diffrerent BGMs for each game which each have their own tunes for their respective emotions the game might chose to convey.\n\n--Narcissu Side 2nd--\n\n*Covering this one won't be as lengthy as some features of the second were addressed in the first.\n\nWithout hesitiation I can say Narcissu Side 2nd is the better title in virually every facet perceivable. It is nearly twice as long as the first, has much more savory flesh to go along with it, more characters that are actually material to the story, and I actually let my tears flow out with this one. It is what I'd call a close to perfect second game and shows the creator definitely became proficient on his ambitions.\n\nSide 2nd is really a prequel taking place a couple years before to the first, with the story being told by the one and only Setsumi herself as she is discharged from the hospital for the first time for the summer. At this time, Setsumi was still a blue-bracelet yielding patient, not one of the infamous 7th floor. While one day she goes back to the hospital for a brief examination, she is called out by Himeko, the best chara- erm... a twenty-something year old woman who is a resident of the 7th floor. During their small exchange regarding Setsumi's tote bag, some other stuff I refuse to spoil happens and they develop an attachment toward eachother, and so Setsumi begins her long, exceedingly sad 15th summer with this woman.\n\nAs this is a prequel, readers can detect some changes from the first game, such as Setsumi's personality as it has just a bit more, vividness, to it. However, my true fascination with Side 2nd is it's ability to link characteristics of this novel to it's chronological successor. This is shown precisely in Himeko's character, and how it serves as a noticeable precedent for what would become of Setsumi's character in the first game. The novel is also more intricate with it's writing in both a superficial and emotional level as themes of Christianity and the inevitable destiny of death are amplified to eleven this time around. No, really, it gets to a point where some one like me, an atheist won't understand the true meaning behind some sentences. Can't forget about the symbolism incorporated here as tale of A Dog of Flanders will be shoved down your thoat. Due to all this, the kinetic novel will become a harder read than the first for no justifiable reason. It all sunk in for me eventually, and some scenes struck me like a pole and I instantly became a geyser of tears. Super important thing here, this game will f***ing rip you apart. I can't stress it enough, but I don't want to utter anymore about this as it will spoil... and this damn review has been prolonged to a stupid length anyways.\n\nFYI: Achievements = There are achievements now, but the update that enabled them managed to clear all of the prior save data. It's all in the void now. No worries, hold the control key upon starting and you'll zoom though the novels in a jiffy (because it's an actual unit of time).\n\nPlease, do yourself a favor and click that install button. You won't regret it, I assure you. I invested a whole hour in this review for a reason. Whether any of this was helpful or not, Narcissu 1st and 2nd are just the quintessence of an underrated visual novel, let alone here in the west. This one is a heart-felt pair of stories that were made from the soul and I simply should have put it like that.","January 31, 2015","true","11.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sasamisan/recommended/264380/","sasamisan","Libertarians are 6 year olds","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sasamisan/","665 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nNarcissu is one of the best Visual Novels I've ever played, which is odd because it lacks a staple feature of the genre in having no choices.Reading the author's notes he states that he wanted this VN to flow like a movie and have good pacing which really adds to it more than it takes away. The story has more meaning behind it than just tear-jerking/FEELS, and the minimalistic art makes you feel like your a bystander listening in instead of looking at talking heads for hours. After playing both Narcissu 1 and 2, I feel that 1 has a better story and has a stronger experience behind it, but 2 is better produced and has a sadder story. Narcissu 2nd definitely makes you feel for Setsumi more in part 1, and gives you some insight into how she feels.\n\nI think I should mention that the author states in the notes he would like people to play 2nd before 1st because it's the chronological order. I personally played 1st before 2nd because I played 1st when it was first translated by insani a few years ago. But it definitely would probably be a more powerful experience if you played 2nd before 1st, knowing what happens kind of gave me a weird feeling, it's hard to explain, but I think it would make the 1st game an even greater experience if you had the build up of 2nd still in your mind.","May 27, 2014","true","15.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pmgbove/recommended/264380/","pmgbove","DarkRyoshi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pmgbove/","30 products in account","TL;DR This is an amazing game overall and it has 10 out of 10 in all of its aspects. (Art is debatable)\n\nWhere to start....\nI had played the first game a while ago, back when steam wasn't famous and the visual novel genre wasn't really famous, it was my second Visual Novel ever, Tsukihime being the first.\nI replayed Tsukihime not so long ago and with a greater capability for analysis I found it even more enjoyable and noticed some stuff I didn't notice the first time. Not so long ago I told myself "Hey, why not? Narcissu is now available on steam, let's replay it."\n\nJust as with Tsukihime, I enjoyed it even more this time, and it was way more painful. They present a sad reality and execute it really well, the inner conflicts of someone who knows they will die soon without a specified date. The OST just fits perfectly for each scene and makes you feel even closer to the character during their conversations, even cheerful conversations can feel painful at times because of the tone the characters speak with(The VAs do a pretty great job with this, I was amazed). You notice the pain they are carrying inside and you feel for them.\n\nAnd then comes side 2nd, which expands into this topic by presenting you another part of the conflict: Those who are left behind. The trouble close relatives go through when someone they hold dear  is close to dying, and how they try their hardest to support them despite their pain. And not  only that, but they develop further the main character from the first game and it makes you realize how she turned out that way. Every little detail mattered in the development of her character.\n\nIn the end, just like first, you go through a feelings roller coaster, the conversations tug heavily at your heart and the more you advance the more you know about the 7th floor and its patients. Each of the characters feel real and each of their interactions contribute to character development for every of them (This applies for both games).\n\nIt's truly an amazing piece of work. Soundtrack, writing, conversations, voice acting, characters. Everything is 10/10. Sure, the art may not be the most appealing, but the feel you get from it is just right.","October 24, 2015","true","5.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BlackReaper707/recommended/264380/","BlackReaper707","MrReaper","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BlackReaper707/","82 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nNarcissu is a great VN (visual novel) and well if you haven't tried it yet you really owe it to yourself to try this, as it is a very emotional experience, it has a great sound track and it is short and free so you might aswell just download it now as your not paying anything to try.\n\nNarcissu is a pretty depressing VN as it's about terminally ill people, who are going to die soon the story takes you through the hardships and isololation their illnes causes them. So be WARNED after reading this it will be pretty difficult to be happy for a while but it's good that this VN gets you emotionalally invested in the characters. The concept and writing was good and I did enjoy the characters aswell, but I want to specifically mention the sound track. It was really well done and helped enhance pretty much every scene, it not only suited the scenes, but it enhanced them aswell, when something emotional was happening, I was sad due to what was happening but the sound track really gave everything an extra kick, it was definitely well done.\n\nWhat might put somepeople of is that this is a novel meaning you have hardly any interaction, think of it as a book with sound and visuals as a aid, as all you will do is click or  nothing at all if you set it to auto scroll, so whilst it has a good story, you should be warned this isn't really like a game this is more like a novel as it has no gameplay what so ever (No choices in this VN either).\n\nHowever I will still recommend this, the story is good, the characters are strong and I don't think I have anything else on my Steam Library which has made me feel as much for the characters as this VN does. The topics it explores is heavy but I felt that this was an interesting experience putting myself in the shows of somebody who doesn't have much time, did also get me to reflect on what my reaction would be to this situation and I do feel like I have gained something just by exploring this topic.\nIts only a few hours long, its pretty well done, it is also free, I don't think there is a reason for you to not at least try it.","November 14, 2014","true","8.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

Narcissu shows that even text can convey the deepest of the emotion.\n\nTo play the 'game', you need to sit back, relax, click thru the dialogues slowly and enjoy it. Just don't forget to occassionally save so you won't bang your head against the wall if your machine magically crashes and you need to restart the story all over again.\n\nReplayability is zero. Once you finish once, that's all you need to do. Except if you want to recall the story later.\n\nAs an Early Access, Narcissu is pretty much done and polished - except for blank so-called Achievements - and most importantly it's completely translated into English. I'm surprised they didn't charge a dime for this on Steam.\n\nThe only purchasable DLC here is OSTs. While I don't own the DLC myself, it's been said that the quality of the OSTs are FLAC, pretty much what we expect nowadays (who likes lossy MP3s now?). Even so, I can vet for the quality of the OSTs in-game, it's very memorable and deep, perfectly blend into the story and I can fully recommend this set for your listening pleasure.\n\nAll in all, it's a free stuff with great presentation and story that you can finish in one sitting (at least for each part). Well worth your time. 10/10.\n","May 10, 2014","true","14.0"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

The first one is a main story about Setsumi and the second one is the prequel of the first one but with another character, Himeko... longer and with many more details that explain to the reader why Setsumi behaves in that way.\n\nNo choices, even a game, nor the typical an audiovisual novel, is just like a book so there is nothing to do except read, listen and feel.\n\nHighly recommended.","June 2, 2015","true","14.1"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

This story forces the feelings of its characters in a way that you can connect with by putting you in the middle of the action (like most visual novels do). Narcissu 1st is absoluetly worth reading. You bond with a girl named Setsumi. First meeting her at a hospital, then soon you're on a wild adventure throughout Japan. Setsumi can be described in one word, tsundere (Cold on the outside, THE FEELS ON THE INSIDE). As you prgress in the story, she slowly opens up to you. In the end, you are left with feelings of happiness, sadness and longing for more. Narcissu 2nd is the prequel to Narcissu 1st (yeah oddly enough). This story is about friendship, hardship and loss. Our beloved Setsumi has only begun to experience her life in the hospital. There she meets the prequel's other protagonist, Himeko. Narcissu 2nd is more to clarify Narcissu 1st and is not at all needed to be played first to enjoy Narcissu 1st.\n\ntl;dr:\n-Narcissu 1st is an AMAZING visual novel filled with emotions that you are looking for if you want to cry.\n-Narcissu 2nd is a prequel to clarify questions in Narcissu 1st. This does not need to be played first to enjoy Narcissu 1st.\nCriticism (not like I'm a visual novel critic):\n-I reaaaaally wish they put actions you can choose from which would effect the outcome of the story.\n-Why is there not more of these types of VN on steam?","June 21, 2014","true","4.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I haven't begun the 2nd one yet but I would like to at one point. I just knocked out the 1st in almost a single sitting so it took a while. :P I will note that the achievement system seems to be broken. I completed Narcissu 1st, the voiced version, and did not receive the achievement for it. That aside it was a decent story and I enjoyed it. It definitely tugged at my heartstrings a few times and made me want to cry a few times as well. If you have never played a visual novel or have only played a few, as I have, it will take a little while to get into it but don't give up! The story does improve with time. :3 ***SPOILER ALERT: I wish that the ending was different, though and instead he pulled her away... :< *sadface****\n\nUPDATE: I have just completed Narcissu 2nd and I feel as though the story was an improvement on the 1st. I feel as though I felt more emotion and it was nice to get a backstory on Setsumi! I however ***SPOILER ALERT: am a bit disturbed by the fact that suicide seems to be so nonchalant in these games. It is a very serious matter and I don't think this should be taken at all lightly. There were also sacrilegious messages but if you are able to ignore that the story is absolutely emotional and you really start feeling close to the characters... or at least I seemed to. :)***\n\nI have also heard about a Narcissu 3rd in Japan so perhaps it will be translated in the future and brought here? Until then I definitely enjoyed these games. Remember they do go somewhat slow at first if you aren't used to games like this but if you can bear with it the story is pretty good! Definitely something to play if you like emotional stories. But be warned that there is sacrilege so if you can put that past you and just focus on the story it is an enjoyable story overall but also highly depressing! Have tissues ready!!!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bloodyseraph/recommended/264380/","bloodyseraph","Bloody Seraph","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bloodyseraph/","100 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nNarcissu and Narcissu Side 2nd are two short indie visual novels about residents of the 7th floor of an hospital. However, those residents aren't only sick; they cannot be cured, and so they wait for death to take them.\n\nWith such a premise, you can easily tell the story will make you shed some tears, and trust me it will. It is a sad, but incredibly beautiful, journey, which makes me recommend it wholeheartedly. Also, while there aren't that many songs in the soundtrack, they all are beautiful and really add to the atmosphere and emotions of the story.\n\nOn a more technical standpoint, both Narcissu and Narcissu Side 2nd are quite short VNs (completed both aswell as the epilogue in 9.3 hours) in which there aren't any choices to make. Some might say this lack of any gameplay mechanics is a bad thing, but in my opinion it allows you to stay focused, if not immerged, in the story.\n\nThe only things I might complain about would be the few mistakes in the text, the sometimes confusing syntax (though I understand the goal of the translators, as described in the translators' notes), and the rather small pictures and text-box.\n\nAll in all, Narcissu and Narcissu Side 2nd are really worth the time reading in my opinion, even more so considering they are free. Give them a try, you won't regret it.","July 19, 2014","true","9.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

How they are struggling to keep smiling even though their heart is in pain, knowing that they will gone forever. How they spent the rest of their time. And how they pass the rules.\n\nNarcissu's gameplay is simple. Just sit back, relax, and enjoy each of the scene (or words perhaps?) in this game. There's no choice selection so you don't need a walkthrough for it.\n\nI totally recommend Narcissu. Why?

While the player has little control over what is happening on the screen, as they can only move forward with the plot, I however have never been more engrossed into a story on screen.  Everything from the minimal visuals and the hauntingly memorable soundtrack all helps the player in being attached to this depressingly beautiful plot full of heartache, death, meaning, and life.  I encourage everyone to try this out; I strongly believe anyone who experiences this VN will come out as a better person with a new appreciation for life.

It is definitely worth a play through. The 2nd one was the better one and the only I actually cried on. The flow and the characters of that one really gets you. It's hard not to get attached to the characters. The 1st one wass alright, just not as emotionally tugging as the 2nd. It only really followed two characters and their really long car ride.\n\nThe images of the game are beautiful, no doubt about that. Although there was at least one that struck me as strange. I'm not sure if describing it would be spoilers, but for someone who just got out of a long hospital stay, their face would not look like that when they get on the bar. Unless she had magic anime muscles, which might explain everything. Just a minor detail though, the art isn't at all bad! (They all look like children too, even the adults. But again, minor detail.)\n\nThe music was just great. It really fits with the situations and gives you the feel of this being their moment. I don't know how to describe it, actually. Just know that if I had rewards to give out for best music in visual novels, this game would get all of them.\n\nIt has voice acting, if that's what you're into. But I honestly just rushed through that part and played through it silent twice to get the achievements. To me, since i played it silent the first time around, all the characters had their own voice inside my head. The actual voices aren't bad though.\n\nDo I recommend this? Heck yes. Definitely.

This is by far, the sadest gamr I've have ever played in my life. (And 1 of my favorite games.) This game should have been the most played game in the world (Not Leauge of Lesbians.) due to the impact it has on the player. It has a loveable character that sadly dies in the end. It has the best story I've had ever read. It also has the most sadest soundtrack in Video Game history. Graphics: 10/10. Story: 10/10. Everything else: 10/10.

Most people won't like this, as you have to read and have patience. It's not an action game, it's not even a game, as such. It's a  VISUAL NOVEL.  I have played quite a few of these, and fell in love a year or so ago. Sadly, they never hit the Western audience, generally being produced by Japanese developers, in Japan, in Japanese. Visual novels are what they say they are -- books that you can see. It is a book. That's it. But - as with books - it's the story that grabs you, and I must say, this had a pretty damn good story. If you are a person that likes to read -- go ahead. If you are a person that likes to be gripped by a devastating story -- go ahead. If you are a person that likes to cry your heart out cry manly tears at the end of the story, at the end of the road. Go. Go and read this.

I have played many Japanese Galgames and this game brings me the first feeling of a true situation: the meaning of the death and life. This is amazing, in my opinion, galgame is just a type of game that meet a girl and have a nice love story. However this game shows me another spirit, I feel very sad when I knew the girl's death but after that I still thinking. The girl isn't happy when she alive and the only thing she want in this hopeless world is just a scene of flowers.When she really came to there, I think she has already gain the value of her life though it is a very short and painful life. At last she committed suicide but I think she must do this with a bright smile. So this is a wonderful meaning game. If you like a story with the meaning of life, if you are a painful and hopeless patient like the girl, or if you want to commit suicide, I strongly recommend you to play this game. This game will help you find the meaning of your life and help you to gain your own value of your life.

The first installment is based in the future of the series, whereas the second is an almost "prologue". The 1st is based on two characters, a 22 year old woman and a 20 year old man, both residing in the level 7 of an unnamed hospital. The way they interreact and the emotions I got from this installment were amazing and pure. The 2nd is the story of the 22 year old woman, set around the time she was first admitted to the hospital.\n\nThis series uses slow tension and the reinforcment of facts and tones to help build a breathtaking story, and I would reccomend it to any and everyone.","July 7, 2014","true","7.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

There's no interaction, no choices to make, nothing to do except read and press the space bar to progress through the story.\n\nSaying that, this is a really good visual novel. There are two stories. The first takes places after the second. If you want to do them chronologically, start with the second then the first. However, in my opinion, the stories work better if you go through them the other way.\n\nIt needs to be said that there's a trigger warning for suicide in these stories. So if that bothers you, you may want to pass this over. If not, I highly recommend downloading and completing both stories.","October 25, 2014","true","9.3"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","6","11","0","0"

It offers an intruiging look at life, death, and terminal illness, with a gorgeous soundtrack and interesting characters to go along with it. My only gripe with it was the narrow screen, which may have just been an aesthetic choice on the designer's part.\n\nIf you don't like reading, I cannot recommend this game to you, as it has you read a lot of dialogue and monologues. If you do like reading, however, and don't mind that you'll be doing nothing but clicking to advance to the next piece of dialogue, this might be a great entry point to the world of visual novels.","April 26, 2014","true","2.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Instead of cheesy anime girl story with "plot" just like almost every manga-anime this day, Narcissu offers a deep and touching story. The author lays out the one's life, who wants to live life to the fullest for one last time before facing their own death, beautifully in a simple VN. The story was able to make me shed tears. Still, could be heartwarming as well. Beautiful soundtrack, good dubbing and banner sized picture also strengthen the feel of the story.\n\nFor my first try, I must say that I'm impressed.","August 29, 2015","true","30.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The only major flaw is that the narrator sometimes switches without telling you (which shouldn't be a big deal if you're using the voiced, but I played the unvoiced version). While Narcissu 1 was a pretty solid tale of its own accord, Narcissu 2 drove it home even further and made it that more memorable. Most games I spend under 5 hours on I end up not really liking and dropping, as they fail to have an impact on me. Narcissu is an exception: for a short VN, it packs quite a punch, and I'd recommend it to anyone who hasn't had their daily dose of feels.","September 8, 2015","true","2.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

When I first started reading it I was surprised by the complete lack of choices, since most other visual novels are a 'choose your own adventure' variant. This isn't necessarily bad, but I like to be in control of the main character, even if it's slight. This, naturally also leaves only one route to follow, and one possible ending. This makes replayability.... slim, as well as shorten the novels length. However, the story you do get is pretty interesting, and toys with your emotions pretty well, regardless of the fact that the first novel has no character development, and the protagonist just kind of does things. Setsumi, the protagonists 'friend', is dull and boring. She is overly intelligent with no explanations as to how she knows anything considering she's spent most of her time in the hospital. Side 2nd goes into some detail as to why she knows these things, and is in my opinion the better of the 2 novels. We learn more about Setsumi, and her past, as the story is told primarily from her point of view. Side 2nd was longer, and had a more satisfying end, and there was some character development with the main characters. The soundtrack is.... decent, it does the job, but there weren't any notable tracks that I particularly liked, and it didn't transition very well between scenes. It's nothing special. The voice acting was pretty good for the most part, particularly for setsumis character in the first novel. The same voice actor is in side 2nd as setsumi, but she sounded just as depressed as she is in the first novel, which doesn't make sense considering she still had some hope at this point in the timeline. The other female protagonist in side 2nd is great, she sounds very cheerful, and knew how to be fun, and serious when necessary. None of the other voice actors stood out, as they had few lines. If you're looking for a good read, I would recommend this, but don't expect anything too special.","October 20, 2014","true","0.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

These VNs are ROUGH. Very well done, beautiful, engaging, and tasteful, but it's a tough one. After unlocking the dev's Notes, you know these weren't meant to be "tear-jerkers," but I just about had a fit after 1st.\n\nIf you have ever wondered about the world of chronic/terminal illness and the associated psychological warfare that accompany the regular symptoms, this is almost a case study. This game masterfully illustrates the inner workings of the minds of those essentially given a diagnosis of "IDK, good luck to you." It's about grief, guilt, and grace.\n\nI appreciate the focus on the deeper questions people given a finite timeline to work with have to answer. Sometimes it's not just about depression or self-blame. Rather, it can be about feeling objectified and out of control, coupled with a deeply profound view on the long-term effects interactions will have on anyone involved in the health/well-being process.\n\nFocusing on how people in these positions can and will think about how to execute the "end-game" was extremely welcoming and refreshing to see explored, When the body fails and is beyond personal control, most people don't know the internal struggle that ensues in trying to be resolve the situation and re-align the bodyand mind in the most peaceful way possible.\n\nI unintentionally played the game 1st and 2nd, without knowing the developer wanted it to be played in reverse. However, I enjoyed the juxtaposition of the stories, and the conclusions that can be drawn by revisiting the first part after completing the second are very eye-opeing. I was happy that the subject of religion and morality was brought up in the 2nd, because it is a deep and frustrating struggle that people really wrestle with in the medical world (and will continue to do so).\n\nOverall, highly recommended, especially if you or someone you know is going through a similar fight.","July 4, 2015","true","6.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Instead of cheesy anime girl story with "plot" just like almost every manga-anime this day, Narcissu offers a deep and touching story. The author lays out the one's life, who wants to live life to the fullest for one last time before facing their own death, beautifully in a simple VN. The story was able to make me shed tears. Still, could be heartwarming as well.

The only major flaw is that the narrator sometimes switches without telling you (which shouldn't be a big deal if you're using the voiced, but I played the unvoiced version). While Narcissu 1 was a pretty solid tale of its own accord, Narcissu 2 drove it home even further and made it that more memorable. Most games I spend under 5 hours on I end up not really liking and dropping, as they fail to have an impact on me. Narcissu is an exception: for a short VN, it packs quite a punch, and I'd recommend it to anyone who hasn't had their daily dose of feels.","September 8, 2015","true","2.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

What will they do knowing nothing but the life of a patient in a hospital ward?\n\nThere is no greater plot, there is no romance, and the relationship between the two main characters could hardly even be described as friendly, but the coldness of the cast and simple story both play very important roles in tying the incredible atmosphere of the VN together.\n\nThe game actually comes with two translations one of which focused on retaining the original script's phrasing (resulting in some rather poor grammar at times) while the second translation focused more on  shapng the script into something closer to what a native english speaker would have written.

While I myself am not a huge fan of visual novels, I do like when authors take something Melancholy or macabre and manage to turn it into something emotional and beautiful. I think if you are a fan of storys that take a painful subject and make it something more, you should take the time to play (read) through Narcissu (1 and 2).

I definitely lean more towards the "thumbs up" button than to not recommend it. The game (read: visual novel) have that amateurish feel to it. It doesn't affect the game negatively. Perhaps more the opposite - like comparing a hand-made product to a mass produced one. The story holds up quite well and the background music is solid work that adds to the immersion. I would have liked a bit more depression to it for that extra impact. But that's just my personal love for depressing stories. The ending was quite satisfying.\n\nBy all means, give it a go when you are bored or feel like trying out some non-interactive visual novel. It's a free title. You'll only lose time, but hopefully gain something worth it to think about.\n\nEDIT: Oh yeah. The artwork is decent especially in the 2nd title. Scarce in quantity but it leaves more for your imagination. Manga/anime haters though: Don't bother.

I'm as close to an expert as one can be on this subject and still be living.  I survived a nearly fatal heart issue at age 18 and had two open heart surgeries.

Essays suck."  The fact that the characters only deal with half of dying is a hard thing for me to let go of, especially when the characters just generally seem to be withering away from a general 19th c malaise.\n\nBarely recommended as a fair attempt to portray a complex subject on which the authors did not have a clear grasp.

Our story starts with a protagonist, a young man who is admitted to a hospital with lung carcinoma. He eventually meets another girl who has the same diagnosis as him. She indicates that they are slowly dying and the cancer may returns after therapy. She is in her final stage of cancer as she may pass away at any moment. As the cancer progresses, they will eventually die at the seventh floor of the hosptial at the palliative unit, or at home with family. The girl calmly expresses that she doesn't want to die at the hospital nor home. She wants to escape and asks the protagonist to come along her. That's her final wish... to die alone without her family and friends... because they are the ones that suffer more.","June 30, 2015","true","7.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","1"

The story is well-written, and honestly, it prompted me to reflect on the value and shortness of life. It's a short visual novel, but it powerfully evokes emotions in the brief time we get to know the protagonist and Setsumi, whose lives are made brief due to their respective illnesses. Though the characters are distant at first, there is an intimacy between the them that develops which was touching and the soundtrack and voice track simply enhance the experience. For a doujin work, the artwork is quite well done and the minimalistic approach of presenting the setting and characters allowed me to have a more personalized experience with the story. The rare moments when I actually got to see the Setsumi's face actually felt precious. I really liked this approach. However, I did notice some inconsistencies with some of the art, but it was not terribly noticeable.\nIt's a touching story about two terminally ill patients who are unhappy with their situation, who go on a search for a place that they can die peacefully. It's a tear-jerking story and it is well worth the time.","November 26, 2015","true","2.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Not wanting to die at their homes or the hospital they are in they escape. The girl you meet is quiet and mysterious and while you journey blindy after escaping the hopsital wing for terminally ill patients you try to get to know her more. I didn't get through it all due to getting upset, the girl talks about death a lot, suicide too, but she is confused on the matter, something I have a issue with too.\n\nThe extras such as the soundtrack is a lovely addition if you are tired of reading and just want to hear some calm and nice music.\n\nI highly recommend it but yeah it might upset some people more than others.","December 12, 2015","true","0.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Nothing ground breaking with the gameplay.\nAnyways on to the review\n\n\n\n\n\nNarcissu is a beautifully done visual novel even though theres any visuals to look on to. It is it's on Text that makes it pretty.\n\n\n***** SPOILER ALERT MUTHA ♥♥♥♥AS *****\n\nStory:\n\nThe story isn't anything complicated just terminally ill patients that will die one day in the hospice they're in.\nThe girl ends up saying "I don't want to die here or at home" which inspires  you (The main character) to bring her on a journey when your dad bring you his ♥♥♥♥ing car for no apparent reason (Look i skipped alot of dialouge in the beginning but trust me it gets a hell of alot better.). Then the two of you the Girl and you go on a road trip to die in a better place. At first I thought this was going to very boring. Oh my, I was very, very, very wrong. There were exciting scenes here and there and throughout their road trip they share exchanges here and there then eventually become better friends and very, very, very. little fan service. No, not that fan service, where boobs start flying everywhere smacking the main character's face. I mean that type of Fan Service of romance. Unforunately don't expect alot of romance, but they do share a very good bond that was executed very beautifully. No seriously don't expect romance theres no kissing at all in this, nor that erotic-ness, just alot of Kawaii. Now lets actually get back to the story. Their destination is a hard one. But they get there. Apparently she commits suicide. Thats how the story ends. She commits suicide. Look, I understand the Writers wanted to give this a dark approach and that theres no such thing as a good ending in this game. But look, atleast let her kiss the main character. Why do you ask? Because the god damn boy brought you to a very beautiful place and done so many things for you. (Didn't read the second story don't know if it conflicts with this one.) But honestly thats my opinion, and I really, really, wanted that to be in the game. I don't know, just made me feel like the game was un-finished ya know?\n\n\nCharacters:\n\nI pretty much explained a whole lot of there. But lets add more things about the characters. The girl, obiviously is very smart and talented, could've been very useful in life but dies in the most melancholy way possible. She is in a way has a tsundere trait. No she is not a tsundere, she just shows she can, and is barely even brought up. She is in no way energetic. She is a cold and a depressed girl so when she finally smiles in the game you start to feel happy your self and say "This ain't so bad".\nBut eventually through out the journey she opens up to the character. She does have a immature tendency though, don't expect it to be brought up through out the story either. The main character isn't anything special or new and when you finally see his face you find out he is just a another cliched character. However, he asks all the right questions and does all the good ♥♥♥♥. So expect him to be unexpected.\n\n\nMusic:\n\nFor me the music gets repetitive, and then blasts my ear because I didn't expect that note to come out. But regardless of it not having a variety of a AA Budget game and a crew smaller than a chinese's man ♥♥♥♥. I did not expect the sound to be Clannad level of Melancholy. Just okay-iness. Still, the Music sounds ♥♥♥♥ing great\n\n\nAnimation/Art\n\nTheres literally no animation whatsoever. I mean there is a tinsy-little animation in the ending with the picture of the girl. But its just a still picture to give it a effect. Still, in my opinion there isn't anything noting for with the art, and as I said the dev team isn't big so I didn't expect it to be AAA level.\n\n\nAfter composing up all of the S.C.M.A/A I have found the bestest rating for this game\n\n9.2 out of 10. (Indie Level)\n\n7.8 out of 10 (AAA level)\n\n10 out of 10 (If it was treated as a book instead of a game)\n\nA Beautiful masterpiece, we americans are very lucky to have this game translated, I recommend reading this while you have the chance. Also, I'm going to be honest with you. DO NOT GO TO SCHOOL/WORK TOMORROW, YOU WILL BE DEPRESSED. TRUST ME ITS THAT GOOD.\n\nThis is Jankie signing out yo.","April 28, 2014","true","1.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This is a masterpiece all in it's on right. It really is a said story, but I also think it's a story about choosing your own way to leave this world. And at the end, when Setsumi went into the see in the final chapter it made me cry so damn hard. I was hoping that the main character would stop her cuz I could see them being a lovely couple. All in all bravo this game has so much emotional depth to it that I really enjoyed it. I also think that this game will pave the way for other games with this kind of narrative.\n\nAlso the soundtrack is amazing although as I think about it the soundtrack sounds like it could belong to a Japanese RPG game, which isn't a bad thing the soundtrack is beautiful and fits with the theme of the overall story greatly all in all if I was a major game reviewer like gametrailers or ign, I would give this a 10/10","April 29, 2014","true","2.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Well worth the free download." - Me\n\nAnyways... my gosh this is an amazng story. I felt connected to the character, and I had yet to see her face. 15 minutes in, I already was halfway to tears. This is the most sad "game" I have ever played. This isn't an interactive game, it's more of a narrative, and a damn good one at that.\n\nI don't want to give any spoilers of the story, because every single word captures your attention, and you are glued to the screen for the first 3 chapters...then you turn the game off 'cus you dont want to start crying. But basically, the story is about a girl who at a very young age is striken withh illness, and has to spend 2/3 of her waking life in the hospital. when she is a young high-school student, she has very few, if any, friends left from her youth. se wakes up one morning after a driving test to a searing pain in her chest, and it's back to the hospital for a while :( . She is given a very fancy room on a new floor sh hasnt been on before; she gets the room to herself (as opposed to regular rooms in Japanese hospitals which have 5-8 people in them), it has a nice lounge, big open ceilings... th windows dont open... the nurses don't walk through... oh my lord. They are leaving her to die :'(... and thats where I will stop telling you.\n\nSo far, and I havent gotten all the way through the story, its an 11/10. Absolute masterpeice of story telling.

Again. Skip straight to the bottom for the TL;DR version.\n\nThis is a visual novel style "game" and if you don't like clicking and reading and doing ONLY that, avoid this game at all costs.\n\nIf, however, you enjoy a good story AND don't mind the lack of interaction, play this game, and/or read on. Mild spoilers follow.\n\nThis visual novel talks about suicide rates and the somewhat personal pain the young, terminally ill go through, pain transcending the physical realm, coming to hurt you right in your head and heart. The story is well crafted and, while the ending was not unexpected, the message it was trying to deliever was solid, clear and strong. If you have had a friend who was terminally ill (I did) this "game" speaks volumes. As I said, however, do NOT play this game if you do not intend or like to read lines of text over and over and over and - you get what I mean. In games, this would be the tedious "clicker" genre, only with nice story. While Narcissu has a great story, personally interaction within this genre is still dominated by "To The Moon", which, by the way, you should play.\n\nTL;DR: play this game if you like story and don't mind lots of somewhat useless clicking, otherwise, avoid at ALL costs.","June 22, 2014","true","1.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I'm not gonna lie, the story is REALLY f*ckin' sad. Haven't cried from a game's story since Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days. Nonetheless, has a GREAT story. Teaches you a valuable lesson about life, and throws feels at you every single moment of the way. I actually found the story to be rather beautiful. It really gets the reader to understand what it's like to feel like you're dying inside. I mainly praise the story, due to how much I felt like it related to my daily emotional mindset. I undergo a lot of daily stress, and sometimes I really feel like I'm dying inside, like I don't know myself anymore. This game brought out that feeling, but showed it in an actual physical scenario. Overall, the story isn't exactly for the faint of heart, but it's definitely a must-have for everyone.","March 22","true","2.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Iv'e only just read the first one and I can say as a visual novel fan I fell in love with this story. Griping, paced well and told with some good voice acting the musical scores really helped set the tone for this story. From the start it captivates you, bringing you along for the feels train. If I had to rate this out of a 10 I'd give it a 8; however, I think it may have been better as just a novel albeit myself enjoying the voice of Setsuna and the wonderful music. For a visual novel it lacked the art  expected of it and at times left me wanting more, as an example where you'd expect a stunning image of Setsuna giving her "bashful sour expression" you often weren't rewarded it. Yet, this does not take away from the beauty of this VN, nor should it deter you. If you are a fan of this type of genre, enjoy reading or simply want to play something to pass time its well it. With a fantasitcly saddening story, moving musical selection and spot on voice acting Its a gem in the visual novel bin.\n\n(PLACE HOLDER FOR PART 2)","April 27, 2014","true","5.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

More than that, it's been a long time since I've felt compelled to write a review at all. But shortly after starting the second part I started to feel the urge to write this.\n\nI've feel bored, confused and aimless with this game. I've played a lot of visual and kinetic novels, including some sad ones, so no blame on the playability aspects is put. It's about the content and "art direction".\n\nMaybe it's because of my personal beliefs on the matter of suicide that I couldn't connect at all with the characters. The lack of character art, descriptions, context... aggravated that. In fact, I probably enjoyed the best the second part prologue, which is the part with no drama in it. I guess that the styling of the message didn't favour the content of the message at all. Of course, this may be different for you (YMMV).\n\nI failed to see the message of the work too. Often I found myself wondering "What should I be feeling or asking myself?". Even after reading the game notes I'm not sure of the purpose of the work. And I think that's at least partially a fault of the design decisions.\n\nAs an example of this, I didn't like the voices, nor the art. The voices would have suited best some half-hearted commedy than this story ambitioning to be as deep as possible without being less broad and remaining evocative to the reader. More than support the story, the voices broadened the gap between story and reader. And I'm a player that as often as possible relies on text-to-speech synthesis to voice unvoiced games. The most interesting game reflection is the one I'm having while writing the review. The author asks himself, as you can read in the game notes, whether the game's assets must be kept minimalistic to not impose a particular view. Probably the neutral TTS voices I usually listen to do the trick of increasing my enjoyment of games without being intrussive.\n\nClosing, finally. Many people seemed to enjoy this game. However the game is so lacking that can be very hard to enjoy at all. While not being a bad game, it's one of the dullest I've ever played, a remarkably unremarkable experience.\n","December 22, 2015","false","14.6"," 7 of 17 people (41%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","41","7","17","0","1"

A novel, sure, but as for the visuals they are merely wide-ratio images. After the first few images it gets to the point where they don't really add much. If they had published it as a website/blog, with the images as headers, then I feel the experience would have been better. and in that format you wouldn't need to worry about clicking through each sentence, or dealing with the sentence autoplayer.\n\nAs for the story itself, I think its OK. A bit too depressing for my tastes, but it does seem to capture the essence of what it would be like to live with such a condition. The finality of it is hard to handle, but if you want an emotional story, then go for it. Some of the translations are, as expected, occasionally a bit off, but overall it is very good.\n\nAs I've said, clicking through the program [calling it a game would be a bit much, considering it is a linear story] can be tedious, and the program itself is a bit odd. The chapters don't seem to run off each other, it takes you back to the main menu after each one finished. And the addition of achievements is clearly an unwarranted gimmick here.\n\nTo bring this together, I've not got any problem with the story. But the game that it is wrapped up in is probably better off not on steam.","May 2, 2015","false","5.7"," 1 of 11 people (9%) found this review helpful","9","1","11","0","0"

Painful story of death and suicide, and how we allow immovable realities to dictate our lives, and how we might change them a little by doing ridiculous, risky things.

Nevertheless, it was poignant throughout, and well written. I would say that the author is talented and smart, but this book itself is a well illustrated process of slowly dying while grasping at the last few straws of life, and that is what reading it feels like.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tachiba24/recommended/264380/","tachiba24","matrixman.neo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tachiba24/","3 products in account","First, probably important for you to know, I read the unvoiced 1st season.\n\nSo lets start: It's a non-optional visual novel, in other words, just mashing your mouse button / return key and reading is all you'll find in this game, paired with some sounds and pictures, suiting the story, and a soundtrack, supporting the actual mood of the story. The soundtrack contains - at least, as I guess, after playing for almost 3 hours - probably only two songs, but I didn't recognized this as a problem, yet it worked out really well, since you got to know whether that scene was sad or just glumly just by recognizing the right song. The sound effects also were fine, even if I got somehow scared, hearing - the first sound of a human, not a car or the waves - a girl crying and sobbing.\nComing next to the pictures, I'm somehow unimpressed. I got the impression, that there are too less pictures. Plus pictures barely showed humans, making it very unlively. Also more than a few pictures were used too often. The effect, the soundtrack, containing only a few songs, had, reaches here for the opposite. It formerly tells you "yes, in the car again, nothing new, nothing exciting at all" and you may come to think it's really boring, not worth going on with reading. That somehow got to be my case, but there are also a few other points according to that.\nThe text itself is written from a to the protagonist limited narrator, containing very much dialogs.\nAnd here comes the reason why I wrote "unvoiced" in bold in the first line:\nIt's unbelievable hard to follow who is saying what. When it was almost over, you could tell from the way the characters speak, who just said that, but in the beginning, it's a real pain and it confuses and makes the story incredibly boring.\nHonestly, I was close to quitting the game mid-way.\nWell, I continued till the end, always thinking "no matter how sad it is going to be, since I was so confused in the first part, I won't be affected that badly (meaning I won't show any emotion like setsumi)". But I have to say, I was at least a bit wrong. It didn't got me that hard, but it was somehow sad.\n\nThere is another problem, I had with the story: WHY THE HELL IS THE PROTAGONIST A GUY??! Either I missed that part, in the first few sentences or it was supposed to be like that. But now, I have a different view on everything what happened. It confuses me even incredibly more. I somehow dislike the protagonist being a guy, I would prefer that story, I already imagined all the time, dealing with two girls.\n\nIf you wanna give it a try, being interested in this visual novel, please, for your own sake, play the voiced version.\nI started the second season just yet, this time voiced, and until now, nobody except the protagonist - a girl - was dubbed. I have no idea, if that's the same case in the first season, I won't try. I also won't go on reading the second season, because I don't think it's worth anymore, confusion being the cause.\n\nI hope I did help you, deciding whether you should give this novel a try, since it's for free.","May 26, 2015","false","2.9"," 0 of 9 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","9","0","0"

It's more of a visual novel you tediously click through.  See EDIT.\n\nI went through the first Narcissu, and tried very hard to empathize and I could not. It was a story trying very hard to cause emotional impact and be profound, but when the supposed family members were uncaring to the point of ridicule, it made the story come off melodramatic making it hard to take it seriously. The girl might as well have a stormy, rainy cloud with a sad face chasing her as she walks.\n\nI felt the pacing of the story was too slow and the recycled background images made it very hard to get into the story. Images should evoke emotion, but when they are repeated ad nauseum, emotional impact turns into tedium. The only defense I can come up with is that, the story was trying to create a feeling of emptiness through the repetition, but it drug out too long to were I felt like ooook I get it, I get it.\n\nIt ended up making me feel frustrated, annoyed and over it. I wasted a lot of energy trying to be invested and now feel cheated.\n\nI would love if choices were implemented instead of it being just a visual novel because the idea and the subject matter are very interesting and have a lot of potential to be a meaningful experience.\n\nEDIT: I agree with what is being said in the comments. It IS a visual novel. So, I'll rephrase my complaint to make more sense.\n\nMy actual problem is that I didn't actually expect a visual novel to be on Steam and I find it disingenuous that it even is on Steam. To me it was like driving to the video game store and finding a comic book on the shelf. Steam, I think, is supposed to be a market for videogames not visual novels or "experiences" like that "game"  mountain [mountain-game.com]. A video game by definition should have some level of interaction beyond just clicking through.\n\nAND AGAIN, like I said on the review, I LOVE the idea and the subject matter and would like if this visual novel was redone as an actual videogame with choice and consequence and more interaction beyond just clicking through. Like for example, *SPOILERS* the scene where they had to go the gambling parlor to steal money. Imagine THAT situation with a choice and consequence mechanic. *END SPOILERS* It would be an awesome experience.\n\nEDIT: Fixed spelling for clarity. The word is empathize as in "to have the same feelings as another person". Oh and,  defense [www.merriam-webster.com].","April 23, 2015","false","4.1"," 31 of 90 people (34%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","34","31","90","5","12"

Very little effort has gone into this and it shows. What particularly annoyed me was the terrible translation. Not so much spelling mistakes, but grammatical nightmares. Badly constructed and run-on sentences, confusing tenses, coupled with exceedingly poor punctuation, all combined to twist my mind into knots when I should have been enjoying a leisurely read. In a visual novel you would think language to be the most important factor, but often you are distracted enough in trying to make sense of the sentences. I really didn't think that would be where the user participated when I downloaded the game.\n\nBecause there is often a confused frame of reference you can be left in the dark over who is doing what exactly? "But they told me: that I was going to die." Who and why a colon? "It was the only thing (word) that left my mouth from beginning to end." "There was no way to escape it it seemed." "It seemed there was no way to escape it." Is a much less complicated construction. I did consider the developer used a young teenager for the role, and had done an expert job of replicating their moderate language skills. Soon however she reveals her age to be 20 years.\n\nThere is very little to do in the game, other than advance the text and it's lucky the developer provided a save feature. The story is tedious and extremely boring and the images add very little depth.\n\nI'm not against visual novels because I thought Depression Quest was very well done and had some very interesting dialogues and user-participation. There's nothing like that here, and even though it's free it's a hard novel to get through.","April 26, 2015","false","3.2"," 4 of 31 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","4","31","0","0"

I could infer the malaise and hopeless situation that the main characters find themselves in. The chapter ended with a good sense of mystery about the girl Narcissu.\n\nThat said, this was my first visual novel. I don't mean to knock the genere, but I was expecting more 'visual'. 20minutes into the novel, and all I saw was rain, a hospital ward, and some tables. I would have liked to have seen more of the scenes that were described by the text; parents, the school mates, the drivers licence. Even when Narcissu is first mentioned, perhaps I could see the back of her head as she whatched the TV?\n\nI realize things will probably pick up as I advance in chapters, but this left a dull taste in my mouth for the genere. I guess it's not for me.\n\nSome features that I would have liked to have seen:\n-A save option. So I can stop in the middle of a chapter.\n-A recap dialogue. So I can return to a save or chapter, and catch up.\n-Full Screen mode, for immersion.\n\nIn short, probably good if you like the genere. Personally, I'm turned off. I may try again with something more up-beat.","January 19, 2015","false","0.3"," 6 of 37 people (16%) found this review helpful","16","6","37","0","0"

To start, the translation options are cryptic, so the best option for your language is unknown when you start the game.  I chose Insani because it was the only one I thought was legible as far as its logo goes.  It turned out to be an English translation, but the voice was still in the original language, which meant the voice meant nothing to me.  This is an overly glorified e-book, so I hate the empty, wasted space and the very tiny window.  It seems unnecessary to confine the user/player/reader to a game window when they could be reading the book more comfortably from a full-screen e-reader app.  Oh, yeah, you can't full-screen this 'game'!  Hell, it would be better if I could skip to a specific portion of the story since there's no save option or any kind of actual gameplay (no choices).\n\nFinally, the pictures are generic and have very little to do with the text.  You will see the same images more than once and not really understand why they're shown to you at all.  It's ridiculously lazy storytelling in my opinion.  I expected more relevant imagery from a visual novel.  In the past, I used to watch visual novels like this one which were amazing, but this one just isn't worth my time.  It's boring and implemented poorly.  I've seen better in free Flash animations back in the Newgrounds glory days! Yes, it's free, as well, but it's a big waste of time when you can get better experiences elsewhere without much effort.","April 16, 2015","false","0.2"," 5 of 35 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","5","35","0","0"

I know this is free and all, but I don't consider price when I review. At the end of the day it falls short because the author seems to lose interest in his own stories before they go anywhere.\n\nMaybe since it is early access all the stories become more strongly linked eventually, but at the current pace of these I'd say I have no interest either way. Best wishes to the author in the future though.","November 16, 2014","false","1.1"," 1 of 28 people (4%) found this review helpful","4","1","28","0","0"

The translation is generally good, although some phrasing is awkward, and the story itself is beautiful and will give you a lot to think about -- the general message, I think, can be applicable/relatable even if you are not in exactly the same situation as the characters in the novel.\n\nFor a free work, I was also impressed with some of the extras: several different translations are available as well as the original Japanese text; there is a full set of notes from both the original creator and the translators; and the lovely music is on display in a special "sound mode," which allows you to listen to music from either Narcissu 1st or 2nd.\n\nGiven that all it will cost you is a bit of space on your hard drive and a couple of hours of free time, this is definitely a worthwhile addition to your library.\n\n*To the devs: (this may have been a fluke, but...) the one technical issue I found was that the game gets stuck at the end of one of the notes (I believe it was the last translation note for N1st): instead of being able to simply click and return to the "Notes" menu, you have to hit the "back" button and then "return to title."  Obviously, not a major problem, but I figured that I'd mention it, since the game is still in early access.","February 2, 2015","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It isn't really a game, and in fact can't really even be considered a Visual Novel in the broad sense of the term.  It literally is a novel; one with pictures, music and partial narration.  This is a sad, soulful piece of art that also tends to branch away from traditional VN expirirences by not having a palphable romantic streak or a hard, action based storyline. Although I am only at chapter 3 in 1st, I am completely enthralled and did start crying at some of the more eloquently worded scenes of reflection.  Again, although I have barely touched the surface I have no doubt that for all the more abstract and open-minded gamers out there who can accept a touching linear click-and-read this is a must.\n\n11/10","May 2, 2014","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The novel wasn't the greatest part to me as I'm not a big book reader but, the sound track makes the freebie worth even more of the while. Definitely while its free download it.

In keeping with true Japanese style if you want to follow the story chronologically you should read part 2 first as it explains how the two main characters come to meet. Part 1, however, is the heart of the story but is also resoundingly bittersweet, so be warned.\n\nYou follow along on their journey to find one last moment of meaning in an otherwise fated existence. The voice-over is not complete but when present adds a unique connection to an already emotion packed dialogue.

The writing is brief and the story is linear without choices unlike most visual novels.\n\nNarcissu is about 1.5 hours long if you're listening to the voiced edition. It's difficult to get into because both characters are very jaded (They have been spending their time in the hospital waiting to die.) It's alright for a short read. I found it more happy than depressing based on how the characters act towards the end.\n\nNarcissu 2nd is significantly longer, about 3-4 hours (voiced) and is the prequel to the first story. The tone is different, the characters are much more happy and you're able to learn the characters' backgrounds. Also, the production quality is noticeably higher with more art and has a short animation.

I don't even know what to type right now; it's been a long time since I've been this depressed. The story is about a male protagonist (who remains anonymous, probably for immersive purposes), and a quiet woman who's a few years older than him. Both have been denied their future. Not wanting to have their final moments in a hopsital or at home, the two run away. Initially with no goal in mind, the two travel aimlessly before deciding to finally set their sights on the narcissus fields in Awaji Island.\n\nDo I recommend this game? Yes, but be prepared to feel sad. I really took a feels trip with this visual novel. Also the music is great- at least a x3 feels multiplier. It moved me and changed the way that I looke at things. Anyway, the less info you know about the game, the better experience you'll have with it- that's my opinion. Consider taking a few hours out of your day to experience this beautiful, yet sad piece crafted by Tomo Kataka.\n\nNote- Give it a go even if you don't like the 'anime' style of it. You will only see the characters a few times- most of it will be just settings; you can also chose to have it unvoiced. Pressing 'a' will turn on auto progress if you're tired of clicking.\n\nWill update after finishing the second story.

It's a rather sad tale that has a nice setup and a lot of interesting perspective from our protagonist. Just wanted to let you know that.\n-However (and I'm assuming this is part of the early access) there are so few pictures or discussions in this visual novel. I'd like to feel the family strain to smile at the protagonist, and have the discussion with the girl whose hair goes to her hips. So much of the story right now just has a blank screen or the background (which is very beautiful, I might add), but the characters need to be there.\n-Finally, the story so far is doing a lot of "tell, don't show" with what the protagonist sees, like with the friends playing with her and not coming around as often, or the family around her being as friendly as possible. Simply put, we're told all these things are happening, but I think it would really help to drive the point if we had even a small conversation with some kids when the protagonist is sick, or talking with the family and seeing that smile, wondering why it's so abnormal. This doesn't have to be like adding in minigames and moving around, but just a few slides where the protagonist and characters are having these moments.\n\nAll in all, I really can't wait until it's finished. I'm nervous of going further to spoil the story when the whole thing comes out, but I just might have to keep playing!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/adeldk/recommended/264380/","adeldk","Adel D-K.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/adeldk/","324 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAllow me to introduce you to Narcissu, produced by Stage Nana. There are three visual novels (two being free to play): the Narcissu (the original), Narcissu Side 2nd, and Narcissu 3rd – Die Dritte Welt. (And yes, the story does reference narcissus (daffodils)). I read through the first two and found it very thought-provoking. I will give you a brief summary of the games without giving any spoilers (unless I have no other info), and then I will give you my detailed reviews.\n\nNarcissu:\n\nThe story revolves around a character named Yuu Atou, a college-age student (about 21), and a reclusive girl named Setsumi Sakura (age 22). The story is told from the first-person perspective of Atou. The two of them are both sick to the point where they are going to die (there is no known cure for their diseases), and thus they have been confined to the 7th floor of a Catholic hospital, the hospice, where they sit around doing nothing exciting. The boy insists they take off, and opportunity falls in his lap.\n\nNarcissu Side 2nd:\n\nSetsumi returns, but this time, the story is chronologically-earlier than the original. A former-Catholic girl named Himeko, who for a time volunteered at a hospital, ends up meeting Setsumi. Like the first visual novel, the story carries on with the two gallivanting off to various distant places in spite of sickness.\n\nStory:\n\nI played through the original Narcissus first. I’m glad I read it that way – Side 2nd is better in both story and presentation. The first novel is long, and by that I don’t mean text-wise (it’s only four chapters) – I mean it’s dragged out. Not much is really going on. The writer keeps things realistic in that there is no secret source of healing or some new medical technology the characters must find to save themselves. There appears to be no hope period. There isn’t anything to do, hence the characters are seeking something. That’s the ultimate goal – to just get it all over with. But even that goal isn’t existent, or rather, obvious, until the very end. In as much as it lacked direction (Don’t misunderstand me: I appreciated the realism), the little things added up. For instance, how does Setsumi know so much about vehicles (and contrary to other bloggers, it’s not because she’s fascinated with cars)? Why does she have so much money saved up? Why does she want to visit the beach? Questions like these are all answered in Side 2nd. Spoiler: We learn that all of these things are simply ideas inherited from Himeko. Hence, the first story laid the groundwork for the second, chronologically-earlier story.\n\nThe story of the second novel is different from the first in a few respects. First, the story isn’t solely centered on Setsumi all the time. It was nice actually being able to see things from Himeko’s point of view concerning her own life. The time given to Himeko as well as her relevance in the story makes the story seem more like it was written about two people, each with their own separate story and each just as significant. Both are the central protagonists, both have their own story, and yet both interact with each other on a very frequent basis. The plot of the second novel develops better than the first: it actually has a direction. Himeko has a list of things that she wants to accomplish, and the mystery as to what those are adds some intrigue to her activities. The presentation of Himeko’s background also adds some variance to the story and is important, given that it shows her lack of faith and helps explain why she no longer refers to herself as Catholic (though she continues to believe in God). Concerning Setsumi, her silent nature is highlighted. Plus, she isn’t portrayed as the reclusive, paranoid character we get in the first novel. Rather, she is simply quiet and polite. Her politeness is not habit, but it isn’t accompanied by the normal cheer typically associated with politeness. Another aspect is that, as Himeko points out, it is hypocritical (note the fries).\n\nCompleting both stories in the Side 2nd (Narcissu 1st & 2nd) program reveals tan epilogue and full credits. Rightly so – you wouldn’t understand the epilogue unless you had read both. It was… short, and somewhat rewarding. I wish they would have finished the Himeko story (even though it was implied), but I guess it’s less emotionally straining leaving the ending like this. Note that since the epilogue was created after both stories were made, they didn’t make the same mistake of assuming that walking out with a smile is somehow happy in light of inevitable end.\n\nI can’t emphasize enough how much I appreciated the objectivity in both stories (original and Side 2nd). Let me explain: In the end, I don’t feel a bias towards or against anyone – they are as they are and they believe what they believe. The characters, while I didn’t think of them as real, call for sympathy given their circumstances. They didn’t do anything beyond common human responses. While I don’t agree with Himeko and eventually Setsumi did, I do understand realize that many people see things way and don’t have reason to believe otherwise. Hence, within their own frame of mind, they were justified in doing what they did. As for Yuu Atou, he acted out of the desperateness of his situation. I wasn’t in favor of him escaping from the consequences of his actions, but neither did I condemn him. I was disappointed that he stole things, but it was all in the passing of the moment. Being on the run isn’t justification for acting like a fool, but it is realistic to act like a fool when on the run.\n\nMeh:\n\nAs an oddity, Yuu Atou never actually introduces himself. Furthermore, none of the characters really indicate their age. The hints at age occur when Chihiro mentions she went to college and she addresses Himeko as being older. An occasional picture of a character might be shown, but anime-style characters have that funny way of making it difficult to tell what age they are. The images we see of Setsumi seem to indicate she is very young in both the original and Side 2nd novels. She is in the latter since it’s chronologically earlier. However, it seems to me that the story could just as easily have been told if she had hardly aged.\n\nA note should be made about the medical field. The author didn’t do as good a job as he could have about making the world of the hospice realistic. Instead, his primary concern was with story, so the truth about hospitals was neglected to a considerable extent. Care and life in the hospices isn’t as bad as the author made it out to be.\n\nOverall:\n\nFrankly, I rather enjoyed the read. It was very thought-provoking. It was a long-drawn out experience, and it didn’t help that I read it during the only hours I had time each day: between midnight and four in the morning. Take my advice and get some sleep, but if you happen to have a slot for time open between 10 and midnight, let me just say, the cinematic and emotional aura of stories like this is always enhanced at night. Trust me on that.\nYou should definitely give it a try.","May 1, 2014","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is a visual novel. Such a format is rather new to me and I was skeptical. It seemed to me that a lack of material in the form of words would make visual novels just incredibly short books, the lack of mechanics would make the genre incredibly boring games, and the comparitive lack of visual information would make the genre rather drab movies.\n\nWell, it turns out I was very wrong. Narcissu 1st and 2nd are awesome just as they are. The background music does add significantly to the experience, and its pacing would not be nearly as effective to me in a film or book (and it certainly wouldn't fit a game).\n\nIt is a moving story about young people in palliative care and how they decide to live, and die. That doesn't really do it justice though. Another review described it better: "This is a story of disease and suffering; of medication and adverse effects; of thoracotomy scars and cellular poisons; of the living who cannot help but to die and of the dying who cannot help but to live; of a resting place other than "on 7F" or "at home"\n\nThere really is no reason not to give this story a try.

In my time of playing them I've never really encountered a story that hit me as hard as this one did. It's a beautiful story that is not terribly long, and is definitely well worth your time. It includes both the original Narcissu, and it's prequel, Side 2nd. Both are incredible stories.The soundtrack is perfectly fitting. My only real complaint would be the narrow visual style can get kind of hard to look at after awhile, but it is visually distinctive and does look nice. I should note as well that you don't get to make choices in this like other visual novels, but as mentioned previously, the story it gives you is astounding.\n\nAll in all, it's a free visual novel and it is well worth a few hours of your time.","June 23, 2014","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The writing is brief and the story is linear without choices unlike most visual novels.\n\nNarcissu is about 1.5 hours long if you're listening to the voiced edition. It's difficult to get into because both characters are very jaded (They have been spending their time in the hospital waiting to die.) It's alright for a short read. I found it more happy than depressing based on how the characters act towards the end.\n\nNarcissu 2nd is significantly longer, about 3-4 hours (voiced) and is the prequel to the first story. The tone is different, the characters are much more happy and you're able to learn the characters' backgrounds. Also, the production quality is noticeably higher with more art and has a short animation. Much easier to get into than the first.","September 13, 2014","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What follows is a desperate, yet touching tale about how even those who have no more hope can still fight to pursue happiness and the final choice of how their lives end.\n\nI played Part I first, but looking back, I highly advise playing Part I last so that everything ends more conclusively.\n\nOn an ending note: there is a good reason why this story has been reprinted and retold in physically form, and you have to play this VN to discover it.

Everything is set in the "real world", so no signs of fantasy or such things.\nAlso, I have to say that the soundtrack of this novel is OUTSTANDING!\n\nBut.. where's the criticism in this review? Here it comes: The Art.\nThe usage of images wasn't as big as you would expect from a visual novel but you know what?\nPersonally, I don't mind this at all. I enjoyed this novel because of the story and because of the characters interactions.\nIt even made some moments even more special. For example event showing one really, really beautiful picture at a certain instead of the standard "plot" images as usual.\n\nI promise you that this novel WILL BE worth your time, since it is completely free!\nIf you plan to play this game (what everyone should if haven't yet), then be prepared to shed tears.\nOn the first part, I really enjoyed following the story of our two characters during the 3-4 hours.\nSo go!

The plot of both revolve around characters that have been admitted to a hospital level called the "7th Floor." This hospital floor is not your typical floor in a hospital (if that makes any sense). It's a "hospice," a place where people who suffer from incurable diseases and will eventually die go to live out the rest of their days. Each story is different from the other, and play out different from each other. However, they are both connected and intertwine with one another.\n\nNarcissu Side 2nd is the prequel to Narcissu. Narcissu Side 2nd tells the story of the relationship between two girls and basically how they spend the summer together. However, they both suffer from the same or similar disease that has no cure and will eventually kill them. This story is about Setsumi (who is a main character in the original Narcissu) and Himeko (Setsumi's new, cheery "deathrow" friend). The story is told primarily from the perspective of Setsumi, but at times switches to Himeko as she explains events in her past. At different points in the story, we learn alittle about the two. We learn about Setsumi's family, Himeko's family, Himeko's past, etc. There's alot more I could mention, but I don't want to give away too much. Just know that, like the original, this is a beautiful, sad, and whimsical quote-on-quote "game." This story also has the same beautiful and heart-felt music from Narcissu, as well as some new pieces which are just as good. Art style is also the same, although it seems there are more images in this version and they are of better quality. Dialogue is well written just like in the original. And as with Narcissu, I did almost cry towards the end of this story. More so on the verge of tears than Narcissu. The story, overall, I feel is BETTER than the original. There's a lot more depth and substance added to this story than the first Narcissu. However, this comes at the cost of greatly increasing the amount of chapters to read. While in the first Narcissu there were 7-8 chapters (including prologue), Narcissu Side 2nd has a whopping 20 chapters (including prologue)! So, a downside to this story is it's a lot longer than the original. Another potnetial downside to this story, which mostly pertains to how "sensitive" you are towards religion, is there's a fair amount of talk about God and Catholicism. I only bring this up because some people may hate the constant mention of God (i.e. if you are a nonworshiper of God or just hate talk of religion in general), and/or may hate how Catholics can be portrayed in this story (there are times in the story where a character tries to disown their Catholic past or ways; there are also times when characters describe Catholicism in a somewhat negative light). This aspect didn't bother me, but it is worth mentioning for others as a warning. Still, a great prequel to a great, original visual novel game.\n\nNarcissu is the orginal story, or at least the one that was released first. This story follows the journey of two 7th Floor patients to a special destination. What is this "special place" and why are they going there? Well, you'll have to read the story to find out. The two patients are an unamed male patient and Setsumi. The story is told mostly from the perspective of the male patient, but a few times Setsumi narrates some of her life's story. This story is essentially that of a road trip story, but still good none the less. The music in this game is well-composed. Each track is beautiful and compelling. The art style is good. Slightly low budget looking, but still good to look at. The dialogue is well-written, and provokes many philosophical questions from the reader. While I said in my analysis of Narcissu Side 2nd it had less substance, the story of Narcissu is still a great story. I literally almost cried at the end. The characters were portrayed well and were very interesting. Overall, a good story and a good starting point for many other good stories within this universe to come.\n\nAll in all, this series is great. Two beautiful, yet sad stories in one beautiful, yet sad universe. The only problems I have with both of the stories is there is some heavy repetition (which can be annoying at times) and reading both stories back-to-back makes for one long reading experience (at least for me it did). I'm very inexperienced when it comes to visual novel games, and didn't expect to spend around 15 hours just reading both of these stories! I thought this series of stories would've been significantly shorter, but boy was I wrong!lol Still, I reccomend you "trudge" through those long hours to uncover a beautiful, intertwining story. As far as which one you should play first depends on your personal preference. The author of both stories reccomends you read the prequel then the original. However, I reccomend you read the original then the prequel. In my opinion, reading the prequel after the first game is a better way to experience the story. The prequel, essentially, fills in all the holes and makes many references to the first game. Seeing how the author wove all these intricate details from the first game into the story and showing how they made their appearance in the original Narcissu is very interesting. This particular analysis can only be done by reading the original first. Not only that, but I feel coming from the prequel to the original may dissapoint a few people. Like I said, Narcissu lacks substance in comparison to Narcissu Side 2nd. So, people may be let down when the original has a lot less story depth than the prequel. It may just feel kinda empty to them. Narcissu was, essentially, the foundation of the Narcissu "universe." So, it's understandable why that story felt alittle more bare bones. The prequel simply took all the good things from Narcissu and built upon them, making the story all the more better. But, still, the ultimate decision of in what order you read is left up to you. Me, I probably WOULD have read the prequel first then the original if I had known Side 2nd was a prequel. But I'm still ok with the order in which I read both. Anyhow, this is a visual novel game that I HIGHLY recommend. A lot of thought, love, and care was put into both of these games and it shows. And the best part of this game/games is...they're free! So, definitely check them out. You'll more than likely love them.:)\n\nP.S. Also, as of March 26, 2015 the acheivements STILL do not work.:/","March 26, 2015","true","14.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The characters still have objective, despite the atmosphere was rather gloomy and give the no hope vibe, the characters are seeking something which is just to let it go (to be realistic to wait for their end ) but doesn't want it to end like that so they wanna end it while living the last of their life in the fullest. As the story lacked direction to begin, little and little things add up, then gives off "I CAN SEE THE ENDING" full with hopes and feels which was awesome.\n\nDefinitely worth to try.\n\n","November 10, 2015","true","38.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What follows is a desperate, yet touching tale about how even those who have no more hope can still fight to pursue happiness and the final choice of how their lives end.\n\nI played Part I first, but looking back, I highly advise playing Part I last so that everything ends more conclusively.\n\nOn an ending note: there is a good reason why this story has been reprinted and retold in physically form, and you have to play this VN to discover it.

There are two parts to the VN, Narcissu and Narcissu Side 2nd. They are complementary to each other and I highly recommend reading both in order. If you don't read it in order... well it will probably be confusing.\nIt's very short taking about 3 hours or so, depending on how fast you read and whether you want to listen to all the voice acting.\n\nVisuals:\nArt is very minimalistic, and the backgrounds only cover about 1/3 of the screen\nKinda disappointing, but being a free game I can hardly complain.\nWhile there aren't too many backgrounds and CG, the game is fairly short and takes place in only a few places.\nSo it completely makes sense. There are very very few character CGs and when do appear, it is just at the right time, and at the right moments to complement the story. Super minimialistic, yet effective in it's own way.\nSome say silence is an important part to music, and certainly applies here as well.\n\nSound:\nVoice acting is good. Nothing outstanding but each voice fits the character. There aren't too many characters in the first place, but the voice actresses do a good job.\nOn the Soundtrack, it is quite beautiful. All the tracks greatly add to the ambience; although a bit depressing to listen to alone. For such a short game, there are lots of different tracks. I've seen longer VN with only half the tracks that this game has. 12 songs for the first part, and 14 for the second for a grand total of 26.\nIt even incudes a few vocal tracks!\nOne complaint I have is the abrupt cuts in music during scene change, or at the end of a scene. I wish it had some sort of fade. The sudden stop to the music kinda kills the mood the game has.\n\nStory:\nThere are two parts to the story, Narcissus  and Narcissus Side 2nd\nThe first part is sort of like an introduction, but the 2nd is what completes the story as a whole.\nWhile it is possible to only play the first part, you owe it to yourself to complete the second. Trust me, you'll feel a lot less depressed :(\nThe second part definitely wraps up the story and leaves with a glimmer of hope.\nThe plot is definetly not the main focus here. It is more about the life of each character and their emotions. Struggling with death and hopelessness. Again, going with minimalistic art, I'd say the story is very minimalistic as well. A lot of things are unsaid, giving a lot of freedom of interpretation for the readers. I quite liked this style, and allowed for some thought provoking dialogue.\n\nBeautifully written, and thought provoking, it makes you wonder what I would do in that situation. Could I have the power or courage to be hopeful in despair?\n\nIf you enjoy Visual Novels, then go ahead and try it out!\nIt's free and there is nothing to lose~","April 22, 2015","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You feel anger, happiness, sadness, love, compassion, and so many emotions inbetween while reading this.

Though finished it a way ago without steam, I still wish to make some hours with steam to make my review persuasive.(LOL) Would recommend Setsumi to my girlfriend, student and project adviser. (though I have none of them)\n\nWhat I want to write:\nActually I played Narcissu's app a while ago, approximately 2 years from now on an android phone. It was a warm May afternoon, and I got  a 2 hours off after the swimming class and before after-class curriculum. I had only a mobile phone, no homework, no friends around, and nothing to do but waiting for the curriculum. So I found myself so bored that I have to seek something interesting - except playing games on my phone that  I had cracked for several times. I checked google play store, with the keyword that I've  forgotten, and my focus was caught by an app with a cover of white background and a smiling girl. Its  name was “水仙” (shuixian, means narcissus in Chinese). I downloaded it, thinking it was some kind of Life simulation bishojo game, which was a perfect way of wasting time. That's how I found Narcissu, the Chinese translated version.\n\nHowever, it's Narcissu. The result of playing this "Life simulation bishojo game" was that I had totally forgotten what was around me for the next 2 hours, because all my focus was on this novel. No matter how loud guys were when the class was over, no matter how warm the sunshine was, what I  could only feel was a kind of regretting, for something that I could not express at that time. That's Narcissu. I did not cry, but my heart was somehow hollowed at the time I finished it. That is Narcissu.","May 1, 2015","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When he gets sick he soon hears that he cant be cured and is going to die. Because of this he needs to go to the seventh floor of the hospital where he meets a girl who also is going to die but neither wants to die there nor at her home...\n\nThe second part of the game is about the girl who the protagonist meets in the hospital. In this part she has yet to be sent to the seventh floor and meets someone who will change her life forever...\n\nThe game has a really beautifull story and you can choose if you want to play it with or without voice acting. The developer gave the player this option because he wants the player to be able to imagine the voice but also understands that some would rather hear the text spoken. For this same reason there arent many images of the characters in the game.","November 20, 2015","true","10.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I played this long before it came out on steam)\nA very sad story set in the 7th floor of an hospital. This floor is where terminal ill patients are sent for them to stay for their last moments and our main characters are the inhabitants of this floor.\nFrom this you can already imagine that this is not going to be an happy story (despite the 22 yo lolita)\nYou will cry. And a lot. The entire visual novel is a story about life and death, which puts in contrast the behaviour of Setsumi, whose hope is long gone, and Yuu, who just arrived and has yet to understand Setrumi true feelings.\nThis game comes with the second game of the series, that is a prequel, which explains some plot holes about the first one.\nWhile the first part earns points for the originality of the story, the second one looks a bit like a repetition of the previous one so not everyone may like it: we again have a terminally ill protagonist, older than our previous character, who is going through the same that Setsumi  will have to face in the future. The second one is "lighter" than the previous one, and sometimes a bit easy to predict\nBUT\nWhat you should notice is the completely different kind of ending (which I won't spoil) that they have, making the first one even more sad when compared.\nTL;DR\nIt's free, it's 2 in 1, it's beautifully sad. Read it\nP.S. Since a lot of people don't seem to know... This is a KINETIC NOVEL, which means that there won't be any choices.\nYes, there are visual novel that are read-only. No, they don't suck for that (Higurashi and Umineko)\nSo quit giving bad votes for the lack of choices, that's not how you judge a visual novel.","September 9, 2015","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Side 1: You play as a young male (I'm not sure of his name) who has just been assigned to Floor 7 of the hospital, where he meets a young woman named Setsumi who tells him the rules of 7F. One of them being "You have two choices on where you die: At home, or on 7F." Side 2 is a backstory to Setsumi from before she was assinged to 7F and is where the majority of the feels were located (for me anyway).
