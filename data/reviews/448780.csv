I was ok with the translation errors, enjoyed the background pictures and the story (as far as I went...)   The QTE bits were kind of annoying to be honest.  I do appreciate trying to add some interaction, but this didn't work for me.   Ultimately, I got bored before I finished. (I played a couple hours, the rest was idling for the final card drop).    I'd give it a side-ways thumb if I could, but ultimately I wouldn't recommend it to anyone I know.","May 16","false","5.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Has some rough patches with transltions and unnecessary QTEs. The story is decent though, and it made me curious about what wouod happen next. I hope they downplay the hallucination aspects, as they seem like a cop out. Maybe they are trying to borrow too much from the Metro storyline. There is also one multiple choice quiz late in the game that seems to have you brute force guessing 5 questions in a row.","June 2","true","11.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

I can't read Russian, so I couldn't figure out what to do.  Game over.","March 23","false","5.4"," 13 of 29 people (45%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","45","13","29","8","0"
