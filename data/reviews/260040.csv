Hence I don't know a thing, and am reduced to guessing all the time xD Still nice for its nostalgic feeling and humor. Got all YDKJ games very cheap during the sale in a bundle, so it isn't worth complaining about the culture barriere. Overall, it is a nice game for now and then, but nothing special.\n\nFor this game in particular, you better know everything about ♥♥♥-old tv-shows, or you will fail as much as I did xD","December 23, 2013","true","0.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/epicfail236/recommended/260040/","epicfail236","epicfail236","http://steamcommunity.com/id/epicfail236/","690 products in account","Date: 2/25/16\nReview Number: 27\nGame: You Don't Know JACK (group review, classics)\nFrom (Creator Publisher): Jackbox Games\nPlayed On: Steambox (controller/keyboard)\nSteam Price as of Review: $2.99 per game, $20.00 for all the classics\nTotal Time played: So much time\nReview:\n\nHaving at least eight different versions of You Don't Know Jack in my steam list, I had a feeling that these were going to come up sooner or later, and so rather than bore you with the possibility of multiple reviews of what is essentially the same game done over and over, I'll just compress this down to one review, though it's the Television version that gets the lucky posting.\n\nNow I have been a huge fan of trivia games for some time.  Nearly every time I have deigned to grace others with my magical presence in a social situation has nearly always been in a bar that has trivia, and indeed my wife has an even greater breadth of trivia knowledge than I do.  However, for the most part, I have found many trivia games, games that by their nature should be a social event, to be somewhat lacking on the PC and mobile devices.  However, there is one specific series that has kept my attention for a large chunk of my portion as a breathing meatsack on this planet, and that is the You don't Know Jack series by the now named Jackbox Games.  Now for the most part, trivia games have a very simple formula, you get asked questions, you answer them, and the fastest/most correct/best at distracting other players ends up winning.  But what sets games apart in this genre is the social experience.  are the questions amusing enough to keep a group entertained?  Is the gameplay smooth enough to be somewhat transparent and intuitive?  Are the questions easy enough to be generally answerable without insulting most player’s intelligence?  If you can positively answer at least two of these questions you usually have a sellable game, however YDKJ has generally gotten all of them right.  The questions are actual solid trivia type questions on par with even the more taxing game shows, yet they are framed in a almost slapstick environment that keeps players totally entertained.  The multiplayer is seamless (particularly in the newer games from the party packs) and has been the source of many a shouting and cheering match at family gatherings.  Even the voice acting is golden (though I prefer the newer announcer Cookie over Schmitty anyday), adding humor without drowning out the actual game itself.\n\nAll in all, YDKJ is the type of game that you buy and play and play and play until the questions start repeating themselves, and if you are able to get to that point while having four players running the game every time, you probably know enough people to run for public office, so be sure to be graceful in victory.  Or pay your opponents, whatever works in your political arena.\n\nGame’s Fate: Removed the old ones from the steambox, but I keep the new ones.  Party games don't get any better than this.\nBuy/No Buy: Specifically on the classics?  They’re awesome, but unless you are a trivia nut, save your money for the newer ones in the party packs.  Now the new ones.  Those are a buy","February 26","true","0.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TiffanyAK/recommended/260040/","TiffanyAK","TiffanyAK","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TiffanyAK/","1800 products in account","The television trivia is now extremely dated, of course, but the YDKJ fun is still there, and many questions pertain to classic television shows that even a modern audience at least has a chance of being familiar with via reruns and everything even if they are not major classic TV fans. The really tricky thing is when they bring in what even in the 90s would be considered obscure questions about little-known shows. But, regardless, even if you're just left randomly guessing answers to absurd questions, if you're a YDKJ fan, you'll still have a lot of fun. This is another one that I can't wait to try in multiplayer. I haven't had the chance yet, but it seems like it'd be a good opportunity for family fun, though I have a feeling my mom would win every time.","August 12, 2015","true","0.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
