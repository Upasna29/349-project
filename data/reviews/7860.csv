Bush and you've been sent back in time to fight off a demonic zombie invasion during The Great War.. Although it may just be a reenactment of The Great War, given the obviously fake German accents. You could still be in Texas, I'm not totally sure.\n\nI also couldn't tell you why it's actually fun, but somehow it keeps me playing.\n\nIt makes no sense, because the gunplay isn't nearly as satisfying as Painkiller, and mostly it just feels like an even ♥♥♥♥♥ier Singularity without the cool time-glove gimmick. It's almost as if it tries to be just a little bit worse than everything else, and somehow that total disregard for quality ends up becoming endearing.\n\nIt is a consummate B-game. It's digital filth. It should never have been made, you shouldn't be playing it, and that's exactly why you want to.","November 1, 2014","true","3.1"," 115 of 153 people (75%) found this review helpful 60 people found this review funny","75","115","153","60","5"

The cutscenes and voice acting are TERRIBLE, there are many bugs and glitches, but the game is actualy fun to play and thats where it shines - the gameplay.\n\nNice mechanic is the use of melee combat (and shadohand on later stages), alongside with the pistol.\nOnce the player get the shadowhand, the gameplay is becoming closer to the Bioshock series, cause the different spells, combined with the tipical gun shooting. Controls are little different compared to the Bioshock though - left mouse button for the left hand, right mouse button for the right hand.\n\nI said "combined", so now is the time to mention the COMBOOOS.\nOur hero have three types of melee attacks - kick, left hand melee and gun melee attack. The bayonettas and the shovels can be thrown at the enemies to nail them on the wall, the gas lamps exept to light the way, can be used to burn the hordes of undeads and freaky creatures. The arsenal is impressive.\nIt's good to perform different attacks to create combo. For example - knock down the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on the ground and then finish him out with the pump. Or slice him with the bayonetta for the "Herr Doktor" combo.\n\nThere are different "challenge rooms", which becomes avalible after beating any given level. The challenge rooms helps the player to permanently unlock different gear types to be avalible in the inventory.\nThere are parts of the game when the player controls giant mech or even ride a dragon. Yeah, the it's total mashup of many mechanics from different games (there is even bullet time system implemented in it), but it fun to play and it works...for the most of the time.\n\nIt's not AAA title, it screams "I'M A CHEAP, LOW BUDGET, SOMETIMES UGLY GAME", but it's charming in some inexplicable way. So, try it!\n\n7/10","November 26, 2013","true","10.2"," 64 of 81 people (79%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","79","64","81","9","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rivvern/recommended/7860/","rivvern","João","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rivvern/","403 products in account","Necrovision is a strange game. Stuck between a myriad of styles and influences, it emerges as a blend between the atmosphere of classic world war shooters and the crazy mass murder party of games such as Painkiller, Serious Sam or Bulletstorm. The overall result is highly personal and depends heavily on your mindset: don't go into this game expecting an AAA shooter. You'll find cringeworthy cutscenes, amateurish voice acting, a pixelated GUI and weird bugs all around.\n\nHowever, as soon as you get past its imperfections, you'll be playing a pretty crazy and fun game with a (surprisingly!) relatively readable storyline, zombie beheading, dragons, huge boss fights and lots of other nonsense ♥♥♥♥ happening in WWI. One of the biggest surprises was level design, which, although relatively linear, is huge, well planned enough, often aesthetically pleasing and with a very classic feel and pace.\n\nOn less positive points, the combo system is pretty bland and doesn't really feel well-implemented (although it can be fun). The weapons are also sub-par: the historical limitations are understandable, but for a game this crazy, they often slow the action to a crawl as you painstakingly bolt your rifle after every shot fighting giant demon things. Health is also a bit weird: medkits exist and are pretty abundant but are close to useless since your health automatically recharges up to about 75%; which breaks some of the classic appeal in my view.\n\nOverally, Necrovision is a pretty fun experience if you're willing to forget its technical shortcomings and accept its particular brand of insanity. 7.5/10","November 30, 2015","true","11.9"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","21","22","0","0"

But its for all oldschool FPS players almost legend. It is bug, its looking good (this what Farm made with old Painengine is just ridiculus, that game was looks nice and get nice carnage elements shooting out limbs from screaming people).  Nice mix of storyline, that at end become clear.  Game is a bit to simple in all mechanics (animations etc), but its fun. First War + Vampires + Hell and Demons = good idea, but not all can made it good like Farm 51. This game for me is still a small legend of good carnage FPS with nice storyline and big, darkly locations. 8/10 from me for this game. 2 points was lost for bad animations and old Pain engine  that for 2008 was allredy to weak... but that makeup was briliant and  ragdoll with tottal max carnage andloots of phisical elements...

I found that it packed a 'punch' from it's lore which kept me playing through hours I probably shouldn't have been playing playing it in, back in the day. Yes, this game was scary like that and because of it's sound (and possibly graphical ) design -does this to this day (depending on your tolerance to the experience).\nStory is 'loosely' based on Chaos of war, around Weapons of Mass Destruction and sinister experiments gone horribly wrong, whereby our protagonist survives and gets to experience the about-to-unfold madness firsthand. The story expands from this point on and extravagates (in a fantastic way) into something that is Unique to this genre of Horror/Shooter, at least back in the day it was very unique. Anyhow, if you choose to pick this gem up; Get strapped in for one 'Hell' of a ride.\n\nBack in the day one thing that stood out and I loved about this game are the visuals which In My Humble Opinion overall look very nice, even to this day. This aspect helps with the immersion factor, for I wouldn't call the game *realistic* persé but it's sublime sound design (ambiance, voice-acting), dark atmosphere coupled with interesting Character interaction/development throughout the course of the game are worth the money, if not so then the -experience alone is something great to behold, if you are into this kind of thing -that is.\n\n"ze Germans are here, ze Germans are heeree!!!".\n\nOne note; If you pick up this game, be sure to check out it's sequel/add-on that is also to be found on this Glorious Steam (not joking) by the name of:\n\nNecrovision Lost Company.\n\nThank you,\n\n-"HellzWind"","November 28, 2015","true","4.9"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

If I had to describe it as briefly as possible I'd say it's DooM set during WWI, with some LOTR mixed in because kraut zombies wasn't strange enough. The first half of the game is a relatively standard period shooter with bullet-sponge opponents; These levels are well designed but drag on a bit.\n\nThe second half of Necrovision is where things start to shine, as you find yourself dropped into the middle of a compelling underground fantasy realm populated by imaginative (and truly chilling) monsters like gas-mask spiders, flamethrower rat-men, ninja vampires, angry spirits and yes, DRAGONS. The needlessly convoluted story concerns the subjugation of this under-world by demonic forces, who are now spilling over onto the surface. It is here you receive an entirely new set of weapons and a nifty melee super-gauntlet that can be charged with the souls of fallen enemies to unleash powerful explosive attacks. I wish some of the opening missions could be shortened or cut completely to make way for this part of the game, as no doubt many players will be turned off by their first-impression of Necrovision before having a chance to experience the good stuff.\n\nTechnically the game is rough around the edges, with some maddening difficulty spikes, but worth it for shooter enthusiasts in search of an original premise and oppressive atmosphere.","March 14","true","24.5"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","11","13","2","0"

The game mechanics are old and somewhat clunky, but still work well and are easily adjusted to. The game provides several weapons and ways employ these weapons so that combat is exciting when a new weapon is found. The story is sub-par. The idea of the necromancer is somewhat absurd and steals the idea of nazi zombies from call of duty even thought I am sure that this game came before call of duty: world at war. In the beginning, the game frequently steals the camera from you and stops the action that this game is good at. When you do regain the controls, you feel as if you have shell shock and don't trully know what is happening. While you regain control quickly, it is still disconserting. With in NecroVisioN, there are collectables that tell you more of a story throught letters. But more importantly, there are "vampire" collectables that allow you to activate a special power that slows time and increases your effectiveness. This power only comes from killing enemies in specific ways but the easier ones are the best backup for any situation. The voice acting is low at best, but still conveys the meaning behing the words. Over all, NecroVisioN is for the people who want to play a fun and exciting game that has its own niche in the gaming world and doesn't follow andy conventional methods.","May 8","true","6.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/recommended/7860/","widgetguy","widgetguy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/","972 products in account","Quick Summary: Action / Horror First Person Shooter with mostly World War 1 weapons, though that changes about half way through the game. The graphics are decent for an indie game and gameplay is pretty basic shooting with partially regenerating health so you can run through large portions of the game.\n\nYou play Simon, an American soldier in Europe fighting the Germans in World War 1, but you quickly encounter far more dangerous enemies as the dead rise and demonic forces appear out of thin air. As you sacrifice your humanity and progress deeper and deeper underground, you find the ancient world of the vampires, who look like people in heavy bug armor (watch out for their vampire kung fu). For ages the vampires have held back the demons from invading, and now it’s up to Simon to do what they no longer can: Enter the portal to Hell and defeat the demon lords.\n\nRight from the start of the game you’ll get some pretty pathetic World War 1 guns and throwable weapons. Most of the enemies in the game have enough life that it takes a few seconds of shooting to kill them. That means any more than 3 or 4 enemies at once can be a threat to you, especially when you run into the big dudes who actually run faster than you and take about 5 clips of ammo to kill. Like a lot of modern games, if you can avoid taking damage for a few seconds, your life will partially regenerate (up to about 60%). This means you can run past about half the enemies in the game (much harder in later levels with teleporting enemies).\n\nAn additional tool in your bag of tricks is the “adrenaline” meter which you charge up by killing enemies. The adrenaline can be used to temporarily slow down time, making it easier to avoid enemy attacks (or run away like me). If you take enough damage to kill you, and you have a full adrenaline meter, the time slow will activate automatically and you’ll actually become invincible during the effect. Unfortunately, during the time slow, your attacking and reloading is slowed down too, so don’t think you can just use the opportunity to blast everyone. Additionally, when you’ve started your descent underground you’ll acquire a special weapon with magical attacks (shadowhand). It’s not as cool as it sounds, but it adds to your arsenal.\n\nPros:\n+I enjoy horror shooters (like Jericho) and despite having mixed ratings, the story is ok.\n+This is a straightforward run and gun. There isn’t that much puzzle solving so if you just want to blast some enemies, you can do that. You have a little compass on your HUD that points you which direction you need to go.\n\nCons:\n-The game crashes occasionally for no apparent reason. Also, I wasn’t able to Alt+Tab out of the game without the game freezing. There’s a bug causing blurry vision, but that can be fixed with a command line addition.\n-The little cut scenes between levels are weird. Not only is the subtitling occasionally wrong, but they show and say things that don’t make much sense relative to what has happened in the gameplay. This is likely due to the game’s developers not being native English speakers.\n\nOverall, the game is a mostly brainless shooter and if you’ve played the Serious Sam or Painkiller games, you should have an idea what to expect. The game isn’t awesome, but it’s not completely horrible either. 6/10\n","March 9","true","7.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Tem gráficos interessantes e imersivos em diversos momentos e músicas boas mas que depois de um tempo começam a ficar repetitivas, por isso não brilham tanto. A proposta do jogo é enfocar mais no combate do que na história, por isso as vzes tem umas coisas sem pé nem cabeça, assim como  zumbis e soldados que desmembramos a todo momento na engine de física divertida. O arsenal de armas vai desde tipos de pistolinhas, metralhadoras, snipers, baioneta, shotgun, até um canhão lá antigo e armas melle como espadas e pás também. É gostoso decapitar cabeças e desmembrar corpos dos zumbis e soldados  com essas armas todas. A história se passa na Guerra Mundial e o que começa numa guerra comum passa a desvendar uma maldição de mortos se reanimando. Zumbis variados, alguns que rastejam, e os soldados alemães vivos também continuam na brincadeira, e mais adiante começam a aparecer até ogros gigantes e demônios alados e também seres que mais aparecem alienígenas. Aparece até um dragão! Mas e sse ajuda a gente. A gente "pilota" o dragão. O jogo é uma loucura do começo ao fim por isso não dá pra levar tão a sério, e sim viajar com ele, surfar na idéia louca do desenvolvedor. O foco do jogo não é ter a história redondinha, e sim maluquinha. Num esquema de jogo que lembra Serious Sam e Painkiller. Bem jogável o jogo e recomendo bastante. Fechei o jogo no modo demonscrusher. O jogo tem artefatos pra achar pra aprimorar alguns combos.","May 14, 2014","true","32.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Graphics are top notch with undead appearing very ghoulish along with other unique creatures such as what looks like a cross between a flying manta ray and a fiery pheonix.\n\nGore as mentioned already is excellent and on the spot brutal to the eyes. When seeing a world war 1 soldier blown to bits with only his torso intact it really made me feel like i was seeing a real corpse.\n\nThe whole game world of NECROVISION is very immersive making one feel you are there in the trenches. They could have easily made this into a world war 1 game if they had wanted to. Soldiers screaming,dying,yelling out orders all around the player really takes one to another world. Its this scary before the supernatural stuff even begins!\n\nThere are hand written notes scattered about which are voiced whenever the player picks them up to read. The voice acting is of high quality with the creepiness i used to feel when reading the books and letters in CLIVE BARKER'S UNDYING game. They really help to flesh out the nightmare of NECROVISION even more then it terrifyingly is.\n\nThe player characters voice in the original demo was a bit..hokey but in the full retail version his voice is great fitting in with everything going on around him. There are also times he will talk with what sounds like a demonic version of Caleb from the 1990s 3dgore shooter BLOOD by MONOLITH after alot of carnage and going into a murderous rage.\n\nMusic is grand and epic with some very powerful fitting classical atmosphere.\n\nAlot of the environments are destructable with different ways of making them into shattered wreckage. There was this one tower i could either wittle away from afar with a mounted machine gun placement or move in close and blow it up with a grenade.\n\nOne of the sleeper hits of the year and a must buy for fans of the genre.","June 5, 2014","true","7.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

To start off NecroVision is a FPS set in the time period of world war 1. The guns in this game range from pistols to machineguns that also range in power and precision. NecroVision uses the war to give the game a sense of action and then boosts that by adding in all the bosses and demons that you have to fight while completeing a mision. The game also uses the common mental toying all through the game. For example, you can walk into little dugouts where the soldiers slept and most of them are gassed so you go through stages where it becomes hard to see through the gas but when you complete whatever it is that you had to do you would find there was nothing in there. So that's the good perks of the game but unfortunately not every game is perfect. The game will sometimes shoot grey lines across the screen if you don't have the required computer stats or if you overestimate your computer and set your settings too high. Well that's basically all the perks to the game so if you are looking for a great action game that still has those horror game qualities then NecroVision is a game that you should consider.","January 2, 2015","true","6.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The combat is great in some places and the Shadowclawthing is fun.\n\nThe bad: Everything else. Here's how cutscenes SHOULD work: You get to a point in a level and see them. In this game, it's AFTER the level and tells you stuff that happened during. Example: I killed a boss, then spent a few more minutes running around. After the level ended, it showed me a conversation w/ the boss.\n\nAlso, this game isn't friendly on the hardest setting. At the end of the game, there are almost no checkpoints. Also, why is it that every creature in this game is neat but for hell they choose a stupid demon thing that is bland? Get this, though, it's the most annoying enemy in the game.

Once you're done clicking at the enemy they just rag-doll in an awkward manner. Don't even get me started on the hand-to-hand combat.\n\nThey were apparently too lazy to properly make cutscenes in this game. In the flash-forward sequence they just played the trailer.

Soldier comes running at you, soldier gets killed by incredibly badass looking enemy, you awkwardly run up to the enemy, you do this awkward punch like thing, one punch later the incredibly badass enemy turns into a rag-doll, your plastic face looks into the camera.\n\nThey obviously tried to emulate Painkiller by making both you and the enemies move incredibly fast, which would have helped normally with the gunplay, except you are constantly packed into tight corridors where you are consistently bumping into things, trying to pick out the gray-brown enemies from the gray-brown environment.

The idea behind it is nice though, but the game itself is a ham-fisted cluster♥♥♥♥ with graphical issues which ruin the experience. Black screens on loading game with no way to fix it anyone?\n\nSad to see a good idea ruined by incompetence.\n\nUpdate 07.09.2014. I decided togive this game a try again, remembering it had some good moments. But alas, it was not to be. A recent reinstall brought a new issue. First, the game crashed in the menus. When I got over that, the video was so blurred out so that I could really not see anything. Once I managed to fix that, the crashes started. It started crashing to desktop after 2-3 minutes after starting up the game, even if you just waited in the menus and no amount of workarounds on the intertnet or tinkering around in .ini files fixed this. This game is now completely broken beyond any salvation.\n\nOS: Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit, GeForce GTX760.\n\nVerdict: Save your money and buy something that actually can be played. Even if you receive this as a gift, either politely decline, or add toinventory instead of adding it into your library so you can gift this to someone you really, really don't like.","August 31, 2012","false","31.3"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

At first, the game seems like a below par WWI game.  It takes that aspect, and brings zombies and many other monsters together.  Once you get to the powers, its honestly very fun.  The bosses are challenging and sometimes takes planning.  This game reminds me of a mixture of call of duty zombies, skyrim, and bioshock all together.

That sounds rather interesting until you start playing the game and find yourself groaning at missing textures, bad hit boxes, unterpowered weapons, laughable enemies, and your big texan main characters voice. I will at this time say that yes I do know it is an indie game but many of the problems of the problems listed above are something they should have looked at the third time around in beta and fixed.

It's got an interesting combination of war with Nazis and vampire battles, but each half of the game is pretty much day and night.  There's a good selection of weapons, but once you hit the second half of the game anything you find in the first half are useless because the ammo is never found again.  Vampire weapons aren't bad, but underpowered against th hordes.  The story doesn't make any sense and seems to jump around.  Finally, the final boss is one of those bosses where they have a ton of HP but present no real challenge.  It's also lengthy, but drags on way too much near the end, like they ran out of ideas and decided to just clone Painkiller.

It’s definitely not one of the greatest FPS games, but it certainly isn’t the worst. You play as Simon Bukner, an American Soldier in The British Army, fighting against the Germans during World War I. The game takes you through the battle of the Somme, underground world of vampires, and eventually Hell. During the course of the game Simon uncovers a war between vampires and demons,  and earth’s fate hangs in the balance.\n\nThe plot itself is interesting but does fall flat in some areas, and has weak narrative. Although it does have weak narrative, you generally feel progression as you play through game, and it often feels like you are working towards a goal. Unfortunately more often than not, you aren’t quite sure what that overall goal is, or why you’re doing it. The dialog and voice acting is subpar and is sometimes laughable due to it’s corniness. A side not on voice acting, for the last few chapters of the game, all of the voice acting was in Spanish or Italian (excuse my ignorance) but the cutscenes were in English; it was never explained why, or at least I didn’t see why. Funny thing is, is that I didn’t mind at all, I felt the language fit really well and the voice acting was nice.\n\nI did really enjoy the combat in Necrovision,  it had a very old school feel to it, and a great dual-wield system The weapon selection was adequate, although during the latter half of the game, just a small handful of guns was available, and you could no longer get ammo for the weapons you had found on earth. The enemies you fought were varied, you come across German soldiers, zombies, ghosts, vampires, and demons. And all kinds of hideous abominations of said enemies. Boss fights were fun and were generally large bosses, but took little strategy.\n\nI wanted this game to have a “neutral” rating was because it isn’t a game I would ever go out of my way to recommend to a friend, and there are a lot of other shooters I would recommend before this one. But it’s positive because I did have some fun mowing down some zombies and demons and spouting some cheezy one-liners","December 7, 2014","true","12.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It worked.\nSo here is a "how to have fun in this game":\n- Do not care about realism (by game's standards of course)\n- English is the language to choose\n- Don't take yourself or the game serious\n- Don't expect any explanation of the circumstances or anything else that is story related... Just enjoy the randomness (<-- this) of the plot\n- Use all weapons, and try to make a mess (especially melee)\n- Play it on easy, seriously it doesn't reduce challenge more than it reduces boring fights (you know that feeling when you just want to finish the game but the same boring monsters keep spawning and spawing in the last two levels? Yeah thats why)\n- The ending is pretty cool so it made up for the previous point ^\n- Throwing shovels around is priceless!","July 20, 2013","true","11.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But it's not a generic arcade shooter. There is something that differs NecroVisioN from other shooters, modern included.\n\nStory and setting:\nThe game is set in 1916, during the First World War. You play as Simon Bukner, a british trooper whose destiny is about to change...\nThe game starts in generic trench warfare scenario, but later we will find out that there are much worse enemies than germans.\nThough, the storytelling is pretty confusing - that's the only flaw.\nOverall story score: 4/5\n\nGameplay:\nGameplay and mechanics in this game are brilliant. There are two-hand weapon mechanics, enemy limb damage mechanics and even great close combat mechanics. For example, you can grab a knife and a Luger, a demonic hand and a Luger, and much more. Enemies greatly react to damage - you can shoot his leg off to make him crawl away in despair.\nAs in every old-school shooter, there are secrets scattered around the level. Talking about the levels, they are huge, taking an hour to pass, which is definetly an advantage.\nOverall gameplay score: 5/5\n\nGraphics:\nThe game is built on NecroEngine, which is a modified version of PainEngine used in PainKiller. The engine provides an amazing picture quality: the effects are juicy and loud and the designs are great.\nThough, graphics in this game are pretty lame in comparison to nowadays standarts - "soap" textures and "rubber" people.\nOverall graphics score: 3/5 (personal: 5/5)\n\nDesign:\nDesign is what gives this game an awesome feeling. Gasmask-wearing spiders; barbed wire-coiled, mutilated germans and vampires, gigantic underground strongholds and much more.\nOverall design score: 5/5\n\nTo conclude, I definetly recommend this game to you if you need quality gameplay.\nOverall score: 4/5, one of the best old-school games out there.","November 1, 2015","true","13.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What I found  is they are not many and not too popular. Valiant Hearts and Verdun are most well known I think. There are few grand strategies, but i'm not in to them. The reason i started with this is NecroVision take place in WWI setting and this was the only thing I could think of to start the review.\n\nYou take the role of Simon Buckner, young american who join the British army to fight germans in 1916. After an ambush and the following fierce battle, everything for our hero turns upside down. Simon encounters supernatural phenomenon and realize that greater evil threatens to wipe humanity. To a certain degree it's the germans fault. They never learn not to play with fire. The story is not bad, it kept me interested through the whole game, but it's not memorable enough. You have to save Earth from germans, vampires, demons and whole other bunch of creatures. The good thig in the story is it takes to great locations.\n\nLet me take a step back and look at the the settings. Rebindable keys, HUD and crosshair opacity are few of the good things in here. But in sound is missing speech slider. In some places people speak so quietly, I can bearly hear them. Subtitles help to understand what are they saying, but they in some places are not displayed. In video options you can change a lot of things – textures for weapons, people, envoirment. Also you have render quality, dynamic shadows and so on. But even if everything is on max settings the games is not a good looker.\n\nThe dev try and succeed in putting enough mechanics in the gameplay to differentiate from other FPSs. Not all are entirly original. When you kill enemy in non-traditional style, you are rewarded with Adrenaline and Fury. Adrenaline is basically bullet-time and later is used for one more thing. Later for it. Non-traditional ways for killing reminds of Bulletstorm, but here they are not that creative. Headshots with different weapons, kicking, melee and so on. When you manage to chain few combos, you gain Fury level, which in turns leads to, for the first few level, electricity coming from you and hitting enemies. For even higher level – incinerating them. For reaching maximum Fury, be on a lookout for hidden vampire artefacts. Each found increases one level. It's so satysfing to melee a group of bad guys and incinerate them.\n\nNecroVision is FPS. And what you do in this type of game? Shooting and blasting enemies. How is the shooting? It's good. Weapons have arcade feel to them. They don't have recoil, but they also don't have Quake-like accuracy. If enemies are far away , you have to burst, because crosshair widens and the gun become less acurate. Weapons in 1/3 of the game more or less represent the time period the game takes place. Two pistols, rifle, sniper, rocket launcher, shotgun, heavy and light machine gun. These weapons are used in abovementioned 1/3 of the game. After that the game takes hard turn and starts to get more interesting. You get Shadowhand, SMG, shotgun, rocket launcher, and flamethrower. One of them raises curiosity. It's Shadowhand. It's metal glove with Wolverine-like claws. You can use it for melee or cast spells – fireballs, iron rods and freezing. All are useful. Shadowhand have one one more ability – raising the dead. When Adrenalin is on it's maximum stand to nearby fallen enemie and ressurect him to help you fight.\n\nThere is more. You can dual-wield pistols and machine guns. You are less accurate, but in close range is so satisfying to mow enemies down. In your right hand you can equip a pistol and in your left you can put another pistol, bayonet, shovel, granade, dynamite and gas lamp for setting enemies on fire. With shovel and bayonet you can melee or throw them. I killed a lot of enemies that way. Almost every murder gives you adrenaline.\n\nThere is a sprint button. Except for fast movement, you can use it with combination from melee and a gun to knock down a group of enemies. This and kicking are the best course of action if bad guys surround you.\n\nI intentionally missed few interesting things, that will happen. I don't want to spoil everything, when the game turns 180.\n\nRestoring health is done in two different ways. Generally, half of it is regenerating and for the other half you have to find med packs. This is through the first 1/3 of the game, which I will continue to mention. After that you will restore it by collecting red orbs from dead enemies or finding them in hidden places or breaking the surroundings.\n\nWhen you are about to die, you get The Last Chance. Everything slows down to a crawl for a few seconds and you have manage to get away or die.\n\nThe level design through the 1/3 of the game are okay. Trenches, castles, dungeons, all standard stuff. But (there is a big but here) when you past that 1/3, the gets more interesting. Better and wider level design, better atmosphere. Gothic dungeons created from forgotten and vanished civilization, full with strange machines, electricity coming from tesla coils, dungeons filled with lava, strange railroad, leading to some uncharted and dark places, deep in the bowls of the earth. Here creativity of the developer shines. Great level desing!\n\nIn almost every level there are secrets to be found. Except the abovementioned vampire artefacts, there are also weapons, ammo, letters and golden chests to be found.\n\nThe sound here is not great. As I mentioned in the beginning some voice actors can barely heard and this is design flaw, because this is at certain places. The voice acting is good, but I don't like the main character voice and don't get me started with the one liners. They are not that good or original and you will hear them over and over again through the hole game. Music is almost absent. When is present it's good, but it's so rare to hear it. There is some ambient music and it's contribute for the atmoshpere, but it's not enough. The game needs more tracks and the music have to be played more often.\n\nEnemies are fairly diverse. I know i'm repeating my self, but during the first 1/3 of the game most of them will be germans and zombies and few bosses. Eventually and gradually, new enemies will apear. Masked people that shoot you, other that make some kung fu kicks, when you are closer to them, imps, dragons and other flying creatures, two types of ogres and so on. I don't know what type of creatures are all of them, so I make up their species to get you an idea to some degree how they look. I almost had no problems with all enemies, unless they surround me. The ogres gave me headache, because they are fast and do a lot of damage.\n\nAlmost everything I said until now is what I liked about the game. However, there are few things I don't like and I think it's worth to mention them. Non of them are game breaking. One of them is the AI, when you ressurect someone. It's dumb as brick, always falling behind, you have to walk slowly and babysite them. This makes the ressurection useless. You can also see flickering textures on buildings. As a whole the game is not a good looker. Sometimes I didn't know where to go, I was confused by the level design. Some times I can jump over a fence, others I can't. Not always was clear where to go, but this maybe my fault. There tiny little bugs, but naybe the biggest problem is the first 1/3 of the game. It's fun, but it's just okay. But after that everything gets better – level design, guns, abilities, atmoshpere, enemies, everything! I get it from storytelling point, but some players maybe be turn off by this. Be patient and you will granted with awesome moments. As a whole it's rough around the edges, but entertaing. The game reminds me of Return to Castle Wolfenstein and Painkiller, this is a good thing. It's not as polished as them, but you can always do worse. I had fun, so I recommend it.","July 16, 2015","true","13.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Later for it. Non-traditional ways for killing reminds of Bulletstorm, but here they are not that creative. Headshots with different weapons, kicking, melee and so on. When you manage to chain few combos, you gain Fury level, which in turns leads to, for the first few level, electricity coming from you and hitting enemies. For even higher level – incinerating them. For reaching maximum Fury, be on a lookout for hidden vampire artefacts. Each found increases one level. It's so satysfing to melee a group of bad guys and incinerate them.\n\nNecroVision is FPS. And what you do in this type of game? Shooting and blasting enemies. How is the shooting? It's good. Weapons have arcade feel to them. They don't have recoil, but they also don't have Quake-like accuracy. If enemies are far away , you have to burst, because crosshair widens and the gun become less acurate. Weapons in 1/3 of the game more or less represent the time period the game takes place. Two pistols, rifle, sniper, rocket launcher, shotgun, heavy and light machine gun. These weapons are used in abovementioned 1/3 of the game. After that the game takes hard turn and starts to get more interesting. You get Shadowhand, SMG, shotgun, rocket launcher, and flamethrower. One of them raises curiosity. It's Shadowhand. It's metal glove with Wolverine-like claws. You can use it for melee or cast spells – fireballs, iron rods and freezing. All are useful. Shadowhand have one one more ability – raising the dead. When Adrenalin is on it's maximum stand to nearby fallen enemie and ressurect him to help you fight.\n\nThere is more. You can dual-wield pistols and machine guns. You are less accurate, but in close range is so satisfying to mow enemies down. In your right hand you can equip a pistol and in your left you can put another pistol, bayonet, shovel, granade, dynamite and gas lamp for setting enemies on fire. With shovel and bayonet you can melee or throw them. I killed a lot of enemies that way. Almost every murder gives you adrenaline.\n\nThere is a sprint button. Except for fast movement, you can use it with combination from melee and a gun to knock down a group of enemies. This and kicking are the best course of action if bad guys surround you.\n\nI intentionally missed few interesting things, that will happen. I don't want to spoil everything, when the game turns 180.\n\nRestoring health is done in two different ways. Generally, half of it is regenerating and for the other half you have to find med packs. This is through the first 1/3 of the game, which I will continue to mention. After that you will restore it by collecting red orbs from dead enemies or finding them in hidden places or breaking the surroundings.\n\nWhen you are about to die, you get The Last Chance. Everything slows down to a crawl for a few seconds and you have manage to get away or die.\n\nThe level design through the 1/3 of the game are okay. Trenches, castles, dungeons, all standard stuff. But (there is a big but here) when you past that 1/3, the gets more interesting. Better and wider level design, better atmosphere. Gothic dungeons created from forgotten and vanished civilization, full with strange machines, electricity coming from tesla coils, dungeons filled with lava, strange railroad, leading to some uncharted and dark places, deep in the bowls of the earth. Here creativity of the developer shines. Great level desing!\n\nIn almost every level there are secrets to be found. Except the abovementioned vampire artefacts, there are also weapons, ammo, letters and golden chests to be found.\n\nThe sound here is not great. As I mentioned in the beginning some voice actors can barely heard and this is design flaw, because this is at certain places. The voice acting is good, but I don't like the main character voice and don't get me started with the one liners. They are not that good or original and you will hear them over and over again through the hole game. Music is almost absent. When is present it's good, but it's so rare to hear it. There is some ambient music and it's contribute for the atmoshpere, but it's not enough. The game needs more tracks and the music have to be played more often.\n\nEnemies are fairly diverse. I know i'm repeating my self, but during the first 1/3 of the game most of them will be germans and zombies and few bosses. Eventually and gradually, new enemies will apear. Masked people that shoot you, other that make some kung fu kicks, when you are closer to them, imps, dragons and other flying creatures, two types of ogres and so on. I don't know what type of creatures are all of them, so I make up their species to get you an idea to some degree how they look. I almost had no problems with all enemies, unless they surround me. The ogres gave me headache, because they are fast and do a lot of damage.\n\nAlmost everything I said until now is what I liked about the game. However, there are few things I don't like and I think it's worth to mention them. Non of them are game breaking. One of them is the AI, when you ressurect someone. It's dumb as brick, always falling behind, you have to walk slowly and babysite them. This makes the ressurection useless. You can also see flickering textures on buildings. As a whole the game is not a good looker. Sometimes I didn't know where to go, I was confused by the level design. Some times I can jump over a fence, others I can't. Not always was clear where to go, but this maybe my fault. There tiny little bugs, but naybe the biggest problem is the first 1/3 of the game. It's fun, but it's just okay. But after that everything gets better – level design, guns, abilities, atmoshpere, enemies, everything! I get it from storytelling point, but some players maybe be turn off by this. Be patient and you will granted with awesome moments. As a whole it's rough around the edges, but entertaing. The game reminds me of Return to Castle Wolfenstein and Painkiller, this is a good thing. It's not as polished as them, but you can always do worse. I had fun, so I recommend it.","July 16, 2015","true","13.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What I found  is they are not many and not too popular. Valiant Hearts and Verdun are most well known I think. There are few grand strategies, but i'm not in to them. The reason i started with this is NecroVision take place in WWI setting and this was the only thing I could think of to start the review.\n\nYou take the role of Simon Buckner, young american who join the British army to fight germans in 1916. After an ambush and the following fierce battle, everything for our hero turns upside down. Simon encounters supernatural phenomenon and realize that greater evil threatens to wipe humanity. To a certain degree it's the germans fault. They never learn not to play with fire. The story is not bad, it kept me interested through the whole game, but it's not memorable enough. You have to save Earth from germans, vampires, demons and whole other bunch of creatures. The good thig in the story is it takes to great locations.\n\nLet me take a step back and look at the the settings. Rebindable keys, HUD and crosshair opacity are few of the good things in here. But in sound is missing speech slider. In some places people speak so quietly, I can bearly hear them. Subtitles help to understand what are they saying, but they in some places are not displayed. In video options you can change a lot of things – textures for weapons, people, envoirment. Also you have render quality, dynamic shadows and so on. But even if everything is on max settings the games is not a good looker.\n\nThe dev try and succeed in putting enough mechanics in the gameplay to differentiate from other FPSs. Not all are entirly original. When you kill enemy in non-traditional style, you are rewarded with Adrenaline and Fury. Adrenaline is basically bullet-time and later is used for one more thing.

And what you do in this type of game? Shooting and blasting enemies. How is the shooting? It's good. Weapons have arcade feel to them. They don't have recoil, but they also don't have Quake-like accuracy. If enemies are far away , you have to burst, because crosshair widens and the gun become less acurate.

One of them raises curiosity. It's Shadowhand. It's metal glove with Wolverine-like claws. You can use it for melee or cast spells – fireballs, iron rods and freezing. All are useful. Shadowhand have one one more ability – raising the dead. When Adrenalin is on it's maximum stand to nearby fallen enemie and ressurect him to help you fight.\n\nThere is more. You can dual-wield pistols and machine guns. You are less accurate, but in close range is so satisfying to mow enemies down. In your right hand you can equip a pistol and in your left you can put another pistol, bayonet, shovel, granade, dynamite and gas lamp for setting enemies on fire. With shovel and bayonet you can melee or throw them. I killed a lot of enemies that way. Almost every murder gives you adrenaline.\n\nThere is a sprint button. Except for fast movement, you can use it with combination from melee and a gun to knock down a group of enemies. This and kicking are the best course of action if bad guys surround you.\n\nI intentionally missed few interesting things, that will happen. I don't want to spoil everything, when the game turns 180.\n\nRestoring health is done in two different ways. Generally, half of it is regenerating and for the other half you have to find med packs. This is through the first 1/3 of the game, which I will continue to mention. After that you will restore it by collecting red orbs from dead enemies or finding them in hidden places or breaking the surroundings.\n\nWhen you are about to die, you get The Last Chance. Everything slows down to a crawl for a few seconds and you have manage to get away or die.\n\nThe level design through the 1/3 of the game are okay. Trenches, castles, dungeons, all standard stuff. But (there is a big but here) when you past that 1/3, the gets more interesting. Better and wider level design, better atmosphere. Gothic dungeons created from forgotten and vanished civilization, full with strange machines, electricity coming from tesla coils, dungeons filled with lava, strange railroad, leading to some uncharted and dark places, deep in the bowls of the earth. Here creativity of the developer shines. Great level desing!\n\nIn almost every level there are secrets to be found. Except the abovementioned vampire artefacts, there are also weapons, ammo, letters and golden chests to be found.\n\nThe sound here is not great. As I mentioned in the beginning some voice actors can barely heard and this is design flaw, because this is at certain places. The voice acting is good, but I don't like the main character voice and don't get me started with the one liners.

As a whole the game is not a good looker. Sometimes I didn't know where to go, I was confused by the level design. Some times I can jump over a fence, others I can't. Not always was clear where to go, but this maybe my fault. There tiny little bugs, but naybe the biggest problem is the first 1/3 of the game. It's fun, but it's just okay. But after that everything gets better – level design, guns, abilities, atmoshpere, enemies, everything! I get it from storytelling point, but some players maybe be turn off by this. Be patient and you will granted with awesome moments. As a whole it's rough around the edges, but entertaing. The game reminds me of Return to Castle Wolfenstein and Painkiller, this is a good thing. It's not as polished as them, but you can always do worse. I had fun, so I recommend it.","July 16, 2015","true","13.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Do you like Wolfenstein? Then you'll like this game. Would have liked to see some more of it take place fighting in the trenches but that game if fun, and it's $4, so why not? If you like old school FPS then treat yourself, it's an awesome experiance.","May 31","true","12.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
