I’ve been playing it for years on iOS, and the PC version is even more beautiful.\n\nQuell is an amazingly designed and polished puzzle game that starts with a very simple premise. You control a drop of water, and you must move the drop around to collect all of the Pearls in each level, except once you move the drop, it does not stop until it hits a wall. These basic gameplay mechanics make for some very well designed and challenging levels. The game then slowly adds more rules and mechanics to add to the challenge.\n\nThis is a game that is definitely worth it any price tag, and I would recommend you pick it up today. Even if you’re not normally into puzzle games, you may be surprised how much you will enjoy Quell.\nFrom its artwork, to its music, to the pure level of polish this game has, it is by far one of the best puzzle games available.\n\nIf you’ve played Quell and liked it, check out the two sequel games: Quell Reflect, and Quell Memento, which add even more new mechanics and put a fun twist on an already awesome game.\n","May 14, 2015","true","3.2"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","14","15","0","1"

I've seen other similar games but with just basic graphics that are blah.  This game is what a puzzle game should be:  a complete package of good gameplay, graphics and music.  There's no story, but I don't expect that from a puzzle game.\n\nHow to Play:\n\nUse your mouse or the arrow keys to move a blue sphere through a maze to collect all the pearls.  Once you choose a direction the sphere keep going until it bumps into something.  Avoid spikes (obviously!), use warp rings (look like sonic rings) and you can even move off the screen and appear at the opposite side!  Though sometimes that leads to endless loop if there is nothing to bump against.\n\nMusic:\n\nSoft, peaceful background music that does not intrude on your thought but is just nicely in the background.  Perfect for this game.\n\nGraphics:\n\nYou are in a quaint house with lots of brown, beige and neutral colors.  The level select is a bookcase.  When you go to play a level it goes to the window.   I'm very impressed with how much these little details add to the game to make it complete.  It's not "just" a puzzle game, it's a peaceful experience.\n\nThere is no timer (yay!).  You can take as many moves as you like to finish a level, but they do say what the least amount of moves is for each level and you can replay to try for that goal.\n\nThere are achievements for those who like to collect 100%.  I have not finished the game, so I can't tell you if they are all easy to get or some really difficult.  I'll have to update this reveiw once I know for sure.\n\ntl:dr version:\n\nMove ball through maze to collect objects in the least number of moves\nPeaceful music\nQuaint setting\nNo timer\nAchievements","January 2","true","1.4"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","4"

It is an abstract puzzle with sequential-movement solutions, on a grid, which only allows sliding movements. You have to collect all of the 'pearls' in a level to proceed to the next and it challenges you to do it in as few movements as possible. It features mechanics such as matching push blocks, hazardous spikes and levers to rotate them, appearing blocks, which trigger when passed over, teleportation, off-grid movements, hidden jewels collecting. It also comes with background music and although it's only a single continuous loop it works wondrously with the combination of other game sounds to create a relaxing atmosphere. It features a reward system for your correct solutions and any hidden gems that you find throughout the game, which you can then use for hints on more difficult levels.\n\nOverall, it's a casual game, but still offers a modest challenge and lots of fun elements!\n\n","December 2, 2015","true","3.6"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","2"

Everything can be finished by learning from your mistakes (the U and R keys are your friends); I didn't have to use hints until the last few levels.

Go and buy it NOW!!!\n\nNot yet convinced? Ok, the game has simple rules: slide a drop of water around on a window collecting pearls and avoiding spikes. Sounds simple, right?

There are\n84 campaign puzzles,\n4 secret extra puzzles, and\n84 jewels to find.There is one jewel cleverly hidden in each one of the puzzle grids which adds a nice mind-teasing bonus to the game.\n\nIt took me around 10 hours to play through the whole game and unlock everything. My advice: buy the title in the Quell Bundle together with Quell Reflect and Quell Memento. Each of these two clones adds simple, yet surprisingly rich new mechanics to the game making it even more fun to play.\n\nSo again: if you're are logical puzzle lover GO AND BUY IT NOW!!! :D","April 18","true","9.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
