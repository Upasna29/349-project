Pluses: the art style is adorable, each run is short - success or failure - so it's easy to play in between other things, and the controls are responsive. Minuses: some obstacles are very hard to see, or don't come on screen until you've already committed to a jump to catch more kitties; lack of achievements and leader boards limits the motivation to try and do better. Unless you're into that weird "personal improvement" nonsense.\nIn short: more features would be nice, but for the price it's an easy recommendation.","March 27, 2015","true","2.4"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","16","18","2","0"

The concept is cute, the sound effects and texts are all nice, and the "idea" of the gameplay would be fine. However, the camera is sickeningly bad (it jerks around like nobody's business and doesn't show the important upcoming stuff). The menus are also poor, meaning you'll spend a lot of time waiting in them and clicking through them to get back to the core part of this game: the cute meow sound of picking up kittens.\n\nAt a push, you might get this as a novelty gift for a cat loving friend, but it really needs some fixing-up before it's playable for any length of time.\n\n(note on playtime: I played this before on Desura because  come on saving cats is an awesome concept.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/270810/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","This game was reviewed using a code sent by the developer.\nPutting kittens into any game is going to instantly get you bonus points, but putting hundreds and hundreds of them into a game is basically a winning combination. Jones on Fire puts you in the shoes of a firefighter saving kittens from the burning blaze throughout a forest.\n\nThe gameplay itself is very simple. All you need is one button, the up key. Jones is constantly moving and you cannot stop, you must jump and slide under burning objects, if you miss the jump, the wall of fire catches up to you for a bit until you can gain some ground on it.\n\nAfter each run through, you get the chance to spend your money, which is in turn granted by how many kittens you save. The rewards consist of straight upgrades, or one time abilities, such as cat nip, which basically attracts all the kittens to you without having to move to collect them.\n\nEach run you get three lives, at the end of the three lives you have to start again, but you don't lose all of your rewards and upgrades, these are carried over. This makes it feel like every run you are improving your character in some way.\n\nThis game does the simplicity very well, there looks to be some more content on the way looking at the reward screen as there are two more sections with "Coming Soon" showing, so it will be interesting to see what else is added.\n\nI can definitely recommend Jones on Fire for the price that is currently set at (£1,99), I have only played for half an hour and I can see myself jumping in again to save a couple hundred more kitties!\n","April 19, 2015","true","0.5"," 28 of 47 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","28","47","2","0"

The problem isn't the fact that it goes fast (i like fast games), the problem is that it isn't involving skill, it's involving impossibility. You HAVE to jump to pass the wall, and if you jump, you stub yourself into the logs behind, you can't reach the ground to slide under it, so the level can't be completed unless you are lucky with the layout.\n\nAnd the game hasn't much to offer, it's just always the same scenery, and an horrible uninspired grind (it takes hours in order to be able to buy an uninspired upgrade)\n\nThere are so many better endless runners, free and paying, I can't find the appeal of this one.","October 18, 2015","false","4.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

There's only 3 obstacles ffs, 2 you jump over and 1 you slide (or jump) over, meaning you can play the entire game with just the Up key, which is, well.. boring.

Gets challenging rather quickly, but gets repetitive just as quick. The upgrades and golden kittens just take that long to get and you don't feel like there is much of a goal other than getting to a higher "hazard level". Ultimately, It sucks that you need so many golden kitties for higher level temporary boosts (or permanent abilities) so that you can have a proper run - on one level at a time (because the boost wears off after 1 level).\n\nThe game often asks you to tweet score for small daily bonuses and each time you press "tweet" it opens a new tab in your browser. I really don't like that. I'd rather get the bonus somehow else.\n\nEdit: Also, occassionally on higher difficulty levels, your mid-air slides (or even running and falling from top of a obstacle) tend to go too far because there are a lot of obstacles... this can be frustrating and kind of make it really hard to get into hazard 10+\n\n----------------\n\nIt's still a fun experience and I recommend giving it a try.\n\n8/!0","May 15, 2015","true","2.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

It's got tight gameplay and controls, a unique (and uniquely suiting) visual aesthetic, and a nice dose of humor and cuteness to boot.\n\nWhat really makes the game great though, in my humble opinion, is that it essentially hooks you the with the same basic idea of all of the classic OG arcade games -- the game is simple enough for anyone to pick up and play, is easy to grasp, and yet... is VERY hard to play PERFECTLY.  And each time you cause poor lil Jones to be singed nearly to death, you shake your head and SWEAR you won't do that same dumb mistake next time.  I literally think anyone from kids just young enough to hold a controller or use a keyboard, to 31-year-old men (yours truly) and beyond, could enjoy this game equally fully.\n\nSaving cats from fires is so freakin' addictive!

So you see a kitty hanging there? You jump to save him/her and come down. Oh no! There was a log! In this game you NEED to pay attention to where you are going and where you will land when jumping.\n\nOn the gameplay side of things it's simplistic, but has that old style level runner that a lot of us grew up with as kids. Controls are simble, jump, slide, etc. Doesn't take long to learn them. Especially if you complete the tutorial in the beginning. (I recommend this) You start at hazard level 1, 2hp (Or times you can land in fire or smash into something) before you lose a life. Not to worry! You start with 3, and they appear to regen over time provided you clear a level. When the counter reaches 0, well I'm sure you can guess what happens! It is however a bit hardcore afterward as you drop back to level 1. However, unlike most games that drop you back, you retain all your perks and or upgrades you had purchased previously. This is nice, and certainly helps you continue to climb higher and higher each time you go through runs. Your only objective is simple! You run out there and rescue kitties! And depending how many you rescue, you got it! Determines your over all score for the level and how many points you earn to spend at the actual upgrade stations.\n\n\nArt style wise it's cute. It's not overly complex, but it doesn't look terrible either. I recommend playing the game to find out! (Music is pretty fun as well but gets slightly repetitive. Thats my personal opinion however!)\n\nAll in all I will give this game a 7/10, it did put a smile on my face and I will recommend it to friends and others looking for a decent level runner style of game!","July 29, 2015","true","0.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Or just even compare to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Flappy Bird. It may look like I'm just comparing only somewhat similar games, but what they all have in common is that certain types of feeling you experience while playing the game.\nThis game seemed to be suited for people who like classic, or even just small-looking Phone games. [Specifically to people who fall for cute kitties!]\nPros:\nFun, time-waster.\nGets more challenging as one progresses, so it doesn't get bland quickly\nKitties! Lots and lots of Kitties for you!\nIt also appeals to your Pathological emotion, when you lose all of those lives, not being able to save those kitties ahead, you always got infinite second chances, no matter how much you have to walk on flaming logs and slide through flames!\n[* Powerups!]\n\nCons:\nI had this on a seperate account, and I remember that:\nThe only problem I had with this game was 'shortness', this game just needed a few game modes, I mean, once you get all the power ups, [takes a while] and also all the other items, thats where it actually seems to get bland at, because there isn't much to do after that.","October 30, 2015","true","1.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Whenever you ran out of lives then you have to spend Gold K.\nIf you can't spend golden K to buy lives again. Then you will start all the way back to level 1 again.\nUpgrades and challenges will NOT be lost whenever you are restarting back to level 1.\nYou can recover a health bar by outrunning the fire wall.\nGame is very easy to understand and to pickup.\nThe Parkour will be changed whenever you have died on the level.\n\nOther things.\nJones is a girl...\nMew :3\n\n\n-------------------\n\nI Give this game a 7/10\n","March 4","true","4.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
