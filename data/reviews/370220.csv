Each dungeon provides you with a singular mechanic to play with; the Snake dungeon gives you a sword, the Spider dungeon gives you a bow, and the Lion dungeon gives you a 'flame cloak' that will teleport you forward a short distance. Sadly, you can't use these elements together up until the very end.\n\nThe enemies are merely boxes; the story suggests they are more, but it doesn't come through in the gameplay. Additionally, the gameplay is quite tedious when trying to overcome the enemy obstacles; you'll find yourself standing slightly away from a box's path to slash at them with the sword, or waiting for the appropriate time to shoot your bow, and you never have to deviate your strategy.\n\nWithin the Lion dungeon, you're required to use the cloak to teleport past poison rivers. The cloak will send you a fixed distance away, but there is no indicator of how far you're going to go, and since there's free movement, you'll often just have to eyeball the distance and trial-and-error your way through.\n\nAnimal Gods' story is interesting, but lacking; it raises lots of questions about the world, the Animal Gods, and a few characters mentioned within the various diary entries and logbooks, but provides no closure or answers. It feels unfinished and unpolished.\n\nOne example of this is a pair of buildings in the overworld with half-hearts on each one. It suggests that you should be able to push them together somehow to complete the heart, but you can't.\n\nThe bosses are little more than glorified mazes to walk through, defeating the same enemies as you defeated before them, and progressing to checkpoints. The final boss is no exception, albeit slightly longer. The game clocks in at around 2 hours, which surprised me - the logs gave some backstory and then, all of a sudden, I was at the credits screen with more questions than answers.\n\nAnimal Gods is a pretty game, but not a fun one. It's not worth your time or money, even on sale.\n\nFor a more in depth review, check here; http://www.cybershack.com.au/review/game-review-animal-gods-barking-up-the-wrong-tree131015-3","October 13, 2015","false","2.4"," 42 of 47 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","42","47","0","0"

The art style is pretty good and the story could be interesting but the game play drags down the game in my opinion. The controls work fine but the mechanics just aren't that interesting. The dash ability is fun for a while but I was kind of bored with it by the end of the "dungeon". The combat in the game is pretty dull since all you have to do is find a safe spot close enough to the enemies to be able to strike them without being hit since the enemies won't chase you.\n\nIf you like games that mostly focus on the art style and story I think you could enjoy Animal Gods quite a bit. If the game play is most important to you though, I would at least wait for a sale to purchase Animal Gods.\n\nNote: I received a free review copy from the developer.\n\nRead My Full Review [www.geekyhobbies.com]\n","October 16, 2015","false","1.0"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

My first impression was that it would be an art piece with the mechanics of the genre done well enough that one can focus on the visual emersion. However the lair of the Snake god which was the first dungeon piece I took part in, was filled with dull unrewarding gameplay that focused quite entirely on the subliminal story driven religious message. which might have worked had I been doing anything other than hitting boxes with a stick then restarting a section if I touched a box. Moving on only when all the boxes had been sufficiently hit. which makes it sound way more interesting than it actually was. The music which was immedidiately striking was set on loop for my entirity of my play time such that I truly had no motivation to keep hitting boxes.\nMaybe it gets better, I'll hope for the best.\n","October 12, 2015","false","0.4"," 16 of 26 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","16","26","0","0"

After 3 of these dungeons, you're granted access to the final dungeon, which allows you to use your previously gained abilities for the final stretch to game completion.\n\nAnd unfortunately, that is the entirety of the game in a nutshell. It's got a fantastic ambience to it, and is aesthetically pleasing, but ultimately is just... not very fun. I feel like there are some great concepts in progress here, but they're... incomplete.

A fully illustrated, nonlinear Zelda-esque game. The art style and music just work together in perfect harmony\nDeveloper: Still Games\nPublisher: Still Games\nRelease Date: October 12, 2015\n\nIf I had to describe Animal Gods in one sentence it’d be: Zelda-esque Puzzle-Plattformer.\nThe game’s no action adventure per se. You rarely find yourself in battle, actually you never do, and it’s truly a Puzzle-Plattformer with a rather strong The Legend of Zelda vibe.\n\nStoryGoing into the story would be a huge spoiler to be honest so let me refer to the store page:\nThe Animal Gods have fallen. Once sacred, they are now husks—haunted beasts lost to toxic fumes from a great bronze industry. Play as Thistle, a small & agile hunter hellbent on destroying the curse that plagues these creatures. Wield a 17th century BC Bronze Sword... and set the Gods free.\nDuring your playthrough you’ll find diaries of certain people but the one you read the most about is Juliette. The story will unfold before you if you’re able to find all of her and the others diaries.\nLet me just say that I had a really big WTF moment once I fully knew what this game is all about and what the One God truly is.\n\nGameplayFirst things first. No hand holding. By that I mean Animal God takes place in a nonlinear world. You can decide whether you’re going to free this or this god first. The choice is yours. Or you can just freely explore the world and just be left in awe at how beautiful it looks.\nThe game works without any major issues. As I said earlier you find yourself never in battle, in fact the only time you’re able to actually “fight” is when you’re on your way to free a certain god like the snake god for example. Once you enter the realm of it you’ll gain the ability to use a sword. And only in this specific area and, of course, towards the end during your final boss battle. The same goes for the bow which you’ll find in the realm of the spider god. And of course for your dash ability.\nThose are your weapons. A sword and a bow. I have to say that the bow doesn’t require any arrows or ammunition of any kind so feel free to spam those.\nThe lion god on the other hand gives you the ability to dash. Personally I found his to be the most difficult area since it’s really just all about plattforming and precise dashes. You’ll find streams of poisonous water that you’ll have to dash through else you’ll die and respawn at your last checkpoint. One hit and you’re dead. No questions asked. As for every plattformer it can get quite a bit frustrating and it’ll take some time to find out how far you can dash and so on but you’ll quickly get the hang of it.\nEvery ability comes with an upgrade. The sword, by holding the corresponding button for it and then releasing it, will deal more damage with one hit. The bow will pierce through enemies and those pesky floating little cages. The upgrade for the dash ability is well just to be able to dash longer.\nThat’s pretty much all there is in the game and it still manages to be quite a good game.\nTo recap: One hit and you’re dead and respawn on your last checkpoint. Sword? Check. Bow? Check. A dash? Check.\nThe game does give you all the tools you need and it’s up to you to make good use of it.\n\nOnce you’ve beaten the game in normal mode you’ll unlock Lives-09-Mode. In this mode you have to beat the game with 09 lives or less and … good luck with that. You’re going to need it if you decide to tackle this mode.\n\n\nVisualsThe meat and bone of Animal Gods.\nIt looks incredibly beautiful. At time the game just looks gorgeus and calm like nothing bad could or has ever happened. I’ve found myself just mindlessly running around and literally just explore the world and it’s beauty. Then there are times where you just feel something’s odd and something bad’s about to happen or rather has happened already.\nThe beauty of the game is that every area looks different and unique. I feel like I can hardly to the game justice by describing the amazing artwork that’s been used for it. I mean it’s a fully illustrated game so needless to say that a lot of love, detail and work has gone into it.\nThe game is truly just good looking.\nI really dig the art style and personally I would love to see more like this in the future.\n\nAudioThe music and the sound effects are one of the strongest selling points for this game.\nI mean the art style is, as I said earlier, truly the meat and bone of this game but the actual audio used in Animal Gods is nearly on par. To be quite honest I’d even go as far as to say that they work together in harmony. When I was just watching the trailer I felt that the music gives the game something unique, I want to even say something holy … As crazy as that might sound.\nI’ve found myself enjoying every track and I have to say that the OST is overall calming and relaxing but at the same time it’s demanding and yes even nearly dangerous. That’s the actual beauty of the music and effects used. The rain sounds are one of my favorites but I have to say that the sounds of the waves come really close. They’re subtle but at the same time you find yourself paying attention to them.\nI’m fairly pleased with the overall soundtrack and I have to say that it fits the game.\nMy favorite track of the OST is by far Thistle and the Sky.\nIt’s calming, relaxing but at the same time it does sound rather sad and melancholic. I really have found myself enjoying this track the most.\nOverall there’s something spiritual in the music or … something holy that just works so well with the game.\n\nWhat else can I say?I have been lucky enough to get a Review Key for Animal Gods in order to write a blunt and honest to God Review. Just as usual.\n\nAnimal God is a solid game. I haven’t found any particular points that bugged me besides maybe the game time. According to team I’ve finished this game in 3.4 hours. But then again I feel like that’s not that bad considering it’s been developed by a two man, well by a team consisting of a man and a woman. So you see there’s not that much manpower behind it and if you take that into consideration then I’d say that the game’s just as good as it could be.\nWell I might have loved to maybe see a bigger world. The game’s tagged as Open World and while it’s true it’s not really. I mean it is but you don’t get this open world feeling since it’s rather small. However I do believe that a bigger world wouldn’t have done the game any good.\nWhat I’m trying to say might just be that I’d love to see another game from Still Games with the same art style and approach but just bigger in the future. It’d be really awesome to have a big, if not huge world in this art style to explore at your own pace.\nPeople that look at games as a form of art will truly appreciate Animal Gods and I can really recommend it, despite it’s rather short playtime.\n\nNo drama, Just Reviews.\n\n- Neku","October 12, 2015","true","3.4"," 20 of 37 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","20","37","0","0"

It's a little artistic, and some may find it pretensious. It suffers from the comparisons that have been made to the zelda series - including from the creators. I found the art, sounds, and light story elements to be engrossing, and the gameplay to be perfectly tuned in challenge given the small amount of game there actually is. I was pushed to near the breaking point a few times (why can't I warp through this laser section!) but never past it; and neither did I feel it was too easy and I was wasting my time. But make no mistake, each "dungeon" has a very linear path with very little exploration to be had.\n\nI've seen complaints about the dungeons giving you abilities and then taking them away. I actually thought it was interesting and focused having each dungeon only allow a single ability, and makes the most out of what you can do with that ability. You only do ONE thing, but the challenge level is very fluid.  They are more skill-based than puzzle-based. There definitely is a lack of variation in gameplay.\n\nThe story is a little too light, and told in a disjointed style that makes it unclear what it is even about. It's more of a mood piece. I liked the mood, and if you are into the sort of writing where you have to fill in the blanks yourself to take whatever meaning you can take, you may like it. I found the writing probably the weakest part of the game.\n\nThe standout here is the art. It's a very different style, that plays with shapes, lines, layers, and negative space. Nearly every scene has standout elements that are not seen anywhere else in the game. If this doesn't interest you your experience with the game will be diminished. On the other hand, if those artistic merits do interest you, it's probably worth a playthrough for that alone.\n\nDisclaimer: I was a kickstarter backer. I found the game to be... quite different from what I expected.","October 24, 2015","true","2.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

There are no items to find, nor is there any kind of leveling up.\n\nWhile the story tries to come off as epic, it is very watered down and unimpactful. You find out nearly the entire story through diary entries, and the only living character in the entire game is Thistle. You also never really find out much about Thistle, so it's kind of impossible to develop any feelings for this hero or the world around her. When you finally do get to interact with the gods, it is a very superficial meeting that adds nothing to the overall story or enjoyment of the game.\n\nIt's weird.

As I bash each of their blue shells into finely ground mush I notice their sad looking eyeballs follow me around the room and reflect on my earlier encounters with the creatures in the game. There's a good deal of evidence given throughout the game in the form of dialogue and diaries that they're sapient and intelligent, and at one point were the ancient human villagers who once populated the entire area. After much effort I finally reach the final stretch, a series of fast moving enemy spawns with narrow walkways taking place on the back of the snake god itself.\n\nLooking at how spread apart the enemies are, I suddenly realize that I can run through this entire gauntlet without killing a single enemy. Some parts are tricky, but with proper timing I manage to zip past each obstacle. None of the enemies make any attempt to hunt me down, many of the bigger ones near the end aren't even moving and I have plenty of space to simply walk around them. Why am I supposed to be attacking them again, when they aren't even a threat? Maybe if I continue to avoid them, the game will recognize that I'm trying to show some mercy on these people, I think. Maybe the snake god will comment on my deliberate willingness to make the game more difficult in an attempt to be more than just some single minded killing machine.\n\nBut no, nothing happens, the only way you can finish the dungeon is to (once again) kill enough of the Husks near the end to trigger the exit warp.\n\nWhy do scenarios like this bother me? Maybe I've been playing too much Undertale lately, or maybe I've just grown into too much of a cynic to blindly accept typical RPG tropes- but a game that requires you to massacre living, sentient creatures as an arbitrary ritual to progress from one hallway to the next is not something that I can consider morally intelligent. I end up feeling like Thistle is really not any better of a person than the supposedly evil unseen antagonist. It would be somewhat acceptable to me if the game made an attempt to present Thistle as anything but a morally pure priestess, but it doesn't, which pretty much tears down the central theme of the game (the ends do not always justify the means).\n\nAnyways, for everything else I like (the laser jumping puzzles are fun and the controls are good) and dislike (the game is way too short and predictable), this experience sticks out to me the most. I don't feel like I can rightly recommend this when it killed any semblance of immersion to me.","October 12, 2015","false","2.7"," 10 of 22 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","10","22","0","1"

Something more like a Zelda type game, and this didn't turn out to feel that way to me.\n\nSoon after I loaded it up, I found that movement was sluggish and slow, there was no real guidance on where to go and nothing stood out to me for a while as a clear sign of where I could go, until I found what looked like a cave entrance and entered. I was inside the Snake dungeon then and found a sword. With that sword, I was given the task of fighting blocks that moved around, and any time one of them hit me I was sent back to the last checkpoint spot.\n\nIt wasn't inspiring gameplay. Maybe if I had picked a different way to go I would have found a more appealing path to proceed. I ended up getting stuck in the Snake dungeon and wasn't sure how to proceed after a while.\n\nBy this point, I wasn't enthusiastic about trying to backtrack and try a different path. I was barely into the game and I had already lost interest.\n\nWhile the graphics were pretty and the sound turned out pretty good too, once I listened to it, I found the gameplay didn't appeal to me, and I couldn't get past that.","October 14, 2015","false","0.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Once sacred, they are now husks—haunted beasts lost to toxic fumes from a great bronze industry. Play as Thistle, a small & agile hunter hellbent on destroying the curse that plagues these creatures. Wield a 17th century BC Bronze Sword... and set the Gods free.\nThis is going to be a negative review simply because there isn’t a middle ground, as I believe this game had or has A LOT of potential, but it’s negatives were numerous and nearly made me want to stop playing.\n**To be fair as well, I’m only going to be giving superficial spoilers, as to not ruin the experience for those who might want to play.**\n\nFor the most part the game itself is gorgeous, whether it’s the music or the environment, it nearly dumb-struck me on the intro screen because of how calming and clear the sounds were. As you move throughout the game, you seem very small compared to the old buildings and shrines that are scattered about in the once-holy area, and a feeling of awe overtook me the first time I walked down the paths.\nThis is where my trouble began. It’s not that Thistle is slow, but there’s no sprint mechanic and the environments are large, so it’s a little bit of walking through the same environments to get to newer areas, with no way to speed it up. That wouldn’t be so bad, but the adventurer in me who adored the soundtrack of the game was replaced by a drowsy old man hobbling through similar environments. What I’m trying to say is, it’s all very pretty and lovely, but it nearly put me to sleep walking through over and over.\nWhat I do love is that the game rewards you for exploring, developing the story of side characters and details about the degradation of the Gods themselves through notes and diary entries that are scattered throughout the world.\nFor those loving weapons or fighting baddies…well, you’re going to be disappointed. The only two weapons are the sword and bow, and you can only use them in certain areas…fighting…boxes? I honestly don’t know what those annoying things are, but they present an obstacle that simply can be destroyed and moved on from. This includes the “bosses” or what should be more aptly named the “large mazes that are nearly like the rest of the game’s puzzles but just a little harder”. But I guess the latter was too long.\nUnfortunately, Animal Gods is a lovely looking and sounding indie, but not so much fun once you progress in. I’ve been throughout 80% of the game and about to finish at the two-and-a-half-hour mark. At $10.00 USD normal pricing, I would say to take your 17th century bronze sword and swing away from Animal Gods.\n\nTL;DR\nIf you get it on a big sale? Maybe. At full price? No.","October 14, 2015","false","2.5"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

It's a very solid little game that perhaps makes you think a little, and has graphics and sound to die for,\n\nThe Good Stuff:\n- The graphic design is magical.  By keeping it crisp and clean, with a unified art-deco style, it gets away with not being especially state-of-the-art.\n- The music is equally magical.  Normally I mute sound very quickly, but this game contains a variety of musical themes that are very evocative.  (It's very reminiscent of Zelda games, which meant to be high praise.)\n- The game is designed to be played twice.  Once with no penalties for "dying", the second with a limited number of lives but, of course, you've learned some things from your first time through.  This is very clever, and the game is, as noted, quite short, so revisiting it in this way works very well.  (I know it's not a new idea, but it feels qualitatively different to the traditional "extreme" mode that many games unlock upon completition.)  As someone who isn't a twitch gamer, I felt challenged but not overly frustrated and was really happy that I could play the game to the end without artificial limitations - something that other games could learn from, perhaps.\n- I haven't played many games that are top-down platformers.  (It sounds like a contradiction in terms, but it's the best I can do.)  This makes for an unusual experience There is definitely a reward in patience: learning the patterns is very possible and the game rarely bounces you into a position where split-second timing is the only way through - I think there may be a couple of cases, but I may have missed the "safe" routes.\n\nThe Bad:\n- I don't really want to call the story "bad" because it isn't.  But the non-linear way they have chosen to tell it, combined with the weird approach of stamping text onto some of the levels themselves, really does not help.  (And I speak as someone who loves non-linear storytelling.)\n- There are some levels where the checkpoints are simply annoying.  I understand why, and I don't really hold it against the design, but it's worth noting.\n- The zooming in and out effect is very distracting, and detracts from the appreciation of the style at times.\n- There is a distinct lack of clarity in explaining how the different powers work, and where they work.  And there are some choices in the level design that feel as though they are there to frustrate rather than be a challenge (like the double "jumping" sequences.)\n\nGiven that these complaints are pretty trivial, it's easy to see that I rate this game.  No, it's not a masterpiece, destined to appear in GotY lists, but it's far better than average.","November 19, 2015","true","25.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game play is a tedious and unrewarding slog with no heart. I was expecting a Zelda-like experience, as promised, but this is not Zelda or even Zelda-like except in the broadest possible interpretation; it might have worked better as a point-and-click puzzle adventure, or a JRPG, than a sort-of-maybe-kind-of "platformer". I truly wish the game had turned out better given I helped KickStart it. If you can steel yourself enough to put up with the game play, the art is indeed stunning, and the music is beautiful (if repetitive)--with these the developers met and exceeded expectations.","May 1","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No fights, small puzzles, weird ambiance, lovely short soundtrack and a distinctive art style that almost seems to work by accident. The game's short and doesn't have too much time to get dull. Could use a graphical retouch here and there, because you can see a lot of hasty stitches. Could use the removal of most flavour text, because as prose it's awful.\n\nAll in all, probably not worth that full price, but I don't regret picking it up on discount.","January 14","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
