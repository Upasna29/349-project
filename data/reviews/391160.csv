"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheIronicGamer/recommended/391160/","TheIronicGamer","TheIronicGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheIronicGamer/","1545 products in account","At first glance this game might not look like much but if you look past the graphics then behind it is a very unique and fun puzzle platformer.\n\nWhat really makes the deletion great is it's very unique level design. Each level has it's own unique design premise. Some are just standard platforming but then others have a unique attribute to them that make them even funner. These include things like jetpacks, hidden platforms or enemies that moves when you do and many more. This means you have to attack levels in different ways and the gameplay never gets boring.\n\nThe platforming itself is solid. Very fluid jump motions that feel right. Movement feels good. Nothing really to compain about. Hit detection in terms of obstacles is right and is never off at any point.\n\nThe time to complete the game is relatively small though. It has 40 levels and it took me around 90 minutes to complete. I think this is a little to short personally and would have liked a lot more content.\n\nThe deletion has some great music to go along with it. A large selection of dance tracks definitely adds to the platform experience.\n\nMy biggest complaint is clearly the graphics. Very little effort has been put into them and there just way to simple. At first looks it looks like it should belong on a flash game site. But really this is only a minor problem because the gameplay itself is great. I do feel like the game is going to loose out on a lot of sales because of this factor.\n\nThe other small complaint I have is the lack of any kind of leaderboard. One good addition to give replayability would be a timing system. You could be timed on how quickly you complete the level. It would give people a lot of motivation to keep playing and try and beat there own record as well as there friends records. There could also be some kind of other scoring system introduced.\n\nSo overall I did really love the deletion. It has some very interesting unique platforming that I thoroughly enjoyed. I think ultimately if you can manage to look past the overly simple graphics you will find behind it a great enjoyable platformer. For the small price of £1.59 the lack of content no longer seems like a big problem either.\n\n\nTheIronicGamers rating system\nDon't ever buy this game.\nMaybe consider it on a sale.\nAn average game.\nA good game that should definitely be considered.\nA must play!\nFor more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's group curations here!","March 20","true","4.8"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/391160/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Here is yet another minimalist puzzle-platformer. Steam has been absolutely flooded with them. It’s because they’re relatively simple to make. But the thing that really bares repeating – and I’m certain that I’ve already said it in summaries about other games – while a game may be simple to make the better they are the generally more time consuming they are to make. Russpuppy have nailed the brief with The Deletion. Simple to make, hard effort to perfect and a great gem of a game that I wish more people would play.\n\nSimple everything. Graphics, sound, game design, etc. Only one thing is complex. The strategy required to defeat some of the levels. Great thing. Addictive too. Everything works entirely as it should. It makes playing the game an enjoyable and arguably addictive experience. Tight controls. It’s cheap enough that most can buy it yet it’s worth the price. Biggest in game negative is the sound. I swear my Commodore 64 had better sound. But you don’t play these games for the sound. You play them for the sense of achievement and satisfaction completing levels and the game gives you.\n\nARGH! Another game that should have Steam achievements that just does not have them. Frustrating. Annoying. Where is my sense of achievement that I can boast to Steam friend number 97 about how I was able to defeat X level to earn Y achievement and he cannot or at least will not. Why can I not feel as though I need to beat the game to unlock the final achievement and have finally beaten the challenge that your game has offered? This… This is the only negative. I cannot escape The Deletion until I have that sense of satisfaction.\n\nSeriously, a great puzzle game that made my mind work in tangents as I avoid the dreaded red bars, squares and other traps to beat the game. I still want my achievements, damn you!\n\nFor more reviews similar to this one and our daily giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/","January 11","true","7.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It also depends on your motivation to complete a game with no achievements.
