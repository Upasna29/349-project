The groundwork is solid; at the moment, it's an enjoyable zombie defense title based on Romero's seminal 1968 movie in which you repel the undead menace from a two storey house by way of various weapons and traps. You begin in the reasonable 7 minute mode before heading into bumpier territory with th 12 and 14 minute challenges, unlocking multiple bonus weapons and gameplay variables as you go.\nThe controls need tweaking. The mapping is fine and feels comfortable but command areas for certain item pick-ups and especially the stairs are a little too small to comfortably use in the middle of a zombie panic. Dev also needs a fullscreen fix as soon as possible as the text is a nightmare to read in the tiny windowed mode that Survivor boots in.\nEasy thumbs up at this stage though. Plenty of potential.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SvXO-W3KoE","October 6, 2015","true","0.9"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","77","17","22","4","1"

Basically this game consists of finding weapons/supplies or keys to unlock more weapons and supplies. Certain weapons are best suited for crowd control or single target and managing use of your resources carefully is crucial to beating the game. After beating the 7 minute mode, you unlock upgrades to your ammo capacity + small health and running meter upgrades which seem essential for surviving the longer modes. I did not like how you could get stun locked by several zombies, as when hit by one you drop your weapon and are stuck for a few seconds, and able to be immediately locked again if another zombie is nearby. Overall this game has a lot of potential and updates are still being done regularly.\n\nFor more recommendations on quality indie games or ones with high potential follow our group reviews  here","October 6, 2015","true","0.7"," 20 of 29 people (69%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","69","20","29","4","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198014697454/recommended/386200/","76561198014697454","YukaTakeuchiFan","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198014697454/","1093 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nWell aware of the ridiculously low amount of hours listed, but I assure anyone reading that I've actually been playing the game a fair bit ever since its original freeware release - I'd say the time I've spent is honestly closer to somewhere between 8 and 12.\n\nAnyway! I do feel I can give the game a fair shake at this point.\n\nDespite what you may expect from the screenshots, "Survivor: The Living Dead" honestly feels more like an action-puzzle game that'll require some exploration and quick work on your part in order to do well in. You see, you start in a position of distinct disadvantage - very few weapons are ready-to-use at the very start of the run (or in the game in general, but we'll get to that) and you need to - very quickly - start searching the area for anything that can be used as a weapon, for anything that can be put together to make weapons, or a means to create environmental hazards for later use - as the stuff you can easily reach immediately is nowhere near enough to take you to even the 7-minute run, let alone the longer game modes that come after it.\n\nEven if you know exactly what to do in order to make every weapon in the area available and usable, you're not out of the woods, and that's when you'll need to find ways to use what you've got to the best of your ability, as you're generally going to have JUST enough weaponry in total to take you to the end of the time limit - miss a few too many shots, use a weapon that's obviously meant to eliminate a crowd of zombies on LESS than a crowd of zombies, inappropriately use your barricades to give you the few decent chances to keep crowds together FOR those crowd weapons, don't act fast enough to get the weapons outside INSIDE, or any get any number of steps of the overall puzzle wrong, and you're simply going to run out of options, and most likely quickly die.\n\nTo keep the game fresh, there's a significant number of unlocks that will simultaneously give you far more tools to play around with, and which will honestly be outright NECESSARY to complete the longer game modes as you won't have enough overall ammo to beat the game otherwise - one thing I definitely like about the game is that if you know what you're doing, you'll always have what you need - but only just! - to win, keeping the game tense no matter how much you've unlocked (or if you wanna just run roughshod all over the easier time limits, that's fun too ;3 ).\n\nThere ARE a few flaws in the game, of course. Due to how the infection mechanic works, getting bitten even once is a huge, irreversible handicap that can make a game basically unwinnable if it happens too early (though one can argue that it's just another way of making sure you never allow the zombies to get past your guard in the first place), and some weapons can be a bit inconsistent in their damage output, leading to an unexpected bite when what you thought was a sure kill, well... isn't, and typically at the worst possible time, in strict accordance to Murphy's Law. And you might want to be careful about throwing all your weapons into a big pile; it's not the most pleasant experience trying to get a single specific weapon you need out of the pile once you hear the telltale crash of a door coming down.\n\nAdditionally, I must note that the game hasn't currently changed a whole lot since its original release, and while there's a lot to do on the maps you're given and the house is very well-designed to keep you on your toes, the fact is undeniable that there are only two maps, of which one you'll only see in the Story Mode. This said, it HAS been said that there will be new levels, so this may cease to be an issue in the future. Additionally, the game was originally made in 2010 by a small team, and kick me in the nuts if it doesn't LOOK it, with dated visuals and a UI that's just ugly to look at. However, being fair to the game, everything you need to know is perfectly identifiable with the graphical style, and I've certainly seen a hell of a lot worse, so unless you're a graphics wh... graphics service provider, there shouldn't be a huge problem here.\n\nOverall, I think there's a lot to like about the game and I've got confidence that the planned new additions will ensure it's worth the reasonable buy-in price. If you can skip the cost of a couple of burgers or something, you just might have fun with it too. =3","October 1, 2015","true","1.9"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","12","16","0","0"

Ok yes i did play the freeware version and it was awesome and such a thrill.  Same goes for this version that is on steam right now the story is simple yet can get in depth near the end of the game and its kinda a puzzle at first to figure out everything but once you get the hang of it oh man its a really good time and tons of action and the other thing is if you have a low spec pc its a really good game you can play.

The game as it is now, is largely unchanged from the freeware version I played before so it is familiar. It is confirmed that there will be new levels coming, and from the Twitter, it looks like enemies and weapons too.\n\nThe game is more of a strategy/tower defense game with a twist. When the game starts it is up to you to fortify, find/create weapons and use some crafty tactics to use the environment as another weapon.\n\nAgain, I can't stress to people enough that this is still in development, but I am confident that through early access and feedback the game will be shaped to a much better final product. Give it a shot, once you get the hang of the game it is quite addictive with its additional modes and reward system, which is actually quite extensive.","October 3, 2015","true","0.8"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

You will die quickly. But you will pick up the game again and again and after numerous tries master the house and feel the joy of surviving the 7 minute mode...only to find out you have to beat 12 minutes now.\n\nThis is an "old school" game in the sense that it is unforgiving, difficult, but very fun to master. You will die because of one slip up, you will die because of unlucky timing, you will die because you lost focus. But you will also feel great after executing an awesome combo, you will feel great after setting fire to dozen zombies at once, you will feel great when you get an S-rank on all levels.\n\nIf the video sound remotely fun to you, then this is definitely worth checking out!\n\n","November 9, 2015","true","6.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

And you'll probably die horribly.\n\nEventually, as you get good at the game and unlock all the items it becomes a different kind of game where you aggressively murder all the zombies you can.\n\nAt one point, well before the game came to steam, I threw together a 45 second trailer for the game, which would give you a very solid idea of what the game is like : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfZc1U7bzHQ","May 4","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
