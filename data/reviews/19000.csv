"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AestheticGamer/recommended/19000/","AestheticGamer","AestheticGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AestheticGamer/","3602 products in account","A bit of a warning, this will be my rantiest review I think I've ever done.\n\nLet me start off by politely, and courteously, taking a moment to ask why, out of every Silent Hill game, is this the only one on Steam? Now don't get me wrong, I'll get to Homecoming in a moment, but as most other entries in the series had PC ports, why. biased Konami, is this the only one Steam gets?\n\nWith that out of the way, Silent Hill Homecoming is the sixth main entry in the SH series, a psychological survival-horror series that has come to be known best for its atmosphere, story, surrealism, and creepy monster designs.\n\nSilent Hill Homecoming came out on the heels of the Silent Hill film, and it shows. Several monster designs and much of the visual look of the game can be attributed to the film. Most notably, the game has some impressive Otherworld transition sequences inspired by the movies. They look cool, and sound cool, so they at least get the job done there.\n\nAnd that's something to be said for Homecoming. It's not a terrible looking game, the designs of the characters and monsters at least look cool, the environments look appropriately ominous, and the fog effects, while a bit sparser than other entries in the series, are still rather well-handled.\n\nHowever, the film inspiration becomes a bit much in areas. This was the game that shoe-horned Pyramid Head in for no reason, and I literally mean no reason. Oh, he appears in cutscenes, but not a single time in gameplay. Not once. And that's not even arguing on how he has no reason to be here. Both in the fact he literally does nothing in the story and it goes against on what Pyramid Head was in SH2. And then there's scenes that were so obviously inspired by the movie, and enemies inspired by the movie. It essentially is an extension to the Silent Hill movie in game form, honestly.\n\nBut so much goes against what the SH series is. I was literally in hysterics during a scene almost half-way in the game when suddenly you get a sassy black sidekick comic relief character and escape a police station being invaded Dawn of the Dead style by giant hammerhead land-shark monsters. Don't get me wrong, this is brilliant B-Movie hamminess, but what the ♥♥♥♥ is it doing in the ♥♥♥♥ing Silent Hill series?\n\nAnd that's what I think one of Homecoming's biggest problems is. It doesn't know what the SH series is. I am convinced the creators just watched the SH movie and made the game based off of that. There's no other explanation for it. Homecoming must of at one point in development been a video game adaption of the movie, because it has so much in common with the film; the nurses work just like they do in the film, so does the cult, and the aesthetics... But it's almost nothing like how the rest of the series is.\n\nBut let's get off our fixations of its identity crisis and focus more on the game as its own experience.\n\nSilent Hill Homecoming tells the story of a man named Alex Sheppard who's returning from the military to visit his home in Sheppard's Glen (of course conveniently named after his family). He's been gone for a long time and finds that his hometown has completely changed. There's a few people still living in town, but the place is mostly deserted. Alex comes home to find his brother and father are missing, and his mom seems completely out of it with a pistol on her lap. Alex goes to investigate what exactly has happened to his family, and to this town, and what sort of connection it has with the nearby local resort town of Silent Hill.\n\nTo the story's credit, I did end up liking a few of the characters, most notably Alex, who did end up earning some sympathy from me through his journey. And Wheeler, your sassy black comedy relief character, was enjoyable, though so out of place. Most everyone else was forgettable, however. The plot twists unfortunately are mostly super predictable, the worst of all being the 'main' twist, and while I don't want to spoil the game, towards the end we get into some ludicrous Saw-inspired segments that just feel completely out of left field and unneeded. Homecoming also holds my personal honor for having the worst multiple endings I have ever experienced in a horror game. I'm not kidding, they are that bad.\n\nThe game has a few puzzles, and by puzzles I mean over half of them are sliding tile puzzles or this puzzle about crossing wires. Whoever the ♥♥♥♥ at Double Helix thought that making most of the puzzles in the game ♥♥♥♥ing sliding puzzles really deserves a solid kick in the ♥♥♥.\n\nThe game is also overly focused on combat. The combat to be fair isn't bad, with a very Zelda-esque system, being able to lock-onto enemies and circle and roll-dodge from them, but the weapons are notably unbalanced with some being far better than others. Also while technically the 'best' combat system in the series (and they try to rationalize it with the fact Alex is an ex-soldier), the series was never really about the combat, making it feel like the developers missed the point.\n\nAlso the PC port is a hit or miss based on your system. It either works perfectly fine, or it doesn't. Fans have made a lot of work-arounds for problems in the game, but it has had absolutely no official support. It was basically released on Steam, and left to die there.\n\nThis so far makes it sound like I hate Homecoming, but in earnest I didn't.\n\nHomecoming has so much wrong with it, as a Silent Hill game, as a horror game, and as an action game, that it's easy to mention, but it's actually not a terrible game, and has several quite good moments and actually is an okay to good game, though I'd argue one of the weakest in its series.\n\nHomecoming has some decent moments. Exploring the house is both interesting and a bit haunting. Going into the basement the first time is a bit unnerving. A few of the boss fights, especially the second one, are actually well-done. The game isn't too repetitive and does have moments that split away from just combat or just exploration. Speaking of that, there's a decent exploration element in this game that often is a bit rewarding for little extra tidbits, imagery, and sometimes goodies and hidden weapons. The game has some fun unlockable costumes and weapons.\n\nThe story is enjoyable in a B-fare kind of way, and is backed by good music and sound design. While not Akira's best work, the music still holds up well for the title. There are small touches to the game too and details that are appreciated, including each grave stone in the graveyard having a different description on them (and there are many), some small scares that the player may miss if they aren't observant or don't explore a bit. The atmosphere is okay, though the game really isn't scary.\n\nBut I didn't hate my time with it, in fact, I would say I enjoyed myself playing it. It's got so many flaws and they're so easy to point out, but despite it all there is an enjoyable game in here. It honestly probably would of been better if it was Silent Hill The Movie: The Game though, as it really does things that just doesn't sit right as a fan of the series. But in its own way, it's an enjoyable B-Movie sort of horror game that has dips into legitimately good moments and ideas.\n\nIf you go in expecting some B-Horror fun, as opposed to a Silent Hill game, it's a pretty okay to good game in its own right, just has some flaws, but I wouldn't say the flaws ruin the game and there is some fun and interesting sections to be had as the game goes on. If you go to it for a Silent Hill fix, however, I think you'll be bitterly disappointed. A misguided, but ultimately pretty okay game, that could of been a good game if it wasn't bogged down by a few problems.","May 4, 2014","true","12.8"," 241 of 272 people (89%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","89","241","272","7","9"

The strong points of the series have always been atmosphere, design, and sheer compelling mystery. Homecoming fails on all of these points.\n\nFirstly, the story, unlike those in previous games, is utterly predictable and tedious. It's straight out of the worst horror movies; every spoken line will seem familiar and you can predict half the scenes and twists before they happen. The stories in the previous games weren't always perfectly written, but they were never this insultingly cliché. There's no mystery, no creeping fear, no unresolved questions.\n\nAs for the monsters, they nearly look right for the series, but their behavior is worlds apart. Instead of being willful and mysterious, they're just like the posturing, aggressive beasts you'll find in any other game. That's more a matter of taste, but fighting them is definitely more simplistic than before. When you engage an enemy, you can practically feel the scripting pop into gear; the whole process is nothing but a timing game. Block, button mash, the end. Or, if the monster gets a hit in, enjoy being hit again and again and again as you try to either get back up or get out of the way. It's cheap and nothing but cheap, and not remotely enjoyable. Compounding this fact is that you have only 3 melee weapons that differ in speed and attack pattern, and these qualities stay the same even when you get new weapons (which just replace one of these 3, and play exactly the same).\n\nThe puzzles are shockingly simple. The solutions are frequently completely obvious, sometimes even without reading the hint (which is usually posted immediately near the puzzle, and barely obscures the solution if at all). In two cases, object interaction puzzles are actually repeated; one is only slightly different the second time around, but the other one is literally the exact same puzzle with the exact same method of solution! Overall, the puzzles come off like an afterthought, and add nothing to the experience.\n\nIf you're looking to extend your Silent Hill experience with Homecoming, forget it. Because it isn't Silent Hill, it is a horror game called Homecoming.","December 8, 2013","false","8.3"," 185 of 257 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","185","257","0","17"

Overall it still looks good. You stop noticing low res textures eventually. Monster design is definitely amazing!\n\nSound & Music: 7/10\nIf you have played previous Silent Hill games you’ve come to expect a great soundtrack. All though Akira Yamaoka’s sound is easily recognizable, soundtrack itself is slightly underwhelming. I remember listening Silent Hill 2 soundtrack on a loop for weeks. I don’t feel the same about this one but it has its bright spots. Overall good music and creepy ambient. You can find OST on youtube. It is worth listening to even if you’ve never played the game.\n\nStory: 7/10\nStory is full of traditional creepy characters and plot twists. Some of the ideas were not exactly fresh but overall story and characters were pretty interesting.\n\nThe BadCombat and controls.\nIt didn’t bother me that this SH game was more action oriented than previous installments but combat itself was rather frustrating. It felt awkward and slow. I died so many times until I realized that using a knife (the very first weapon) was the way to against most of the enemies. By the end of the game fighting was no longer a challenge. I had so many med kits and health drinks, I didn’t know what to do with them.\n\nSave Points.\nThere are not that many. Since you die rather often early in the game and game crashes regularly (at least in my experience) replaying the same area over and over again becomes very annoying quickly.\n\nLoading time.\nIt takes a WHILE to load a new area or a save game (I played it on i7-5820K / 16GB / GTX970). Also, sometimes game just freezes for a few seconds.\n\nThe UglyGlitches\nThere are plenty. To list a few:\nControls are unresponsive during button mashing sequences.\nYou cannot damage monsters. Only happened once, I wasted all my ammo and died a few times. It was fixed after I restarted the game.\nSound sometimes is coming out of only one speaker and a couple of times audio was out of sync during cut-scenes.\nMany people reported glitches with certain puzzles all thought I haven’t experienced any. Crashes\nIt must have crashed at least 25-30 time during a single playthrough. There was no particular pattern. Sometimes it crashes on startup (Often 2-3 times in a row. If you keep restarting it will launch eventually). Sometimes mid game, sometimes during cut-scenes, sometimes during a loading sequence. Very late in the game it crashed 8 times in a row in the same exact spot. This is when I was ready to give up. I’m glad it didn’t crash 9 times in a row otherwise I would never be able to finish the game :(\nNone of the solutions I found online helped me (although, I think lowering graphic settings does help in some cases). I tried playing on 2 different PCs, on Win7 and on Win10.\n\nI am glad I finished the game. I enjoyed parts of it but overall it was a very frustrating experience because how bad this port is. In the end it was a sigh of relief rather than satisfaction from a completed game.\n\nIf you are a fan of Silent Hill franchise or horror games in general this game is worth playing but you will be better off playing it on a console.\n\nSilent Hill Homecoming:  7/10\nSilent Hill Homecoming (Horrible PC Port Edition): 4/10","February 19","false","15.1"," 35 of 43 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","35","43","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BridgetFisher/recommended/19000/","BridgetFisher","BridgetFisher","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BridgetFisher/","4086 products in account","This game is spooky and terrifying more than just whats in the game.  In the game, the world around you can fragment and break away as the world of silent hill infects everything around the character.  Oddly this game has that effect in real life, making it more than just a horrific game to play, but a horrific experience for everyone in the world even YOU!  *chains rattle\n\nThis is a throwback game to survival horror with exploration at its heart.  The world thats made is pretty much free roam to be explored with items to find making it feel a bit like RE1.  When this was released everyone hated it, its competition was Dead Space so thats a tough one to go against without bringing the A game.  This game though does what few games do anymore which is exploration in a world of survival horror, the monsters while not diverse fit the atmosphere including a boss right out of Human Centipede named Asphyxia derived from greek meaning without heartbeat.\n\nAnyone who hated the movie, will hate this game.  Story is similar but vastly different in its approach making it fresh for fans who saw the movie a billion times.  Those who hated the movie should check it out again now to see what a top movie studio can bring to blood guts and gore that they really havent done since if they want something to appreciate.   For survival horror fans who couldnt stomach this game at release its the modern day now so all we get are walking simulators with spooky stuffs.\n\nThis game is horrific to look at visually, in all the wrong ways which somehow makes this game even creepier.  Released for Xbox 360 and PS3 using the Havok Engine, which brought us everything from Skyrim to Oblivion and Dark Souls.  Silent Hill comes off looking like some abomination mix of PS2 textures, with PS3 character models for some characters while others are PS2 looking or even PS1 with the fidelity of their textures.  This mashup of quality lends itself actually to Silent Hill, where something is always a bit off.  Something always lurking below the surface, in a good way this bad quality in any other game actually adds to its charm here of being an evil demonic messed up interdimensional crossover crazy kinda world.\n\nThe lighting however is pure genius, some of the best ever in gaming for this genre.  The world isnt BLACK like other games to add a fake fear factor.  For many games that is their gimmick a one trick pony of wondering whats outside the dark.  Its a cheap gimmick, and people make that world, they design it for atmosphere and if we cant see it or feel the atmosphere their just wasting their time and ours.  In this game its dim everywhere just right to get a feeling for the world or place you are in, there is a flashlight to further light up areas since its so dim.  Dim means we can see the world its amazing a work of art that way in survival horror design where many games opt to just make everything black.\n\nThe gameplay is brutal, playing it on normal isnt bad at all, playing it on hard is doable as well.  Dodge is almost broken but works under very very precise conditions relying on the skill of the player to memorize the moves of a given boss to anticipate them and react.  On hard with bad controls every boss can still be beat with melee.  The controls are as horrific as everything else, there isnt much if any of a tutorial so its just wing it and see what works with different weapons.\n\nBugs, well this game has em all, from being version 1.0 we bring you random crashes and bugs galore.  The game will freeze erratically at times then magically unfreeze.  Oddly many of these glitches somehow also add to how the game infects your computer and its own engine.  The world of silent hill and how it wants to ruin everything can not be contained!  None of these are gamebreaking, there are save spots so if it crashes no big loss.\n\nBridgetips:\n1.  Turn out the lights, play at night, say goodbye to the real world and hello to Silent Hill.\n2.  Use the knife for almost everything.   The combo to use is Fast-Fast-Fast-Heavy\n3.  Enemies in the streets respawn, run by them when possible.\n4.  After fighting Curtis who has a buzz saw, go back in Curtis's room and get the 301 key on the wall, when leaving before the 1st gate get your weapons back in room 301.\n5.  Use doorways to your advantage many enemies cant get through them or only one can get through at a time.\n6.  Use the environment like desks and tables to heavy stab across out of range of enemies.\n\n*Using a controller get this mod made by steam user grasmann who is an awesome member of the community putting in the button prompts for xbox or ps controllers here:  http://steamcommunity.com/app/19000/discussions/0/618458030648125452/\n\nRating:  7/10  Value: $9.99\n\nEarlier it was mentioned this game was horrifying in the real world.   This game can wreck the reputations of even the most high tech and largest corporations in the world, Amazon.  It would be correct to understand that this game is made by Amazon who owns Double Helix game studios.  Even scarier is currently if trying to visit the double helix website, all browsers will block you saying its an unsafe sites.  Nothing is safe from the horrors of this game, while this game is for sale on steam, its interesting to note that Amazon does NOT sell this game on PC as of this writing.  The limits of Silent Hill know no boundaries oozing into our world infecting all this game touches.  Even scarier is wanting the game fixed calling a contact at Amazon who owns Double Helix only to find out noone has the phone number to the company they own.  Who knows what nightmares will be unleashed if and when that phone number is found, but most likely problem with game is it was literally made for XP, so they gotta update it, gotta do something and its high time they fix it or at least were made aware we care enough for them to fix it, so lets hope we now get our update!\n\nMore fun trivia?\nSilent Hill is based on a real place, hell on earth, a town called Centralia in Pennsylvania.  A place of absolute evil that stinks of the bowels of hades with the burning smell of sulfur.  A hell burns underneath this town from an underground coal mine fire that is impossible to put out so it just burns forever.  A town covered in ash with columns of smoke rising randomly into the sky blacking out the sun on the brightest day.\n\nThe roads missing in the game thats legit, fun fact in Centralia there is only one road in and out.  The government  tried to build a highway through the city then the day that highway opened, a giant hole opened swallowing it up.  The town is so evil, the government built the highway around the entire town keeping the town cut off.  The town has few residents many part of a singular religion which has some unique elements to say the least.\n\nGraveyards are actually full of children.  Its rumored that locals had deformed children due to the toxic byproducts of the fire.  These locals were too kind to kill their children, so they would put the children in the old mine shafts left to themselves eating eachother or the scraps the out of work mine town could afford, who knows if their still there or what tourists they feed on who make the mistake of making a pit stop.\n\nThese stories also gave rise to the Hills Have Eyes movies, and inspired Rob Zombie for the underground parts of Devils Rejects.  At each entrance to the town are shrines to the Virgin Mary with candles, flowers all kinds of stuff, who lights all those candles?  The town next door has a HUGE what must be 6 or 7 story tall statue of some christian preacher guy with his hand outstretched in a stopping posture towards the town of Centralia as if keeping the evil away.  The whole area is suspect of supernatural something or other, yet most who go there trying to survive the night lose their minds or never live to tell the true tale of what lies within the dark heart of Centralia.","August 11, 2015","true","22.2"," 61 of 90 people (68%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","68","61","90","10","0"

A greater emphasis on combat removes the horror from the equation, and the combat itself is awkward and jittery. Not to mention, the starting knife attacks so quickly it can stunlock almost every enemy in the game and makes every other melee weapon useless.\n\nAnd this is all assuming you can actually get it running. Especially on newer systems, you're likely not to be able to launch the game at all without some fiddling. And if you do, expect a lack of video options and weird performance issues or visual glitches all around, as well as frequent crashes. It's a messy version of a game that was already a mess, and yet somehow they still feel fine charging $40 for it.\n\nIf you're eyeing this one during a sale in hopes of one last little gasp of Silent Hill to satisfy your craving, just don't. You'd be wasting your money and your time on a game that is an amateurish, embarrassing shadow of those that came before it.

I only payed $1.50 on a Brazilian gamesite. It activated no problem and all was perfect. So I saw the gameplay and the game looks awesome.\nSo I launch the game on Steam. I put the game on the highest settings since my computer is like 3 times better than the required specs. Boy was I dissapointed with the port of this game. I played trough the first chapter and it took me longer than an hour. Not because I don't know how to play or what to do. The game runs maybe at 5-6 fps, The only thing that doesnt lags are the cutscenes. Also when you die or go to a next level or sometimes even different area it loads from 5- 10 minutes. It is ridiculous how badly they optimized this game for pc. I dont know if its the steam version since I saw a guy on youtube play this on pc flawlessly. Must have been a pirated version.\n\nI can't recommend this game at all and on top of that its like $40 in the steam store.

But the gameplay, interface and most important of all, story, just make this into the worst Silent Hill game I've ever played.\n\nThe save points are in stupid places, very far apart and hard to get to. That's not a problem because you'll die a lot (you won't) - it's a problem because after playing for another fifteen minutes of nothing happening or being ambushed by the same monsters over and over again, you're going to be so bored you just need a break. And you can't take one, because then you'll have to play through this whole tedious section all over again.\n\nYou're a much more combat capable character in SHH (I imagine someone saying "Shh..." and placing their hand over this games face to just shut up all the stupid) but that's not necessarily a good thing. It takes a run and hide, survival horror and makes it a dodge, counter, attack fighting game. There's not so much a sense of fear, but frustration, over the enelies getting in cheap or lucky shots, when you should be going, "OH GOD WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥ IS THAT?!"\n\nGood news is, this game adds nothing to the overall mythology (at least not in the time I've spent playing it) so you can skip this and hope the next Silent Hill game coming out is pants ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly good.","November 19, 2014","false","5.3"," 50 of 79 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","50","79","2","1"

Then if you open steam in game, or alt tab, it crashes immediately. There are also many glitches that cause the game to be unplayable.\n\nAllowing the use of a controller would make this game a lot better, as well as fixing all these terrible bugs and lowering the price.

I loved the first 3 Silent Hill games and the fourth one was okay but this game is terrible compared to Silent Hill standards. the monsters are boring, the combat is way too easy in the beginning and suddenly becomes very difficult later in the game and the game can be scary from time to time but overall it doesn't live up to the scarieness and constand terror from the previous Silent Hill games. the puzzles aren't that bad but nowhere near as good as the puzzles in the previous Silent Hill titles. and on top of that the game even counteracts the storyline from the previous Silent Hill titles, just to give you a small explaination Pyramid head or "bogeyman" is in this game which is part of James' (from Silent Hill 2) personal nightmare so Alex shouldn't be able to see him.\n\nSo where did it go wrong. First of all developers try to make this game more mainstream so people who weren't interested in Silent Hill before might become interested, same thing happend to Resident Evil. in the end nobody gives a sh!t about these games, people who werent interested in the game still aren't interested and the (hardcore) fans don't like it either. Second of all this game isn't created by the origional developers also known as "Team Silent" and nobody in the entire world, and by that I realy mean nobody in the entie world except off course for Team Silent really understands the story of Silent Hill so it's best if nobody makes another Silent Hill game, at least not without the help of some of the developers of the origional Team Silent.\n\nI give this game a 5/10 as a horror game, it's mediocre at best, but a 2/10 as a Silent Hill game because in my opinion it has nothing to do with a Silent Hill game, and please stop f*cking up Silent Hill.\n\nStill not convinced, watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5-XhBpfqMM.

There's native support for an Xbox 360 controller, but the onscreen button prompts are numbered instead of having A, B, X or Y on them, and they have the wrong color.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/magicmoo/recommended/19000/","magicmoo","magicmoo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/magicmoo/","723 products in account","Just another buggy piece of junk.\n\nOnce I got through the usual black screen startup inherent to a lot of rushed PC games, I had to figure out why the game was running on such a low (often stuttering) framerate on my usually quite decent hardware (core i5 + gtx 770), but after tinkering few minutes with some settings in the config files and trying to overload vsync in nvidia control panel (turning it off gave me terrible screen tearing, which was a pretty bad sign considering my hardware and the game graphics), I got to the conclusion that the game was just performing the best it could and that its coding was just a mess... of course this was confirmed when I encountered ridiculous 5/10 seconds freezes after some cutscenes. The whole thing was starting to make me quite uneasy as save points in this game are set way too far appart, but more on that soon!\n\nAnyway, despite the terrible performance, I still wanted to give it a shot, as I'm a big amateur of the Silent Hill series and actually owned the same game on X360, but never got much far due to the utter annoyance of the combat system in hard difficulty and one awful freeze that made me lost one hour of boring gameplay. But this time I was determined to go through with it, thinking a pretty average game with Akira Yamaoka's music might at least give me a bit of pleasure.\n\nSo there i was, wasting another time tediously running around on some cheap scavenger hunt from corridor to corridor in what appears to be an even more cheap knock off of a Silent Hill game, which quickly throws a bunch of cliches from Silent Hill 2  at you without even trying to have its own identity. It's really quite impressive how bad Double Helix was at this, but hardly surprising if you look at their other games or even at the ones from their former companies (nothing really good appart from a bunch of games in the 90's). How they got this gig is mind-boggling and just shows how Konami execs have become out of touch this last decade to the point of trusting these hacks with one of their most emblematic franchise. It's kind of sad from a company that most definitely was at the top of its game from the 8bit to the PS2 era (one of my best gaming memories as a kid where on their SNES games. still remember how seeing their logo screen popping up would instantly reassure me that I was in for some quality gaming time).\n\nBut I disgress... Remember what I said about those save points being way too far appart for a buggy game like this? Right after the first level of the game, you get into a really tedious part of the game, which pretty much consists of running around way too much in different parts of the town. I only had one save point in the beginning, but then I got to almost fully explore a house, picked up quite a bunch of stuff, got to explore the first part of a cemetery only to have to backtrack quite far, because I didn't see the right climbing path the first time around. And then, just before I finally got to the next save point, BAM! got accidentely ALT-TABed out of the game, which of course crashed when I tried to get back in it! Almost made me smile... Almost :p. Anyway, I was just looking for a good reason to put this game down early (and forever. this time) and it looks like it made me a favor by collapsing from the weight of its own mediocrity after a mere 1 hour of gameplay.\n\nSo there you have it. Think twice before buying this terrible port. Even if you actually remotely enjoyed it on consoles, you're probably going to have a bad time. Besides, there are so much better games like this one to try (hell, even a small indie game like Lone Survivor gets it more). In the meanwhile Konami might pull their head out of their ♥♥♥♥ and redeem themselves by releasing the 4 earliest Silent Hill games on Steam. Hopefully it'll happen before they cut their veins open, while ingesting pachinko balls and frenetically playing DDR until they die while trying to figure out how they can "revive" another franchise. Yeah... this must how they've been making their decisions lately.","June 10, 2014","false","1.3"," 16 of 27 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","16","27","0","0"

But I had finished it way before buying it on Steam... Since I own the retail version as well...)\n\nWhat ever, that is the only Silent Hill I approve of, but here again I am biased since I enjoy Resident Evil (especially Operation Raccoon City, 4, and Revelations), Half-Life, Aliens vs Predator and any other action paced game... Which is fairly not the goal of Silent Hill, I shall admit.\n\n\n... But this one pleased me, and I think that's THE problem. This game will most likely make you happy if you are heretical to the original Silent Hill fanbase. But whatever they say... This is objectively a good game, and a good PC port. Its graphics are alright, the gameplay is cool and varied, the atmosphere is still very present, and the action scenes are well mastered. There's also a wide range of weapons, costumes to unlock and combos to put your hand on... Just as in any Resident Evil haha! I kind of like the storyline as well, and the multiple-ending scenario.\n\n\n\nYou get it... That's positive for me, but I can totally understand why the fanbase of the franchise despised it.","December 27, 2015","true","2.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Every time you finish the game you can get new weapons and costumes depending on the final. The game is good, not best game of franchise but not the worst...(downpour feelings)...\n\nPerformance\n\nWell, well... here's the thing that I do not recommend this game for pc... first, it is very badly optimized, if the question was just the fps I could play it without any trouble. I can live with that! but okay, started the game...it crashed :c... started again... crashed again... started over and over again and it crashes... Almost without hope , I searched on the internet how to fix this and a guy told to start the game as admnistrator. Okay, I tried and it worked! sadly just for a while :(. Go for search again and another guy told to start the game in the folder steamapps. OMG it really worked!!! I'm happy again ...Sadly.... about 2 hours of gameplay playing normally I see an dog, and every time that I get close to him to pass that stage the game crashes again, and no matter what I search or what prey or vodoo kinds I try the game never changes and this is the final for me. For my luck the game costs 2.00 USD for an retailer.\n\nNOTE: If you minimize your game it will crash too! sounds great :D\n\nfinally, the game deserve to be played, but JUST IF YOU HAVE A CONSOLE FOR THAT! 7/10\nor...if you like a crash simulator it will worth your money perfectly!!\n\nNOTE: If anyone knows a type of magic for run the game please add me and I will try because, seriously, the game dont worked for me!","December 4, 2015","false","3.2"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","57","8","14","3","5"

Audio only came out of one side, loading seemed like it was coming off of a DVD, but the controls were ok, and it did run. A generally painful experience that I would not recommend, and generally consider a port port. The game it self may be ok, but the porting job is very poor. The load times are on par with a 360, which defeats most of the point of a PC port. If I recall correctly, the game only had two graphical quality settings; low and medium. How does that happen? I would have accepted low and high, but medium? Thats just lazy development there. I would recommend this game be played on a console before this poor PC port. It looks like the company was just trying to make a quick buck, because it lacks effort, and lacks even trying.","November 24, 2012","false","3.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But how everyone whines about how it does not fit the silent hill universe and all, I will mostly ignore that in this review: this is my review about Shepherd's glen, homecoming.\n\nso to get the silent hill things out of the way:\nathmosphere: indeed, I got more scared by the blur of the dated silent hill, but this still can scare if you are playing alone in the dark and really into the game, but it will never get close to other titles in the franchise. Also the monsters: in other games they might have been more scary and here more agresive, but going with the entire silent hill thing of the character's mind and all, it actually fits. Alex is a very VERY agresive person, most of the other games featured just normal people, nothing with a real agresive past where here you have a soldier! added up with an abusive past no wonder this guy likes to fight.\n\nWell, let us go on with Shepgerd's glen, homecoming;\nbugs? I've played trough this at least three times and never have I encountered anything but a few weird monster movement wich to be honest made the things more scary.\npord? well, I have seen better, WAY BETTER. but this is NOT one of the worst, some of the buttons are awkward but it could have gone full lego lord of the rings.\nstory? Personally, I LOVE the story, it has great moments and for me it fits all into place.\nsoundtrack? It's still a silent hill game, and Akira Yamaoka is still on it, off course it's great.\n\n\nSo the review in short:\nPersonally I love it a lot, rip it of the silent hill title and people would call it a silent hill look a like, but remove those people and you got a very VERY nice game, sadly there are a lot of people getting bugs, if they would fix it for those people I'll call this an easy 7.5/10\nI guess a 7/10, not silent hill but not horrible.\n\nnote: Welcome to the land of fan-service.\n\n\nMy excuses for the poor english.","September 29, 2011","true","36.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Wanna get a good idea how bad it is? At lowest settings this game runs at 15fps on a very low resolution. My computer can run Battlefield 3 maxed out at 60fps at 1920x1080. So now you have a good idea of how bad this port is. Not only that, but i had to disable my second monitor to even get this game to start, what the ♥♥♥♥. Also, the load times are atrocious, it takes literally more than a minute and a half to load anything.

I've found the mixed range of weapons and supplies ample at best and some of the puzzles fairly challenging. This also has a cameo appearance by none other than THE PYRAMID HEAD ! How scarry is that? Replay value is good if you want to collect all the unlockables.

In addition the alt + tab only manages to cause the game to crash.\n\nHowever the biggest issue and what has ultimately caused me to write this review and prevent me from even finishing the game is that half way through playing Homecoming has failed to register my keyboard. No matter what keys I press no effect will register. It is not frozen because my mouse still works in the game I just can't move or open the menu screen.\n\nLike I said I love the Silent Hill games however these aren't issues that I can just ignore and look past which I have been known to do for many games.

For me the game installs and plays fine.\n\nThe game itself is a good "clone" of the Silent Hill franchise.  The reason I say that is the original Team Silent only made Silent Hill I through IV.  Because of this, all the rest are more or less a clone of the original series, and Home Coming, despite really feeling like one, is itself a pretty good one.\n\nI am not going to go much into the game or gameplay itself, if you have ever played a Silent Hill game you already know what it is like.  There is not anything really new or different with Home Coming aside from the story.  Where the game is fun is just in the feeling of being in another Silent Hill story: the creepiness, puzzles and atmosphere are all there, and then there are definitely those moments where you have to just smile as what you just experienced was pretty awesome!\n\nIf you are a fan of the survival horror genre, or just a fan of the Silent Hill series, Silent Hill Homecoming is definitely one you will want to get.","December 31, 2014","true","3.7"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","11","23","0","0"

But only if you're an old school survival horror fan. Save points are few, you WILL die because of the crappy controls, you WILL  have to replay portions of the game because of these two things. Alot.\n\n","October 9, 2014","true","5.9"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","10","21","0","0"

In this game, you arrive in a small town to discover that almost everyone disappeared. It's up to you to discover what happened in Shepherd's Glen. The interesting story is part of the reason why I bought this game.\n\nIf you liked Alan Wake, you'll like this game. It's also a 3rd person horror game and it's almost as scary. I would say it's more gore than scary most of the time but the atmosphere is still really good. As for the gameplay,  you discover many weapons (melee or ranged) throughout the game but the ammos are limited so it's up to the player to use them wisely !\n\nIt's not really long but I would say it's adequate for this kind of game. It took me about 7-8 hours to finish. It's longer than most of the horror games nowadays.\n\nAs for the PC port, I read so many bad reviews that I was wondering if it would run on my computer. Finally, it worked without any problem for most of the game. I did NOT encounter any crash but at the end of the game, the game 'freezed' before saving for about 20-30 seconds. Pretty annoying but it's nothing game-breaking. There's also a puzzle at the beginning of the game (Wires) that did not work at all since i couldn't click on something else with my mouse. I had to plug a controller and then unplug it to finally be able to select the next wire. That was the worst bug I saw in this game.\n\nIn conclusion, buy this game if you love horror games and don't mind about some bugs from the PC port (also considering that it's the only Silent Hill game on Steam, there's not much to complaint about.. at least we have this one)","June 20, 2015","true","7.6"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","10","21","0","0"

Even then, the loading sections take horrible amounts of time and make the game seem like it's frozen, (several times it took 3/4 minutes just to load the save menu) and will constantly do this as you move around the maps to new areas.\n\nIf you can handle these slight hiccups then go for it, but I'd really recommend either waiting until Steam patches up the glitches properly, or buying a hard copy of the game that runs smoother.

There are some problems with the sound, animation, framerate is locked at 30, too many loading screens and the loading time is too damn long for some unexplained reason, but the soundtrack and the story are amazing, just like in every other Silent Hill game. This game is the first one in the franchise where we can directly interact with objects, making the game experience a bit more realistic, considering even in Silent Hill 4 every object was basically glued to the ground. It makes it much harder to stay silent when fumbling around in the dark. I also like the quicktime events - on consoles it's like an every day thing to have those, but for a SH game I found it surprising. Still can't jump, but jumping isn't even an important part of the game mechanics, we can roll instead, which is much more effective and fun. This is just a bad port of an amazing game. No matter how much hate it got, I've wanted to get it eversince 2008 and only now did I get the chance. I love it to bits and pieces, especially how it builds up tension in whoever plays it, the atmosphere is just perfect - eerie, mysterious, enough to make you shiver everytime you hear the slightest noise.\nAlso, AKIRA YAMAOKA IS A GOD. ♥♥♥♥ING LISTEN TO DAT SOUNDTRACK IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY.","July 10, 2015","true","9.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Yes I haven't played it that long, but I am going to defend this Game in most ways people criticize it.\n\n1. It has 30 FPS!\nMy responce: This was before 60FPS was commonly accepted to be put to use as far as I know. This was made in 2008, which is 7 years ago, unlike games like Batman: Arkham Knight, where all of the other games were 60FPS and didn't have a lock. I played it and had no problems with it, unlike with most Shooters and Action games on the market. Horror games are meant to be slow, not fast like those types of games I mentioned earlier. If you really have a big deal, just look it up on the internet and I am sure you can find a solution.\n\n2. It's way too expensive! How is a game from 2008 $39.99!\nMy responce: Look at the publisher who made this. The last game they made was from 2011. I do know that the developer did make a game less than a year ago, but the publishers do control the price of the game for the most part. I do agree that this game should have a price drop, but there is something we can look forward to: Sales. A while back, this game rarely went on sale, but within the past year, it has gone on sale twice and it uually goes down to $9.99. That is the price I recommend getting it on Steam. If you don't want to wait long (For example it didn't go on sale for more than a year before), then buy it on ♥♥♥. As of right now, the prices are under $9.99.\n\n3. The controls are awful and a mess!\nMy responce: The controls aren't bad at all. They are the same as before with WASD. How are the controls bad? That is what confuses me with this.\n\nSo hopefully, these reviews won't make you shy away from this game.","November 1, 2015","true","2.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

There are some problems with the sound, animation, framerate is locked at 30, too many loading screens and the loading time is too damn long for some unexplained reason, but the soundtrack and the story are amazing, just like in every other Silent Hill game. This game is the first one in the franchise where we can directly interact with objects, making the game experience a bit more realistic, considering even in Silent Hill 4 every object was basically glued to the ground. It makes it much harder to stay silent when fumbling around in the dark. I also like the quicktime events - on consoles it's like an every day thing to have those, but for a SH game I found it surprising. Still can't jump, but jumping isn't even an important part of the game mechanics, we can roll instead, which is much more effective and fun. This is just a bad port of an amazing game. No matter how much hate it got, I've wanted to get it eversince 2008 and only now did I get the chance. I love it to bits and pieces, especially how it builds up tension in whoever plays it, the atmosphere is just perfect - eerie, mysterious, enough to make you shiver everytime you hear the slightest noise.\nAlso, AKIRA YAMAOKA IS A GOD. ♥♥♥♥ING LISTEN TO DAT SOUNDTRACK IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY.","July 10, 2015","true","9.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

You will typically be able to predict what is coming next.\n\nThe characters are wrote in such a way that they lack depth and it is hard to form a bond with them.\n\nGameplay: Punishing, almost arcade-style. You will die frequently as the enemies are scripted to pummel you with quicker attack speeds and wider attack range than you can achieve. You will find yourself spamming the dodge-uppercut move hoping for a lucky shot.\n\nThe puzzle sections are good, not great. They offer subtle aids to help you complete them, but the reward for your endeavour is not always felt.\n\nThe saving mechanic is flawed mainly because the save points are placed at random points, forcing you to rely on checkpoints. Some checkpoints are poorly done as they force you to watch cutscenes again and again that you can not skip.\n\nSoftware: The software crashes at random points in the game. I don't claim to have the best gaming pc, but I have researched that even high spec pcs suffer from the random bugs infesting the software.\n\nVerdict: This game has about 5% of the spirit of Silent Hill, leaving much to be desired. Unless you are a diehard who must own everything Silent Hill, avoid this one and research other horror titles to spend your cash on.","December 17, 2014","false","13.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Forget about trying to dodge as it simply is broken and will only work about 25% of the time.

For $9.99 I recieved nothing but amazing levels of frustration and anger.\n\nWhy?\n\n1. This "game" crashes continuously. It often crashes on start up - at the moment that it says Konami on the screen - before it is even remotely possible for there to be any legitimate reason for it to crash. It often crashes right after major boss fights, causing them to be refought. It crashes on cut scenes. Crash. Crash. Crash. Crash. Crash. Crash. Crash. Crash. Crash. Crash. Crash. Crash. Crash.\n\n2. Save points - These are so rare as to be non-existent. I know that "survival horror" is supposed to be "hard." I have played plenty of survival horror games. This is not hard. This is stupid. My play time consists of hours of playing the same parts and skipping the same cut scenes over and over and over because of save point placement being insanely stupid and rare. Save points after boss fights? Nope. Dieing 3 minutes after a boss fight and then having to fight the boss again was common. Doing the same thing over and over and over and over because the save points were randomly placed by idiots is not fun.\n\n3. Combat is constant and ridiculously difficult. I play shooters, hack and slash, RTS, survival - a bit of everything - and NO GAME I have EVER played made combat such a chore. 90% of the time, success was luck. Try to dodge? Nope. Try to stun? Nope. I ended up doing more pointless button mashing in this game - and still, success always came down to just luck. In the less than 12 hours I played this game I must have died 80 times - which is almost half as many times as the game crashed. This does not make a game "scary." It makes it rage inducing crap.\n\nI hate this game with a passion. I would vow to quit playing it, then come back and try again. I really gave it way more time than it deserved, but in the end, I quit half way through and wouldn't play it again for money.

It's NOT a BAD game, but comparing this to the old games... just dont, its doomed from the start.  Konami can wash away the shame by just putting Silent Hill 1-4 up for sale on Steam, and it would make a lot of old school gamers happy... come on Konami... i want you to take my money... but you have to give me some quality stuff in exchange\n\nIn light of recent events, i cannot express how dissapointed i am that all we got was this piece of crap and something awesome like P.T. will never be avalable on Steam... ♥♥♥♥ on this game, ♥♥♥♥ on konami","November 28, 2011","false","5.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Controls horrendous. Graphics pathetic and look 2002 era.\n\nThis is my first SH game and I hate it. When I had nearly finished chapter six I still had only have two hours game play on the clock.\n\nI am sick of dying. Stupid combat with inadequate weapons or no ammo. Sick as hell of having to repeat tragically difficult or awkward stuff. On top of that it crashes everytime I minimise it, like when looking for a walkthrough. Basically 2.5 hours of nothing and 50% of that time is from dying and repeating. What the hell is that for over 1/3 of the chapters of game?  Added to that pointless notes to read taking up time.\n\nAll I can say now is thank goodness a Steam copy arrived for £5.40, and not full Steam price of £18.\n\nI got worn out in the maze of the hotel in chapter six. I would do a tiny bit, and run back and save. Basically because save points are like one per chapter, occasionally two, and occasionally none. I tried to carry on a few times, and clawed my way through. Then finally I met the chapter six boss. It plays a trump card of insulting here. The combat controls change between the two stages of the boss fight. In the first half letting go of shift releases aim and you are free to move at normal speed. Second half, releasing shift does not let go of aim. It is toggled on.\n\nWrangling with the controls to axe the creature's arms is nearly impossible. By default it aims for the head which is out of reach. It is so hard to remember to cancel toggle shift after a strike. You get knocked down and get up to find you can hardly move because shift is still on. Smashed to the floor again. Maybe thirty goes at this boss. The end. I gave up. Four days it took me to try finish chapter six.\n\nI did come back and do a bit more, beat the ch 6 boss after about fifty goes. I played on a little and the insults just kept coming. One was a code for a locker was the time on a clock on a wall. Basically without the ammo in the locker you can't beat the next mini-boss monster. Of course you can't minimise the game to check a walkthrough fo the code because it will crash. Therefor you are bound to re-start from last save.","January 7, 2015","false","16.5"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

This is my biggest problem (and may be to do with my system) but the graphics look a little simplistic and dated, making it a 'look for the thing rendered more detailed' style gameplay - but the main gaping point is it's sooo dark i have to strain to play it....therefore i stopped playing it and never got passed the 'sanitorium' bit which is the first part. I literally can't see what i'm doing so the horror aspect is good when you see it, and the noises are creepy so jump scares aplenty, but other than that it's aimlessly wandering through a 'this door doesn't open so it must be the other one' style. Not really that exciting and didn't instill any confidence in wanting to try any others.

"love" like I have all the game cases lined up on my bookshelf for display and replay emulated copies of them often - Love.  What makes the series so great?  The story; the subtle psychological horror of you and a town gripped by subconcious evil.  A story of isolation that can only come from it's Japanese author.\nSilent Hill Homecoming takes this legacy and corrupts with American misunderstanding and pretty much performs sub-par on everything except what Konami had forbid them to change: the direction of the original author.  God help us....quick time events, shoe-horned love intrest [when will America stop this?!], and misunderstanding of enemy design [what the hell do they represent to Alex?].\nCompound all that with more frequent combat and more jumpscares [RE series jealousy?] and the subtle atmoshere is nearly lost.\n\nBut why do I recommend it?

The story of 'Silent Hill: Homecoming' left me cold. Very cold. It didn't really feel like a Silent Hill game at all. It was more like the movie (which I hated, btw).\n\nWhile the mist, the otherworld and most of the monsters fit into the series quite nicely, the main characters and the bosses however did not. I know they wanted it to be more like in the movie, and some of you might actually like that. The movie is really popular after all.\n\nThe controls are simple, battle works fine, but sometimes when attacked by a feral my game glitched and I couldn't fight it off, resulting in game over. Let's talk about puzzles. I like puzzles. Me and my SO have spent days on the puzzles of SH2, 3 and 4, but not homecoming. Not because the puzzles were bad, oh no. Most of the puzzles are the usual find item to go forward, with a few delicious exceptions. I particularly enjoyed the otherworld house. Music and themes fit nicely with the slightly out of focus and hopeless genre, sounds the enemies make are panic-inducing at times (especially the Needler, who the hell came up with that??), and voice acting, while a bit stiff, is way better than in a certain previous title.\n\nIt is hard for me to say that the game is bad, at least from the perspective of a devout fan, but I feel like I absolutely have to. I did not like this game. Silent Hill fan? You should try this game. Maybe even buy it, if you can get it for less than 15€.\n\nThere's one good thing about it though: Unlockable Pyramid Head Helmet.","June 4, 2014","false","37.4"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

As much as I played before my game actually glitched out and can't go further, the controls are nicely ported over considering this is a console port. Everything feels a bit laggy only because the game has a fps cap of 30 which is hardcoded in. It's a bit confusing at first because the controls aren't explained anywhere but it shouldn't be too hard to figure out. I'd probably stay away from this one since there seems to be a lot of bugs and that 30 fps limit.","November 5, 2011","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics are bad, even for its time, there's no such thing as lip sync, and the facial expresions are terrible.\n\nLetting all that aside...\n\n-As a videogame: I liked it, worth the 5€ that I paid for it on sale.\n\n-As an horror game: It's not scary, and when it tries to be controversial or shocking, it turns to be so over the top that I can't take it seriously, it managed to put me in tension at some points... whatever, it's fine.\n\n-As a Silent Hill game: ... No. I've played SH 1 to 4 and Downpour, and I love them all (even Downpour with its lame enemies and bad frame-rate), but I can't with this one, Homecoming is the worst of the 6 in everything (except the bosses and some enemies, it has some of the best in the franchise).\nNone of the characters are believable... and for that matter, not even likable. Alex is a good main character tho.\nThe ambientation is not there, the stages are lame, too gory (more than SH3, but in a worse way), sometimes it dumps super loud "scary" noises in your ears, which are only irritating. Compare that with the use of silence in SH2, with the opressive atmosphere of SH1 and 3, with the eerie and moody sounds of SH4 and Downpour... This game only has a good soundtrack for that matter. Oh! and it copies some aspects of the 1st film, I'm fine with it... except the smoke... It's supposed to be fog! that's a HUGE mistake by it's creators.\nPyramid Head is SO REDUNDANT in this game, it just shows up for a couple of seconds 2 times out of nowhere without making any sense (wasn't bounded to James?). Again trying to copy the film...\n\nThe plot is the weirdest of any Silent Hill that I've played, it's the most twisted too... I don't like it, it's so over the top and most characters are so unconvincing, it's my least favorite.\n\nThe design of the enemies is great, I didn't manage to get what represent all of them, but ♥♥♥♥, they look twisted, I liked Siam specially. The combat system is wack (but acceptable, Downpour and SH4 are the best at this), frustrating vs minions like dogs and easy against bigger enemies, the knife is the best weapon... by far.\n\nI loved the design of the bosses, the best part of this game by far, the stages where you fight them are bland (like the rest of the game) but the bosses are cool, super twisted and elaborated (their apearance is related to their backstory). This by itself makes this game worth a playthrough.\n\nTL;DR: Bad Silent Hill game, super glitched and with bad graphics, but with some redemning aspects to it. Worth only on sale if you can forgive mayor glitches, contradictory elements and some other crap. Not nearly as good as the 4 originals nor Downpour.\n\nP.S. You can get the UFO ending in a 1st playthrough (like happened to me) and that's quite ♥♥♥♥♥♥, I won't even bother trying to get a better ending, I'll watch a video. 0 replayability.","November 5, 2015","false","11.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

By that point I was so let down by my experience that I didn't bother trying to fix the problem. This review is based off of my experience in those two hours.\n\nGods, what a let down. I'm glad I got this game on sale, or else I'd be spitting hellfire right now. Anyways. On to my grievances.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=405044752\nNot once was I ever scared in my two hours of Homecoming, be it by the weakly designed monsters or the thinly veiled atmosphere. And I even tried to become immersed, playing completely in the dark with headphones and no other distractions. The characters are bland, the scares amateur and the whole game experience disappointing. Even the music is forgettable and boring.\n\nThe biggest problem I have with this game however, is Pyramid Head's brief (and anticlimactic) appearance.\n\nI mean, it's entirely pointless. PH is a Silent Hill 2 exclusive monster for canonical reasons, him being a hallucination as a part of James Sunderland's guilt-ridden psyche. PH showing up randomly for no damn reason is entirely pointless and completely shatters the thin crust of immersion I managed to accumulate from this sad drooling mess of a game. It's one of the biggest offences of non sexual fanservice I have ever seen, obviously done purely out of desperation to connect this game with its far superior predecessors. Also what the ♥♥♥♥ is Robbie doing in the game? Homecoming doesn't even take place in Silent Hill!\n\nAlso the 'other world' was introduced FAR too early in the game. What made the 'other world' so terrifying in earlier games was that it was introduced later on, after the player had built up a hefty load of unease and tension. You can't just slam your ace into your audience's faces right off the bat like that.\n\nWhat this game needed was uniqueness. If it had been released separately, as its own game without 'Silent Hill' in the title then it would have been a vaguely decent standalone horror title. Sure it still would probably have tanked, but at least it wouldn't have put a massive smear onto the name of a legendary series.\n\nDon't let the Silent Hill in the name fool you. This game isn't anything special, like the original games were. It's just a sad attempt to cash in on the dying franchise. I'd close this with a comment about looking forwards to Silent Hills but, well. We all know the fate of P.T by now. Rest in peace, you terrifying gem.\n\nBUGS:\nStuck on the second “cut” action in the medical theatre in the first level, unable to cut through it, had to reload game.\nCountless clipping texture issues.\nMonster ragdolls fell through the floor in several areas.\nBookshelf that leads to the panic room bugged, unable to re-examine it after going downstairs and triggering the cutscene with the mother.

Combat mechanics that will leave you in awe of how poorly executed the gameplay side (always) is.\n\nIf you do intend to go through the game, look up each of the monsters weaknesses online.\nThere are a series of monster counters that are arbitrary, unobvious, but necessary to succeed in fights. If you don't know these, you risk losing 1-3+ health items per engagement, which can force you to restart the game from the beginning if you run out before a dangerous part.\n\nFor example, if you're the sort who thinks a massive fireaxe would be a good counter against a slowly and steadily advancing undead nurse with a knife, you're already dead after being locked down into an unbreakable slicing and stabbing combo that prevents you from even opening the weapon screen, let alone attacking or dodging. And you can face up to 3 Nurses in one engagement.\n\n=== Bad PC Port Warnings ===\n\nControl CFG: Your controls may glitch back to default each time you load a save game. Only solution is to close the game and re-open it. If it keeps happening, you have to go into the game's binding cfgs and manually set both controller type and key for EVERY binding. Curiously this only seems to happen with the Keyboard/Mouse side of the controls.\n\nMinimize/Maximize: Do you use your computer for anything other than gaming?\nWell, it will probably have to be put on hold. If you minimize the game, it'll probably crash the next time you open it.\n\nMinimap: A chunk of the bottom may be cut out if you play on higher resolutions. If so, you will have to use the Zoom function to figure out where you are.\n\nFreezing: You may experience common, random freezes that last just long enough to convince you the game has perma-froze, and short enough to make sure you catch that quivering twitching knife or scythe in the face. God save you if it happens in the middle of a one-hit-kill-quick-time sequence.\n\n=== In Summary ===\n\nExactly what you would expect when a Japanese company turns over a famous franchise to a Western company. If you can endure combat that is repeatedly unexplained, unfair, and unpolished, you will enjoy atmosphere that is creepy, eerie, and engaging. The atmosphere is as good as the gameplay is bad.","April 28, 2015","false","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

By that point I was so let down by my experience that I didn't bother trying to fix the problem. This review is based off of my experience in those two hours.\n\nGods, what a let down. I'm glad I got this game on sale, or else I'd be spitting hellfire right now. Anyways. On to my grievances.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=405044752\nNot once was I ever scared in my two hours of Homecoming, be it by the weakly designed monsters or the thinly veiled atmosphere. And I even tried to become immersed, playing completely in the dark with headphones and no other distractions. The characters are bland, the scares amateur and the whole game experience disappointing. Even the music is forgettable and boring.\n\nThe biggest problem I have with this game however, is Pyramid Head's brief (and anticlimactic) appearance.\n\nI mean, it's entirely pointless. PH is a Silent Hill 2 exclusive monster for canonical reasons, him being a hallucination as a part of James Sunderland's guilt-ridden psyche. PH showing up randomly for no damn reason is entirely pointless and completely shatters the thin crust of immersion I managed to accumulate from this sad drooling mess of a game. It's one of the biggest offences of non sexual fanservice I have ever seen, obviously done purely out of desperation to connect this game with its far superior predecessors. Also what the ♥♥♥♥ is Robbie doing in the game? Homecoming doesn't even take place in Silent Hill!\n\nAlso the 'other world' was introduced FAR too early in the game. What made the 'other world' so terrifying in earlier games was that it was introduced later on, after the player had built up a hefty load of unease and tension. You can't just slam your ace into your audience's faces right off the bat like that.\n\nWhat this game needed was uniqueness. If it had been released separately, as its own game without 'Silent Hill' in the title then it would have been a vaguely decent standalone horror title. Sure it still would probably have tanked, but at least it wouldn't have put a massive smear onto the name of a legendary series.\n\nDon't let the Silent Hill in the name fool you. This game isn't anything special, like the original games were. It's just a sad attempt to cash in on the dying franchise. I'd close this with a comment about looking forwards to Silent Hills but, well. We all know the fate of P.T by now. Rest in peace, you terrifying gem.\n\nBUGS:\nStuck on the second “cut” action in the medical theatre in the first level, unable to cut through it, had to reload game.\nCountless clipping texture issues.\nMonster ragdolls fell through the floor in several areas.\nBookshelf that leads to the panic room bugged, unable to re-examine it after going downstairs and triggering the cutscene with the mother. Had to reload game. (This is the bug that killed the game for me.)","June 28, 2015","false","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are many things on this game that will irritate you all the time. I'll list some of those things below:\n\n-bizarre glitches\n-infinite loadings\n-annoying freezings\n-bad support for gamepad controller\n-low FPS\n-bad controller response\n-annoying camera\n-almost invincible bosses with a "hard-to-find" weak point\n-a SH that you don't play in SH town (WTF?)\n-etc\n-etc\n-etc\n\nSummarizing: generally, a SH game give you the creeps and some scares, which is something nice when we talk about a survive horror game. But this one will make you more bored and angry than excited the most of the painful gameplay experience. If you intend to buy this game and play it to make you feel "complete" as a hard fan of SILENT HILL, just like me, think about it twice. Honestly, I cannot say I regret to buy this game, but surely I can tell you SH Homecoming is a really disappointing game for all those reasons I listed above.

The continued sale of this unsupported and fundamentally flawed product at 39.99 can only serve to polarize unwitting purchasers against the publisher and developer alike.\n\nI originally bought this title as part of a sale in 2011.  As a huge fan of the first 3 silent titles I had high hopes despite mixed reviews.  However, I immediately regretted my decision. The port was so buggy I was unable to progress more than a few minutes into the game.  This game sat dormant within my library for 5 years with only 6 minutes of play until Steam’s revised return policy gave me a chance to right my mistake.  Sadly, steam did not grant my refund, 5 years is a long time, so half hoping to work myself into tizzy I reinstalled.  Well it worked….kind of.  Whether the result of a patch or my new hardware I was able to complete the game, though at times wised I hadn’t.\n\nSilent hill homecoming features the series trademark moody, misty, and mysterious environments.  The game play is built around over the shoulder 3rd person combat, typical fetch quest, puzzles, and even a few undercooked metroidvainia style elements.  However, depth clearly wasn’t a design driver.  The fetch quests are simple, and due to relatively barren environments it doesn’t take to long to figure out what goes to what.  Next, Homecoming is missing legacy features like combine item, and inventory item examination thus removing further depth from this installment of the franchise.  But don’t despair, with the exception of a few mid game riddles, Homecoming treats you to puzzles like that slide puzzle at your dentist office or there own R rated version of the baby shape game.\n\nThe combat system is almost a bright spot.  The Combat utilizes several melee weapon classes and small arms featuring a relatively linear progression in reach and damage.  While the ranged combat is what you might expect from a 3rd person shooter, the melee combat is more developed than any previous SH title.  Players can dodge attacks, counter, block, heavy attack, execute finishers, and even combo in game.  Sounds pretty sweet right, and it would be if it wasn’t for your ability to crit-lock nearly all enemies, broken quick time events, and unfriendly camera angles.  Your inventory is also oddly limited.  For despite Alex’s ability to carry a knife, pipe, axe, shotgun, pistol, and rifle your character can’t seem to find more than a handful of space for ammo, making the survival horror staple of stockpiling resources a no go.\n\nOne thing I did like was Homecomings story and voice work.  The campaigns premise while unoriginal just works, and late game plot reveals do a great job making sense of memory flashes and found tokens.  In addition I found myself constantly guessing at who Alex is.  Is he crazy, already dead, or a resident of otherworld like Lisa from first Silent Hill.  Hell, for half the game I was pretty sure Alex was an imaginary friend.  Despite these great story elements Homecoming features some terribly developed characters, none of whom seem to find perpetual mist, infrastructure ending sink holes, or an army of other worldly demons all that odd.  While the game cleans this up late game in a Shamalan style twist, it does so at the cost of creating plot holes you could drive a bus through.\n\nGraphically the game might be best described a barren, even for a port.  A lot of environmental objects are use repeatedly but sparingly.  The textures also are so underwhelming you might not realize Alex’s jacket is desert-camo and not desert tan.  The character models and monsters however are greatly detailed and feel a bit out of place in the low poly count world.\n\nIn terms of replay value Silent Hill Homecoming features 4 different endings based on three critical decision events distributed evenly throughout the campaign.  Since we got one ending, and one bonus costume out of our 11 hour campaign pass we’re confident there is a lot of game play left for the masochist that needs to see it all, but most of you should just Youtube them instead.  With the exception maybe of running about town bashing monsters wondering what could have been we can’t suggest buying.\n\nWorst of all the game has a tendency to crash and at a minimum freezes for sometimes 30seconds at a time making it one of the least stable games in my collection.  We try to keep our reviews free of outrage.  Others have done it first and better, but even I found it difficult to maintain an objective tone while evaluating this title.  We suggest you don’t buy at any price point.  As always I hope this review has informed your purchase. Be well.\n\n-Bandersuke\n","February 13","false","11.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
