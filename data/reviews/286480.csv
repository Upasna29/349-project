I prefer part 3 over part 2, but nothing tops the first one ;)\nIf you haven’t played the other games, I do not recommend this game, since you won’t get much of the story and some important facts won’t be revealed to you. If you played them, you shouldn’t miss out on this one!\n\nPart 3 is even darker than the other two games and the creepiness is reaching a new peek towards the final truth. The shocking and bloody moments, just like a delusional main character, makes it a very convincing and thrilling story.\nThe story continues with Darren's, uhm, Adrian’s search for the truth of his past and a dark soul slowly taking over his possession. We move around in the usual setting of Willow Creek and get to see some new locations and old places from the first games with new graphic perspectives and of course some familiar faces (who would forget about Ralph and Mr. Bubby?)…\n\nYou can die several times during the game, as you make wrong decisions or react too slow.\nThe gameplay is much the same as in the other games, nothing to complain here. At some point you were able to play two characters and switch between them. I’m not a fan of this game mode usually, because it may cause a lot of effort to explore every object twice, but they managed to find a nice solution for that.\n\nI got stuck a few times, and even noticed a glitch about triggering the right moment during a puzzle, but it worked out fine in the end. The story was packing the whole time and the connections between the other games were perfectly considered. The atmosphere was great, as always, with detailed graphics and a perfect mix of music and sound effects. Every character had its own interesting storyline and the voice acting was well done.\n\nTowards the end the cutscenes, dialogues and puzzles all of a sudden become longer and longer. That lasted until the end and felt a little sluggish, but that was just a little thing that bothered me. All in all this is a worthy end for the series and I’m not disappointed a bit. And for a sale-deal or even the original price on Steam, you can’t do anything wrong.\n\n(Note: People, who complain about the game just being English on Steam, should be advised to read the description first. No reason to downvote the game, because Steam won’t release it in their language!)","November 17, 2014","true","15.7"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","21","22","0","1"

It started with a series of long dialogs and uneventful actions and I remember wondering if it would ever get interesting. Then things got a little better, but not much, and then had me yawning and rolling my eyes at the end.\n\nPersonally, I am more into games that combine gathering-and-combining with logic puzzles, deductions and not too long dialogs, which is why I (who played the previous two) felt disappointed. This game gave me very (I do mean very) long dialogs, 90% gather-and-combine and just five puzzles in the whole game. From those five, three were "remember the image you saw before  and you are done" and only two were logic puzzles. I will not say if they were easy or hard, because that varies from player to player. My problem was that they were just two!\n\nThere are a few glitches. I was forced to skip on a "puzzle" (which was no puzzle, really) because the right answer was not recognized, so I could never move on from it. I had to go to the walkthrough to find out that it was, indeed, a glitch.\n\nNow, the story... Oh well, taste is subjective and I can only say what it was for me. Compared to how much I liked the story in the first game and how I was already sort of disappointed by the second, this one really didn't do it for me. They start, as I said, too slow and uneventful, then they try to regain the "creepiness" of the previous stories(the creepy tortures and experiments that the doctors were conducting, the morgue, etc.)but, for me, it was like "yeah, I saw that already in the previous two games". For the last three chapters, they take the player on a rollercoaster of Catholic fervor mixed up with a pagan ritual gone wrong and a spiritual hero on a battle for his soul, the future of mankind and even the very foundation and preservation of the Catholic Church. Religious beliefs aside, I felt that the writers aimed at doing something original and overdid the plot, cramming a lot of long dialogs and clips at the end with very little choice or interaction (save click here, put that there) from the player.\n\nI am not toooo sorry that I got it, as now I at least know how it ends. But I wish I had waited for a better discount (I couldn't help myself and got it with the 20% off release). This was definitely not my cup of tea! But, as I said, if you are into this kind of game, this is a great one, which is the only reason I will click on "yes" recommend this game. The voices sounded very nice to me, and I have to say that I liked the images very much. I liked to wander the castle that I once wandered as Samuel and remeber events from that first Black Mirror, like the sound of the potatoes on the fire in the kitchen when I went to talk to Bates.","April 13, 2014","true","19.5"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","22","25","0","2"

The repurcusisons of the events of the second game now litter Willow Creek and it's residents, and by doing what the trilogy is best at, you get to explore a place changed by sinister evil and terrible events.\n\nAs with it's prequels, the game is stunning to look at, and the story is dark but satisfying.  It is, in fact, at it's very best when a peculiar character called "Phil" comes into play in what is, unfortunately, a rather twisted side story which is left hanging and without any satisfactory resolution.  it is an almost odd inclusion in the game and one which feels almost half finished - slightly extraneous if truth be told, which is a pity as it fits into the twisted world of Willow Creek quite nicely.\n\nBut, Black Mirror III is a game that knows where it wants to go, and it intends to gat there by the most direct route.  You want to know how it's going to end.  You're invested in the Gordon family by now, and want the castle to finally give up it's secrets.  Sadly, this is maybe the biggest weakness of BMIII - the final few rooms are rather a let down, as they could only ever be after such a monumental journey.  One thing I have found with the trilogy, is that when the games actually comes close to Mordred Gordon in terms of the secret catacombs and traps which guard his secrets, the games are significantly less interesting than they are when you are roaming Willow Creek.  It's as if the games are unable to live up to their own expectations as they reach their conclusions, and as such they do fall flat a little.\n\nBut that's a minor gripe  I found the Black Mirror trilogy to be majestic from start to finish.  If there is one final annoyance however, it's the lack of 'what happened next' in terms of Willow Creek and it's inhabitants.  By the end of the trilogy there will be some names you will be familiar with and places you will know well, and it would have been a nice way to end to find out if Edward really did get the job he desired to badly, or how a couple of Willow Creek's more "challenged" residents fared after the dust settled.\n\nBut no matter.  It was a nice touch, that the game developers hinted that although the Gordon Curse may finally be resolved, there could be more shade-busting adventures to be had, but sadly, short of Kickstarter I couldn't see any possible return to Black Mirror castle or Willow Creek.  But for what it was worth, the experience was truly fantastic, and it's a shame all games can't be made with such skill and passion.\n\nOne of, if not the very best series of point 'n' click games I have ever played.","August 2, 2015","true","9.9"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

What about that prisoner that was in the cell with Adrian? The cops didn't even give a fudge about the slightly bad situation he ended up in.

Black Mirror II ends pretty definitively (or so it seems). That said, I'm glad i rediscovered it and decided to play, as the Black Mirror series are some of my favorite point and clicks and III adds a lot to the series.\n\nFor one thing, there is a marked difference, in my opinion, in how coherent the storyline is. The first game was interesting, but sort of all over the place - if there's one thing that forcing a more linear rigidity does give to a game, it's the gift of coherence. With II becoming more linear, it was slightly more understandable what you were doing at any given time and why, and this one seems to have really maxed that trait out.\n\nThis is a very interesting and dark point and click horror game that fans of the genre will really enjoy, whether or not they have played the first two (it does a good job of introducing characters and events previously used in the series without being too hamfisted.) The locations are fun to explore and the plot has lots of depth. If you're into history, family dramas, insanity studies, or atmospheric creepers you'll have a good romp with this one.

It left me with seriously mixed feelings. I felt incredibly annoyed at some of the puzzles (especially near the end, and because of it I didn't bother finishing up anymore). It was too aggravating.\n\nToo many challenges at the wrong time! I hate when a game leaves me feeling braindead (and this was the case with BM 3).\n\nAs much as I love the graphics & the main characters (+ subcharacters), some of the puzzles really blew it for me.\n\nAnd I felt there were too many elements introduced (be it story-wise or character-wise), which created quite a bit of "loose ends" (i.e. unexplained phenomena, no follow-up in regard to certain events that had taken place throughout the series).\n\nThis game bugged me to the core due to:\n\n- the absence of multiple solutions to one problem\n(I can clearly remember one time, where I needed an item to seal off the entrance to a cave *near* the local morgue - which had a fitting item *at* the morgue, that could have been used to achieve this, but noooo - the game had me running all the way back to the castle - TO THE OTHER SIDE OF TOWN - to get an item I had specifically examined before but couldn't pick up, as the character exclaimed "not needing" it - NICE! NOT!)\n\n- utterly weird parts that felt disconnected & unbelievable (e.g. a homeless guy who was introduced in BM 1, who reappeared in BM 3 while living at some ancient ruins with no visible food source or decent shelter - HELLOOO? how is that possible?)\n\n- the lack of consistency in regard to interior design (more notably; the rooms & hallway in the castle not really looking the way they did before & some areas not being mentioned, even though BM 3 takes place only 3 weeks after the ending of BM 2!)\n\n- 2/3rds of the game being spent trying to prove the protagonist's innocence in regard to a serious series of events that had taken place in BM 2, only to end up solving one tedious & aggravating puzzle after another, JUST to break the Gordon family's curse! (it was just TOO much)\n\n- the altered map system (I eventually grew used to it, but it was totally unnecessary)\n\n- the main character's sudden open mind & approach during therapy sessions with the local psychiatrist, even though he's the levelheaded, down-to-earth, smart, cautious type - blurting out every obscure detail of his occult experiences up until now (only to moan about the fact he's not taken seriously!! - that was so out of character for this guy!)\n\n- some awkward repetitiveness feeling rather unnatural (e.g. daily phonecalls to a fortune teller, only to have the main character moan about how what he gets to hear is a load of crap - well stop calling then?!)\n\nUnfortunately, this installment of the series ended up annoying me terribly. It had some fun & exciting parts, but I can't help but wonder whether the whole crew wanted to have their say, and have their ideas implemented, which eventually had the developers adding a mish-mash of elements (to please everyone perhaps?), but couldn't make it work into a believable, cohesive story.\n\nJust like in BM 2, I felt like the supernatural parts didn't blend well with the realistic elements in game. It wasn't all that bad, but in the end it felt like they wanted too much of everything.\n\nI would still recommend getting it (as part of the pack - BM | BM2 | BM3), and most definitely play from the start... otherwise it gets very confusing.","January 25","true","22.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

But when you enter maze room, save immidiately on a new slot, because if you lure the ghost into "incorrect" room and save after that you will not be able to complete the game.","August 6, 2015","false","18.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Essentially the second half of one game (BM2 being the first half), the game's first few acts are okay but are just more of the same from the previous entry. It has pretty much the same locations and the same cast of characters. The game has even less horror then the previous entries in the series (which barely had any to start with) and even goes some lengths to make Mordred relatable or even likeable. The final act is incredibly cheesy and filled with some rather annoying puzzles (and a laughable cutscene confrontation with Mordred). The end contains no great insight or revelations or surprises, just a rather boring end to the whole saga. There's also religious aspects in the final chapters that seem out of place with the game's pagan themes and secular protagonist. In conclusion, avoid this series and spend your money and time elsewhere.","August 15, 2015","false","25.1"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

This third installment improved on literally everything. Well, apart from the catastrophic ending! However, it can be overlooked if you're purely playing because you're a fan of the series. Unfortunately, the ending barely made any sense because they jumbled every fact they had collected together to make some sort of explanation as to why Mordred is doing these things. It was unsatisfying, but that is the only negative side to this game.\nNot as many puzzles as in its predecessors, which for me is great because they drive me absolutely ♥♥♥♥ing mental, but for those who are going out of their way to look for them it's a little disappointing; plus they've become a lot easier (or I've just become smarter, who knows?)\nI definitely recommend it, honestly there aren't very many games out there quite like these, unless you want to delve into the 2004 wave of point-and-click and search through mounds of Nancy Drew until you find what you really enjoy.\nGive it a go, it's always included in any Steam sale, especially the bundle for all three games which you can get for like 5 bucks in a sale.\nIt's worth it.\nTrust me.","February 11","true","13.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I felt it was as good as the first, possibly better, and I liked that it rounded out the trilogy in a satisfying way. Yes, still some tedious tasks. The only real problem I had with II and III was that I didn't care for the main character at all. He wasn't likable so it was hard to really care whether he succeeded or not (only because I was playing as him did I feel concern about reaching the end). Samuel in the first game is a much better character. I still didn't figure out how to take pictures correctly in order to open the bonus games. This was something that was started in game 2 but I only took one picture in that one that was accepted. In this one, from the start I literally took a picture of just about everything the main character was supposed to check out in every single scene, but the list was still pretty grayed out when I checked at the end. Why won't they tell what you're supposed to do here to get the bonus achievements? That didn't make much sense to me. Oh, the puzzle to trap the two souls...man, was that hard! I saved like every few steps, which was a good thing because when I inevitably died, I didn't have to go back too far.","May 14","true","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
