Physics/ environment wise is amazing! Really loving the space atmosphere and the "gravity free" feel to it. I think this game would look spectacular with the Oculus Rift. Controls are pretty intuitive and definitely adds challenge to the gameplay! Also I could swear my head is still spinning from all the spins during the game ha!\n\nHowever, as a Sci fi/ space game lover I would love to see more to the game environment (perhaps other shuttles, the ISS, probes, making the ships accessible to the cabin etc, perhaps even stars to really enhance the visuals? Making the environment bigger too would be great especially with such freedom in movements).\n\nAs for the gameplay, I would love to see perhaps co-op/ multiplayer gameplay because I think team work in this game would add more fun and realism to it. I would also like to see more interactive and different missions, instead of just mostly hovering on different waypoints,  Maybe users could also even design their own missions?\n\nOverall, great, chilled, relaxing simulator with huge potential!\n\n\nEDIT: I forgot, could you also include more dialogues, the radio dialogues get too repeated at times and we could sure use an options page as well in the menu.","April 2, 2015","true","2.4"," 25 of 34 people (74%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","74","25","34","5","0"

For the low price that it is, Astronaut Simulator is reasonably well received in my eyes. Simulator? Not entirely immersive, but the control scheme does require some practice before you get the hang of it. But what do you expect for a less-than £5 title?\n\nThere are obviously much more immersive and/or higher-detailed games out there for us space-sim lovers, but honestly I had fun playing around with this for the shorter-half of an hour on my alternate account. And I'm sure I will continue to enjoy it when I feel like I need a break from the more hardcore simulations I frequent.","April 5, 2015","true","0.2"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","12","17","2","0"

Its verry simplistic, all you have to do is move around The Endeavor and other space Shuttles and fix things, yet it can get SUPER intense when you loose control of yourself and slowly start drifting off in to the Deep Dark space that awaits to devour you, ya it can get kinda scary too. Its a great little game, and if you like anything to do with space this is somthing you will want to have in your library. If that sounds interesting then this is something you will defenitly wanna pick up.\n","April 5, 2015","true","0.8"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","14","22","0","0"

It's a very good game to give a go at, but I wouldn't say it's for everyone.\n\nIt can be extremely frustrating trying to get through the very first level (if you can), as you have to really try to control the precise movements of the astronaut. Small movements are important (very few button presses to release N2), and taking your time is crucial. It's very easy to screw up, so make sure you're pressing the right button, or you may go into a panicked frenzy of button pressing that jetisons you off into the darkest regions of the nether that is space..!\n\n...\n\nDon't buy it if you can't handle a good challenge, or don't have a lot of time to spare in getting really good at pretending to be an astronaut.","August 15, 2015","true","0.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","2"

Simple in the surface but very rewarding.

I could barely move with it and only got to one checkpoint in the tut before losing energy and not be able to stop spinning. So I pretty much laughed the game off for awhile untill today, I came to the conclusion to try it again. We'll Let me point this out, The controls are a little better and controlable with a keyboard they're still a bit wacky. I almost finished the tut before running out of energy. I made up my mind to try a mission. I was doing great untill I realized the energy bar is sooooo stupid. It's like trying  to keep a charge on a Ipod 1st Gen. The game is relaxing but needs quite a bit of help. If this game had like mechanics where your hands and stuff move or when you fix something you actuallly have a animation. Or even a bit more distinct way of finding the objectives.\n*Pros.\n*Pretty Decent Graphcs and Designs.\n*Good Specs.\n*Really cool voice clips from real space missions.\n*Decent music.\n*Gamepad support (HIGHLY UNRECOMMENDED)\n\n*Cons.\n*Terrible movement.\n*Energy bar runs out WAY to fast.\n* I'd like to do missions inside the cabin too.\n*Once out of control with no energy you're done\n*The two little boxes that display info are kinda tacky.\n*No user menu interface. (Can't change video, Buttons, Sensitivity ETC)\n\n\n\nConclusion: I can't determine if this game is for you or not. I wish I could put my review as  inbetween because\nit's negative and positive at the same time, One update is all this game needs and a couple of fixes and then I'll recommend the game.

Quite a pixel show.\n- Player can't set the resolution at all.\n- Some more interesting tasks, not only fly to a point and stay there.\n- The Earth is spinning, when you fly over it with the shuttle in an orbit lower than 36.000 km.\nThe shuttle and MIR were mostly in a lower orbit.\n- Dialog loop too short, you hear it over and over again.

That's not to say it's a bad game or anything, but i just can't bring myself to recommend it to other people if only because it's not quite as interesting as I hoped it would be. There really isn't a lot to do other than "go here, wait, go there, wait, go here, wait, go there, wait, go back here, end level" all while admiring a beautiful scene of earth as you orbit around it, and the space beyond. Controls are easy if you use a controller, though they might take a while to get used to and gameplay's pretty simple and slow. pretty much your objective is to fly to waypoints and sometimes wait at them before heading back to the ship before your O2 or NO2 runs out. Bare bones and basic really. I was hoping that some of the waypoints that required you to wait by them to "make repairs" would have involved some small hud animation or even a little quick time event or something that would involve the player doing anything while they waited so that they're not bored twiddling their thumbs. Over all, it's a time killer for people who are really into simulations. If you wanna know what it's like to float around in "Zero G" while operating an "MMU" this is the game for you. otherwise, you might be more interested to play "Moonbase Alpha"","June 6, 2015","false","1.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"
