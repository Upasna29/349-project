(Meaning don't know how to proceed)\nThough I suppose that could be considered par for the course for this genre of game.\nI had to glance at a walkthrough myself on the second mission .. though I do my best not to do this.\n\nAlso being a DOS game the sound stutters mildly from time to time.. I suppose that should be expected but would be nice if it didn't happen.\n\nAnd finally an issue that I find the most annoying, though really not all THAT bad, is the Star Map navigation.\nIt is impossible, and I mean that literally, impossible to nagivate without either the manual on hand or a Star Chart\nwhich can be found by one of the friendly people in the forums or somewhere online.\nI really despise needing anything outside of the game, to play the game lol.\nBut really I suppose it's not so bad to have the Star Chart up on a laptop or second monitor, or something;\nor even better yet printed out. (Man if only I had a printer :P )\n\nIf you like this game, you might also consider getting Judgment Rites which is the sequel.\nI am gonna be playing that once I complete this one, myself.\n\nAnyways.. overall awesome game, highly recommend it to anyone who it looks interesting to,\nparticularly Trek fans.","May 8, 2015","true","6.6"," 34 of 34 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","34","34","2","3"

If you clicked the wrong star system you would get attacked and be potentially destroyed. This was an early anti software piracy feature before the days of DRM and always on internet connections. During the mission you and the three other shore party members interact with the environment and each other to achieve the mission obejectives. When interacting with NPCs, you as Captain Kirk, sometimes have dialogue options ranging from diplomatic to snarky. At the end of the mission you're given a score by a Strafleet admiral based on your mission performance.\n\nThe only parts of the Enterprise you really see are the bridege, and the trasporter room before you beam down to the mission. A feature I always like was accessing the ships computer by pressing "c" on the bridge and searching for information to solve a mission puzzle, or to just look random stuff up.\n\nThis is the Enhanced CD-ROM version which includes voiced dialogue by the characters, additional sounds, etc. I liked how the computer read out was voiced just like on the show, added a nice touch.\n\nThe only "problems" I have with the game is that outside of the bridge you don't really see or interact with the other characters (Scotty, Sulu, etc.), and the mission evaluations at the end of each mission can feel somewhat arbitrary. You can't really tell why Starfleet gave you say 91% instead of 100%.\n\nStar Trek 25th Anniversary and it's sequel Judgement Rites are two very rare Star Trek games in that they're actually good (imho). They capture the essence of the series by emphasing thought over action, by which I mean you'll be using your tricorder more than your phaser. A must have for fans of the series, and if you enjoy old school click based adventures you should probably check this out as well.\n\n\n","May 9, 2015","true","5.8"," 20 of 20 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","20","20","0","1"

It's hilarious when you accidentally kill lots of people and hear it. It was hard not to do it over and over again back when this game was new. Half the fun was finding ways to kill everybody, good or bad, and messing with Bones to elicit fun responses in all the scenarios. I also like watching ragdoll Max Payne falling to his death and bending through rafters, so take it for what you will.\n\nThe game has great voice acting and dialogue options. This was back when they actually tried to produce good content and didn't try and skate by on graphics like most new games that suck. You can google the starmap and manual if it's too hard to figure out. Definitely recommend. The story and realism it provides will never be dated.","December 27, 2015","true","3.4"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","94","16","17","4","0"

Steam and GOG.com is bringing back so many classics.  The CD-ROM edition is the *superior* version of this.  It also makes it easier (for simple folks) to load and play.  I have the originals but to get everything in place to work.  The hand drawn art is a thing of beauty.  Everything has the familiar look and the voice acting wasn't "phoned" in so it feels geniune.  The 8 espiodes in the game have a original series narrative to it so it's like a lost season.  Judgement Rites is the same way.  BTW keep the map handy, I forgot you need it to get from point A to point B!  Otherwise, you'll get to enjoy the outnumbered ship to ship battle to the pain!","May 11, 2015","true","0.2"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","0"

The graphics are rather dated and will on modern PC's be limited to a small windowed screen. Which is fine because that leaves room for a notepad file and the navigation map to be on your screen for quick reference.\n\nNow just to wait for the rest of the old catalog of Interplay games to come to Steam.\n\nThis is a oldschool game and can seem rather dated by today's standards. But the voice acting is all the original cast and top notch.","May 8, 2015","true","2.7"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","8","9","2","0"

I never knew until much later that Star Trek 25th Anniversary was actually the predecessor to Judgment Rites but I always wanted to play it for years. Interesting to note that around this time, I also finished the Star Trek 25th Anniversary game for NES which was pretty good considering the limitations of the console.\n\nI would highly recommend this game to any hardcore Star Trek fans as every level plays out like an episode from the series. It has superb voice acting from the cast of the Original Series, authentic sound and music, challenging puzzles that took me days to solve without looking at a walkthrough and overall it’s just a really good game that captures the spirit of Star Trek far more than Star Trek Online. The main problem is of course that the graphics are dated, but it’s easy to move past this once you put a few hours into it. The final battle is really tough, but not Kobayashi Maru impossible.\n","July 28, 2015","true","16.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

After sinking a couple hours into it so far, here are my thoughts.\n\nPros:\n\n- Fantastic voice acting and writing - The original cast is present in all their glory.\n- Great writing - The episodic storyline feels like an authentic piece of the series.\n- Good dosbox tweaks - While it's clear that Interplay didn't put a lot of effort into porting this one (basically just bundling it with Dosbox and auto-launching), I do have to give them credit for customizing the dosbox settings for relatively smooth playback.   The resulting experience is the way it SHOULD be played.\n- Creative puzzles - There are some great puzzles to solve here (which is a critical part of any adventure game right?).\n\nNeutral:\n- Very minor bugs - There are some extremely subtle bugs (for example num pad keys not typing text until numlock key is hit twice).  Nothing that significantly impacts gameplay.\n- Nothing new - I get it. It's a port of a classic adventure game and  Interplay wants to maximize profits by re-introducing it.   That's fine.  If you've already played it though, don't expect any major (or minor) differences.\n\nAdmittedly, I think I'm experiencing this with rose-tinted glasses. Still, if you'd a child of the 90's like me and grew up with this, it's an easy buy.","May 24, 2015","true","4.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I had no idea they had rereleased the game on CD-Rom with voice overs, which is neat. It is pretty much required to have and read the game manual, which you can find online. As this game is from the early 90s, it doesn't age very well, but that does not make it any less good. It is also nice to have a game that is challenging and does not hold your hand.","May 9, 2015","true","0.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It belongs to the era of video games in which far less pixels were used to render the graphics. No one who plays HD games could take a title from this era very seriously at first glance. For those who have played it, like me, the gameplay far outshines the minimalist appearance. Full of authentic gadgets, weapons, alien technology and races faithful to the OS of Star Trek, the 25th Anniversary is a masterpieces of discovery and action. The battles with the Elasi pirates, the unveiling of an ancient and advanced civilization beneath the surface of a Federation Colony, to the Klingon trial and the conspiracy to build duplicate ships Enterprise, all combine to create what I believe to be an admirable extension of the series. What could have been filmed became part of a game that nicely implemented space combat, ground fighting and real time puzzle solving. Broken Sword owes its existence to this product. It put point and click games on the map and showed fans of Star Trek that simplicity can't get in the way of a good experience.","August 7, 2015","true","0.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
