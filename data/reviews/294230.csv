"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shikono/recommended/294230/","shikono","Elfee","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shikono/","382 products in account","The game „Millie“ reminds me of the same basic concept as the classic game „Snake“ has. With eating / collecting pellets your body grows and you have to take care that you don’t colide with yourself.\n\nIn Millie you play a cute colorful millipede which is detailed designed. Also the music and comic influences are in a cute childish style.\n\nThe aim in Millie is to get all pellets (+ maybe upgrades) and to get her to aviation school so that she can become a pilot. But the story does not match the gameplay. It’s more something additionally.\nThe upgrades in the game can help you in different ways, for example making the body of Millie shorter again or destroying walls. So you should better collect them.\n\nWith finishing levels you also unlock minigames which are really challenging if you want to get good playing times and always full rewards.\n\nBut in general I think this game is just something for boring times in between. I don’t regret that I bought this classic game for such a cheap price and I think I will play it from time to time.\n","April 22, 2014","true","1.7"," 59 of 64 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","59","64","0","1"

Navigate mazes filled with corridors, collect all the pellets, and reach the exit, all without running into your own body, which elongates as you eat pellets. Familiar with Rattlesnake from Windows Entertainment Pack, which I recall had easier levels, I wanted to see how this compared.\n\nIt was fun for me in the beginning, but this was because the levels started out small enough that you could see the entire playing field on screen at once. By the time you access world 2 of 3, they become so big that even the zoom button won't show you the whole thing. This is important, because as you progress the levels become trickier, with more bottlenecks that you have to identify and clear early before emptying the rest of the stage. So, there's an increasingly heavy trial-and-error aspect that I don't really like. In addition, Millie's body becomes so long in these larger levels that, in order to eat those last few pellets you're missing, you have to take the long way around the whole area multiple times, just to avoid running into yourself. I've gone from taking 1 or 2 minutes to clear a stage, to taking multiple 5-minute attempts to clear just one, and I'm not even halfway done with the game as of this writing.\n\nThe zoom button pauses gameplay, and because the default camera is often zoomed in too close to anticipate bottlenecks and such, you'll have to zoom out constantly to make sure you aren't going down the wrong path. Not only does this make the pacing tedious, it suggests the developers wanted to enforce a memory aspect, which again is something I don't really like.\n\nThere are powerups, like hammers that break cracked walls and sirens that let you go both ways on one-way streets. I was hoping these would add variety to the levels, since there are nearly 100 of them, but they never seemed to make enough of a difference in the gameplay. They activate instantly upon pickup and last less than 30 seconds, so you have to know where to use them first, but again, since the levels become so large, you often have to make a preliminary attempt just to discover all the noteworthy areas. I feel the levels become challenging less by creative use of different mechanics, and more by increasing level size and number of bottleneck areas.\n\nIf the premise interests you, and the above points don't bother you, go ahead and give it a try. Otherwise, be warned that it becomes much more difficult than the mood of its trailer suggests.","April 23, 2014","false","6.0"," 89 of 114 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","89","114","2","0"

It's a kind of remake on a large scale of the well-known snake-games, where you have to eat your way through labyrint-like levels of increasing difficulty and complexity. While Millie eats her heart out, she grows longer and longer, and so there is an ever-increasing chance of eating ... your own tail. Happily, there are several means provided to make life a bit easier: there are clocks to rewind the time, hammers to smash through walls and even scissors ... to cut a bit off your own tail. Ouch.\nBy going through tons of levels, one can obtain stars (needed to buy the extra items), and shoes. With these shoes, one unlocks new levels. Quite simple, well-tried, and still effective. Graphics are nice and colourful, sounds are pretty good - I love the sound of Millie eating ;-).\nBut it takes hours and hours to really progress through the levels, as some are really very difficult, and only the most stubborn will reach the end of it I suppose. I got bored after a couple of hours, but my daughter isn't yet ;-). The game has full controller support, which is nice, but the controls seems to be rather sluggish and get some time to get used too.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/serieus1/recommended/294230/","serieus1","Serieus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/serieus1/","2327 products in account","Millie is a game that resembles the Snake game found on old school TI-82 calculators, QBASIC, or cell phones.  However, instead of an open screen, you are stuck in a maze picking up a bunch of dots like Pacman, minus the ghosts.  You're given a few tools in your toolkit to help you along you way and you must finish the level by collecting a certain number of dots and a certain number of shoes.  The game itself is perfect.  It plays very well, the artstyle fits the genre of the game and makes it perfect for kids.  The game towards the end takes a long time per level, which can make it frustrating when you are stuck or die and have to start all over.  However, the story line is very mediocre.  It's a story of a milipede that dreams to fly.  So that means that every third level you find yourself in a flying game.  The flying games are not well done and can be frustrating if you're looking to get a good score on them.  Overall, the game is fun and I highly recommend it if you enjoy a casual snake like game.","March 9, 2015","true","17.8"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","21","24","0","0"

"Nonsense", Millie declares, the anthropomorphic arthropod protagonist of the maze navigating puzzle game of the same name. She's a girl full of dreams, which makes it rather a dreadful shame that my hopes for Millie were all but completely dashed in the end, leaving me sad and wondering what went wrong.\n\nThe developers describe Millie as a puzzle game, but it's easier to think of it as Snake meets Pac-Man. Running through mazes your goal is to devour a set number of pellets and make it back to start without running into your bum, which grows longer with each pellet you eat, creating a train of legs which follow your pattern and threaten to cut off your path if you don't plan in advance. As a huge fan of both the games it takes inspiration from this sounded fantastic, but Millie screws up in a handful of ways which managed to all but completely destroy the experience for me.\n\nA bigger issue than anything, controlling Millie is an absolute nightmare. She's clunky to turn at the best of times, but more often than not fails to turn at all or does so too early, almost always forcing you to restart a level as you find yourself trapped in a maze of yourself. Adding onto this frustration is the deliberately inflated difficulty of limited power ups (most notably the one that lets you rewind time briefly to undo your mistakes), which I can only imagine are a carryover from a mobile F2P model given the inclusion of an in game store (though everything is purchasable with stars you earn from playing the game). It doesn't seem like it would be an issue at first, but despite the kid friendly aesthetic Millie is an astonishingly challenging game. I found myself having to meticulously plan my every move just to be able to finish levels, which requires a level of memorization and precision that felt far above what should be expected from this sort of game.\n\nI had high (perhaps admittedly too high) hopes for what Millie could be, but after only a little more than an hour I couldn't take anymore of it. The unnecessarily high difficulty, pour balance of power ups, and astonishingly bad controls sucked away whatever fun could have been, which not even the extremely cute art direction could hope to salvage. I can only speculate at how much content the entirety of Millie contains, not having the stamina to finish it myself, but for all the levels it contains  and the appendages of its lead, Millie doesn't have a leg to stand on.","June 19, 2014","false","1.3"," 29 of 42 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","29","42","0","6"

Millie doesn’t suffer from any big gameplay drawbacks, bugs, or anything like that; the biggest problem of all is perhaps the fact that there simply isn’t anything new under the sun. The premise is cute, but there’s not much of a story going on beyond that. Controls work well, but the gameplay itself offers nothing new or even somewhat innovative. In the end though, Millie’s joyful quest to fly, the brightly colored graphics, and simple gameplay mechanics are likely enough to leave younger audiences satisfied, however the game doesn’t quite make it beyond that.\n","July 19, 2014","true","9.1"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","0"

Well that's what Millie is. Remember the anger you feel when you bite your own butt in snake? That's ALL that Millie is.\n\nNow in general I'm decent at snake, I'm not one of those hyper good pros who can snake against themselves multiple times, But you'd think at least the first couple of levels in Millie (maybe 1-30) would be simple and not require you to be some kind of predictive expert at snake. WRONG! At level FOUR you're easily stuck if you're bad at planning your next move and it doesn't get any easier from there.\n\nWhat makes this even harder than snake? Well you can't even see the entire map for one so you're literally on the other side of the map munching along and then, wait, what's that? The other end of your body... Then you walk right into it because you couldn't even see how big you were getting.\n\nWhile this game is cute and has some weird... you're going to pilot school plot... It's not for those who are not experts at snake. It's frustrating and just not fun. It'd be different if they made the collectables (shoes) the main think you need skill to get, while they require a little extra effort, you still need to be extremly good at snake to even beat the level with the minimum amount of dots required to open the level exit.\n\nOverall a very frustrating experience. There should be levels of difficulty such that your body doesn't grow as much if you choose medium or easy. This game is dropped for me which is sad since I do enjoy snake games and this was cute and fun the first 3 levels.

There are also extra lives and scissors to shorten the caterpillar making it a more enjoyable version of these games as it isn't frustratingly hard. Each game has it's own place in our lives, while we may enjoy triple A games with souped up graphics or FPS, it is occasionally nice to sit back and play something relaxing like Millie.\n\nI will definitely follow the developer's work and I am glad to see something this good come out of greenlight. Given that it is also quite cheap, it is absolutely a great game.","November 3, 2015","true","1.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It has some uinque aspects such as the hammer, which allows you to break through certain walls, but overall this game is about circling around a map in a large manner to ensure you don't run into yourself.

Addtionally the controls are kinda buggy (if you are playing with a gamepad, idk about keyboard or mouse) and sometimes you will make a turn that you didn't mean to do. My biggest complain is when you do run into yourself there is a turnback time powerup that moves you back, but often your only path that you have available is the path you just did before.\n\nThis game isn't anything special and you should take a pass.

As others have mentioned, this is a mixture between snake and paceman. I used to play snake on my very old Nokia mobile, it was superb fun and the best part of it was the open area, the speed and the responsive controls. Millie has closed spaces, a slow pace and extremely frustrating controls that don’t seem to respond. If you are walking between walls for example, pressing left or right for your next move sometimes registers but doesn’t always, leading you to lose the route you just preplanned in your head.\n\nOverall I would recommend the game as there is always hope for the future that the joypad controls can be fixed. A game with poor joypad responses shouldn’t advertise as having full controller support.\n\nI strongly suspect whats happening with the joypad is that the movement is registered but millie only turns on the grid, so it you are just a little too late then she carries on to the next space and then turns, which is very unforgiving. The should be some lee-way, a little forgiveness for the human reaction speed, all the play to move when you are actually on the space and moving slightly beyond it instead. Developers, if you are listening and even bother reading these reviews, please take note :)\n\n\nPros\n——\nNice music\nExcellent graphics\nExcellent presentation\n\nCons\n——\nLevels change from easy to difficult too quickly\nPoor response times to joypad (probably down to the way millie is programmed)\nView feels a little claustrophobic, would be nice to have a fixed level view (at least as option) so you can really plan your route ahead and have fun with the whole level\n\n","December 15, 2014","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Millie is eating little glowy dots like pac-man and growing longer, thus making level harder to the end. Only part of the maze is visible at once so you have to remember a little bit what is ahead and where your tail might be.\n\nMillie have some tools to help him out, like clock to move back in time if you made wrong turn, hammer to break some walls or scissors to cut Millie shorter (ouch!)\n\nEven though simple game, this is very nicely done. Good graphics, great music for game like this and well designed levels.\n\nThere are some small annoyances too. Like sometimes using clock doesn't rewind enough and you are still stuck after using it, even twice. Unlocking new episodes or small flight missions requires quite well played levels, practically clearing them totally. Second episode graphics are bit chaotic compared to calm, nice graphics in first episode.\n\nThat said, even this game looks like it is made for small children, it might be a bit hard for too youngs. Nevertheless, cute little game :)\n","November 8, 2015","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
