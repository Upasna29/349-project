Hell yeah I would!\n\nThe individual elements to this game are packaged together perfectly. The smooth neon look, the epic soundtrack, the various obstacles and their difficulty...it's got me hooked.\n\nI'm not the best at games like this but no matter how enraged I get, I keep coming back for more. I love the simplicity of the menu's and usability. The checkpoint system in the game is ace...whilst you see how many you have to use, you're not sure how many more obstacles are between you and the finish line so half the time it's a psychological battle deciding when to use them. Farspace Studios have balanced those well and not just given you too many to splash about as you please.\n\nYou can play with either a controller (I tried a microsoft 360 controller) or keyboard. I preferred using a keyboard but it's nice there's an option :)\n\nHands down the best puzzle game I've played, suitable for anyone (maybe not for people with weak hearts or mega high blood pressure) ;)\n\nI've played for about 10 hours + overall (direct purchased version) but it had me won over after 15 mins.","February 12, 2015","true","0.2"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","17","21","2","0"

The difficulty ramps up steadily, so you're always just good enough for what it's throwing at you. When you're doing well, it's like the best of the old arcade games, where you're just making it through but you're not sure how. Once you've finished a stage, you can go back to it to perfect it, trying to get five stars on every level. Which right now seems to me impossible, but I know people have done it! If you're sick of games that check all the boxes but fail to deliver the goods where it counts - in the gameplay - give Hyphen a try. Just don't blame me if it makes you scream at your computer :)","February 16, 2015","true","14.9"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","11","11","0","0"

If you aren't aware of what those games are, perhaps you are familiar with the board game "Operation". Basically you need to navigate a spinning bar through a gauntlet of neon. If you touch ANYTHING, you will explode. Different levels offer you "checkpoints" that you can drop down at any point in the level and you'll respawn at that checkpoint upon dying. It felt like cheating to me honestly, but you can't get 5 stars on a level if you drop a checkpoint, so mastering the game requires no checkpoints.\n\nIt's rage inducing. But still fun. Provided you like Hard-On-Purpose games, I can easily recommend Hyphen.","February 18, 2015","true","1.9"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","0"

For the average-to-good gamer, it's not as hard as other ultra hard platformer/puzzle type games, like Super Meat Boy, because it has a number of player-defined checkpoints in every level, a system which works really well (although the constantly rotating neon hyphen always respawns in the least convenient orientation possible). For the more hardcore type, there are bonuses which are only available by finishing every level using no checkpoints and with no deaths, which brings it up to the masochist level of challenge.\n\nSome levels require a second try because you didn't know the map layout, but overall, the controls are very precise (with a controller - don't even attempt this game with a keyboard), the game is never unfair, and you can reasonably expect to progress smoothly- the last 1/3 of the game takes longer than the first 2/3, but that's to be expected as the last few levels are long and have some pretty hard bits. I thought the music was not that great, but the visuals are quite nice, and you can turn sound off and play your own tunes if you want.\n\nOverall, if you enjoy platformers and puzzle games but are sometimes put off by evil level design, you will likely find Hyphen very satisfying. And protip- you can skip the upside-down Y puzzle near the end of the game completely ;)","December 27, 2015","true","6.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/orbitcube/recommended/346510/","orbitcube","Orbi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/orbitcube/","1050 products in account","Hyphen is a less polished Kuru Kuru Kururin that has some questionable design decisions. That's not to say it's not a fun game because the base gameplay is still intensely satisfying.\n\nI do however, have some issues with certain elements of the game:\nThe neon Geometry Wars knockoff aesthetic is appealing, but the glow around elements can be frustrating when you're trying to make tight movements.\nTimer doesn't reset when you die before setting a checkpoint. It seems like a minor gripe but it's one of those small things that you notice when it's missing.\nResetting when you die before setting a checkpoint takes a little bit too long personally. Maybe have a button bound to reset from the start?\nHitting switches triggers cutscenes that, while maybe necessary to tell you where to go, are quite long and frustrating since you're just stuck there.\nWhen you do die (which is often) it can occasionally feel cheap. That's not to say this game's hitboxes are bad, they seem quite good in fact. What I think is happening is that when you hit a wall you instantly disappear and go back to the checkpoint. This means that you don't actually get a good look at exactly where you collided. It's weird saying this after talking about how other elements need to be faster, but maybe have a number of frames after you collide where you can still see the stick? It'd be hard to design in an effective manner but I'm not a fan of how it currently is.\nThat said, the obstacles are well designed for the most part, with you being able to develop your own unique techniques for dealing with them. Those things that rotate and shoot arrows in opposite directions can go screw themselves though. Levels feel fair and the difficulty ramp is satisfying from what I've experienced.\n\nI don't mind the soundtrack but I ended up turning it off in favour of my own music player. I found tracks repeated a bit too often and there were only a few tracks I legitimately wanted to listen to. They were also a bit disparate for my tastes, making the moment when the game changes songs feel occasionally jarring.\n\nI'm in two minds about Hyphen. I really like the base mechanics but a lot of the elements surrounding it push me away. It says a lot about how strong Kuru Kuru Kururin's formula is that this is a positive review.\n\nFor reference, I've only played about 2 hours of this game, I initially idled for cards before actually playing the game. I hit level 15, quit the game to get some sleep and next time I launched the game it had lost my save. I might touch this again but that's frustrating.\n\nThere's not many games in this genre, so I recommend people give this a shot, especially if you can look past Hyphen's lack of polish (those glossy button prompts and Xbox 360 controller layout give me flashbacks). This isn't an unqualified recommendation but it's $5 and that feels about right.","November 30, 2015","true","5.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
