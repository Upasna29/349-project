If you are expecting this game to be a commentary on anything or an interesting look at a different perspective, for example someone transitioning between genders, then do not play this game.\nAt its core, DNA Twister is a visual novel game which decides to give the player several shallow characters rather than one or two indepth paths like you would find in Japanese visual novels. I suppose you could draw a comparison to an CYOA novel, but it lacks the same feel as that kind of game. I will fully admit I read the bare minimum of text in this game because the writing in this game is really bad. Everything is stupid and cheesy but lacks self awareness. For example, the scientists who made the drug that makes you become a sexy woman work for a company called Abbadon. The writing just feels sophmoric, shallow and at some points blatantly insulting.\nI considered writing more indepth on the story but I feel that it would be disingenious as this game is clearly not made for me. I do not have a huge passion for webcomics and I do not have a transformation fetish or gender bending one, and most of my comments would be on how stupid the characters are, which is a moot point. I will say, if you do love webcomics and have a laundry list of fetishes or you are Bulgarian, then seek professional help and buy this game\nThe art is bad, but I suppose that goes without saying. The phrase "deviantArt" gets thrown around a lot, but frankly, the art in this game is embarassing. The women stand at impossible angles, destroying their spines. Their bodies have long, weird stomachs with too small hips and giant balloon sized breasts. Perhaps it'd be best to describe the art as beloning to a bad webcomic? Really, that's what this game feels like.\nOne final thing I want to address is how gross this game made me feel at times. Now, before you assume I'm going to take some sort of moral high ground and condemn it for sexualizing women or something, I am not. I do not particularly find the T&A appealing, but that's my own view on sexuality and aesthetics. What left me feeling gross is the childish, and very stupid message the game shoves down your throat. It's not, as one might expect, "Wouldn't it be cool to see what life was like if you were the opposite gender?" where maybe the characters get to experience the good and the bad of being a woman, or something. You know, freaky friday style trials and tribulations that cause them to grow and better understand themselves and the female gender? DNA Twister, obviously, does not do this. What it does do is give the message "Everything would be better if you were a girl!" which to me is really unnerving.\nAll but one of the characters (from when I last played at least) was totally fine with being a girl. They totally embraced sexy clothing and in multiple characters' paths they spend entire nights masturbating (I am not kidding). It's this eye rolling drek that makes the whole thing feel like it was written by a 15 year old who loves boobies. The worst of it comes at the end of the fetish monster Dina (my pebbles) story where she talks to the one character unhappy with being a woman. The dialog essentially boils down to:\n"I don't want to be a woman forever Dina!" "Fred, I know you say that, but deep down you actually want to be a woman." "Wow Dina you really changed my views on this."\nThat left me slackjawed in awe of how oblivious the writer(s?) of this game are.\nOther highlights include: Black character grows straight, white people hair upon becoming a woman. Horrific breast expansion. Tons of implied masturbation. And an epic quest of self discovery.\nIn conclusion, this game is really good. Buy it now folks!\n\nPS: As an aside, the devs were helpful and polite when it came to getting my key onto steam and did so fast so there's that.\n","September 25, 2014","false","2.6"," 429 of 494 people (87%) found this review helpful 87 people found this review funny","87","429","494","87","11"

Huzzah!\n\nOkay, let's do this thing. I'm somewhat ashamed that I bought this game. This does coincide with my interests, and I felt like supporting an indie dev. It also got endorsements from a few webcomics I read, which also lead me to take an interest in it. If it were five or ten dollars, I would feel less ashamed, since I wouldn't feel quite so ripped off. In a world where Chroma Squad is 15 bucks, this game is a hard sell. I am not a troll and I am not a hater; in fact, I am somebody who is probably the EXACT TARGET AUDIENCE of this game.\n\nNow, I'll admit that I haven't played all of the paths. I stayed away from the anthro-heavy arcs because that isn't an interest of mine. I played through Dina, Yael, Dan, Nadine, and dabbled with a couple of the others.\n\nPositives-\n* Um... er... Dan's cute. I feel sorry for Yael. I could feel something for THOSE two characters.\n* I'm REASONABLY sure I don't have cancer afterwards.\n\nOkay, now that we've gotten the nice things to say out of the way, let's get to the meat of this. This is not a good game. This is not a good story. This is not good porn. It tries to be all three of these things and largely fails.\n\nFirst, let's look at Gender Bender DNA Twister Extreme as a game. Now, I'm not going to get into the "are visual novels games" argument. I'll accept here that a visual novel qualifies as a game because it's at least somewhat interactive (you make choices and there are branching paths). The number of choices are fairly limited and a couple (I think specifically of Yael choosing to slack off or not before the accident) are pointless and have no impact. I love alternate universe stuff and thinking about what might have been, but none of these endings were worth the effort to make save states to see how things play out. The differences are either insignificant or horrifying. This is more of a game than, say, Sakura Spirits (watch the Game Grumps playthrough of that, it's hilarious), but I didn't feel engaged. This is because of...\n\nThe story. Oh Lord, the story. This game actually has a surprisingly in depth story, as the playable characters weave in and out of each others' paths. And that story, for me, crashes and burns because of the character Dina. (It would be on life support if she wasn't the horror that she is, but she kills it). Dina is selfish. She wanted to be a woman with enormous jugs, so she decided to make a serum to make that happen. Fair enough. The accident at the start of the game that forcibly transgendered everyone was unintentional. Fair enough. Dina's actions afterwards are horrible, however. She promises to help work on a cure. She instead works on something to make her more buxom. She tests that buxomizing formula on a character who wants nothing more than to turn back to normal on the theory that "big boobs are awesome, and Yael's a jerk anyway, so forcibly altering his body further is AOK." She enjoys messing with people, has no responsibility, no EMPATHY for the people whose lives she ruined and is never punished for any of this. She doesn't even lose her job and in fact becomes stinking rich. The game clearly wants me to think that she's a funny character. She is not. I hate her and everything she stands for. The rest of the cast are more or less "insert body type fetish here." Short and Busty? Dan. Sorta regular looking brunette? Yael. And so on and so on.\n\nI mentioned earlier that the branching paths often ended up being horrifying. The game does not regard them as horrifying. The game regards them as funny or sexy. However, paths where a character loses everything they have and is forced to transform into a half human creature and be objectified all day to make a living is horrifying to me. Paths where a character makes it QUITE clear that they have no interest in making already large boobs larger and is then forced into it by someone who claims to love them is horrifying to me. Sure, the characters accept this, but they do not feel like human characters. Everyone is EXTREMELY blase about everything that happens to them. The characters I actually sorta liked were Yael and Dan, and that's because I thought that their reactions to the whole thing (being miserable, at least to start) made SENSE. The game also has numerous romantic pairings. These relationships are rapid and forced but we're supposed to take them as being extremely romantic because... shut up, that's why! Clearly these characters who have been women for a week are able to make lifelong romantic decisions with people they've often JUST met! Because that's healthy! If I were transgender, I'd be insulted by how seamless and easy this game makes the whole thing seem.\n\nNow, you'd be justified in saying to me, "You fool, you're obsessing over nonsense like gameplay and story when clearly this is just mindless smut based on a transformation fetish! You're just supposed to turn off your brain and be turned on!" Well, (despite some comments I saw in the Steam forum to the contrary), that is exactly what this is supposed to be, though there's no law saying that your porno needs to have a character as hateful as Dina. Well, the art really gets in the way of that. I'm no artist and I couldn't do better. I fully recognize this. But the character models are often inconsistent from shot to shot. There are sexy ideas utterly ruined by the execution, as I think to myself, "Is that Yael? I can't be sure... yeah, that's the same jacket, I suppose." Especially jarring are the stylistic shifts you see in images where it ISN'T the character's "talking" body with a different outfit thrown on.\n\nThe art has been described as amateurish and wannabe anime. I can't disagree with this. If this game was still in alpha and the images were placeholders along the lines of "pants to be darkened," it'd be acceptable. If this were a free beta with the promise of future improvements, it'd be acceptable. I've seen no evidence of any future improvement in the art in the materials I've read. This game costs more than Final Fantasy VII (a primitive looking game with infinitely more style than this one) on Steam. There is no excuse. There are also a lot of head scratching artistic decisions. Characters like Dan and Ben are always feeling themselves up in public in scenes where they really SHOULDN'T be, based on the dialogue, just because the artist didn't draw another placeholder shot. The anthropomorphic characters are horrifying to look at because of how the hair is drawn. The ultrabusty characters are horrifying to look at, eliciting sympathy rather than attraction. Even with perfect line art, these decisions would still make the game hard to look at.\n\nIn closing, notice how many times I used the word horrifying in this? Yeah, there's a reason for that. It is. I could see someone having a good laugh at the whole thing, but for me, I just come away feeling bad for myself for even giving this a second glance. Also, anyone trying to fool themselves that this isn't a borderline hentai is in denial.\n\nTL/DR: Do not buy. I wish I had a physical copy of the game so I could burn it.","May 21, 2015","false","0.1"," 297 of 342 people (87%) found this review helpful 36 people found this review funny","87","297","342","36","8"

Since each character tells you precisely what they include (How many endings, what types of strangeness they will encounter) any real surprise is removed before it can sink in. You're left scrolling through lives that you can figure out precisely where they may be going (accurately) long before they get there. After about an hour, you start reading the text simply to confirm you were invariably right.\n\nThe game is insensitive, and honestly I'm a bit hurt that someone could even make something like this. The artists have deleted several threads filled with honest criticism of the title, but they are also at the same time incredibly helpful both to me and others. They are just trying to stand by the game they made.\n\nI find myself genuinely conflicted, because distasteful art is still art. Even if I think what they show here is 'bad', it's designed with someone else in mind, and I wonder if that person really deserves for me to demonize their fun. In any case, I do not personally recommend this game to others. If this is your sort of thing, you could do well to wait for a good sale in any case.","September 9, 2014","false","16.7"," 592 of 720 people (82%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","82","592","720","17","26"

A lab accident occurs, hilarity (in theory) then ensues, and all of the exposed people have to cope with the ramifications of the gender swap.\n\nWhat The Ad Copy Leads You To Believe: This is a zany, gender-bender comedy extravaganza along the lines of Ranma 1/2 that portrays the hilarity of a diverse cast of characters having to adjust ‘to wearing a bra in the morning’ (per the devs). That said, the title is also allegedly sensitive to the many difficulties transgendered individuals face in modern society.\n\nWhat The Title Actually Is: The extended, misogynistic, self-insert fetish fanwank of two boys who wish they were hot lesbians, and whose comprehension of gender issues and cultural sensitivity lies slightly below that of Chris Brown.\n\nHow Much Have I Played: Every route of every character thus far released, from Yael to their latest character, Nadine.\n\nAs someone on the discussion boards pointed out, a Visual Novel needs to have: Art, Story and Gameplay. GBDNATE is wanting in all three categories.\n\nThe ART in GBDNATE has been called “anime style”, and that style is fairly common for VNs. The style itself would work, if not for problems with:\n\nBasic Anatomy - Even by anime standards, the characters’ proportions are grotesque. Hands and feet are awkwardly avoided or poorly drawn. Character poses (especially Steph) would require breaking the character’s spine.\n\nClothing - The artist doesn’t seem to know how cloth hangs on the human body, nor how light shines on it. He also thinks every woman dresses like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nPerspective - Backgrounds defy the rules of perspective drawing, and the characters (who are flatly drawn) appear simultaneously in front of and behind other objects.\n\nEye Bubbles - The characters’ eyes look more like lizard eyes than eyes with light reflections.\n\nI’d encourage anyone who wants to see the art to look at the screenshots or download the demo.\n\nThe STORY in GBDNATE is not one story where you play the character you want. GBDNATE is implemented as separate (8 now, 13 total planned) stories that have some events (the explosion) in common, but otherwise contain too many inconsistencies to be deemed a perspective shift.\n\nThe first seven routes have none of the Setup / Conflict / Resolution narrative structure of a VN at all, so they read as “stuff happens until it stops”. The eighth route (Nadine) is the only route with a coherent narrative.\n\nThe characters in GBDNATE are flat and largely indistinguishable. Yael and Nadine are the most coherent characters; Lynn and Dina are the developers’ Mary Sues (with all the problems thus engendered), while the rest of the characters are forgettable. They all talk and think with the same narrative voice, despite differences in age, gender, education, social standing and anything else.\n\nGood character ensemble humor comes from the interplay of different, well-defined personalities (think Rumiko Takahashi or Seinfeld), but since the characters are poorly (often inconsistently) defined, there’s no humor in their interaction. They’re just lifeless boob joke generators, and nothing more.\n\nWith no humor, a fanwank title like GBDNATE should at least have a titilation factor, but all the sex scenes are rendered as follows:\n\n…\n……\n………\n“Was it good for you?”\n\nUnless one finds ellipses to be erotic, there’s no titillation to be had in GBDNATE. The characters masturbate more than they connect with each other anyway (Yael actually sets a flag for this, sadly).\n\nIn terms of the writing, the developers are violating the first rule of writing: “Write what you know”. Anyone with genuine experience in the sciences, technology, the law, sex or anything else will find much to bang their head on the desk over.\n\nNadine’s route was especially bad. It strayed into the realms of science, computer hacking & security, legality, criminal investigations, corporate business culture, investing, and a variety of other fields in which the developers clearly have no knowledge or experience. Even the background art will make any computer-savvy player twitch.\n\nMechanically, the writing is just not good. Tenses drift, continuity errors abound in all routes, there are plenty of spelling and grammar errors - it’s a hot mess. It’s not as hilariously bad as “My Immortal”, but it’s definitely a distraction in a format that relies on writing to convey 95% of the content.\n\nNadine’s route was the worst offender in this category as well. My impression was that someone had spell-checked the hell out of it, but nobody ever sat down to proofread it with a red pen. Again, in a text-centric medium, solid editing is just as important as basic code testing.\n\nGAMEPLAY: Up until Nadine’s route, there is none. The first seven routes are nothing more than Choose Your Adventure novels (with very few choices). By making a choice, you choose which path the narrative goes down. What few choices you get often have no bearing on the content to which they lead, which means that making a single choice of “Stay At Work” leads inexorably to the Lesbian Catgirl Ending of that route. Things like sexual orientation are determined by getting haircuts and eating nachos.\n\nThere are no skills to master, there are no meaningful status flags to set, there is no endgame to navigate, there are no deductions to make. In the first seven routes, there simply is no gameplay at all.\n\nThey tried to change this in the Nadine route (which ends with a watered-down Phoenix Wright knockoff), but the only real “gameplay” here is in asking a few common sense questions in the right order. At no point is any information from the rest of the game required to navigate the endgame, and it’s quite possible to reach the optimal ending having never seen the rest of the story that leads up to it.\n\nStill, as badly executed and derivative as it was, I’ll give them credit for the attempt. It’s a positive sign that after over a year of being told that their title has no gameplay, they actually gave it a try in one route.\n\nCODE QUALITY: While not normally relevant in a review, I do have a couple of comments because of two factors:\n\nThe developers didn’t write their own VN engine; they’re using a free one called RenPy.\nThe developers are charging premium dollars ($25 as of this writing) for their title.\n\nGiven that the developers are charging premium dollars for a title that’s just a script running on someone else’s engine, it better be a pretty amazing script.\n\nThing is, it’s not.  GBDNATE is an absolutely appalling pile of spaghetti code that a) would not be accepted in a Comp101 class, and b) taps into almost none of the RenPy engine’s capabilities.\n\nThere are far more robust RenPy games available for free on the RenPy website. There are far more robust RenPy games right here on Steam for far less money. GBDNATE simply is not implemented well, nor is it worthy of the ridiculous price tag hung upon it.\n\nFINAL SUMMARY:\n\nGBDNATE is a bad title, plain and simple.\n\nDo I recommend it? Well, if you share the developers’ fetishes, I’ll recommend that you download the free demo. If you like that, you’ll probably like the rest of it enough to buy it if they ever put a realistic price on it: say, $6.99 (the price of a trade paperback). It’s not worth any more than that, in my opinion.\n\nI’ve been asked by several people if GBDNATE is a “so bad it’s good” title. In my opinion, it’s not. It’s just dull and tediously bad, with mediocre art and way too many 5th grade boob jokes.","December 7, 2014","false","5.1"," 426 of 512 people (83%) found this review helpful 36 people found this review funny","83","426","512","36","29"

Yes, this is a rather weak attempt to do a review in the style of Zero Punctuation, given the fact that Yahtzee hasn't reviewed this game and it doesn't seem like he's interested in doing so.\n----------------\nIt would be very narrow minded of me to say that all VN created by amateurs or fetishists suck, it's like saying that every shooter game released this day is a rather bland and weak work of copy pasting the same concepts but with different stories and some sort of different graphics (even when this is true 90% if the time). The fact is that there’s bound to be at least one thing to your taste in all different varieties of VN’s, be it about the most cliché story about heroes or mundane slice of life pseudo-comedies or even about sex maniacs that want to have sexual intercourse with every woman in the vicinities by sheer force of wank and luck. But it would be fair to say that there are certain popular trends in VN’s that tend to set off my “this is massive ♥♥♥♥” alarm. I would list them but thanks to this particular VN I don’t have to, now I can just point at Gender Bender DNA Twister Extreme and say: “Pretty much that”.\nNow don’t get me wrong, I’m not sort of fascist VN connoisseur who cannot function without a sublime argument and jaw dropping CG’s, reading about nonsense, plastering your own dark and deep fantasies and making a plot that doesn’t appeal even the most twisted of fetishists is fine with me, as long as it brings me some degree of fun or enjoyment. I’ll make an except at making a VN with Mary-Sues so unbelievable ♥♥♥♥ed that you’ll start to wonder if those magical crystals you added to your coffee this morning were actually sugar. The game starts rustling my jimmies when it populates itself with a cast full of rapists, sociopaths and incarnations of fetishism and starts neglecting even the most insignificant amount of plot or even art decency because it’s too busy vomiting fetishes at us that makes me want to beat the faces of every character with a mallet.\nAllow me to expand, the abominable cast of characters lets you summarize what can happen when your entire VN is a walking abomination made of your own fantasies and the only thing the player can do is chug the ♥♥♥♥♥tream like there’s no tomorrow. There’s no reason to not add any ♥♥♥♥ed-up character but the game seems to be too busy eating its own ♥♥♥♥ and feces cake to care about it. It’s like a friend invited you to some convention, under the false promise of some food and fun, but then you realize that the convention is about ponies and your friend buys you a hamburger in apology, but no, you won’t forget this betrayal, oh no.\nThe producers are trying to play the: “Intricate and deep story about transgender issues and society” card, but in truth you’re only invited to a party where the cake is only a cover of nice looking icing but under that there’s only ♥♥♥♥ and wank. It seems however that after all the rambling and rage about this game attracted the developers are only plugging their ears and yelling really loud: “IF YOU DON’T LIKE IT, DON’T BUY IT. THANKS FOR THE MONEY”, totally oblivious of the fact that here, in Steam, you can’t rate ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ if you don’t buy it. There’s going forth with confidence and then there’s the developer whooping my nose with the tip of their big self-pleased stiffy. Not that I think that most amateur VN’s are sublime works of art that deserve the maximum amount of praise, some are only worth of a shot in the balls. But the only thing you need to do is not grabbing all the worse parts of every single trend and fetish in history and magnify it by 200000%.\nThe “story”, if one can be so bold as to call it so, revolves around a pair of male “scientists” (a term that this game uses so loosely that the genitalia of the most concurred sex worker is cleaner than this) that are FIXATED with becoming females. And I made the word fixated big because it’s something that borders plain and pure madness. But not the kind of madness that makes you do the right thing in the wrong way, no, it’s the kind of madness that whispers in your ear and makes you wank in front of your parents. The kind of madness that was treated with electroshocks and brain lobotomy.\nGender Bender DNA Twister Extreme is a game that really makes me want to hate it because everything about it is twisted (get it?) to a degree where all that could possibly be remotely enjoyable has morphed into a horrible ball made of the most horrible nightmares. And there’s nothing wrong with nonsensical writing, there’s some charm to it in fact. But this shiny gold star I sticked for the attempt at nonsensical writing its almost immediately torn off for some truly abhorrent drawing and writing design. Genderbending: Fine. Genderbending with some animalistic tweaks: Fair Enough. Genderbending with the option of going full furry: Now we’ve dropped into the ocean of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ness. But then there’s Gender Bending, with the option of going full furry, mermaid, goo girl and others mixed with the worst writing in the history of humankind and art worth of a 4th grader: And now the ocean of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ness has closed over our heads.\nLazy attempts at absurd aside, GBDNATE, strikes me as a rather mediocre attempt at a game. An argument as solid as farts and that whole speech about wanting to create a truly enjoyable game about living the life as the opposite team aren’t valid points when your whole game is just a pile of turds.  The Road to Hell is paved with good intentions, they say and this game sure makes you notice that you’re on a different kind of hell. Instead of red skinned fellows wielding pointy tridents you are pinned against sexual deviants, furries and mentally challenged people. Even when they try every single approach to the other routes, you can see that it’s just a misuse of a good formula.\nYou see, if that were the only fatal flaw, we could call this game mediocre at best, and then go back to the wanking, but no, this is just the tip of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ iceberg. I’ve already mentioned the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ art. And even when the artists says he’s trying to “improve” all I can really see is a moderate amount of effort being put in not sucking so much rather than stop being a complete disaster. IF at that you add the price tag, which is 25$ you can see with ease what the problem seems to be. Because, let’s be honest, if this massive ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ was only 2 bucks then then the only complains would be: “Such a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game, but for 2 bucks it’s a nice way of getting a giggle of two (If only you could call this an attempt at comedy), but no, the price is way high for a quality this low.\nAt this point it seems that the developers are only trying to grab the most amount of cash in exchange for the least amount of effort. And no, the: “Then don’t buy it if you don’t like it” card cannot be played here, devs. Also, speaking of the green devil, I must remind (Or tell) you that this game was FUNDED before. Yes, the devs got even more money before they even got this game on Steam. And that makes you think that they could’ve hired better artists or a decent writer for this.\nOverall I can only recommend this game to masochistic ♥♥♥♥♥ that enjoy psychological pain rather than the physical one, but at some point you will also feel the physical pain. And you don’t have to tell me, I’ve spent 110+ hours in this thing reading every passage trying to find the most minimal trace of good writing but at this point I can safely assure that my adventure has ended in total and abysmal failure.\nPaying the full price it’s equal to asking a gentle colonoscopy. You won’t like it but you paid for it, and the guy who’s doing it it’s probably enjoying the ♥♥♥♥ out of this.\n\nRating; Welcome to Deviantart","July 2, 2015","false","129.9"," 241 of 319 people (76%) found this review helpful 100 people found this review funny","76","241","319","100","20"

Its especially hard to actually read on Zeke's storyline when pretty much every 2-10 minutes, he mentions the fact he was forcibly turned into a girl and infact he has a pretty ♥♥♥♥ing a okay point and everyone is like "OMIGOD YOUR HOT.". Jeeeze, there is stuff like this all the way through the story and in fact its pretty cringeworthy. Its pretty much gag gift status, right up there with bad rats.\n\nI could seriously see this game hurting the feelings of some people, and its not really in anything else but the writing. The writing is definitely the worst part, i absolutely hated all the Gender Bended characters when they interacted with others, literally all they did was talking about being a girl and how sexy they were. Not everyone is going to be like that if you force them at will, in fact i'd imagine they would be really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off and sue you.  The other storylines are just as cringeworthy (and funny) but Zeke's one is absolutely the most ive ever gotten actually angry at a visual novel that i've had to force myself to finish reading through it so a word of caution.\n\nA Few Bug Issues.\nOccasionally the UI will have you thinking its your protagonist talking but instead its another character. Spelling mistakes galore, too! It makes you think that these guys haven't even heard of a spell checker, its a magical construct that actually makes sure you haven't ♥♥♥♥ed up grammatically!\n\nUltimately what the hell else can you expect from Gender Bender DNA Twister Extreme. Hell, i accepted it because i figured it would be a bit of a laugh to read and it is so, i guess this game has that.\n\nHowever, if your in it for the narrative side there are many alternatives. Stuff like Katawa Shoujo and Analogue : A Hate Story tell the story in a much more interesting way. In the end this game will always be ridiculous while with Katawa Shoujo and Hate Story in some parts its some top class writing.\n\nI'd like to take the time to tell you that Katawa Shoujo is Free, and Hate Story is much much less costly.\n\nedit: fixed a few typos.","September 11, 2014","false","3.5"," 456 of 638 people (71%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","71","456","638","10","14"

Gender Bender DNA Twister Extreme (Is that the only ♥♥♥♥ing name for this game they could come up with? It sounds like they mashed together the names of a fetish porn and a arcade machine.) is a visual novel with some very light choices that dont pop up often. (Date this bland character or this other bland character) The VN it self claims to be "A romantic comedy where a bunch of people become female" Right off the bat that sounds pretty stupid, but it could have worked if you got someone like ernest hemmingway or quinten tarintino to write it. Lets jump right in to the review and see how ♥♥♥♥ed this whole thing really is.\n\nVISUALS/AUDIO\nPeople often call this game deviantart quality, this is an insult to the ms paint  fettish artist on deviantart. Honestly a painting elephant could make better visuals for this game.  The whole thing just looks strange, and it makes it worse comparing its self to anime and much better visuals of other cheaper visual novels on steam. Have you played SC2VN? Its visual style is very clean and colorful, and despite being koreanime, its a lot closer to the style then this drek.\n\nWhile I could tolerate the bad music in most other steam VNs, I muted the game the minute I heard whatever the hell the music was. I really don't know how to classify the genre of this crap, Somesort of girly pop with no lyrics? Stock free music from hell?\n\nSTORY\nThis is the part that gets really bad guys, this is where the whole thing falls into the abyss. Firstly I would like to say if you are getting your idea of transgendered people from this game, go to this link http://w.itch.io/dys4ia buy and play dys4ia, a game that perfectly sums up what it feels like to be transgendered. If you dont want to shell out 5 bucks you could get a gay freind or something.\n\nThis game's story and writting can all be summed up by the campain of one character, the most evil and despicable "protagonist" I have ever seen in a video game, Dina, the main character. Dina is a selfish juvenile monster. Lets look at dina's list of achievments. The whole plot started because Derek, thought he was transgendered (even though the people who made this game only think with their ♥♥♥♥♥ and have no idea what transgendered people are like). Derek was actualy just obsessed with getting big boobs (so many dialoge boxes were wasted with derek obsessing over boobs). Derek then uses some really inacurate science to make himself into a female. Dina.\n\nHe accedently turns all of his researchers into women. The researchers wer not told they were working on gender manipulation and did not want to become female. So instead of looking for a cure to un♥♥♥♥ several people's lives. Our protagonists works on way to make her boobs bigger. She makes a boob expansion serum and gives it to Yael,  the reasercher that hates being female the most. Dina tells Yeal that the big boob serum is a gender reversal serum. Yeal gets even bigger boobs and dina never changes her back, claiming being female is much better than bieng male.\nInstead of working on a cure Dina: gorges on nachos, gets drunk at a club (You can tell the authors are are little kids because dina acts the same drunk as when she is sober) and works on a way to make herself into a half human half whatever the hell monstorcity. BTW Dina never gets comeupance for the horrible things she has done, she just gets filthy rich.\n\nOh and how can I forget this little detail. Dina goes to the mall and sees the researchers buying clothes. She then hides behind a plant and starts taking pictures of them. When the mall security gaurd Stephane, catches her she arrests dina for sexual assault. In the mall security office Dina claims she will delete all the pictures off her phone, stephane watches as she does this. Stephane goes to the next room to take care of some buisness, and Dina escapes, laughing at how Stephane didn't know that the pictures were backed up in the cloud.  Dina then shows the pictures to her best freind and everyone but the reasercher who was in the pict... WHAT THE HELL!!! WHAT THE HELL IS THIS GAME???!!!  WHO IS RESPONCIBLE FOR THIS???!!!\n\nVERDICT\nIf you want to laugh at the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ dialoge just watch a youtube video. If you want to give a joke gift to your freinds just give them bad rats, its only 99 cents.  If you want male to female transformation porn just go to deviantart. If you want a visual novel get neoparka OR ANYTHING BUT THIS!  I WANT TRANSCENDANT GAMES TO GO ♥♥♥♥ING BANKRUPT! I WANT TO PERSONALY SWALLOW THE SOUL OF EVERY STAFF MEM...\n\n*Technical difficulties Plz stand by\n\nDont buy this game, not even for a giggle.","January 18","false","2.6"," 78 of 91 people (86%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","86","78","91","24","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/residntevl/recommended/321060/","residntevl","Resi ♥","http://steamcommunity.com/id/residntevl/","931 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nIf you have a fetish for this list of things:\n\n- Male to female transformation\n- Breast Expansion\n- Furries (Anthro) [sorry horse humpers]\n- Shoddy dialogue\n- Falling in love with your male friends once you've become a girl\n- and badly drawn art\n\nThen this is the game you should play. The deviantart tier art showcases how little budget went into art production when the game was heavily funded. It would seem like the developer only kept the artist because either A) The artist is the dev's friend or B) The artist pretty much did a lot of the art already or C) Both A and B. Most VNs don't need good art to be good but the artistic value in a fetish/harem VN should at least be more presentable than 7th grade "decent", considering that's exactly what this game is. It's a fetish game.\n\nYou play as a male who gets turned into a girl. That's a fetish and also delves into the realm of transgendered issues, but I'm not going to talk about that as I am sure this game doesn't even graze that subject, considering this is purely fetish and not social commentary. Then you can go further into your fetishes becoming weirder things or having body expansions. This game would be better as a dress-up game as I'm already falling bored of the character interaction and find nothing interesting in the characters. That could be due to the visual representation of them. Thanks again, art, for being so subpar. It seems like this could have been written by a young teen and you can notice the attempts of proper grammar leaking through the text as it feels forced. This is because the developer is French Canadian. I doubt they're a young teen, although fetish art this bad and fetish writing on Deviantart is generally young teenagers, which is pretty shocking when you think about it.\n\nOn transformation it seems most of the characters instantly enjoy and embrace their feminine selves instead of trying to fix the damage that was done. This can be construed as the characters are all perverts or actually wanted to be females to begin with. I doubt this is even a plot point of the scientists who created this disaster, as they apparently do not have a clue what's going on. What I think makes this worse is the fact you get to have male love interests. I can understand embracing your feminine changes but these characters are almost right into it and ready to be girls. I guess if they wanted meat in them before this would make sense they'd be instantly okay with it as a girl.\n\nOverall, there are better (and free!) VNs or games in general with fetishes that are more well played out than this game that you can jerk off too. I still recommend this game. It's a disgusting waste of $25 but if you want to show your friends how much you love buying them trash and you have the disposable income, you should buy this for them.","September 5, 2014","true","5.8"," 534 of 832 people (64%) found this review helpful 82 people found this review funny","64","534","832","82","42"

The art is not only bad, it's inconsistent, with characters constantly being off model, to the point where parts of their clothes would change color in between sentences in ways that can't be explained by shading, the characters are mostly unlikable, and the Abaddon Conglomerate has the most supervillain-esque name of any fictional company I've seen. I felt ashamed owning this game, and I added ♥♥♥♥ like Imouto Paradise to my Steam. Don't buy this game, and if you bought it, aim for a refund.

Honestly, I went into this with just knowledge of the screenshots, yet still I kept an open mind about what to expect. As such, I can see how this does appeal to some crowds and why it doesn't appeal to others. And for only 3 people working on this project, it is not half bad. Again, would I recomend it to others? No. Do I believe that it should be on Steam? I'm a bit conflicted there as I have seen other visual novels here, some with gameplay elements, others like this one.

It's basically about two guys make a gender swapping thing (like the title says) and it get's all ♥♥♥♥ed up. Personally, my favorite character has to be Dina by how batshit insane she is. Dina's an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and always gets her way (somehow).\n\nAnyway, I can get at where some people honestly hate this game and I can tell you why. The art is ok, the dialogue is cheesey as ♥♥♥♥, the characters have no actual form of a women, as in their proportions are way off.\n\nBUT, besides the downsides, there is one good thing I got from this: The crazy ♥♥♥♥ and creepy characters. The characters have impossibly large breasts that make them look like an hourglass with one larger end than the other. Later in the story when people start changing into an anthropormorphic animals I sometimes jumped out of my God damn chair cause they creep me out. The dialogue is hilarious and what they do is hilarious. The ending (I'm gonna spoil a little so be prepared) is so ♥♥♥♥ed up. I felt bad for everyone and only the people who acutaly WANTED to have their gender changed got the best of the lot while everyone else is stuck as a female and let me tell you something: SELF PLEASURE DOESN'T SOLVE ALL PROBLEMS. I'd guess the suicide rate was pretty high after the events of the two-part finale.\n\nIs the game worth it? ABSOLUTLY but you have to be ready for some fetish ideas in the story (That MIGHT be the reason why I like this game but don't think I like it because of the breasts). Is it worth $25?

No, this is worse than cancer, and I know just how much it is. Let me tell you a story.\n\nSo one day in Hell, Satan asked his personal chefs to make the most delightfully horrendous meal. So the head chef decided to make it a burrito of the most horrendous things on the surface: DeviantArt fetish art, sexualized furry - and other things of that nature - art, dialogue typos,and characters, ideologies and a story that makes no sense. All wrapped up into an over priced mess. Having some touch with my mortality, I thought it was more horrendous than delightfull, but still brought it to Satan. When he gave us his seal of approval we knew we did a good job. But that cancer burrito gave the Prince of Lies some serious diarrhea and he was on his toilet for a while and it ended up clogging, and I had to deal with it. After unclogging it, at the end of the plunger was this game. Curious, I looked through it, and it was worse than any torture I had seen, and I was in Hell. So, I decided to show it to the dark lord, after looking through it for a little, he had his classic smerk and that told me everything I needed to know.Then he called for one of his assistants and told him to publish it on the surface. And so is the origins of this game, from the pits of Satan's personal toilet.\n\nI don't know what else to say about this game that wasn't said in the story. It looks like it was made by a teenage deviantartist with a furry fetish, who doesn't know proper english, and is extremly ♥♥♥♥ing greedy. And the story makes no sense as no one really questions why people just randomly change to the opposite sex (not gender, there is a difference) and the people who do question, don't question for very long. Now, there's nothing wrong about a game where people have sex changes, it's totally cool and if people feel they need it that's cool. But this doesn't feel like a game that can give transgender people a character they can relate to, because the characters who have the changes willingly seem more like they want it out of fetishism than actual gender dysphoria.\n\nSo I got this game from a friend who got it free themself, the only reason I took it was as a joke. But that was a mistake, please, don't make the same mistake. Put down your wallet, or buy a better game, like LiEat :3","May 19","false","2.6"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","38","3","8","5","1"

It also covers the consequences and aftermath of the accident in several of the newer characters.\n\nPros:\n\n1. Funny, witty, silly, and occaisionally hits the mark on the emotional or profound.\n2. Likeable characters\n3. A soundtrack that grows on you after a while and is well utilitized during Dan's story\n\nCons:\n\n1. Typos in the text. After 12 characters and multiple releases, this shouldn't be happening. Especially in the older content.\n2. Incorrect name plates for characters involved in their own storylines and appearing in stories prior to their own. I'd really like to see this get fixed on account that it's distracting and a spoiler.\n3. Character selection is not grouped or organized by plot timeline. While it's nice to be able to pick any character that looks interesting, there's a definite order for them to be played in for the plot to make sense. At the very least the loading screen should start up on Dina or Lynn since either of them play out the baseline story.\n\nConclusion:\n\nGBDNATE is a fun little bit of entertainment. It doesn't try to dive into the deep emotional and physical hardships transpeople experience everyday. At the same time it doesn't minimize them either. It simply does two things- It tries to answer the question what if this happened. And conveys the simple message that identity, gender or otherwise, is a part of a person's mind and heart- not their body.","December 1, 2015","true","15.7"," 8 of 23 people (35%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","35","8","23","2","0"

This is a fetish game, and one that's appealing to a very niche audience. If you're looking for a game about the life of transgender individuals, this isn't it; if you're looking for a normal-ish porn game, this isn't it, I would reccomend Huniepop though.\nHowever, if transformation fetishes apply to you, be it breast expansion, animal transformation or gender swapping, this game is most certainly for you.\n\nWhile it isn't cheap and the artwork doesn't even come close to standing up to a game such as Huniepop, it is actually fairly amusing for a visual novel. A lot of people I see talking about it ask why you wouldn't just on deviantart to find this; and to that, I challenge you to find anything nearly as vast or complete. Many of the characters have more than 5 endings to find. I can think of very few artists who have written stories retaining to these fetishes that would even come close to half of the stories this game tells.\n\nWhile I certainly don't think it has the enjoyment factor of something like Huniepop which can also just be played for fun, I do think that it has plenty to offer. If it appeals to your weirder side like it does mine, get it, otherwise it simply wasn't intended for you and you can avoid it entirely.","September 27, 2015","true","2.9"," 23 of 56 people (41%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","41","23","56","4","1"

But people just need to treat this as a game, with another what if situation and enjoy the story for what it is. It's a long, semi-choice driven visual novel that has decent graphics (all things considered) And for me, a lot of fun to play through each of the character's stories, some even multiple times.\n\nThere is also hate on the game for the graphics, but really, I loved them. The backgrounds were recycled for the entire game, but each of the characters had a set number of poses and costumes. And they all worked when they were used. I enjoyed the art style quite a bit and had a lot of fun playing through the game.\n\nIf there were a single problem I had with the game it would be the final two chapters of the story. I won't spoil the plot, but it felt rushed, and while I know that the developer had tried to tie up all the loose ends of the story and make sure it somewhat fit. I would have personally felt better not having all the main characters having a what happened in the end senario built into the end of the story, it kind of makes the choices of partners, and endings you can have in the individual ones less exciting and fun.\n\nOverall, I had a lot of fun with this game and it left me with the feeling of reading a good book and  would recommend it to anyone looking to spend an hour or so having a bit of fun with the story.","December 11, 2015","true","15.3"," 4 of 16 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","4","16","0","1"

Guess which engine I paid the $25 through? (Steam, ftw!).  Anyways, on to rewiewing!  The game had a bit of a cliche beginning, but it quickly made up for it with the characters and their stories!  The stories of the characters run the gamut from wacky shapeshifting hijinks to courtroom mysteries to super spy-dom... with plenty of soap opera and romantic comedy thrown in for good measure!  The detail and variety of the playthroughs made it all worth the $25, even without the new characters coming.  There are currently two spots in the Russell story where there is some sort of red coding message, I think during the nighttime nacho shop and inside the nighttime club where creepy old guy  is the doorkeeper.  That'll probably be fixed soon, though.  The best character stories from gold to bronze medals (IMO) are Nadine/Russell's (I count those two as one, play Nadine then Russell), Dina (mad scientist ftw!), and either Steph or Zara (can't decide).  Well worth playing, can't wait to see what other stories the characters are put through!

It sucks to see that it offended some people, but for people like me, it kind of hits the spot.  Nice to see other people have similar fantasies to my own.  Maybe it's more fetish than transgender, or maybe some transgenders are super fetishy.  Maybe I am one.  I have no idea.  Am in a bit of a state of identity crisis lately :P  This has provided a nice little escape for me during a rough time and I am grateful for it.\n\nI hate to see that it upset people when it brightened my day.  Hopefully the developers will hear the feedback and start developing other characters that others can identify with. Dina, is actually my favorite.  Seems to be the one that offends people the most. I see her as quirky, brilliant, courageous, but just has a little bit of tunnel vision and accidentally ignores others. We all have our flaws. I think it's meant to be light and fun.\n\nWatch some YouTube videos or check out the demo if you are interested before buying.  The $25 price seemed a bit steep, but I caved anyway after the demo hooked me.  I hope others enjoy this and that those that find it offensive can see how it is just for different people.","January 21, 2015","true","54.6"," 34 of 83 people (41%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","41","34","83","5","2"

While there is a lot of controversial topics that have seemed to polarize the player base (some love it and other really hate it based on what I've read on Steam), it still manages to evoke some sense of charm for an adult-themed story. I will point out that this is most definitely not for children or the prudish. Unlike Japanese "H-games" (which I happen to enjoy) there is only implied sexual scenes without showing it, but there is enough skin shown (particularly topless shots) to make it unsuitable for a younger audience. That said, if you're a fan of visual novels you can do worse.

Alot of it is fan service, I will admit, but the amount of individual scenes, characters, personalities, and stories that manage to link up to one-another in some fashion is to me mind boggling.\nI recommend this game to anyone who does have even minor interests in gender transformation, anthropomorphic transformation, chest expansion, or same sex romances/multiple romances. Also, I highly recommend this for someone who loves a complex story tree that branches out into so many different avenue but still manages to keep the overall story intact.\nYes, I will admit that the art and stories are not on par with that of Nekopara or If My Heart Had Wings, but it is a very close second to me. Though the story is leagues ahead from such trash as the Sakura Spirit/Angles...\nGive the Gender Bender a whirl, I believe in time you’ll come to enjoy the transformation as much as the characters. I look forward to the Rose story arch and hope to see more for this developer in the future. Awesome job guy!\nAs a P.S. to those who are interested (or care), I’m a woman and I still enjoy this game. It’s nice to think of guys being able to see the world from our point of view.\n\nEdit 1: It has been a long while since I have played as I was waiting for the Russell update, then life happened and I was pleasantly surprised  by the addition of Aleanne.\nFirst, let me say that the game does get better as you play it! Not only in story, but in art as well. You can see the artist improve with each new update and I find it prenominal. Like watching an artists progression only through a story telling media.\nI will admit that it would be nice to see the entire game redone to fit the new and improved work, but that would be asking for an almost complete overhaul every time the game is updated. Not feasible in the slightest with the pittance that is being charged for this game.\nSecond, I hate to say that Aleanne is a little disappointing; with a story that feels rushed and a good deal of typos and incongruities, it’s not as captivating as the previous. But then I assume it would be hard to follow up after Russell, which is a really fun pit of story/puzzle.\nRegardless, this bit of negative does not tarnish the game as a whole. It is still a wonderful game that will captivate and keep you going for a lot longer than most of the story games out there. I still highly recommend this game and look forward to the Scarlett update and any others that may follow.

Gender Bender is walking along that line also. The gender swap is not an uncommon thing in manga or anime and this isn't the only visual novel using this theme, but the writing is sub par and the artwork is, in my opinion, bad and at certain points even beyond worse.\nI also don't get it why the writer(s) keep mentioning "huge/fat/massive soft boobs". Is that the only reason why they wrote this story, to talk about boobs? Sorry, but that's pretty lame and very childish in a dumb and insulting way.\n\nbesides of that, this visual novel allows for some choices and has many different characters to play as, which is nice. All the characters are somehow connected to eachother, story wise and so you might see a single character several times during other play throughs.\n\nI would do recommend this game, but only on sale, because the artwork is too bad and almost a disgrace to the franchise.","October 29, 2014","true","1.9"," 32 of 82 people (39%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","39","32","82","0","3"

If you don’t like it at all, drop it. If you kind of like it, you can check out more routes. If the characters are really interesting and you laughed a lot, this is probably a game you want.\n\nOk, first off, the time you can see (7.6 hrs played) is only for the latest route.\nI did play the other routes, but the game wasn't available on Steam when those came out.\n\nAnother "disclaimer": This game has "Gender Bender" in its title. As you might guess, that's the sort of "audience" for this game. If you do not like “Gender Bender” at all, this game probably isn’t for you.\nI haven't looked at all "Gender Bender" material out there, but unless it's outright porn, most of it is a comedy. Ranma 1/2 comes to mind.\nIn short, the "Gender Bender" genre in general tends to mix comedy with fanservice, a lot. Usually, there is romance involved as well.\n\nI view this game as a comedy as well. Yes, characters can have large breasts and they do wear ridiculous outfits.\nOut of all the 7 currently playable characters:\n2 wanted the change before it happened. (Derek and Liam. They're in charge of the lab)\n4 were male and resisted the change, usually for at least a week. (Yael, Ben, Dan, Zeke)\n1 was female and also resisted the change initially. (Stephanie)\n\nIn general, most of them change their opinion during the first week due to all the craziness that happens.\nUsually the other "transformed" characters are the reason for the craziness, thus adding more and more "crazy" like a snowball effect.\nIn short, the characters may not be the most rational humans on earth. They just start "rolling with it" at some point.\n\nFor recommendations, I'd suggest to always play the newest available character. Making this game is a learning experience for the two devs that are making this. The demo does not contain the "newest available character".\nIt should be obvious for any Early Access Game, but if you are on the fence about it, you should wait until the game is "complete".\n\nMy "score" (since people apparently care about those) would be 5/5. I think the game exactly achieves what the target "audience" wants from it. This game isn't trying to be philosophical or ponder moral issues. This game is trying to provide you with some lighthearted fun most of the time.\nThe demo will contain 7 characters to choose from while the "full version" will have 13 characters.\nIt is likely that the "early character routes" (e.g. Yael) will be "brought up to standard" once all the other routes are done.\n\nEdit: The "full demo" will have 7 playable characters, not 6.","September 17, 2014","true","9.5"," 22 of 68 people (32%) found this review helpful","32","22","68","0","41"

If you take your time reading through it all and "taking in the sights" you're looking at around 90 minutes of sub-par, plot-hole ridden writing per character, of which there are too many.\n\nIn those 90 minutes you'll have a handful of choices, most of which have little to no lasting effect. This game could have been made as a Powerpoint Slideshow. All the dialogue is in desperate need of an editorial by someone whose frontal lobe has not been removed or pierced in some way. The audio is grating, repetetive and generic.\n\nThe artwork is sparse and lacking, showing only a fleeting hint of investment when there's an attempt at illustrating sexy poses, all of which also fall flat on their face. Basic concepts of anatomy are thin, and vary wildly between poses/scenes. All the characters pretty much look the same, switch a hairdo around and you're without hope trying to identify a given person. (Unless you can see the chest area, their other lone distinguishing feature) Most textures look to be taken from a simple Google Image search. All the grass is made using the Photoshop Grass Tool.\n\nHowever, a few of the jokes hit home and Dan is the sexiest creature on this planet. 10/10 must own.

After seeing all the hate the devs were getting though, I decided to help the devs out through this rough period. Also, I wanted to know if all the hate was warneted.\n\nI've just compleated the Deric/ Dinna path and it took me about 3.5 five hours (with small breaks). There were only a hand full of choices for this character, so I'll have to see if the other paths are more interactive. I'm new to visual novesl, but I know Date Warp had more freaquent choice makeing.\n\nNow onto the story aspect. Off the bat, this game is not high on realism, but it's not as shallow as some people are makeing it out to be. Sure, I can't understand why Deric spent all this time and reasech just to become a chick and have masive boobs, but then again I'm happy to be a man. His friend/reshearch partner/ Liam I can understand a little bit better. He was motivated by cruiousity wile Deric wanted a permant sex change. If he didn't like the results, I think Liam would have turned back if they could find the reavsal serum he spends a good chunk of time trying to find. What I like about Deric the most is his devious light hearted (yet extreamly imature) nature. Like a good chunk of the story, wile Liam/Lynn is working on a cure for the infected, she spending his time trying to grow himself a bigger rack (not giveing a damn if all his empoyiees and boss are ok with have a comlete sex change). He definatly very self and incensitive to how most people would really feel in a situation like this (even if most of them do learn to expect it, some more quickly than others, Dan seemed to have the hardest time from what I saw of him/her in Derics story. And what I saw of Liam, I really like that when it's revealed that the affects of the serum are irreversable, he becomes devistated and guilt ridden for all the lives he might have ruined.\n\nSo yeah, this game raise some moral, phyisophical, and ethical quetions. It might not  handel them in a mature manor, but it's a fetish thing. Deep down this game knows that it's fanservice. However, even some of the none fetish humor was hillarios. Derics interactions with Stephany the uptight security gaurd were histerical. And If you get the snake girl ending that joke becomes even more hilarious.\n\nAnyways, this game is just inonccent fun. Parts of it are silly and childish... ok the whole thing is silly and childish. But doest that make the game an aboniation to gameing. Course not. I had fun with just the one path. Some of the stuff wasn't for me, but I really did love that breast expanstion squence.\n\nRecommend to anyone who has TF, expanstion, cosplay, furry, and gender bending fetishes.

Its simple anime art styling, hilarious story line and addictive music soon had wanting to find out what happened other characters. The inital 4 characters, Yael, Bri, Liam and Derek all tell the same events from different points of view, so the back story and future hints are only uncovered a little at a time. The next 3 Dan, Steph and Zeke progress this story forwards.\n\nThis game reminded me the simpler times, of chose your own adventure books, day of the tentical and Leisure Suit Larry in the land of the lounge lizard. At the moment all paths are unlocked in GBDNATE, and playing one story, does not effect any others, I suspect this is a product of how the game has had to be writen one character at a time, after all this is only an Alpha, nothing to stop the developers locking characters and paths, until other ones have been discovered, this however would be best done once all of the 13 character stories have been written. It took me about 25 hours to run through all the character paths, the game has a nice skip function where you can forward through sections you have already seen. However currently it cannot do this where sections are indentical but accessed through different paths.\n\nThere seems much debate if this game is "suitable" for steam. Personally I think not every game needs to be the latest shot them up, where the only difference is the arena, models for monsters and allowing people to pay real money to dress up your doll (oops sorry character!). All a game needs to be is something that is an amusing diversion for a number of hours, I have paid alot more for other games (such as X Rebirth) that have taken alot more developement hours and far more graphics eye candy, but yet been utterly boring to play. The story in GBDNATE grabbled me from the start, and made me laugh alot, even though I am not into furries!\n\nIf you don't like anime or don't like laugh at rediculous situations and prefer to spend your time blowing things up then this game is not for you. However the good news is there are plenty of identical clone first person shoters for you to pick from.\n\nAll we need now GBDNATE to be a proper steam game is Badges and Achievements!","September 7, 2014","true","40.3"," 30 of 148 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","30","148","0","9"
