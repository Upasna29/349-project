The aim of the game is to complete  several tasks such as  researching  monoliths that once unlocked  gain you extra attributes such as  speedier minions, slower enemies, increases the range of your weapons or  makes for faster resource production. Other aims are to complete  all four monoliths  within 45 minutes and to survive the 28 waves of enemies that get steadily harder as you progress.   You race against time between  enemy attacks to build your various  modules.  The sensible thing is to  concentrate on aiming for one monolith at a time and  building   one each of   the modules  in turn till  the cycle begins again.   The sortest route to each monolith is  the optimum so use  the pieces  that appear at the top left of the  game field to decide  when to build a new corridor.  As your work force increases you can manage them via the  task bar at the bottom of the game field, swapping  minions between tasks as and when needed.\n\nThe game gets progressivley harder as your corridor like space capsule spead out like a spiders web,   reaching for the   four  monoliths.  Once you connect with  one of these you have to research it using a minimum of one   minion or a maximum of three.  The faster you   complete the research, the  sooner you can use it's attributes.   To ensure the survival of your minions you  need to place weapons capsules strategically throughout your maze of corridors as each  module only covers a small area no more than a couple of modules in any direction.    Enemies attack  minions which can only take a few hits   so   you're constantly having to create new minions at the end of each attack via  the habitat  module (but you need resources from the kitchen to create new minions).  Before an attack is imminent you get a brief red flashing warning.  At this point you  should    swap all  minions tasks to   weapons    to ensure that all of your weapon stations are manned by minions.  This is the safest location for a miniom during an attack.  Once the attack is over  you should then  retask your  minions  to return to their previous tasks ASAP.  This is done by dragging   them via a task bar at the bottom of the game field to where you want them to be.  There's an alternative method of returning to previous tasks,  which you're informed of in the tutorial, and which I didn't really take note of it at the time, as I found using the task bar  easier;   I think its done by  clicking on the appropriate modules that were being worked on previous to the attack but not 100% sure..\n\nWhen you first start the game  there is a short tutotial that  holds your hand through the first few module builds until the first attack is imminent.  I failed miserably  at my first few  attempts trying to send out  corridors to each  of the  monoliths without  building the support services and because I ignored the tutorial.  You have to ensure you have a constant supply of living quarters  and food  to be able to increase the size of your colony and to sustain it as well as  build extractors, and reactors to ensure you have energy and resources to build.\n\nIf you are into strategic games and tower defense games coupled loosely with a space theme you'll love this game.  It looks  minimalistic, but it sure gave  me a buzz playing it.  It's one of those games   where you don't relaize  where the time has gone after looking away from the monitor.  I'll surely be playing this for a long time to come, or at least until i've managed to complete  a few rounds.\n\nThe    games name rymdkapsel is derived from the Swedish  name for space capsule.","January 17, 2015","true","9.0"," 32 of 33 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","32","33","0","1"

But the twist here is that these blocks are populated by... well, I'm not sure what they are, but they look like rectangles. Each block has a function, so you have a block for defense, for harvesting, for gardens, for cooking and a few more. You have to combine all of these blocks together to create a living world where the main goal is to explore and survive. You can't build a straight road unless you're lucky because each time you construct something a random shape is generated so you have to work with what you get.\n\nAt the bottom of the screen you'll see a bar filling up. Once it's full enemies will attack. It starts with 2  enemies that can easily be defeated, but once the wave is over, the bar will refill and new enemies will arrive. The longer you survive the faster the bar fills up and the more enemies will appear. It can get very hectic, especially if your workers can't get to their battle station in time or if you have too few people left to defend it all.\n\nAnd that's where the exploration part kicks in. There are monoliths to be discovered that can positively alter stuff. Like, for example, making your workers move faster. These seem essential the further you get and it's recommended that you discover and analyze them as soon as possible. There are also multiple objectives to complete, but at the moment for me it's not entirely clear why they're exactly there. Maybe to give you a goal, I don't know.\n\nGraphically the game has a very minimalistic look. There are no bells and whistles, just the essential stuff. The music is also very soothing... until you get that battle alert at least.\nSo nothing fancy here but it does look sharp and colorful and has a style of its own which I can absolutely appreciate.\n\nThe game also feels very relaxing... until, well, things are about to fall apart. Just like how the real Tetris feels.\nAnyway, I like Rymdkapsel. I like it a lot. You should too.\n\n[Rating: 79/100]","August 3, 2014","true","2.0"," 28 of 30 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","28","30","0","3"

Games are unique because of this and are enjoyed because of this interaction with the medium; this is where rymdkapsel separates itself from the competitors.  Its goal is to have minimal user input without souring the experience, macro problem solving would be a good way to describe it.\n\nThe objective of the game is very simple, survive. This is done by constructing a well-fortified station with the help of your minions. You are attacked at set intervals by an enemy and during the downtime you have to prepare and explore. The mode is quite simple and to be frank starts off very slow, and while it may pick up in pace later on it goes from one extreme to the next, due to the poor AI a lot of the time you can’t even perform an action during the break. There are some missions to help break the monotony but they’re very bland.\n\nThe minions are not controlled on an individual level, instead you’re given an overview and decide how many minions you want in a given field of work. This can cause some hilarities and frustrations as your minions walk around like sheep and try to build your masterpiece as they all focus in a singular area even though only one minion will be needed. The same can be said for their fighting as they only can work in groups of two, and if you get some unlucky RNG with the enemy grouping they can wipe you out even if you have overwhelming numbers.\n\nThe game has a pseudo 3D art style which uses vector based visuals which are quite a treat to look at, and for some this will probably be the biggest draw to the game. With the strong use of colour to help dictate certain areas of your station a colour blind mode has been added, which is greatly needed for those who suffer. Why more games don’t have colour blind modes, we’ll never know but it’s good to see it in rymdkapsel and they should be praised for noticing and rectifying this possible flaw in their game.\n\nThe soundtrack is quite ambient giving off a space feel while still being quite simple, sound effects on the overhand are a little lacking but nothing that will turn you off. The game was originally on PSVITA and as such we have to discuss the port. While it does run smoothly it really lacks a decent options menu, no audio sliders, UI is locked to 4 presets (though better than none at all) and there is a total lack of keyboard support.\n\nrymdkapsel lacks a lot of things that would be considered micro, causing the player at times feel useless. This plays as a strength and a weakness to the game and may turn people off. For what it’s worth, rymdkapsel is very interesting and unique, while not perfect you should still be able to objectively view it and see some of the great ideas it has. How many strategy games can you play with one hand, while the other gets that itch which is always behind your left ear?","January 30, 2014","true","3.8"," 52 of 73 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","52","73","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/VALIS/recommended/253790/","VALIS","VALIS","http://steamcommunity.com/id/VALIS/","7552 products in account","A very stylish, spacy RTS-lite that has you commanding your little block men to mine resources, build, research and defend, with the ultimate goal of reaching and researching the four monoliths in each corner of the smallish map. The gameplay is as minimalistic as the graphics -- you have seven building structures to choose from, and have to balance your construction of them based on your available resources, while at the same time making sure you don't put your block men too far away from their battle stations at any time as they must fend off the occasional attack wave, which increase in frequency and strength as the game goes on.\n\nWithout balance and a fair (but not frustrating) level of difficulty, this game probably would have been too simple to be anything but a flavor of the minute, the type of game you play for a day or two to never return to. But it is well balanced and challenging, and the minimal graphics and excellent space synth soundtrack (my wife walked by and asked if I was listening to Pink Floyd) allow this game to succeed in both style and play.","February 16, 2014","true","4.3"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","22","25","0","0"

Your goal is to expand your space station by placing down rooms as effectively as possible taking into account their shape which is somewhat random and inspired by Tetris as you stretch out through the void heading for your ultimate goal, the research of four mysterious Monoliths.\n\nTo do this, you command your minions to fulfil a specific task, such as construction or research and watch as they do their best to fulfil their roles while you oversee expansion and reassign positions as needed, like switching up an engineer who usually boosts resource production into a defencive role to thwart incoming enemies who periodically attack your minions.\n\nThe game uses a collection of known variables and tasks you with using them as best you can. As such, its the type of game that might appeal to those who enjoy refining a strategy or simply improving on a previous attempt. Don't expect a great deal of variation, you'll likely learn everything you need to during your first attempt and from then on, its a matter of using that knowledge efficiently to succeed.\n\nJust like the resource you collect in game, there is enjoyment to be extracted from the game...I just feel it runs dry sooner than you'd expect, not helped by AI oddities such as your builders quite happily doubling up on resources for a construction or the lack of direct minion control can lead to mild frustration.\n\nIt's an interesting game and one that I'd like to recommend, but feels a little bit like a proof of concept rather than a fully fledged title. What's there is good but slightly limited and as such I'd strongly recommend waiting for a discount as even if you really enjoy it, it could prove to be very short lived.","August 7, 2014","false","3.7"," 19 of 26 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","19","26","0","0"

Some may find it's options limited, but what it does, it does well. The AI does a lot of the work, you have no direct control over your blocky minions. Rest assured the AI does it's job pretty well, I rarely got annoyed by the AI doing things inefficiently.\n\nIf you're looking for a challenge you can up the difficulty by going for the harder modes or attempting some of the more difficult achivements. All of a sudden efficient placement of your tetrislike rooms becomes a lot more crucial!\n\nIn short, definitely recommended for anyone who is into this kind of strategy/management games. If you're looking for a game with a lot of different options or want control over your "troops", then Rymdkapsel might be too niche for you.","June 27, 2014","true","8.3"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

I got so into the game I played for 3+ hours without realizing. I thought maybe 40 minutes had gone by.\n\nIt did a couple things right for me personally to achieve that: enjoyable base building and management of units, despite the minimal approach + short, challenging, make it or break it runs to achieve various goals. The first level/difficulty of the game was a blast, easy enough to keep playing though challenging enough you will die, reassess your strategy, and start over a few times. Next level/difficulty is more challenging (I haven't gotten all the achievements yet) but similar. Build, manage, gather and grow resources, power ups, fight enemies, die, reassess strategy, try again. It's quite fun and sucks you in!\n\nAll of that works really well and I'd recommend it. The downside is that it's a small, short game. Once you beat those two levels/difficulties and their set of achievements you're done with the game.\nPersonally I'd love to have seen several more levels and maps and more enemy variety. Maybe a couple more game mechanics. Also, a zen mode, super easy mode, or a huuuuuge map that you could really put some time and effort into a base instead of the many shorter bursts. Just any game mode that you could play an extended game on.\n\nBut none of that really took away from the fun. Get it on sale if you want, it's fun and worth playing for a bit if you're into RTS games.","March 28, 2015","true","3.7"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

The core gameplay comprises of placing rooms, unit and time management. It also requires a bit of forward thinking, to make sure you don't get stuck in an economic situation you can't get out of.\n\nThere are three modes, normal (from the tablet version), zen mode (no enemies) and hard mode (I haven't beaten it yet, it's hard!). The crisp graphics and sound help to focus you on the gameplay. A couple of achievements are available, I unlocked most of them on normal mode.\n\nOverall it's a pretty fun game, but the starting price might be a bit high for some people, so add it to your wishlist!","January 30, 2014","true","2.8"," 22 of 37 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","22","37","0","0"

Complexities are handled with exceptional grace; in many ways it's evocative of Tetris, that king of the casual digital pastime, not just in its mechanics but in its accessibility and gripping power. rymdkapsel deftly balances pensive downtime (building your station, managing resources and units) with punctuated bursts of frenzy (enemy attacks), and the difficulty gradually ramps up as your area expands and proper resource management becomes increasingly tricky. Every element is of critical importance to each other, and the agency provided means that no two games should play the same way.\n\nYou can play to relax or to pursue a number of larger goals that provide replay value and foster a sense of ongoing improvement. These tasks may seem few, but you likely won't achieve them all in a game or two, nor does the game expect you will. You must work for these milestones, and before you know it you'll find the hours flying by as you drive the push out to the next monolith or fight off just one more wave of enemies.\n\nSome might be turned off by the game's slow pace, especially in the early-going, but those that stick with it will find reward, even if it outwardly seems short-lived. Once you’ve picked apart the game’s elaborate system and discovered the path to completing every task, there’s nothing else to see aside from a harder variation in Plus mode and a Zen mode that feels incomplete without periodic enemy invasions.\n\nStill, if you like puzzle games or real-time strategy, this meditative space odyssey is a killer time-killer.","June 26, 2015","true","8.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

It's a strategy game set in space. You control little rectangles and give them orders. They can build more rectangles (and squares too!). They get attacked by triangle-looking things that fly. Did I mention that the resources are also in the form of various shapes?\n\nWhile playing, you're tasked with expanding your little "station" by way of ordering minionsto do various tasks. When you first start off, you're supplied with a limited amount of each of the three types of resources: blue cubes, purple squares, and yellow pyramids. Each resource is used in building new rooms and corridors for your station. Every room has to be attached to a corridor in some way. Corridors are relatively cheap to make, and you'll need them to get to the four monoliths in each corner of the map.\n\nYou start off with a few minions, who can each be given a single task. If a minion is placed into the "construction" group, then that minion will work on building new rooms and corridors whenever the player places a new one. You'll probably want to start off the game by building the basic resource-gathering rooms. The blue cubes are generated out of thin air and the purple squares are harvested from the various pools of them scattered throughout the map.\n\nThe yellow pyramids, however, require a bit more effort to earn. First, you must grow food in a "gardens" room, then, a minion (or two, or three) must be tasked with "food service". These minions will then bring the green trapezoids (well, I think they're trapezoids) into the "kitchen" room, which then turns the raw food into the yellow pyramids for use in other rooms, like the quarters (which gives you two more minions) or the weapons room.\n\nThe weapons room is essential for protecting the base from attack. Every round (yes, the game plays in rounds), a series of attackers will come in and attempt to destroy your minions. If all of the minions are destroyed, you're gone. The weapons room, when minions are assigned to it, allow the minions to wield weapons to defend against these attackers. I tried to clump together all of my weapons stations, but still failed in the later rounds, as there were simply too many hostiles for my minions to deal with.\n\nI found that the rounds started progressing a little too fast. As I got farther into the game, the rounds got progressively shorter, and more aliens attacked the base. There's actually a monolith that can help out with this, as it slows down the rounds. I started going for this monolith first after my first play session.\n\nYour ultimate goal is to survive as long as possible. The game does give you some minor "goals", but your major goal is to just survive. There are four monoliths in each corner, each containing a separate ability to help you out in the long run. One of them improves your extractor's efficiency, with another improving your minion's walk speed. Once you reach a monolith, you can assign up to three minions to research it. This takes quite some time, and I had to withdraw those minions several times due to incoming hostiles. I've yet to complete a game in which I've researched all of the monoliths, but I was close!\n\nrymdkapsel is a fantastic game overall. It looks stupidly simple, but it's just so addicting. Highly recommended.","February 8, 2014","true","2.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/erickolb/recommended/253790/","erickolb","The Professor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/erickolb/","96 products in account","Minimalism is, counter-intuitively, a complex idea. What begins with the simple maxim, "Less is more," evolves into a study in negative space, contrast and juxtaposition, color, and the quintessential expression of an idea. It's an incredibly challenging discipline to adhere to and execute faithfully.\n\nIt's easy to see that rymdkapsel is a minimalist game. Stylistically this much is obvious. But this game embodies the whole spirit of minimalism. It does not merely conflate low-fidelity with minimalism, as some 8- and 16-bit styled indie titles do.\n\nRymdkapsel is a space sim. You control a tetrad-bound space station with little people in it. The presents you with one essential goal: survive. The fundamental strategy to do so is easily explained with the in-game tutorial and involves a handful of room types. How these rooms behave play into a neat and concise set of rules with no caveats and special cases.\n\nThere is a fine balance here between simple game play and flexibility of strategy. It might seem that there is a master strategy one could use, but the expression of that strategy allows a great deal of variance and keeps it interesting from game to game.\n\nYou could say that there are optional goals like "research all the monoliths", but those are just advanced constructs of the same root goal. Researching monoliths provides passive improvement to your space citizens, so the purity of the one goal is not diluted. You are never really required to pursue this. Artificial constructs like 'achievements' might goad you to, but in truth, you don't really "get" anything for doing so.\n\nGames rarely last more than an hour. A natural escalation of aggression guarantees that, in the end, you will lose. Recall that the goal of the game is to survive - the metric, therefore, is how long you can. Consider: a strategy game that terminates like an endless line runner. The elegance of this solution is a little mind-blowing.\n\nI enjoy this game quite a good deal and would recommend it to anyone looking for an engaging sim with low game-to-game time investment. This was a hit on tablets and I waited for the PC version to pick it up; it plays wonderfully and I don't get the sense that anything was lost in translation.","February 5, 2014","true","8.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

But once you've done that, you're basically done. The enemy waves keep coming faster and faster, but there's not really any goal beyond putting all your mindless minions on defense and shooting them down. A vaguely interesting building/management game, but loses steam once you've hit the 4 goal points.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/forgottendawn/recommended/253790/","forgottendawn","Forgotten Dawn (KKS)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/forgottendawn/","182 products in account","To be really fair, I'm rather mixed about this game. Rymdkapsel is a minimal real time strategy game featuring a space station that you're supposed to manage, whether it's about expanding it or defending yourself from waves of hostiles. The whole premise is in fact quite simple: survival. But here's where it gets perhaps too simple.\n\nThere's no story, leaving you to come up with your own adventure and fantasize about whatever comes into your mind. That's fine. But what about adding some actual depth to the gameplay? The latter consists of a few types of room you can build/manage, three kinds of resources that you'll almost end up not using (especially food, which becomes rather useless since you won't need it that much compared to energy/blue cubes and minerals/pink squares), and only a few side objectives that become your main once you realize this is what the whole game has to offer.\n\nThe monoliths could have been used to actually shed a bit of light on a possible backstory involving space archeology or perhaps even the origins of your own space station. Who dispatched you there in the middle of nowhere to begin with? Who is your people, consisting only of blocks in an isometric square world? You know, giving some more spice other than "here's something, grab it".\n\nI also would have loved if the AI leading your work squad wasn't so sluggish and primitive. For instance, if you have a series of corridors you need to build in order to get to a Monolith and have more than two minions working on it, you can witness the AI's incapacity for queueing tasks, leading minions to BACKTRACK and start over again if a piece of corridor gets finished before they're able to deliver the needed resources.\n\nFurthermore, since Monoliths actually grant some substantial boosts to your management, you'd want to get there ASAP and make sure your minions don't get annihilated by incoming waves... something very likely to happen because the route is often quite long from the starting point and minions don't have enough time to reach their turrets, leading you to build extra minions again and wait countless turns to even build more weaponries near the Monoliths. I'd consider that more a design flaw than an actual challenge since it's also the only thing providing some difficulty to the experience and the game itself is designed to be "finished" under 45 minutes.\n\nThe soundtrack is almost non-existent, consisting only of a single drone ambiance that vaguely reminds you of 70's space music and a few sound effects functional to the game itself and that's about it.\n\nOverall, I expected a lot better from this game since I was initially intrigued by the design choices which ultimately left me quite "cold" and wishing for more. It's not easy to work out a "minimal" formula that works in a certain context, often leaving the experience at a mediocre state because it fails to provide depth to the lack of elements which is pretty much rymdkapsel's case.","December 26, 2014","false","3.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","4"

Also, since there is a limit to how close you can build your defensive rooms the enemies can all spawn together, coming from the same direction and nothing can stop them.

While this game has been out for over a year now on other peripherals (Android, iOS, etc.), I’m very glad that it came to the PC as I probably wouldn’t have known that it existed…considering how much I enjoy playing “rymdkapsel”, that would have been a real shame.

Just be forewarned that the game has limited replayability, though it wouldn't surprise me if Rymdkapsel is the kind of game that I'd play for a session of two every month for the next year.\n\nThis is the kind of game that one can write a reasoned review for after just a couple of hours. The minimalist art style is at once efficient and iconic--the kind of style that, if adopted by other games, one may remark: "Oh, yeah, that's very Rymdkapsel-ly." A bit awkward for the mouth, but like Rymdkapsel, efficient.\n\nRymdkapsel is a real-time, pausable strategy game in which you select from a series of 4-block segements to build a contiguous base--they call it a space station, but it would work for a variety of genres. You must manage three different resources--which, like the rest of the game, are represented by simple geometric shapes of differing colors--all of which have slightly different generation mechanics. The modules of the station are few, the minions relatively mindless, but the mechanic is tight: a stubborn completionist should get several hours out of the game before figuring out how to complete the last "mission goal".\n\nThere's not much of a tutorial to speak of, nor multiple play modes, nor much of anything outside of the primary mechanic: "given this limited toolset for this type of problem, how do you solve it?" Your first two-three playthroughs may seem a bit harried, especially toward the end--warning/spoiler: don't bother trying to build anything after wave 22--but as you warm to the mechanic it'll become an exciting quandary to tackle.\n\nMuch like Sudoku, this game is initially difficult to learn; one derives the most pleasure from solving it after the first 20-30 tries; but once you've got it down pat, it's much more of a lower-state-of-consciousness time sink.

Ratings for categories range from 0-10 and the final rating ranges from 0-100 but is not the sum of the other ratings - they do not all have the same importance. I'm trying to be as objective as possible, but needless to say this is a subjective view of a user.\nI only play games on PC on Windows and Linux with mouse and keyboard, so I cannot give any analysis to how well games work with controllers or on Mac.\nPlaytime at last review update: 2.3 hours\n\nDescription\nRymdkapsel is a light/casual strategy game.\n\nStory\nNo story.\n0/10\n\nVisuals\nIt has very simple isometric graphics, which is largely fine for the game. Unfortunately even that simple graphics style could have used a little refinement. Especially the background is downright embarassing - it's a spinning black background with stripes on it. Even if you like the graphics and think they fit the game as I do there's nothing special here.\n3/10\n\nSound\nThe background music is monotone and annoying. The sound effects are minimalistic but fit the game, but also nothing special here.\n2/10\n\nControls\nYou control with the mouse. The controls work fine for what's offered.\n10/10\n\nOptions\nNearly no options in this one. Colorblind mode, tutorial messages on or off, sound on or off (no separate options, no sliders), fullscreen or not and screen scaling, which zooms the game in or out (I assume that's for the lack of resolution options). This is one of the most minimalistic options menus I have ever seen. It doesn't even have a real difficulty setting or save slots.\n0/10\n\nGameplay\nYou have a couple of minions that are responsible for everything that's happening on your space station. There are a couple of ressources that have to be transported and some building blocks that you can place and your minions have to build. All you can do, though, is assign minions to certain very broad tasks (or should I say task groups) like construction, base defense, food supply and so on. This is not inherently bad and clearly the idea of the game, but it just doesn't work at all with their AI. Example: one task group is construction. Let's say I put all my 10 minions into construction with 4 building jobs on the space station available, each one needs 2 kinds of ressources. Then all the minions will attempt to do the same thing, i.e., move to the "first" ressource, load up, and run to the first construction site. Of course, because they have the same speed, all of them will arrive there at approximately the same time at which point the 2nd to 10th minion will realize that that ressource is no longer needed because the first minion already supplied it. They will then look for another building that needs that ressource or go get another ressource. So basically there's no point assigning a lot of minions to one task because their AI doesn't realize which ressources are already being supplied. This pretty much breaks the game because time for movement is of essence in this game. The idea was good but the execution is terrible in my opinion. I assume this could have been patched to something more enjoyable in a matter of a few hours.\nEven if it would work a little better there's not much to do. It's pretty much a waiting game. The strategy is not very deep. The game modes available are pretty much all the same, just with easier or harder waves of enemies or no enemies at all.\n1/10\n\nContent\nAfter you've played a game you've pretty much seen it all. If you're not completely bugged out by the broken mechanics at that point you might play a few more to get better at what you're doing, but content wise there's nothing there.\n1/10\n\nPlatforms\nAvailable on Windows, Mac and Linux/SteamOS and runs fine on the first and the last of those.\n10/10\n\nPerformance\nThis game is almost 2d and has around 20-30 colors including shades. You can run it on a glorified toaster.\n10/10\n\nExternal\nNo external EULA or similar crap.\n10/10\n\nPrice (relative to content)\nFull price is 6.99 EUR or regional equivalent. On sale you can get it as low as 2.79 at which point I would still not get it because it has nearly no content. In my opinion you're better off playing some flash games online for free. If you desperately want to play this still, wait for it to come out in a bundle or be on really heavy sale, because my bet is you'll be disappointed.\n2/10\n\nDLC\nNo DLC.\nFortunately.\n\nOther\n/\n\nIndie or not indie\nIndie\n\nFinal Comments\nBelieve it or not, I like simple strategy games like this one a great deal. But this game has really disappointed in its mechanics. I don't care much for graphics, but the gameplay has to be fun, and this game brings nothing to the table at all. That being said, if you still think this might be for you, the price is relatively low as an absolute value, so you won't have to go hungry if you get it and find out it sucks just as much as I said it did.\n\nFinal Personal Rating\n10/100\n\nHave fun in games,\nDNF","January 5, 2015","false","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Your task is to last as long as you can.\n\nTo do so you need to build your base which is made of Tetris-piece shaped rooms. Every room is built for a specific task: grow food (garden), cook food (kitchen), house minion, gather resources (there are two kind) and defend from the enemy.\n\nYou cannot directly command you minions but you give them one of the possible tasks: build rooms, handle food in order to increase the number of minons), use resources to build new rooms, improve resource gathering speed, defend your base in one of the defense rooms, and do research (there are pre-made rooms where your minions can research improvements). The minions will decide on their own how to do the task (which room to build, or where to bring food).\n\nThe nicest point of the game is that it gets away with micromanagement, and let you enjoy your minion's activity "from above". The difficulty of the game increase quite quickly so you need to be careful and plan a bit in advance, but it is well balanced and enjoyable.\n\nThe worst part is that the game has only two levels (plus one without enemies) which shortens longevity a lot: if there was a way to generate random levels it would be perfect.\n","February 6","true","26.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
