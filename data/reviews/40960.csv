"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrivateGodfrey/recommended/40960/","PrivateGodfrey","Captain MooMoos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrivateGodfrey/","490 products in account","This is a long review, so look for the game you are most interested in and read from there.\n\nStronghold Collection Information:\nFirefly studios finally does it again with The Stronghold Collection. Well as you can tell from the product description this pack includes: Stronghold, Stronghold 2, Stronghold Crusader, Stronghold Crusader Extreme, and Stronghold Legends. Stronghold and Stronghold Crusader both have patches that make them HD (1080p), so buying this pack essentially gets you both those games in HD without having to buy them individually. So essentially for an additional $4.00 you can get Stronghold 2 and Stronghold Legends (as Stronghold HD is $4.99 and Stronghold Crusader HD is $9.99)\n\nStronghold 1:\nStronghold is the first in the Stronghold Series. It offers the introduction of castle simulation with managing villagers, food supply (apples, cheese, wheat, meat), resources (timber, stone, pitch, and iron), products (armor, weapons, etc.), religion, and taxes. You can build a market and trade for these resources if you are low in order to create an army without having to have mass production of every asset. Stronghold offers a riveting campaign revolving around a young man who takes vengeance on his father by defeating each of his foes. The campaign is fun, but at some points can be near impossible. Luckily this is an old game so if you need to you can cheat without any penalty. The missions are fun, and each require you to focus on different strategies.\n\nHint: Remember you can adjust gameplay speed mid mission, I would recommend doing this at the start of each level till you've got your desired castle layout. Then slowly bringing the speed up to max speed when you know you have got the victory.\n\nPros:\n+Great campaign\n+Fun castle management system\n+intelligent resource management system\n+Wide unit diversity.\n\nCons:\n-Poor unit movement\n-Eventual population cap because cost to keep food inflowing is too high\n-Siege missions can be so tough you are required to cheat\n-No skirmish mode.\n\nStronghold 2:\nStronghold 2 is the point where Firefly made a huge mistake. This is not because I just wanted the same game as Stronghold 1, but rather because this is a prime example when a game maker has a great concept but executes wrong in every way. The campaign is divided into two sections: Peace and War.\n\nFirstly the Peace Campaign, well it’s terrible. In this campaign you are not a knight, and you must earn knighthood by living like a lord. You must create a stable town and create required goods which change for each mission. Each mission is on the same map, but in a different town. This sounds smart, but you essentially lose most of your progress between each town. You can build in the other towns, but you do not share pooled resources. So in each new town you own you must construct timber mills, farms, and so forth in order to maintain that village. Then you must build trade posts in order to trade resources from that village to your village. You cannot change taxes offer any real control on the mood of the villagers (so once they get upset it’s almost impossible to make them happy again). Some of the missions are timed, so you must do all this very quickly. This can be infuriating especially with banqueting goods, which can take for ages to accumulate even with a village full of banqueting production facilities. Similar to Stronghold 1 I highly recommend you put a lot of effort in controlling game speed. As some missions every millisecond counts and you will need to not only destroy your entire village to meet the demands of the mission, but you must do it quickly and efficiently.\n\nSecondly the War Campaign, it’s not too bad. You play as Matthew Steele a page to Sir William, and your mission is to take down The Hammer, The Hawk, The Bull, and Olaf traitors to the king. In this campaign you are given the choice to turn against the king or side with him after the fourth mission. This choice you open up four missions for the path of good or the path of evil. This means if you want to beat the game completely you need to beat the fourth mission twice so you can choose both the good and evil path. Similar to the Peace Campaign each map has multiple villages which you can capture by sending units to the town flag. If you capture a village you can use it to help gather resources more efficiently. This is an interesting concept although still is lacking because you can capture a village, build it up, and lose in in a few seconds because the enemy has swooped in with an army. Switching the village to their side and allowing them all the work that you did, making the villages essentially giant wastes of time.\n\nHint: On the fourth mission I would recommend building a beyond measurable army as you lose your castle to an ally, so if your army isn't ridiculously big then you won't be able to win the mission.\n\nPros:\n+Interesting war campaign\n+Military units are a lot quicker to build and can be built larger numbers\n+Ownership of multiple townships means you don't need to overpopulate your home village for resource needs\n+Better unit mapping allows for smoother movements\n+No maps require cheating unlike in the first one.\n\nCons:\n-Too many goods you need to produce (banqueting just seems excessive)\n-Most units require honor so if you don't have any you can't build an army\n-Graphics are considerably bad in comparison to the first one\n-The voice acting is just awful\n-This one has not been bumped to HD (1080p)\n-The peaceful campaign is just plain awful\n-Still no scenarios\n-Firefly got rid of The Rat, The Snake, The Pig, and The Wolf.\n\nStronghold Crusader & Stronghold Crusader Extreme:\nStronghold Crusader is most commonly referred to as the best Stronghold from the series. This game is based around crusades (obvious from the title) and involves playing in a whole new landscape with brilliant new features. Stronghold Crusader offers different types of castles Arabic or European and introduces a whole new Skirmish mode.\n\nSkirmish mode brings whole new life to the Stronghold series. No longer are you limited by the campaign system, instead you can play in matches against AI where you both build castles and try to take the other one down. The skirmish mode can be played with up to eight players (I believe) on various sized maps. There are sixteen different characters each with varying tactics and difficulty curves. Our fabled original villains The Rat, The Snake, The Pig, and The Wolf return in this triumphant sequel. The other characters include: The Marshall, The Abbot, King Phillip, The Lionheart, Emperor Frederick, The Sultan, The Caliph, The Nizar, The Wazir, The Emir, and Saladin.\n\nPros:\n+Skirmish mode\n+16 Different characters with varying tactics and difficulties to play against.\n+Middle Eastern environments and limitations (farms can only be built on oasis)\n+Newly introduced mercenary camp\n+Traditional campaign offers a fun story with practice for the skirmish mode\n+Multiplayer mode\n+HD (1080p) resolution\n\nCons:\n-Mercenary units can defeat the point of actually building units (the archers from mercenary barracks are just as good as the archers you build – based on the cost and amount of effort required to get them).\n-The maps can be rather small and thus not offer much room to really expand a kingdom.\n\nStronghold Legends:\nWell I haven’t beat or even played Stronghold Legends. This game is next on my list, so I will update this review with information regarding this game after I beat it.","February 27, 2014","true","21.2"," 293 of 310 people (95%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","95","293","310","6","13"

I'm a bit of a medieval fanatic so I know what I'm saying when I tell you that I van definately recommend this collection!\n\nThe original Stronghold is the best. While old, the game mechanics are still quite impressive. Like any Stronghold game, you basically build your castle the way you want while simultaneously managing your stockpiles, funds, and hundreds of ungrateful peasants. You need to keep them happy, for the most part, but stronghold one has more to offer: you can also use fear to terrorize your subjects into submission! This, imo is the best way since if you can keep them both happy but intimidated, they will work much harder and produce more resources. Stronghold 1 imo is a 10/10!\n\nStronghold 2 is basically like the first one but with 3D graphics and a really annoying yet fun crimne system. Unfortunately, they completely got rid of the fear factor stuff and replaced it with crime which was a terrible mistake, FACT. However, Stronghold 2 is still tons of fun and to this day is still one of my favorites. Castle sieges are where this game shines as combat is a bit more realistic. Knights can no longer bring down castle walls as they could in stronghold 1. I give stronghold 2 an 8/10!\n\nStronghold Legends is imo the weakest of the franchise. It's an extremely dumbed down version of Stronghold 2. There is no crime or fear factoring and its just way too easy. Un;ess you completely suck at these kind of games, you will never see your happiness rate drop below 99. The only things I think are good about this game are the medieval mythology setting and the map editor. Imo, Legends gets a 4/10.\n\nAll in all, this collection is great!

However, having bought this pack, and played some of each game I now love this series. The combination of castle building/planning, military action, and having to balance your economy and flow of gold with the happiness of your peasants makes this a fairly deep, very interesting game.\n\nPersonally I prefer the first Stronghold over the others simply because when they moved into 3D graphics the game started looking rather cartoony. I got used to it, and play Stronghold: Legends regularly.\n\nOverall if you're looking for a good medieval themed strategy game that has a good learning curve, excellent map editor, and overall superb campaign modes, this is the game for you. I recommend getting the Stronghold Collection, because it'll give you a nice array of games to play, each with their own little bits that makes everything different between the games.","January 11, 2014","true","4.6"," 41 of 45 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","41","45","0","0"

What you're getting is...\n\nThe original Stronghold from 2001 - a game that has aged tremendously well and looks good to this day. You build your castle and defend it from various warlords that would seek to destroy it through RTS mechanics and controlling large armies of medieval soldiers while keeping your castle happy, or simply build peacefully however you wish. Comes with a map and scenario editor and a HUGE community with downloadable maps and scenarios too. The HD remake included here also has some of these community maps and missions built in.\n\nStronghold Crusader (2002) - This was where stuff got interesting as this implemented AI for building castles and such, meaning now you could play against AI opponents building their own castle across the map and be rushed to simply have a better one than them before armies clash. The original stronghold had multiplayer, but the faster paced style of this one plus literally double the amount of units you can train thanks to mercenary outposts makes it considerably more fun to play with friends.\n\nStronghold 2 (2005) - This was the first 3D stronghold game to be released, and at the time of its' launch had massive bugs, crashes, and performance issues, much like a certain Stronghold 3. Difference was, they FIXED stronghold 2. The game now has a larger scale to it, with campaign missions that can span large amounts of time on a single map thanks to numerous objectives and AI castles to deal with. Bringing back AI castles and mercenaries from Crusader, this also adds in a new type of granary - the Lord's Kitchen - with 4 new types of food for your lord and various guests that magically appear during times of battle without the enemy noticing. It also goes back to Stronghold 1' style in a way, doing away with deserts and bringing back the worthless wooden walls that are brought down by peasants, as well as a new resource in the form of honor which encourages the use of the new buildings, as honor is now used to train most troops and mercenaries. It also adds in the "estate" system, which are little villages around the map that can be purchased/captured and will send you resources via horse cart, which can also be used to send your allies resources. Multiplayer is especially fun, although the inability to add AI castles during multiplayer matches (singleplayer only) is a bit upsetting.\n\nStronghold Legends (2006) - Based heavily off of Stronghold 2, this game features 3 different factions you can play as which now varies your gameplay massively. Taking place in mythical times, you can play as the good, the ice, or the evil, with it changing the look and play style of your castle along with it. The good side plays very much like normal stronghold, and is therefore very easy to pick up for veterans, but with the addition of King Arthur's knights of the round table as trainable, highly powerful knight units. The ice style adds in new flying units and ice-based giants and such, while also having its' own graphical style, new music, and some different structures you can place in addition to normal ones. The evil side has all sorts of weird creepy-crawly things that can easily overrun your castle, climbing right up and over walls and demolishing things easily, once again with its own visual style, music, and different structures. This also brought back adding AI to multiplayer games, allowing PVE gameplay with friends. Problem is, this is also the most glitchy game in the bundle, with AI that openly cheats by having access to things they should not be able to build yet, and also some strange changed things such as markets being absolutely useless, strange prices for resources, and other various things...oddly enough, it's these changes that people didn't much like that were kept in stronghold 3 and crusader 2. Still worth a play though.\n\nOverall...for $20, you get 4 fantastic games that are going to give you a fantastic time playing. Make sure to get a program called "Gameranger" however, as all 4 of these games ran on gamespy for multiplayer which is now down - gameranger lets you play with friends or publically by using its' own servers rather than gamespy.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zanriel/recommended/40960/","zanriel","Zanriel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zanriel/","874 products in account","What a fantastic collection! All the best Stronghold games right here. Each one is excellent in its own right. If you want Stronghold Legends, this is the only way to get it, and that one is probably my favorite of the series.\n\nStronghold Legends uses the same engine as Stronghold 2, so it's 3D and you have full pan and zoom controls. Where it differs is less civic management (no law enforcement, dung pits, or falconer's posts), but in its place you get fantasy and hero units. There are multiple story based campaigns, as well as skirmish trails, so there's plenty to do.\n\nThe difficulty is fairly challenging, even on easy, so you need to play smart, build quickly, and focus on multiple things at once. In the story based campaigns, you may end up using a castle on one chapter that you built several chapters previously, so take care and build up as strong as possible on each mission. Most chapters have timed objectives, as is typical in most Stronghold games, so you have to pump out as many buildings, units, and resources as you can in a limited time. This is where the challenge comes in because it seems like you always have either too many of a certain resource, or not enough. Finding the right balance can be tricky.\n\nThere's something deeply satisfying about building the best castle you can, defending it against attack, building up an army, and then crushing the enemy. One thing lacking, however, is any kind of grand strategy game where you try and take over territories on a world map (kingdom or empire building). There's also no economic campaign or sandbox mode.\n\nI haven't tried multiplayer so I can't comment on that. However, of all the Stronghold games I've played, this one is excellent. If you're in the mood for a realistic castle simulator that gives you a sense of medieval life, play Stronghold 1, Crusader, or 2. If you're just wanting to have a good time with knights, wizards, witches, and monsters, and castles, this is it!","January 12, 2014","true","4.7"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","23","26","0","0"

Stronghold 2 may not be the greatest RTS game in the world, but what it does get right is the castle building aspect. Which is what sets it apart from the rest.

I can say that after playing Stronghold 2, original stronghold experience feels like a joke to me right now (it's still an old but gold series regardlessly).\nI cannot even gather all my praises about this game in my mind right now, it absolutely surpassed my any and every expectations. It made me addicted to a game that is very different and way better than the usual stronghold that I knew from before. And it feels like I cannot go back to those old days anymore, not unless I feel extremely nostalgic. Apparently I played more than 12 hours in 2 days, which is probably the reason why I couldn't attend the classes lol...","March 21","true","51.6"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","10","10","3","0"

This game may not have the best graphics, but with this level of gameplay it exceeds most games from the time it originated from, and I personally would be willing to say it was the best game at the time it was produced. Unfortunately multiplayer is no longer supported by firefly studios, so unless you are willing to use some basically coded software to overcome this, you may be left in the dark. I'd still advise buying it, as even if you don't wish to spend your time trying to get the multiplayer to work, It is well worth the time and effort. I advise to use gameranger if you really need a source for multiplayer.","May 24, 2015","true","214.8"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Although the game doesnt focus on battles and units as much. The game really excels with the castle management system. Keep the citizens happy to keep the gold flowing for war! Build up your castle in friendly (no enemy) maps or try your strength against Vikings, Kings and Queens! The game does a wonderful job balancing growth. Too much tax? Not enough food selection? Ale run dry? Say goodbye to your citizens and watch your castle economy screech to a halt. Great game from years past.

It's not too much money for amazing content. I may do little reviews on each game individually but the reason I am putting this on the pack as the criticism I have effects all of them: MULTIPLAYER!! I simply cannot get the multiplayer to work. It seems to be all the same problem but "Multiplayer Service is not Available".... ever; that or it crashes midgame. I don't often play Multiplayer (LAN mostly) as the singleplayer provides sufficient challenge but when I do want to I can't. This is definitely a Steam-side error since I have some disc copies of the originals and they work fine.\n\nIf anyone has a way around this that I may not have tried, please PLEASE let me know.","January 4","true","2.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

So essentially for an additional $4.00 you can get Stronghold 2 and Stronghold Legends (as Stronghold HD is $4.99 and Stronghold Crusader HD is $9.99)\n\nStronghold 1:\nStronghold is the first in the Stronghold Series. It offers the introduction of castle simulation with managing villagers, food supply (apples, cheese, wheat, meat), resources (timber, stone, pitch, and iron), products (armor, weapons, etc.), religion, and taxes. You can build a market and trade for these resources if you are low in order to create an army without having to have mass production of every asset. Stronghold offers a riveting campaign revolving around a young man who takes vengeance on his father by defeating each of his foes. The campaign is fun, but at some points can be near impossible. Luckily this is an old game so if you need to you can cheat without any penalty. The missions are fun, and each require you to focus on different strategies.\n\nPros:\n+Great campaign\n+Fun castle management system\n+intelligent resource management system\n+Wide unit diversity.\n\nCons:\n-Poor unit movement\n-Eventual population cap because cost to keep food inflowing is too high\n-Siege missions can be so tough you are required to cheat\n-No skirmish mode.\n\nStronghold 2:\nStronghold 2 is the point where Firefly made a huge mistake. This is not because I just wanted the same game as Stronghold 1, but rather because this is a prime example when a game maker has a great concept but executes wrong in every way. The campaign is divided into two sections: Peace and War.\n\nFirstly the Peace Campaign, well it’s terrible. In this campaign you are not a knight, and you must earn knighthood by living like a lord. You must create a stable town and create required goods which change for each mission. Each mission is on the same map, but in a different town. This sounds smart, but you essentially lose most of your progress between each town. You can build in the other towns, but you do not share pooled resources. So in each new town you own you must construct timber mills, farms, and so forth in order to maintain that village. Then you must build trade posts in order to trade resources from that village to your village. You cannot change taxes offer any real control on the mood of the villagers (so once they get upset it’s almost impossible to make them happy again). Some of the missions are timed, so you must do all this very quickly. This can be infuriating especially with banqueting goods, which can take for ages to accumulate even with a village full of banqueting production facilities. Similar to Stronghold 1 I highly recommend you put a lot of effort in controlling game speed. As some missions every millisecond counts and you will need to not only destroy your entire village to meet the demands of the mission, but you must do it quickly and efficiently.\n\nSecondly the War Campaign, it’s not too bad. You play as Matthew Steele a page to Sir William, and your mission is to take down The Hammer, The Hawk, The Bull, and Olaf traitors to the king. In this campaign you are given the choice to turn against the king or side with him after the fourth mission. This choice you open up four missions for the path of good or the path of evil. This means if you want to beat the game completely you need to beat the fourth mission twice so you can choose both the good and evil path. Similar to the Peace Campaign each map has multiple villages which you can capture by sending units to the town flag. If you capture a village you can use it to help gather resources more efficiently. This is an interesting concept although still is lacking because you can capture a village, build it up, and lose in in a few seconds because the enemy has swooped in with an army. Switching the village to their side and allowing them all the work that you did, making the villages essentially giant wastes of time.\n\nPros:\n+Interesting war campaign\n+Military units are a lot quicker to build and can be built larger numbers\n+Ownership of multiple townships means you don't need to overpopulate your home village for resource needs\n+Better unit mapping allows for smoother movements\n+No maps require cheating unlike in the first one.\n\nCons:\n-Too many goods you need to produce (banqueting just seems excessive)\n-Most units require honor so if you don't have any you can't build an army\n-Graphics are considerably bad in comparison to the first one\n-The voice acting is just awful\n-This one has not been bumped to HD (1080p)\n-The peaceful campaign is just plain awful\n-Still no scenarios\n-Firefly got rid of The Rat, The Snake, The Pig, and The Wolf.\n\nStronghold Crusader & Stronghold Crusader Extreme:\nStronghold Crusader is most commonly referred to as the best Stronghold from the series. This game is based around crusades (obvious from the title) and involves playing in a whole new landscape with brilliant new features. Stronghold Crusader offers different types of castles Arabic or European and introduces a whole new Skirmish mode.\n\nSkirmish mode brings whole new life to the Stronghold series. No longer are you limited by the campaign system, instead you can play in matches against AI where you both build castles and try to take the other one down. The skirmish mode can be played with up to eight players (I believe) on various sized maps. There are sixteen different characters each with varying tactics and difficulty curves. Our fabled original villains The Rat, The Snake, The Pig, and The Wolf return in this triumphant sequel. The other characters include: The Marshall, The Abbot, King Phillip, The Lionheart, Emperor Frederick, The Sultan, The Caliph, The Nizar, The Wazir, The Emir, and Saladin.\n\nPros:\n+Skirmish mode\n+16 Different characters with varying tactics and difficulties to play against.\n+Middle Eastern environments and limitations (farms can only be built on oasis)\n+Newly introduced mercenary camp\n+Traditional campaign offers a fun story with practice for the skirmish mode\n+Multiplayer mode\n+HD (1080p) resolution\n\nCons:\n-Mercenary units can defeat the point of actually building units (the archers from mercenary barracks are just as good as the archers you build – based on the cost and amount of effort required to get them).\n-The maps can be rather small and thus not offer much room to really expand a kingdom.\n\nStronghold Legends:\nWell I haven’t beat or even played Stronghold Legends. This game is next on my list, so I will update this review with information regarding this game after I beat it.","January 31, 2015","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

[C-]\nstronghold crusader: [A]THIS is the best stronghold game ever (waiting for stronghold crusader 2) because its balanced, bots are either medium or hard but they absolutely do not cheat! the campaign is very short but there are challenges as replacements which dont include a story but its funny to play these maps, also they are extremely useful to learn new strategies!\nstronghold crusader extreme: [B-]i dont really like the idea of mass-spawning outposts which completely disable any other gameplay by flooding your castle with units but i will play the challenges for practice^^[\nstronghold legends: this game is like...ehhhh seriously??? really, the balance is the worst ♥♥♥♥ i have ever seen: you can play as the good guys who are limited to the classic units but are able to recruit heroes who are pretty weak but have some skills, if you are evil you can get a bunch of exploding bats to knock down the lord of your enemy, but the real ♥♥♥♥ about this are the ice-themed guys: just get some giants and crush you enemies into little pieces, then use your overpowered ice dragon to freeze them, then you can use your bears to beat the crap out of the little pieces left by the giants.
