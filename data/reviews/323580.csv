Here's what I didn't like:\n\n- Plodding pace of exploration. Even running from area to area from the hub is a bit of a chore. Sometimes this lets you take in the sights that the game wants you to see, as the developers bring back the camera and reveal something spectacular in the distance. Moving slowly gives you time to appreciate what you're seeing. Most times however, the very basic of moving your character just isn't any fun.\n\n- Combat isn't much to shout about. With only a couple of moves and an emphasis on your character's position rather than any skill in attacking, fighting enemies just isn't very fun.\n\n- Bosses are a tad underwhelming. Okay, they were probably the the best parts of the game, but I think they could have been even better. Stop zooming all the way out when we're fighting the jotun - it doesn't make their scale more imposing, or awe us with their size. It just makes it harder to see. I don't get the sense that I'm fighting a titan when I'm controlling something absolutely tiny on-screen. I would love to have seen more reactive enemies as well. Fighting jotun felt more like they were just doing their thing. I could go off into a corner and they'd just run through their attack cycles.\n\n- You don't have to give players problems in every stage. The constellation stage - I was wowed as I began, because I was doing something novel and unique, even beautiful. Then the developers had to make it difficult for the player somehow, with electricity travelling on the ground and lighting bolts coming out of seemingly nowhere to take away huge chunks of health, while still lighting up pylons in the shapes of constellations. What was serene and beautiful before became a complete chore and what I feel is emblematic of the game's failings. Another less egregious example is the ice level with the high points where you survey the entire stage. Why put in the blizzard that comes in intermittently and forces me to hide? It doesn't add anything interesting mechanically or thematically - all it does is make it an absolute chore to finish the stage. Don't manufacture problems for the player to face, and don't feel like you have to shoehorn something to make every stage difficult. You had something special with the constellation stage, but I think you blew it.\n\nI enjoyed everything else - the Icelandic voiceover, the Norse mythology, the beautiful animation and backgrounds; they all give Jotun a mood and feel that is really unique.\n\nI don't usually review games here but this was so, so close to being something special.","October 5, 2015","false","2.9"," 590 of 742 people (80%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","80","590","742","28","14"

Before we get into the juicy details, let’s start out with the art design and the soundtrack, which are generally highly praised – and justifiably so. Especially the art of the game looks absolutely gorgeous and may remind some of “Banner Saga”, as well as adding to the immersion through smart camera movements, more often than not to show the detailed backgrounds or to help the player find their way through crowded combat situations.\nThe Soundtrack, while being above average is nothing I’d highly praise. The voice acting on the other hand is quite good, even though the game is quite sparse with any kind of dialogue, which results in the player only getting to hear it during single-sentence remarks of the player character, Thora.\n\nNow the story is very straight-forward, you’re playing as Thora, a Norse woman who recently died at sea and is given a second chance to prove herself by defeating the Jotun, elementals who roam the different level you get to “explore”. Exploration now is not something Jotun sets a focus on, as each of the different levels (2 per Jotun) is very straight forward, while each of them introduces a “gimmick” such as poison gas, or puzzles to complete.\n\nMy personal favorite among those gimmicks is an ice-storm which simply forces you to stop each time it appears, so that you not freeze to death. That being said, practically each of those gimmicks is not much more than a simple annoyance for the player and even the “puzzles” don’t exceed the difficulty level of playing the first level of Tetris. Added to the linearity of the level design, each of those required 2 stages before each boss becomes much more a chore rather than anything else. The only improving factor being the drawn backgrounds and the rare remarks of Thora, trying to introduce the player to a bit of Norse mythology.\nWhich, of course, laughably fails, if the only thing you do to create a bit of immersion is to let Thora say “The raven (unpronounceable name). Between its eyes sits the eagle (unpronounceable name).” – while it may look cool, and probably has a nice reason to be there, at that location you may generally find interesting to learn more about, the player is just left there, getting a name and the smallest bits of history thrown at him.\nThe best example of this may be in the fifth stage, a swamp in which you recreate the Norse creation myth. Great in theory, until you realize that you have to travel for 2-4 minutes between each of the five spots you have to activate, each of them tells you a couple of sentences about that myth and in the end you realize that you’ve basically learned nothing from it, since you forgot half of it by the time you’re finished.\n\nSo the story, while intriguing at first, fails to convey anything of what it presents in its level design. Thora’s story also doesn’t evolve into anything other than what it was in the beginning: She drowned and now fights for the right to enter Valhalla.\n\nAnother thing I absolutely need to mention before going on is, that there are basically no enemies in the different levels, with only very few examples, such as giants who do nothing else than throw a single rock at you every few seconds, or dwarves that run from you on sight, until you reach a certain point, where they all engage you. What that means is: Nearly all of the levels you need to complete are effectively empty, with the exception of the aforementioned environmental hazards.\n\nSo: In essence Jotun is just a glorified Boss rush. Are the bosses any good?\nTo answer that, we first have to talk a bit more about the combat.\n\nSo what did I previously mean by “simplistic”? Well – you are quite limited in your combat options, having only a rather fast (and absolutely useless) attack and a slower one, which requires you to stand still for several seconds. Additionally you can discover different shrines throughout the different areas you can explore, which reward you with abilities such as Healing, Blocking and so forth, which are all quite useful.\n\nA giant flaw in the combat system is the fact, that the Hitboxes of each enemy, as well as your own axe is very wonky and is the most important reason for the acclaimed “high” difficulty of this game. Example: One of the bosses you encounter is a fiery-giant. With one of his attacks, he swings a giant sword at you, bending forward in the process.\nNow: He is arched over, yet still is upper body is way over your own player character and as a rule of thumb you may have learned from the previous bosses: You only focus on the legs of any of those giants. Yet you can still hit him. The same principle applies later to the last boss as well, who throws lightning spears at you, which circle around in the area, while still loosely tracking your position.\nAfter fighting that boss around 6 times, I still have not a specific clue how the hitboxes on those work. Generally you do not have invincibility frames, yet if you role at a specific time, only the dead-center of those spears seem to hit, while at other time even the particle effects around it cause you to take damage.\nWhat I blame here are the clunky animations. While they may look fine, gameplay doesn’t seem as fluent as you’d need it to be for a game which heavily relies on quick reflexes, especially when using your Shrine-abilities.\n\nThe Jotun themselves are nothing to write home about either. I personally consider myself average of skill and it took me around 1-2 tries to complete each of the Jotun. Each of them basically only has 1-2 attacks to begin with and as such none of them is particularly interesting and really only impressive on the first look, thanks to the beautifully drawn graphics.\n\nThe last boss however was the most disappointing one – only having the ability to throw either one, or.. and now pay attention! – three spears at you. Great. At around fifty percent each of the bosses has a second phase, which basically is the same as the first one. Here however, the last boss just summons copies of each of the previous bosses with a singular attack. Adding to the wonky hitboxes and that you suddenly have to watch out for 2-6 different enemies makes the last boss an absolute chore, or much rather, has you praying, that you simply do not get hit.\n\n\n\nTL;DR:\n\n+ Graphics/Soundtrack (mainly voice-overs)\n+ Smart camera movement\n+ Option to return to the Hub-Area anytime you want, without having to backtrack\n\n- Story might as well be nonexistent\n- Linear, empty and all around tedious level design\n- Level-“Gimmicks” are mainly an annoyance (e.g. Ice Storm forcing the player to stop every few steps in an otherwise       completely empty level)\n- Very bad presentation\n- High difficulty is mainly artificial (horrible hitboxes, overscaled damage and more..)\n- Way too short (Completed it myself in around 2 hours, with most things discovered)\n- No replay value\n- The price\n\n\n\n\nAfter finishing the game in just over two hours, I can confidently say, that Jotun simply isn’t worth 14,99 Euros, or your regional equivalent. It’s an overpriced Boss-rush which suffers greatly due to its presentation and flaws in its combat system, most noticeably the hitboxes. My plea to you: Do not be tempted to buy Jotun just because of its pretty visuals or because you’re interested in the subject of Norse mythology.","March 27","false","2.7"," 84 of 98 people (86%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","86","84","98","5","6"

The art is all hand drawn and is complemented extremely well with the music and narration.\n\nStrangely the game is more focussed on exploration and discovery than combat, and you rarely have to fight lots of enemies, except for during boss fight. Boss fights which are grand and large, along with being very difficult.\n\nThe Giants do not go down easily, and their mechanics get more complex as you continue your adventure. The same can be said for the puzzles during exploration. This is where you'll spend the majority of your time. Exploring the new lands, and searching for the Seals to unlock the chambers for the giants. During this you can find golden apples that increase your health, and shrines to the gods. Here you'll be granted a special ability, and finding similar shrines means you get an extra charge of said power.\n\nAlong with these are the ones dedicated to Mimir, which will replenish your health and powers. Don't waste these willinilly, as they can only be used once.\n\nCombat is the main problem for me. Despite your character being a seasoned warrior and leader of her village; she's very slow and cumbersome. Especially with her broadaxe. Basic swings do little damage and you mainly need to use your heavy attack to damage a giant. This however is the slow part, she lifts the axe and then you have to wait a bit for it to glint, then you can strike.\nThis pause slows the combat flow, and is usually the time when you'll get hit, swatted, smashed, or the giant simply mouse out of your attack area. It can be rather frustrating at times.\n\nEven so the battles are very exciting as you know a simple mistake means you die. You're just a little mortal trying to prove your worth and impress the gods after all. The powers of the giants range quite a bit, from spawning thorny tendrils, to creating dwarves straight from the earth.\n\nFor some the game might seem rather short, there aren't many giants. Although I think the meat of the game is the beautiful world, exploration and puzzles with the giant battles thrown in for fun.\n\nI've certainly been enjoying it, and I'm sure many others will as well.\n\nPC Gameplay\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bFlJY_5_bo","September 29, 2015","true","4.3"," 90 of 113 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","90","113","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spiritreviews/recommended/323580/","spiritreviews","Spirit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spiritreviews/","732 products in account","Full disclosure: review copy provided by publisher/developer!\n\nIn the beginning there was just VOID, which was incredibly blasé farie. Flanking the VOID was a fire realm and ice realm. It was inevitable then that ice and fire would have a fated meeting, star crossed lovers that they are. Sprung forth from their, ahem, unprotected meeting was Ymir, a frost giant and generally unlikable dude.\n\nThen there was a cow and some heavy licking that resulted in more gods and giants and that all lead to a very crowded VOID.\n\nThings went downhill quickly from here and, following some heated disagreements, Odin and his brothers created the known world from Ymir's corpse. Much bonding was done among the survivors. The last of the frost giant, finding the whole situation rather distasteful, escaped on a raft (presumably made from Ymir's all-purpose building corpse).\n\nIt was a rough Monday to say the least.\n\nBut this is all good, because without all this intergenerational conflict we wouldn't have Jotun today!\n\nJotun is an action/adventure indie title... I know, I know – there are a LOT of those. This one, however, is special. Diligently, lovingly hand drawn to Disney animation pedigree, narrated entirely in enchanting Icelandic, and sporting (for this reviewer's money) the most striking, stirring, and impressive game soundtrack of 2015, Jotun is a GOTY contender and should belong in any sensible gamer's library. Does it have issues? Sure, a trivial few. But not enough to dissuade me from enjoying the ever-loving ♥♥♥♥ out of this game.\n\nYou play as Thora (George Foreman Naming Syndrome?), shieldmaiden and generally badass viking lady who's been cruelly denied a seat in the beer n' blood splattered halls of Valhalla. After taking umbrage and calling Norse Afterlife Support she's given a second chance in Norse purgatory: Gingaggagap...\n\nGinnungapgap...\n\nThe Gap, let's just call it the Gap. Thora is trapped at the Gap presumably until Ragnarok – unless she is able to defeat the Jotun, a race of elemental giants that have literally nothing better to do.\n\nAnd that's the crux of the game! Beat five elemental giants, get plucked up by the Valkyries and taken to Valhalla to watch Game of Thrones for the rest of eternity (really need to brush up on my Norse mythology).\n\nEasier said than done.\n\nEach Jotun encounter is broken up by two levels... you have to find their two respective runes, learn some godly powers you can call upon Kratos-style, and improve your overall health while exploring the strange and fantastical settings of Norse mythology. Each level is a little different – some have basic combat, some are puzzle focused – all require exploration. All you need to progress is the two runes but I'd recommend finding those aforementioned god powers and health ups... you'll need them.\n\nAfter you've gotten your viking chores and ♥♥♥♥ squared away you're off to face a Jotun – arguably the highlight of the game; like if Disney's Hercules animation made a shame baby with Shadow of the Colossus/Dark Souls boss gameplay. Thora is a small fry compared to the Jotun and will have to use her god powers, wit, and axe to defeat them all. And it isn't easy, let me tell you. I died at least two, three times to each and every boss in the game (the last two I just kind of lost count after all the screaming and crying and vomiting and passing out). You have to learn their movesets, their weaknesses, and their favorite colors defeat them! When you finally bring one down it's exhilarating, the same feeling I experienced figuring out a Souls' boss coupled with the sadness of bringing down a Colossus. It's epic and my written words just won't do the event justice.\n\n“But Spirit, didn't you mention that the game had issues – a trivial few?”\n\nDon't – don't take me to task in my own ♥♥♥♥ing review. Jesus.\n\nBut yes, there are a few annoyances. As awesomely epic as the boss fights are, the sheer size of the Jotun can cause issues – of the hitbox variety. Sometimes you'll clearly strike the enemy and miss for whatever reason, and sometimes (worse-still) you'll get clobbered when you were clearly out of the way (two boss fights in particular are guilty of this). I also found myself getting lost a dozen times during big fights. If you end up behind a Jotun you can see your silhouette but... sometimes there's just so much action on screen it's hard to keep up with everything happening.\n\nJotun is also a little... formulaic. Explore two levels, defeat Jotun, rinse and repeat. Each level is captivating visually and usually does its own thaaaang, but... that's going to be an issue for some people. The story is okay, doesn't really break the mold. It's very similar to this year's other awesome indie mythology action/adventure, Apotheon. That isn't necessarily a bad point, and I still enjoyed Thora's story, just don't come into this expecting Lou Ferigno's Hercules (I'm here to write reviews and punch bears to the moon... and I'm all out of reviews).\n\nBut in spite of all that, Jotun is one of my favorite games of 2015 – definitely top FIVE. It's beautiful, it's epic, it's a tour de force for developers Thunder Lotus Games – one that has surely impressed those captious, cantankerous gods.\n\nI don't usually find myself grinning ear-to-ear after beating a game but... I did for Jotun.\n\nHere's hoping it impresses gamers.\n\nDid you know Odin rides a flying, eight-legged horse? Can't make this ♥♥♥♥ up.","September 29, 2015","true","9.6"," 201 of 293 people (69%) found this review helpful 88 people found this review funny","69","201","293","88","28"

I looked at the art style and it really caught my eye so I took the plunge.\n\n\nThe best way I can describe this game is that of a storypiece. The gameplay is fine, but the thing that carries this game is the amazing visuals, voice acting, and theme that create a cohesive piece of art. It's definitely still got some gameplay elements that people would like, such as combat, skill use, resource management, and exploration...but people who go into the game thinking it focuses on these elements are going to be sorely disappointed.\n\nYeah, it has some puzzles, some combat, and some resource management and exploration, but not enough to satisfy people who are looking solely for GREAT puzzles, GREAT combat, GREAT choices, GREAT exploration. It has a little of everything, but what it does excel in is the storytelling and visuals.\n\nThe art is absolutely gorgeous and some of the Boss fights are just breathtaking. It also has some of the best camera angle controls I've seen in a game. The camera is often used to make your character seem just as insignificant as you really are in the realm of Gods, zooming out to give you a sense of scale of the scenery and Gods you will be seeing.\n\nHonestly, it's going to disappoint people looking for difficult gameplay or solid controls, but I will say that there are maybe 2 bosses that felt very challenging. (One of them perfectly encapsulates this game and I wish other boss fights would be as cool as he was)\n\nAnyway, if you feel like playing a couple of hours (I spent 5 completing it at a normal pace, some exploration and sometimes just rushing through a zone) of a single player game that focuses on the experience of making you feel like an underdog, with a beautiful art style, I recommend picking this up.\n\nIf money is tight and you're looking for replayability and things to do besides the main game storyline, I'd say look elsewhere.","May 10","true","5.0"," 32 of 33 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","32","33","0","0"

Mixing action and exploration elements in a sleek and enjoyable fashion. One second your fighting a massive earth god and the next your floating serenely through a gorgeous star filled sky, solving constellation puzzles. It's this balance of beauty and chaos that makes Jotun such a fun, unforgettable experience. The only gripe I could possibly have for Jotun is that I wanted more. The games nine levels while incredibly well designed, make the game feel rather short just coming in at about 7-8 hours at the most. This is a rather small gripe, as the entire game is a very enjoyable experience from beginning to end. The story and theme of the game is handled very well and makes you feel steeped in Norse mythology.  Other areas like controls are tight, god powers give the game more strategies and make gameplay dynamic. Jotun is a prime example of what indie games can be, and should be.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DarkSoad/recommended/323580/","DarkSoad","DarkSoad [Curator]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DarkSoad/","383 products in account","Jotun: the story of Thora\nJotun is an action/exploration game, set in a world embraced by Norse mythology. Thora, the main character, has died in an inglorious death and wants to prove herself to the Gods, in order to enter Valhalla. The question is... how is she going to achieve that?\n\nWe start the game with only our axe and will, learning the basic controls such as light attack, heavy attack and dodge. Yes, that's it. There aren't different weapons or combinations. Each button does the same action over and over again. But it nevers feels bad thanks to the incredible design and the abilities we'll gain throughout the game, but we'll get into that later.\n\nThe first thing that gets our atention, is the amazing art style. Everything from design to animation was hand-drawed, and it gives the game an unique look, that reminded me a bit to The Banner Saga. The landscapes are beautiful, Thora itself has a lot of detail on her clothes and all the scenarios we go trough in the game are different from each other.\n\nThe Story\nThora, in order to gain her entry to Valhalla, needs to defeat five Jotuns, which are basically giants, each one representing something. They have their own region and set of levels, having to complete two or three areas before being able to fight them. We gain access from The Void, a purgatory-kind of place. It works as a hub and it's the place where we'll appear if we fall in battle.\n\nThe game has a strong orientation on exploring and solving small puzzles. We don't find ourselves fighting a lot but instead travelling around the map, finding hidden shrines and altars of Gods that will aid us in battle. These powers have a limited use, and they go from creating a clone to make a distraction to shooting a flying arrow, among others.\nThese abilities are crucial if we want to survive, and each boss will require us to strategically think every attack.\n\nThe Mighty Giants\nThe Jotuns are one of the most important and attractive aspects of the game. These fierce opponents will give us a hard time, while we learn their unique mecanics and behavior. They are really big and powerful beings, and they make us feel vulnerable when we are in battle. That's one of the highlights of the game, each battle will take us a few reloads until we learn their patterns.\n\nThe combat is hard, since we are very limited in matters of our attacks and the damage we cause to them. The fights are long and the Giants have different phases, increasing their speed, strength and even the enviroment, like creating a frost storm that gets worse with time until we can barely see where we are.\n\nThe Jotuns will drop a Rune when they get defeated, taking us back to The Void in order to follow up with another Giant. Also, Thora will tell us a little about her past each time we go back from a fight, taking the narrative in a first person way as she keeps going further and further to achieve her objective.\n\nThe Stunning Visuals, Atmosphere and Music\nThe hand-drawn animations are outstanding. Each Jotun has it's own set of movements, style and expressions, and they are all incredible. The regions merge perfectly with the Giants, showing us molten lava in the Blacksmith's area, dangerous roots and poisonous plants, and so on. The gods are handcrafted perfectly and the visual style feels really unique trough the entire game. All and each one of the levels have different details than the others, and that's something worth praising.\n\nThe Norse mythology is perfect and I'm glad that they chose this setting for the game. They have done an amazing work recreating each God, but also in the narrative and story of Thora. She always has something to say when we activate a shrine, enter a new area or find a hidden place. These little details are great in helping us knowing more about the Lore itself and Thora's past.\n\nThe music is the final touch, is that thing that helps to create this unique atmosphere. The battles have their own songs, and they will start changing once we start dealing enough damage to the Giants. This creates tension and injects us with adrenaline, making each encounter different from the previous one.\n\nYou have impressed the Gods: Final Verdict\nJotun is not a common game, but a journey. It leaves the combat aside to lead us into exploring the regions and getting in touch with the lore and mythology of each place. The boss fights are hard and we are going to feel weak and vulnerable, but that's the whole idea. Thora has to impress the gods, she needs to prove that she's worthy of entering Valhalla.\n\nThe only downside about the game is it's length, it took me 6 hours to complete it, but I still have lots of shrines and hidden items that I haven't find in the first run. Should it be longer? Not at all, it's an amazing experience with the right length. And there are also time trails for those who are achievement enthusiasts, having to beat an enemy without getting damage or in a limited amount of time.\n\nI recommend this game to everyone that enjoyed The Banner Saga and Bastion and couldn't find something similar. For those entirely new to these games, Jotun is not an RPG and it focus more on exploration rather than fighting different enemies. But rest asure, each boss fight is an unique experience that will make us love the game even more.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","March 11","true","6.9"," 31 of 33 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","31","33","0","7"

Even though I am not completely finished with this, I know that I would be able to recommend this game to anyone who enjoys AMAZING story, and simple yet rewarding gameplay! 10/10","December 10, 2015","true","3.7"," 26 of 31 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","26","31","2","0"

From the outside, Jotun looks like an adventure/exploration game with little combat during levels and tricky epic boss fights. While this is true; for me, the meat of this game comes in boss mastery and completely centered around combat.\n\nJotun starts with Thora (the hero) dying without a chance to enter Valhalla due to an inglorious death. Odin, the Allfather grants you a chance to enter Valhalla through great deeds by collecting runes and defeating the Jotun (giant elemental beings tied to Norse mythology). To battle a Jotun, you must complete two levels through exploration and some puzzle solving (unfortunately little combat). These levels are associated with the elements of the corresponding Jotun and vary in terms of what is needed to complete them. Each level will have a rune, an apple (increases max health) a Godshrine (gives you a God Power or additional uses of said God Power) and a few vistas or other points of interest where the camera zooms out giving some beautiful shots. Once the runes have been found, it is time to face the Jotun.\n\nThese Jotun bosses are giant elemental beings that will test your resolve, quickness and combat strategy. Fighting these beasts for the first time can feel like an impossible task and defeating them feels like a massive accomplishment. In fact, when beating these bosses for the first time you wonder how any of the achievements for them are even possible. This is where this game goes from good to great!! Each Jotun has 5 achievements associated with them. 1-Initial defeat, 2-Shun the Gods (use no God Powers), 3-Perfect (take no damage), 4-Time trial, 5-Special conditions (ie. don't attack in melee, defeat at under 10% health etc.) Learning all the bosses patterns/quirks and figuring out strategies to complete these tasks can be daunting, but because of reliable combat mechanics and tight controls is very rewarding. Combat is simple with a regular attack that can be used twice for a slightly faster combo, or heavy attack which is a painfully slow wind-up followed by a massive blow. Throw in a dodge-roll and six God Powers (speed-up, heal, shield etc.) and that's it. What makes the combat so great is that you know exaclty what you can get (and are going to get) out of your character. Learning how to use this to maximum advantage is all you have, and what makes this game SO DAMN FUN!!\n\nTo sum up, if you're looking for a good action/adventure with outstanding visuals, good music/atmosphere and decent combat... you'll probably find it here. If you're looking for the above with testing combat achievements and you enjoy boss-mastery type games you might just fall in love with this gem like I have.\n\nJotun - You have impressed the Gods!!","January 24","true","20.9"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","18","18","0","5"

Battling through the depths of purgatory in order to impress the gods and gain access to Valhalla.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSS8trp9XSA\nWaking lost in a forest dazed and confused, direction guided by your subconscious which is spoken through subtitled Icelandic dialog. From the outset it's a strange beautiful world, all handrawn and animated akin to a disney film or some of the better anime series. Revolving around Norse Mythology, if not at all familiar the game does a good job of explaining each reference.\n\nNine levels are spread across 5 different regions which all varied wildly, depicting different aspects of the culture and culminating with fighting a Jotun. Without giving too much away, will be climbing giant trees, forging star constellations and all sorts of other strangeness.  Focus is around the boss fights though was plenty to do between. Each region containing 2 areas with light puzzle elements and environmental challenges. Main tasks were finding runes for further progression, god shrines that grant powers to Thora and optional hidden Ithunns Apples which increased your healthbar length.\n\nScreen resolutions of 4k+ were available. Keyboard had full remapping support and both kb+mouse and gamepad were responsive. Perhaps the biggest flaw to some will be the walking speed. Ultimately Jotun is more about the journey then the destination. Still one worth taking that I've thoroughly enjoyed.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aGoodServant/recommended/323580/","aGoodServant","보르케","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aGoodServant/","737 products in account","Stats at the Time of Reviewing\nHours on record: 12,0\nAchievement progress: 33/33 (100 %)\nSummary\nJotun is an action/exploration game with a soul; it doesn’t quite feel like other games of its genre. It is artistically beautiful, from the atmospheric, high-quality sound effects, which are sometimes used as handy audio queues for enemy attacks, to the appropriate Icelandic voice-overs and the gorgeous hand-drawn graphics style. The boss battles (essentially the only real battles) are solid and fun to replay, which is good, because most of the game is basically a walking simulator, so you will get most of your hours from replaying boss battles for various (kind of) challenging achievements. If you are into replaying content in order to perfect it and get all of the achievements, I recommend that you buy this right now; if not, you might wish to read on.\n\nThe Bad\nJotun is a good game, but it is a bad exploration game. When you first play the game, there is running, a lot of running, everywhere – from the hub area to each of the main areas, and even in some of the boss areas. The art style, voice-overs and sound effects will initially make each area feel great, but you will soon come to realise that you are not really doing anything aside from running, solving very basic puzzles and collecting 2 collectibles per area; a god shrine and an apple. This part of the game, though good-looking, is really tedious; after an hour of running around, looking, it feels like you have been going on for 3, which, for me, led to multiple breaks, while initially playing through the game, due to boredom.\n\nThe Good\nJotun’s boss battles are very well done and worth replaying. The combat is not overly fast or complicated, but instead depends on you learning how to effectively deal with each of the bosses’ moves. Learning to manage the god powers effectively to kill the bosses quickly and/or without taking damage was a fun challenge (though not challenging on the level of bullet hells), and the achievements that made you play with limited abilities or changed rules were also a nice, fun change of pace. The art style, voice-overs and sound effects all greatly enhance the experience and make it feel unique.\n\nThe Verdict\nI cannot recommend Jotun fully to everyone; if you are the type to play a game once and then put it down, the slow, mostly pointless run through the larger areas will be the majority of your game time, provided you don’t die to the bosses a huge amount of times. If you like replaying boss fights to master them and get achievements, though, you can get a lot of solid action gameplay out of Jotun and that, combined with the artistic elements that make the game feel unique, is what left me with an overall positive view of the game, and what made me go for 100 %.\n\nFrom me, Jotun gets a solid recommendation for people who like mastering a smaller amount of content, like I, and a recommendation against buying it for people looking for a larger amount of unique, varying content with meaningful exploration. As I, personally, was a fan, the recommendation for buying it is what will represent this review.\n","March 21","true","12.0"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","18","19","0","0"

The art style really struck a chord with me, and I am a sucker for norse mythology. I still listen to the soundtrack, and absolutely loved the Icelandic voice-overs. If this had been a cartoon, I would have stuck with it for an entire season with no reservations.\n\nAs a game, Jotun just does not deliver much in the way of fun. The trailer on Steam is highly deceptive, making it appear as though you will be involved in tense boss battles by using lots of quick edits. The reality is that enemies are few and far between, and the majority of the game is a walking simulator. A very slow walking simulator.\n\nThe slow pace is reflected in the combat as well. Thora only has two attacks with her axe, a standard swing, and a slower, heavier swing. Pretty common in many games, but how it changes is just how absolutely slow Thora swings when using the heavy attack. It takes about eight seconds. Eight seconds of standing still, vulnerable, with your hands over your head like an idiot. It is nearly unusable in combat, and only useful to clear obstacles out of your path. This leaves us with only the basic axe swing for the majority of combats. The hit boxes feel a bit suspect at times as well. There were several moments where the animation went through an enemy only to not have it register any damage.\n\nThe camera is also a pain. It will zoom in uncomfortably close at times, and other times will zoom out to show a beautiful landscape and leave you a tiny dot on the map, making it somewhat difficult to get around corners or not get stuck on scenery. The camera moves at a slower pace than the character, leading to times where Thora was very nearly walking off the edge of the screen. Having to stop and stand still while the camera meanders into place just so I can prevent from walking into a lightning trap just slows down an already glacial game.\n\nI really wish the developers had made up their mind on whether they wanted to create a puzzle/exploration game or an action game. Had they taken combat out entirely and left the axe only for puzzle solving, I feel it would have been a tighter game and invested the player more into the world. Had they sped up the combat, movement, and camera the game would be quicker, but also more grounded with the idea of Thora as a seasoned warrior. As it is now, Jotun feels like a walking sim with poor controls and frustratingly simple, yet ineffective, combat.","March 28","false","1.2"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","18","20","0","0"

I didn't really care for it. The best parts are shown in the screenshots.\nThe "tutorial" zone, meaning first boss and everything before it. I feel like the game went downhill from there.\nThe last boss, which is the only one that I can say I really enjoyed.\nBad parts:\nPacing. This is where the game failed hard for me. If the pacing wasn't so bad, rest of these negative things wouldn't really matter. To get to a boss, you need to run through two exploration zones. These two zones are mostly really, really boring - just follow the map and keep running. In some zones there's a few enemies or something to avoid, but mostly it's just "exploring".\n"Exploring" didn't feel like exploring. All the exploration zones have maps and are pretty straightforward. Going to a new zone went like: "This theme looks pretty" "I need to run there" ... 5 minutes later ... "how long do I still need to run forward?"\nThe exploration zones don't even have any real music, just some ambient.\nSince the level art seems to be a big part of this game, it's weird that the camera is really close most of the time. The combination of the background art's style and the camera distance makes it feel like you're trying to look at a big painting through a magnifier, with no way to look at the full image.\nThe few puzzles/gimmicks in the zones were often repeated too many times. The best example is a zone where you attack lightning pylons to "draw" a constellation, which is shown next to it. It was nice the first two times. Not so much after doing it 8 times in a row with bigger and bigger images.\nNo checkpoints in the exploration zones. Imagine that you run 5-10 minutes through a zone, then you die (possibly get bombarded with something that you couldn't really expect). Have fun running through the boring part again. Good thing is that there isn't many things that can kill you.\nBoss design was average at best. Stay away and look at how they project which attack, avoid them, slap them in the face. At half health they enrage and get new abilities. Stay away while learning those, go slap them. All the bosses felt like you're just repeating the same rotation over and over for a long time. Most bosses don't even care if you're there or not, as they do not seem to react in what you do or where you stand (most of the time). They just keep doing their thing while you do your thing and the one who still has HP in the end, wins.\nSome of the boss models were unclear about when and where they can be attacked. Imagine a dude who floats above the ground and you can sometimes hit his toe and sometimes not, even though both positions seem like they should be in your reach. Of course these can and will be learned with trial & error, but eh.\nTL;DR: If you like the art, check screenshots from here and around the intertubes. There's not much else going on in here.","October 11, 2015","false","4.0"," 34 of 49 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","34","49","0","1"

It’s a top-down action exploration game that pits you against large foes and beautiful, yet treacherous landscapes. Jotun delivers challenging boss battles, but it also focuses heavily on building atmosphere and anticipation rather than throwing countless of enemies at the player. The considerable amount of downtime before these fights might put off some gamers, but if you’re able to absorb yourself in the world through its beautiful hand drawn visuals, powerful soundtrack, and epically cool voice-overs, you will also find the boss battle well worth the buildup. It might also make you want to read up on your Norse mythology knowledge.\n\nFrom the roots of Yggdrasil to The Northern Sky:\n\nJotun tries to pack as much Norse mythology in every area of the game as it possibly can, but a few creative liberties are taken. Both gameplay and presentation might draw your mind to games such as “Journey” and “Shadow of the colossus” as you explore vast environments with gorgeous vistas and face larger than life boss battles.\n\nPlaying as Thora, a young Viking warrior, named after the god of thunder Thor himself, you are tasked with defeating 5 mighty Jotun to earn your place in Valhalla after dying an inglorious death. Thora must travel through five regions and find two runes in each and every one to summon these giants, all possessing a certain elemental property. There are few enemy encounters in these levels but they all present unique stage hazards that keeps you on your toes and prevents the overall experience outside of the boss battles from feeling repetitive.\n\nEach region has two levels and presents its own feel but they aren’t all executed as well. The winter region Niflheim (yes, they are all tongue twisters) has one level with quite a boring and unimaginative layout and the other one has an annoying stage hazard that forces you to stand behind walls quite frequently to avoid deadly storms. The fire region also had a spot where I accidentally killed an enemy that I needed to take advantage of in order to progress, and it didn’t re-spawn, forcing me to restart the level. A very minor design flaw perhaps, but it needed to be mentioned. The Jotun of the storm region, even with its badass design, wasn’t as dynamic and fun to fight as the rest.\n\nIt might be a tad bit inconsistent, but besides the aforementioned weak points, it is truly enjoyable exploring every region and level to find health upgrades and gifts of power from the different gods, which you will sorely need. It doesn’t hurt that the soundtrack is beautifully put together and the Icelandic voice-over help set the desired tone.\n\nImpress the gods:\n\nThe introductory level in Jotun teaches you everything you need to know about the controls without it feeling like a tutorial. At the end of said level, a tutorial boss is introduced to make sure that you’ve got the basic controls down before facing off with the first Jotun of the game. There are no advanced button combinations needed to become the conqueror of the Jotun, but it is far from an easy task. You have your standard light attack, heavy attack, dodge button, and one button to execute your god powers that will give you different ability boosts that lasts only a couple seconds. Thora’s heavy attack takes a few seconds to execute and her dodge roll has some end lag to it, so timing these correctly can be the difference between success, and sometimes instant death.\n\nIt’s a game that gives you a satisfying challenge with dynamic and responsive gameplay, instead of just having complicated controls and it all culminates in a moment where you must prove that you’ve mastered the timing of dodging and attacking, not only to the gods, but to yourself as well.\n\nSummary:\n\nAll in all, this is a great debut from Thunder Lotus Games but I can’t help but feeling that it had the potential of being so much more. Even for an indie game I’ve come to expect a bit more content, and the few traces of puzzle exploration felt lacking. The lack of enemy encounters and meaningful tasks to keep you engaged gameplay wise might also hamper a second play through, as I loved taking my time exploring every nook and cranny and savor this living painting of a world, but the second time around, I found myself rushing through most levels just so I could get to the main attraction. Your level of enjoyment might come down to how much you’ll be able to immerse yourself in the game and appreciate the awe inspiring scenery.\n\nUltimately though, The pros far outweigh the cons, and thematically speaking, I found Jotun to be a breath of fresh air, and I wouldn’t mind revisiting similar scenarios in gaming in the future. Dynamic battles along with a powerful score and occasionally breathtaking artwork all come together to create an ultimately satisfying experience. It might leave you wanting more, but still happy with what you got.\n\n8/10","September 30, 2015","true","8.0"," 20 of 26 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","20","26","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ashesforpresident/recommended/323580/","ashesforpresident","Ashes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ashesforpresident/","396 products in account","Detailed Review by Ashes\n\nSummaryYou are Thora, a viking warrior who died an inglorious death and was sent to Helheim (Norse Purgatory). To be granted passage into Valhalla and prove yourself to the Norse gods you must slay several powerful entities known as Jotun.\n\nJotun is an amazingly well-animated, beautiful, isometric action-exploration game set in Norse mythology, made and published by Thunder Lotus Games.\n\nLevel DesignLevel design is really well done and non-linear. The game utilizes a hub-like system which you'll see for the first time after you beat the first main boss. Once you arrive at The Void (That's the name of the hub) you are free to choose where to go next, before fighting a boss you have to unlock him by exploring and/or fighting your way through usually two areas and acquiring two pieces of a rune. If you take the time to explore you will find and unlock new abilities and upgrade your health. I found it quite easy to miss or overlook things in the levels because of their complex design. Besides letting you choose the order of what things you do first, the levels themselves are not linear. Instead they are open with lots to explore.\n\nEvery single area in the game is exceptionally unique, well thought out and offers its own challenges which take the form of completing platforming sections, fighting enemies, solving puzzles or traversing environmental obstacles. Jotun does a wonderful job of diversifying the experience and keeping it fresh through the game. Not only are all the levels different in terms of gameplay, but in terms of their themes as well.\n\n\nGameplayCombat and overall player mechanics are rather simple. You can dodge, do normal attacks, heavy attacks and use different abilities once you've unlocked them. Amazingly enough once you get to play this for yourself you'll see that the way the game is structured makes this rather simple combat system feel deep and satisfying. Instead of having a mana bar you are limited to use each of your skills twice, after that you'll need to replenish them at special fountains scattered throughout the game's areas and before boss fights. You can't use a fountain to heal yourself and restore your powers more than once without leaving the area and returning.\n\nSo far the bosses and enemies I have seen have been outstandingly remarkable. Every encounter in Jotun has forced me to develop new strategies and ways to prevail. Button mashing and brute force will not work in this game, instead you will have to learn how to adapt to different scenarios and situations. Your approach is bound to change every time you face something new.\n\nAnother thing reminiscent of the Souls series is the absolute lack of hand-holding which I personally adore, but some people might fight frustrating. You are told small bits of the most relavant and basic information and left to figure things out on your own.\n\nSound, Graphics and StoryThe soundtrack is another thing the devs have simply nailed. Every fight and level has its own theme which often compliments the graphical theme of the said level. The story is rather simplistic so far, but the more you play, the more you'll learn about Thora and her life.\n\nSound effects, voice-over, ambience, the soundtrack and the amazing graphics and art style of the game combine together to make your experience truly unforgettable. Animations are just astonishing and breathtaking as much as everything else in the game.\n\nTechnical DetailsJotun is very well optimized with little to no bugs so far and should run even on weaker and/or older machines. The character controls smoothly and keybinds are fully rebindable. The graphics options are lacking, but I doubt there is any need of a more diverse menu of options considering how well the game runs.\n\nConclusionSo far I've played for about 4 hours despite of Steam telling me I've played only 3. I've managed to explore three areas and defeat two bosses as well as just fool around in a couple of other areas just to check them out. Remember that to face each boss you must collect 2 rune fragments from 2 different areas excluding the first one where you just have one big area which means I still have plenty to do. I think this game will be around 6-8 hours long, but if you fail at beating the bosses a lot it could seriously prolong your experience.\n\nThe game is very challenging which might frustrate casual players or the faint of heart. It also takes a while to fully explore areas and gather everything from them. There is a total lack of hand holding as well which might prove difficult if you're used to more linear games like Call of Duty.\n\nAll in all if you've skipped the whole review all the way to this section I must say once more, I completely love the game and everything about it. The setting, gameplay, music, story, boss design and level design are all amazing and my only problem will be not having more of this when I finally finish the game.\n\nOne last thing I want to say before I finally finish this review. This whole game has an amazing amount of details everywhere, all the things I've mentioned previously and this make this one of the most immersive experiences you could ever get.\n\nPROS\nEvery level is unique in both theme and mechanics.\nLots to explore and find\nBosses are remarkable and very challenging.\nNo hand-holding.\nSoundtrack and art style are amazing.\nRuns perfectly smooth.\nProgression is not linear.\nReally immersive.CONS\nProbably not going to be the longest of games.\nI'm sorry but I just can't think of anymore cons.","October 13, 2015","true","4.0"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","19","25","2","4"

To do so, she must brave nine perilous "Realms" (levels), find the secret "Runes" (keys) that will allow her to challenge five powerful "Jotun" (giants) in their lairs and defeat them to impress Odin, the Allfather of the Gods.\n\nJotun was developed by Canada-based Thunder Lotus Games studio and was funded on Kickstarter in mid-2014.\n\nGame description\nEach time you launch the game you start from "Ginungagap", an ethereal realm in the void between Valhalla and the physical world; no harm can find Thora in Ginungagap and you can teleport back there anytime. The Jotun realms are all directly accessible from Ginungagap and once you find the runes required to unlock the Jotun lairs, you can also access the boss-fights anytime. There is a preferred order in which you must explore the realms and challenge the Jotun and you can redo the realms & bosses anytime (without extra benefit).\n\nThora has a limited set of moves in her arsenal: a low-damage fast swing, a powerful but slow overhead chop and a roll/dash to dodge attacks. Exploring the nine realms, Thora can find "Ithunn's Apples" that permanently increase her max health and shrines that grant her "God Powers" used to perform special actions, e.g. restore health, move faster, hit harder etc; there is six God-powers to be found and each has 2-3 charges. Thora's health and God-power charges are fully replenished each time she visits a "Mimir's Well"; there's usually a couple of them to be found in each realm (they usually serve as auto-save checkpoints too) and one in the entrance of each Jotun lair.\n\nThe giant Jotun bosses each have a unique set of powers/weaknesses and the fights are usually split in 2-3 phases, more difficult as the boss' health decreases. In order to win those fights, you have to figure out the pattern, lay out a plan (involving careful use of Thora's limited resources) and execute it correctly. When killed you are respawned to the entrance of the Jotun lair, at full health, so you can immediately retry the battle.\n\nThe rest of the game revolves around exploring the Jotun realms to find the runes, apples and God-powers which will aid you in the boss-fights. Each of the realms has a unique Norse-mythology inspired theme (e.g. magical forest, lava-filled dungeon, frozen lake, stormy cloud-realm etc) and there's some mini-puzzles, some labyrinth-navigating and a few regular enemies to beat. Thora can die in various ways when exploring the Jotun realms, but going through them is relatively easy.\n\nMy opinion\nThe game has beautiful hand-drawn graphics: the sprites are especially well-designed and animated but I think there's room for improvement in some of the background art; it feels like Jotun attempts to define an original style of its own but falls just a bit short of the mark! The music and SFX are nice, sometimes atmospheric and never lacking or annoying; what I mostly liked about the audio is the narrator/voice-over in Icelandic which is heard a few times in each realm/lair, when you reach a key location. The gameplay is solid, mostly revolving around the relatively hard boss fights; my only concern is that the realms you must explore before you challenge the bosses are quite easy and sometimes feel a bit empty. Don't get me wrong: I like how Jotun fuses the Norse mythology in all those "quests", but I just wish there was more to do!\n\nI played with keyboard but a controller would probably be more appropriate. I am not really good at these games and it took me ~8 hours to complete Jotun (find all there is to be found and beat all bosses) and get ~30% of its Steam achievements. I don't find myself replaying the game anytime soon: the story/setting is pretty standard mythology stuff and all there is left to do is beat the bosses in fancy ways, e.g. do them quickly, take no damage, use no God-powers etc. Note that there's no difficulty setting and the game uses only non-intrusive auto-saving. One could argue that the content is bit lacking, but I feel it is OK especially if you get the game on discount.\n\nI can safely recommend this small indie game to lovers of Norse mythology and isometric/2.5D action-adventure games with hand-drawn graphics. If I were to grade my experience with Jotun, I'd give it a 7.5/10.","December 27, 2015","true","8.8"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","15","18","0","0"

The assets are there. Just something went wrong.\n\nIn Jotun, you play as Thora, a Viking warrior who was drowned, and now is set on the path to defeat several giants known as jotun to impress the Gods, so that you may be accepted in Valhalla. It's a neat concept for a game, and the Norse Mythology theming is wonderful. Much of the lore is integrated into the game's environment, and I found myself learning a bit about the mythology.\n\nThora herself feels pretty damn good. Her movement and attacks are slow, but this is to encourage a deliberate playstyle; she feels very weighty. Her moveset is basic: a roll, a light and heavy attack. You also collect some power-ups to aid you. The massive jotun fights are the focus of the game, with short exploration segments prior, giving the player some nice quiet time. The fights are intense, grand, quite difficult, and definitely enjoyable. I genuinely found myself wanting to replay some of these fights even after I finished the game.\n\nThe presentation of the game is top notch. The hand drawn visuals are wonderfully animated, and each Jotun has it's own distinct style, most of which are really killer (one or two are not my style, but that's preference). Thora's sprites look gorgeous. A lot of care has been put into the visuals. The music is excellent as well, ranging from ambient, to somber, to bombastic. Some tracks really stick out here. The sound design is pretty effective as well, and the dialogue spoken in the character's native tongue really adds a lot, as well as being excellently delivered by her voice actress.\n\nThat's all great. So what went wrong?\n\nThere are a few things. The game has a nasty habit of breaking immersion. Some of the UI seems out of place for the theming, and all the areas are disconnected from each other in a hub area. The game world doesn't feel cohesive, instead feeling like a series of levels to complete, rather than a living world. The aforementioned lore, too, also doesn't feel as "alive" as it should, with certain aspects of the mythology just plopping themselves in. You very rarely encounter smaller enemies, so everytime you do, it feels very awkward. The backtracking can be frustrating often because of the size of some of these environments, and the speed of your character. Often, the game will pretty much just tell you what to do explicitly, and this really hurts the game. No longer do I feel like a sick viking adventurer, instead, a person playing a game in a chair, being told what boxes to check in order to progress. All this and a dissapointing final boss battle, whose design is the least interesting in the game (really?) takes this game from an "awesome" to a "pretty good".\n\nI want this game to be good. I desperately want this game to be better than it is. Allow me to clarify: Jotun is definitely a good game. I am recommending it, albeit tentatively, after all. I love the feeling and aesthetic of the majority of this game. It's just a shame there are blemishes throughout which make it, all together, just pretty good.","January 9","true","7.8"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","10","10","0","0"

The game heavily explores Norse mythology as players take control of Thora, a fallen, female viking who must now trek through the mystifying lands in the hopes of reaching Valhalla. However, she must first appease the Gods by defeating each of them in combat, gaining their specialized abilities to utilize against greater deities further ahead.\n\nThe game is presented beautifully as it contains hand-drawn imagery, extravagantly orchestrated music, great voice-acting and easy gameplay mechanics that’s simple to control. That being said, this game isn’t as forgiving as some may think. At first glance it may be viewed as appealing, childish game with artistic flair, but it is in no means an achievable success in one quick playthrough. In simple terms, this game is not the easiest. Your character is equipped with basic attacks that seem deliberate, along with a heavy attack that drags on before making contact against your opponent. So while engaging in a new fight, the player must evaluate enemies’ movements and lay out strategically planned attacks while retreating more often than not. Sadly, you’ll notice that you die several times, but this is the point as it’s a learning process and becomes increasingly fun as you get better at it. You must die to learn your opponents moves and adjust your gaming style accordingly. The Gods may be predictable but they like to change the playing field a bit.\n\nFrom my own experience the first boss was daunting but beatable; the second boss, however, some more figuring out on how to get rid of its remaining 25% health. Jotun is seriously one of those games that’ll beat you down and kick you once you on the ground, but for those stubborn gamers who thrive for that success: giving up is not an option. Frustration will accompany unsuccessful attempts, so be prepared!\n\nBelow is a quick preview of Jotun. Mind you, majority of it is me and my fail attempts at trying to beat the second boss, thus dying a numerous amount. :)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THxU7vAFDEo","November 23, 2015","true","0.7"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","12","15","0","0"

While the mechanics are indeed rudimentary, they never become boring in their versatility.\n\nThe music, little touches in the animation and the breathtaking landscapes make each of them uniquely memmorable.

The game features great art and animation, and impressive boss fights. Though it may look like a brawler on first impression, it's not at all.\n\nIn Jotun, you play as Thora, who has to go through multiple levels of Valhalla to prove her worth to the gods. She can accomplish this by choosing which level to tackle, in which each will feature 2 stages, then a boss fight. The stages usually play out like a maze or a puzzle, where you'll be finding your path to the end while tackling environmental obstacles. There are some light combat scenarios sprinkled in between, but are often optional, or are set up more as a set piece to break up the stage, than an event to challenge the player's abilities. Once 2 stages are completed on a given level, the entrance to the boss is unlocked and from there, you're greeted with an impressive god like being, much larger than you in scale, and often has a challenge or "gimmick" that echoes the level that proceeded it.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVxfFvgFPZw\nThe art is absolutely fantastic, and that should go with out saying. It's advertised as a hand animated adventurer, and the game certainly does a damn fine job at fulfilling that description. The animation quality is on par with classic animated movies of the past, while it's art design reminds me a little of old school Disney. It's beautiful visuals are complimented with an equally impressive sound design. The voice acting in the viking tongue is a nice touch to push the theme of the game further, while the music and sound effects are both appropriate and of a high quality. I love the OST of Jotun.\n\nMy favorite part of the game is easily the boss fights. They are impressive in design as well as in scale, often towering the player. Think Shadow of the Colossus kind of scaling, but in 2D hand animated form. The bosses also draw elements from the stages that you've completed in order to reach it. The ones I've defeated were very satisfying to fight.\n\nThough there is much I liked about Jotun, there was one thing that really frustrated me. It's inconsistent level design. This is not to say all the levels and stages were unenjoyable, some were actually very smartly designed in it's puzzles. However, the ones that I didn't enjoy frustrated the ever living hell out of me. Back tracking, confusion, paths that lead back to the beginning, and the feeling that it's there simply to pad out the content before reaching the real treat of the game, the boss fights, these were all issues I drew from the game.\n\nThough I feel like some of the levels I've played over stayed it's welcome, my overall experience with Jotun was definitely positive. It's eye catching art and animation, it's impressive sound design and boss fights were definitely highlights.\n\nPros:\n- Great art and animation\n- Impressive boss fights\n\nCons:\n- Inconsistent, sometimes frustrating level design","October 8, 2015","true","9.0"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","9","10","3","0"

Based in Norse mithology, Jotun brings you to a beautiful and wonderfully craften world.\n\nYou're Thora, a viking that died an infamous death and has to prove herself through a chain of great challenges to be able to finally reach Valhalla.\n\nYou have to defeat all the fallen giants that await you in the "limbo". For this you have first to traverse and explore through diverse levels that will introduce you some obstacles and enemies, that you will need to learn to deal with, as the concepts introduced there are essential for beating the bosses later. Smart design that eases you at a good pace on how to approach things.\n\nThe artstyle is absolutely gorgeous, as is the world building. You will find lots of lovely views throughout the game, and all levels give you insight and are linked to the Norse mythology thematically. It really feels like very passionate representation of it.\n\nThroughout the exploration of the levels, you're meant to find the pillars that will allow to access the boss batle, but you will also be able to find health upgrades, as well as new powers that give you some helpful advantages (like doing more damage, running faster, restoring health). Those aren't needed for progression, but they do help you greatly on it, rewarding the exploration of every nook and cranny in the level. In many of the levels you will have to solve puzzles to progress, either navigational (finding the right way and order of going to a certain place) or more standard puzzles of activating certain mechanics in the correct way.\n\nIn addition to that, the combat gameplay is fairly simple. You have a strong attack, a light attack, roll, and roll+attack, and you always use the same weapon. It's responsive and it works well, despite not having a great depth to it. The challenge of the game comes with each boss's pattern. Timing is essential and you need to learn how to read their movements. Patience is recommended and just spamming attacks won't help. You apply what you learn throughout the levels before to effectively use it your advantage.\n\nBoth the design of the bosses and their animation are wonderful. Each one is drawn in a way that both clashes and fits into the world, taking a very hand-drawn aesthetic to them that makes them stand out in the world while at the same time feeling like it's part of it, with smart use of color and shading. The animation also works in the same way. They stand out from the rest by only having some frames of actual animation, feeling like  old-school hand-animated characters, while at the same time flowing perfectly with the game and what's happening.\nThe art also conveys very well the same feeling you have in Shadow of Colossus, battling creatures that seem so much bigger and powerful than you. You're just this tiny being, against giants that are almost the size of mountains, and every thing gives the sense of epic.\n\nAdding to the wonderful world and art in display, I have to reference the music. The game has one of the best soundtracks I've heard this year. It's on point every single time. Proper epic, daunting and energetic tracks while takingg on a boss, soothing ones while exploring, etc. Every single one feels crafted to the specific moment you're going through.\n\nCertainly of the best indie titles of the year, even if flawed in some ways. The combat has lot of potential and could be a bit more diverse and have more depth, and the game doesn't have much replayabilty, but other than that, it's great. Definitely recommended.\n\n8.5/10\n+Great artstyle\n+Challenging Boss batles\n+Amazing soundtrack\n\n-Combat could do with a bit more depth","October 1, 2015","true","12.9"," 16 of 25 people (64%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","64","16","25","4","0"

Everything aside from gameplay was superb.\n\nArt direction, atmosphere, icelandic narration and level design were fantastic.\n\nGameplay had highlights in the boss battles, which are the main selling point of the game and were just hard enough to feel satisfaction when they were defeated but (aside from Odin) were easy enough to beat with only a couple of deaths each, so ragers fear not. Each boss had interesting mechanics that made most of them a joy to fight.\nIn spite of that, for a game that is advertised around defeating giant gods, the combat was dull. You have two attacks, one quick (pronounced useless) and one slow (pronounced infuriating). You have one combat-based God power that just powers up the slow attack, which can easily miss.\n\nThe rest of the gameplay was also lacking, namely tedious character movement and low interaction. I could smash some iceblocks for example, but attacking the giant dandelions did nothing. This is a small gripe I know, and granted the dandelions were just part of the scenery, but chopping them would've been satisfying and is indicative of the rich world being made to feel barren due to a very limited number of interactive moments.\n\nDespite the shortcomings, I still recommend this game when it's on sale.

Either I'm dodging a threat every once in a while or I'm finding symbols spread out across the stage to move on. It left such an empty feeling within me every time I had found all three items (the power-up, the key to the boss and the hidden health apple). Getting them consisted mostly of just walking great distances to them. And that was it. On repeat until the game was over.\n\nA highlight was the vine surfing level where you see that big dragon far in the distance. And then the boss fights themselves. Those were fun. The atmosphere in general was quite good, but atmosphere stops mattering to me if I don't care for the story.\n\nI never really got to know the character I'm playing. I'd always see her from far away. She never did do anything other than walk and fight. There was a retrospective monologue after every boss but her backstory wasn't all that interesting. It also gave me this feeling that the whole story was conveniently set up primarily so that you would learn the names of the norse Gods and the places. I suppose I'm a bit at fault as well for not absorbing everything norse with undying enthusiasm!\n\nNo but I would've liked the narrative to step down from that high horse and relate to the player on a more human level.","October 4, 2015","false","5.2"," 18 of 31 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","18","31","0","0"

Especially for it's very reasnoable pricetag this game is a steal!\n\nTo make it short this game is basically the small lovechild of Bastion, Shadow of the Colossus with a dash of Dark Souls. If you enjoyed these games you will very likely enjoy Jotun.\n\nThe gameplay is tight and precise. There is no complex RPG developement system here but also no unencicary padding. The combat is simple, tight and precise and the rest of the gameplay is very varied for each world and feels very immersive and fitting. The Boss fights are clearly the highlight and batteling a towering creature 40 times your size, that shakes the very ground when it moves is a particularly unique thrill very few games offer!\n\nThe graphics are gorgous and the atmosphere is very dense. An extra compliment to the developers on how they manage to convey scale in this hand drawn 2D enviroment. The game mostly relies on the Dark Soulsy story telling method of letting you experience the world instead of forcing exposition down your throat (but less cryptic than in Dark souls).\n\nWith its 8-10 hours the game doesn't overstay its welcome and forgoes stretching content in favor of a fuller, tighter game experience. Everyone who loves immersive atmospheric games and marvels at the feeling of felling a particularly difficult Boss should definately try Jotun.

You play as a viking woman warrior who drowns and is taken up to the realm of gods. There, she must find special runes to unlock the gates of valhalla. In order to do so, she must traverse five very different worlds (each broken into two separate levels) and fight giant Jotun or guardians. The five worlds are very different and oftentimes entering into a new area feels like playing a different game.\n\nThe game's protagonist fights with a weak, somewhat fast attack, and a strong, very slow attack. She can also aquire, hidden throughout the levels, magic spells that can heal or make her faster or throw magic spears. The fighting is pretty basic stuff.\n\nWhere the gameplay shines, however, is in three areas. First, the art is absolutely amazing. It's like beautiful handdrawn art that has an at times abstract quality to it. The is game is a true masterpiece. Second, the levels. Each level is unique and interesting. Different gameplay is employed in each level and different strategies must be used to get through them. Also, most of the spells and life enhancing items are cleverly hidden so there is extra challenge in order to find everything. Finally, the bosses. These guys are not only drawn and animated beautifully, but they are huge. It's like playing Shadow of Colossus in that most of the battles are learning the bosses' patters and weaknesses. It's extremely challenging to tackle these giants but immensely rewarding once you come out victorious. And those hidden spells that you can find? You'll find yourself scouring every corner of every level to find EVERYTHING because you'll need them for the bosses.\n\nI'm so glad I got to play this game. In my mind it is a work of art that was a blast to play. I think the developers did an outstanding job and I would highly recommend this game.\n\nOn a technical note: game ran smooth at 60 FPS and 1080p resolution. I played with a controller and it worked fine. I didn't try keyboard controls, but I couldn't see myself playing this with a keyboard. I never had a glitch or crash and saw no bugs to report. The game is about 6 hours long and there isn't much replay value after you beat it.","January 25","true","6.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's the biggest feature the game has and it's delivering it right !\n\nThere is two big parts : exploration and boss fighting.\n\n- Exploration areas won't features a lot of fighting (in most of them you won't encounter any enemies). You will collect runes to open portal to get to the boss battle. Each exploration areas will teach you new mecanics used by the boss they give access. Some of those areas can be a bit too big and with a slow character it can be a bit annoying (one is mainly too big for what it has to offer... but it's really my only gripe with the game, it shouldn't stop you from playing it !).\nYou'll collect god powers in those areas too. Those will enhance your character and give you special abilities like healing, shielding, etc...\n\n- Boss battles are really epic, with a good balance of difficulty and are very very very well designed. You can do them again once you have killed them and try some epic challenges like killing one without taking any damage ! :D\nAchievements can appear pointless for most of us (I personnaly like them xD), but those really show how the battles are well designed, and are worth trying.\n\nTL;DR :\n- Great game very well polished, with epic boss battles.\n- A character a bit too slow while exploring BUT you'll get used to it and it won't matter in the end :)\n- Good difficulty and balance overall.\n- The game has some replayability if you enjoy challlenges !\n- Totally worth the price.\n\n\nFor those who are asking themselves : no it's nothing like Shadow of the Colossus.\nI won't go into details, so let's just say the feeling is totally different and if you look for a SotC 2 you might get disapointed.

It shines through its narrative immersion and offers breathtaking art and music. The game is relatively easy and short, and it is more about experiencing a beautiful journey than it is about overcoming challenges.\n\nLong version\nFor a game that's basically a boss rush, Jotun is quite easy to beat. I killed every one of the 5 jotuns quite handily, usually with no more than 2 retries. The end boss was a bit harder, and took me 5 tries. Don't expect Titan Souls or Shadow of the Colossus in terms of difficulty here, as the game does not require much in terms of thinking and skills. You basically just move, hit and dodge-roll. Once in a while, you'll trigger a special power, but they're not that crucial to your success and don't really bring in any tactical play. Similarly, environmental puzzles are not complicated, they just take a bit of work to complete. One interesting characteristic of Jotun is that it masterfully gives the illusion of great danger and urgency, when in fact, gameplay-wise, it's not a hard game at all. But the mise en scene and overall atmosphere make every fight and challenge feel epic and dangerous. It may sound negative, but in fact, the result is very pleasant and exhilerating, especially the boss fights.\n\nIt took me just about 5 hours to complete the game 100%. It's quite short, but it's ok because the devs constructed a simple, yet effective game that's much more about immersing yourself in a narrative journey than about mastering deep game mechanics. And that's a very good choice in the case of Jotun.\n\nI think Jotun's greatest strength is that every action you take, every location you visit feels important and connected to the game's fantasy. You certainly don't mash buttons in this slow-paced game, and that's because it only asks you to perform actions when it would bring you closer to your goal or to let you marvel at the epicness of Norse mythology. You also won't get bogged down in complicated game mechanics or artificial challenges.\n\nJotun's narrative immersion is supported by a breath-taking art-style, an atmospheric soundtrack and a great narrator. Jotun really is unique in this regard, and feels like no other game. All of this culminates in boss fights, which are awe-inspiring and memorable. Not so much because of the gameplay, which is ok, but mostly because of the grandiose and epic feeling you get from these fights.\n\n\nOverall, I recommend Jotun. Go try it now!\n","May 23","true","5.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

When you move towards one of its many huge landmarks, or approach one of the massive bosses, the camera zooms out and out and out until your character is just a few pixels large.

There's a fair amount of fulfillment just in completing the core game: beautiful maps to explore, Shadow of the Colossus-esque fights that feel insanely rewarding upon victory, if only because of the artstyle, a neat & tight-fitting soundtrack, and the devs have used achievements to mask optional hard modes which extend the gameplay well, with seemingly crucial elements of bossfights being optionally foregone.\n\nHowever, It can become somewhat tedious to finish exploring for the last of Idunn's apples, or that last God statue; because the cinematic nature of the maps enforcing the protagonist's small stature is primarily done with scale and time. If you complete a zone and want to return for a missing object, it's really just an autorun experience. Likewise the act of returning to bosses for achievements can become a pain in the butt; a small wait quickly becomes a significant test of patience. The cinematic flair works against it at times; it'd take a special kind of powergamer to play it start-finish, but in brief installments of each zone it works wonderfully.\n\nRegardless, good game, I doubt I'll forget their unique, artful depictions of Jormungandr, Ratatosk or Nidhogg any time soon. 8.5/10 :3c","January 25","true","7.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Perfect difficulty, welcomed puzzles to break up the action (and unique free roam environments that have since been given a slight rework by providing the player with a faster running speed so that it doesnt feel so much like a slog), and a beautiful soundtrack, art style, and mythological setting, really make this 5 or so hour game very fun and immersive.

The Graphics and art style in general is pretty good, however certain things lack the detail of the backgrounds and the bosses are animated at a much lower frame rate than the rest which is unfortunate but not a deal breaker.\n\nThe main issue is that outside of the boss fights the game just isnt very fun. There are a number of extremely simple puzzles that just take a bit too much time to do leading to a plodding pace with no real challenge. For example in the lightning area you need to hit objects to draw lines in order to make constelations, however none of these are particularly challenging and the slow movement speed of the character just left it feeling a bit tedious to complete the puzzles, another area takes place on a tree where the only thing you need to do is walk along amiring the pretty background and pressing heavy attack when you see a specific type of branch.\n\nThe boss fights I experienced in my time however felt much better, but not good enough to warrant the boring filler between them.","December 30, 2015","false","0.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Here are some of the reasons why I would pick up this game.\n\n1) Art Style: A lot of work has been put into making the aesthetic for this game. It is amazingly drawn and gives a sort of Banner Saga kind of aesthetic to the game. The maps look beautiful and in some parts the devs were able to give a sort of scale using this hand drawn method that I have never really seen in a game before (eg A large ocean view with pillars that look like they are taller than the empire state building).\n\n2) Music: This is what I believe to be one of the most important aspects of a video game and this title does not disappoint. The soundtrack is perfectly in tune with the setting giving the proper mood for the proper moments. It is also great to listen too, making me wish to be able to buy their soundtrack.\n\n3) Gameplay: Although slow in some sections (eg walking around for 15min because you are either lost or cannot find what you are looking for) the game definitely picks up the pace in combat. If you enjoy slow paced combat where you like to think about your next action (similar to the pace of world of tank, even though not related in any way its pacing is similar), however this game is real time so you will not be pausing but the attacks of the enemies and yourself are slow enough to generate this feel. All the attacks of yourself and enemies (especially the Jotun) have a real kick to them, imaging squashing 20 dwarves with one swing. The boss battles (which are the most important part of the game) are some of the best executed ones I have ever seen. You really need to think about the style of the boss and how to create opportunities to defeat it without getting destroyed by a giant shield or lightning bolt. All of the hero abilities are very fun to use and are extremely important to being able to win against a boss (you need to use them or you will not win), something that most games forget to do (aka not using an ability because it is useless later on). The controls on PC are easy to use and rebindable which is also a good thing.\n\nOverall I would recommend you guys to take a look at Jotun, I have been having a lot of fun with it.\n\nIf you want to see gameplay check out my YouTube channel at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC87BQWt8MWRMdIOsFVlfGaQ","September 30, 2015","true","10.2"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","3"

This game really isn't worth full price.  On a discount, like 50% or so...sure, pick it up, but otherwise, it can wait.  Why do I say that?  Well...Jotun is all flash with very little substance.\n\nThe game is gorgeous top to bottom, no doubting that.  However, it's basically Shadow of the Colossus with all the depth taken out.  You can move, light attack, heavy attack, and dodge.  Those are what you will use for most of the game.  No combos, no secret weapons, just that.  You can get god power ups, but they're pretty ho hum.  Healing, shield, decoy, extra power, extra speed.  This is a game that's more fun to watch than play, because like Shadow of the Colossus, you are walking around without much to do a lot of the time.  Now, that isn't to say it can't be fun.\n\nI said the game was gorgeous and I meant it.  The graphical style has very smooth animation and a unique nordic flavor that I really enjoy, even if the combat is as shallow as can be.  All the bosses have an interesting look and gimmick to them and some of the backgrounds are just jaw dropping...head under the world tree Yggdrsil and see what you will find.  It's a very pretty game and the music is passable, but I find myself unimpressed gameplay wise.  It can be fun to fight the bosses, who are all huge, but that's all there is.  One level does have you fight a swarm of enemies, but...it's not a fight.  It's a boss rush that's,,,in no rush.  It really drags it's feet with taking you on an extended sight seeing tour of the world of Norse Myth.\n\nI did enjoy my time with this game, so I won't say it's bad, but it is shallow.  The graphics are good enough to warrant a buy, but NOT at full price.

It feels a lot like Shadow of The Colossus with some Dark Souls and Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain elements. You play as Thora, a Viking warrior trying to prove herself to Gods in order to be allowed into Valhalla. To impress them, Thora needs to find all runes scattered in mysterious realms and defeat jotuns - giant elemental warriors from Norse mythology.\n\nYou spend most of the time on exploring vast and dangerous realms. Every single on of them not only looks different, but also plays different. In some you solve simple riddles, like lighting up correct crystals to create animal images, or use boats and fallen trees to get to seemingly unreachable islands. In others you try to make your way through a labirynth of branches or frozen rocks, dodging attacks of a giant eagle and hiding from gusts of northern wind. There are poisonous swamps full of traps as well as caves filled with lava and giants throwing rocks at you. There's a frozen lake with a giant snake poping from beneath the ice. This variety ensures, that exploration never gets boring and requires you to be extremely cautious at all times.\n\nTraveling through levels not only allows you to collect runes required to face jotuns, but gives you the opportunity to develop your character a bit. Finding monumental statues gives you new skills, such as healing or ability to do electrical damage with your axe. Eating golden apples makes your health bar longer whereas drinking water from mysterious fountains recharges your health and skills. Sometimes they are well hidden, so you need to explore every corner.\n\nWhen you collect all runes (usually two of them) in each realm, you get to fight with its boss. Jotuns are giant and deadly just like bosses in Dark Souls. They have many attacks and require you to work out when and how to evade them. You cannot block anything, so you have to dodge, run between their legs, get away when they charge or come close when it's safe. Each fight is different and its conditions change as soon as you deplete some of the creatures health. Some of them clone themselves, others turn floor into ice making it harder to move or make giant tentacles appear around you. It's very easy to make a mistake and die since jotuns' hits take out most of your health. You will repeat some of the fights many, many times before you succeed.\n\nAll characters are drawn and animated by hand, making the game really beautiful and unique. Most of the environments look lovely as well. In some scenes the camera zooms out allowing you to see breathtaking backgrounds. This, combined with beautiful, emotional music and Icelanding voice-overs, creates an experience, that's hard to forget.

Now imagine doing that in a game where you have to be every role at the same time, with no direction or tutorial, no level up system, and a camera that seems to actively work against you. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Jotun.\nIf you are looking for an action game, look elsewhere. I'll admit to only playing through a few levels, but to date, they have been miles of endless, beautiful, but ultimately boring open space. Yes you do occasionally fight monsters, in the same way that in your day to day life you may occasionally have to catch/squish a spider. It happens, its noteworthy for a moment, and then you move back to your mundane existence.\nWhen you do get into a fight, it can be summarized in one of two ways, pointlessly underpowered, where you may as well button mash as a means of working out that cramp in your joystick thumb. Or Boss battle of death and carnage, where you will be killed, multiple times, by a boss whose 'pattern' is only marginally above random, and whose attacks will render you into a gooey paste in approximately 3 hits.  If that alone doesn't discourage you, get ready, you'll be told consistently with each death that you have 'Failed to Impress the gods.' which might seem meaningful, if those same gods hadn't denied you all aid, and expected you to face down a literal host of enemies and a giant who, more often than not, laughs at your pathetic attempts to harm it.\nCombat might be made easier with a tutorial, there are only 2 attacks, a light and a heavy swing, with heavy taking longer. Fun facts you may want to know, the heavy attack can actually stun bosses to break up their big attacks. It can be used to clear certain obstacles, and it is interruptible. There is also a 'God power' button, which does nothing when you start the game. You can get a god power early on, and find more, but unless you randomly hit the button after that, despite having possibly previously tested it with no outcome to show for it, you will NEVER know that it is functional. I was honestly surprised the first time it worked, which some might call the wonder of discovery, and I call lousy planning.\nActually that's the greater issue with the game in my eyes, even beyond combat. There is a lack of explanation and clear goals, yet the game is clearly built 'on rails' with a set path where choice and deviation have been eliminated.  I'm not sure what the point of mystery or uncertainty is in a game where these things  will clearly be revealed. It's like watching Scooby Doo, you know that by the end, someone in a monster suit will be in a net and bound or gaggged, no one will be hurt, and all will be revealed, so why get hung up on worrying over what the phantom wrestler or what have you, will do next? Ultimately, it doesn't matter, nothing substantial will change. Jotun seems hell bent on keeping the player in the dark, not offering any information until you pry it from the cold lifeless hands of the latest corpse it bothers to throw in your path as a minor setback. More fun facts, there are 'golden apples' that will extend your life bar. You will not know about these until you happen to find one, leading me to wonder how many I may have missed, and what other 'secrets' were hidden by obnoxious level design. The environments are not destrutible, except where they are, without any clear marking that this may be the case. There are wonderful set pieces that will seem like they are important. They aren't, or if they are, you won't know why, probably ever.\nJotun hints at story, a tale of viking glory and mythology, and then gives you a walk through a wonderfully painted storybook scene, where you can fall asleep. Looking for a cure to insomnia? Buy Jotun! Looking for an action game? Have you considered chess as an exciting alternative, where the action takes place minute after minute, without miles of walking between.\n","January 14","false","1.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Or at least that is what the game proposes. In fact you only get to learn very little about her. Only when you beat one of the five bosses a small part of her story is revealed. No spoiler here but her background could feature a much deeper story than it is delivered in Jotun. Instead you get introduced to norse mythology every here and there which is pretty cool actually but it sure cannot make up for the missing parts. - 5/10\n\nThe Idea of fighting for glory after death isn't new but the combination with the very deep norse mythology make this very appealing. There are many different aspects to each level and every boss that make exploring and fighting really enjoyable. - 9/10\n\nHave you seen the pictures of this game?! Gorgeous I say! The Artstyle really fits the game so much. Awesome job there!  The UI could have been a bit better. In hectic fights it can be hard to recognize the currently selected power when fastly switching through them. They are displayed way to small and to far out of the players focus (talking about mode-error for those design-nerds out there) - 9/10\n\nSound is simply amazing. That feeling you get when walking towards the fire-Jotun. No words for that.\nAlso the voice-over is just great. - 10/10\n\nThe levels are really different and nice to play. They deliver a certain atmorphere each on their own. I simply hoped there was more variance in each level itself. For example the "crater" is pretty repetitive with only one enemy type and the same "puzzle" everywhere. - 8/10\n\nThe game comes with 9 areas, 6 epic boss fights + 1 intro boss + 1 epic midgard serpent. It took me around 7 hours to complete the game and collect/find every PoI. The mythology presented in the game aswell as the awesome voice-over makes you want more! - 7/10\n\n\nThis ranking was made-up by myself and only does represent my personal oppinion on the game.\nI recommend to play this game with a Gamepad.","October 1, 2015","true","7.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Some of these levels even involve no combat (I did not mind this as it brought a nice change of pace).\n\nThe hand drawn art/animation art style is worth playing this game for alone and is good proof that you don't need shiny graphics to make something look epic!\n\nOf course the music is just as grand, after all Jotun is about Norse Mythology!\nThe voiceovers in Icelandic really really help set the scene and aid in the story.\n\nThe boss design is where this game really excels and I say with confidence they are some of the best I've ever seen in a video game, not to mention that they’re a tough challenge! On each occasion you have to figure out how to take down a giant with just an axe and some abilities you found along the way…but that moment of satisfaction when you finally take them down is amazing!\n\nThe only thing I could fault is perhaps the ending.

Your basic moveset consists of a light attack, a strong attack and a dodge button. Later you will also find "powers" which give you effects like speed or more damage or protection. So for the player there isn't that much complexity, which I like, but the game could need a little bit more depth, however the bossfights make up for that.\nEvery boss has a unique theme and unique mechanics. The nice thing is how the game introduces you to some of these mechanics in the "puzzle" sections before the boss itself which helps to learn how to dodge certain types of attacks and so on, so there is no trial & error. Also the bosses start slow and easy and get more hectic and difficult the more you damage the boss. There was 1 boss which was a bit dissapointing, because that boss had very little attacks and didn't have the quality (in terms of animations, sound design etc.) as the others for some reason. And that's a big deal, because you only get to fight 5 bosses, the game isn`t that long. If you take out all the "puzzle" sections, you could complete the game in 2 hours, but I think it is good that these intermissions exist, to give the player time to breath between bossfights, however they aren`t designed that interestingly.\nSometimes you get to visit interesting locations or see cool creatures, but as the player you are mostly just running around with a very low movement speed and that made these parts a bit boring to me. Also it discouraged me from exploring, but the game wants you to explore. Some powers are hidden really well, but are SO helpful to beat bosses. Thankfully the game shows you the location of these locations on the map, but the map doesn`t show you your location, so you always have to keep track of where you are, but that is artificial difficulty in my opinion. If the game had actual puzzle mechanics and things you could solve or secrets you could find, then the game would probably show you your location, but currently it's just about finding the right path.\nBecause the game isn`t that long anyway and the "puzzle" parts didn`t feel fleshed out (some were cool) I can`t recommend this for full price, but it is a game you should definitly buy at some point, because the bossfights are just really well made, except 1 as I explained and there is a final boss after the 5 bosses, but that boss just recycles all of the previous bosses. That isn`t neccessarily a bad thing to do, but here it is, because of the low amount of bosses/content in general and because there is nothing after that. In Shovel Knight for example you also fought every boss one after the other in the final level, but then you also got to fight a real final boss with unique mechanics.\nOne last thing I want to mention is that I think the theme of this game is wasted. This had so much potential, but outside of some random dialouge about the things you visit there isn't a big story or anything. The game ends as abrupt as it starts. I mean visually it had some really cool places, the voice actors did a great job I think and the soundtrack is also really well made, but it's just the theme of the game, it could easily be something else and it would stay the same game.","October 2, 2015","true","4.7"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","5","10","0","2"

While the game is challenging the first time there really isn’t much to warrant playing through the game a second time.\n-Thora (the main character) is infuriatingly slow without using the boost ability.\n-The challenge of the game will make it inaccessible to most casual gamers.\n\nJotun is an action adventure game with hand drawn graphics in which you play the fallen Viking Thora, who has been killed at sea and must prove to the gods that she is worthy to enter Valhalla even though she died a dishonorable death. Your only weapon is your giant axe, which has a basic and heavy attack. While you will probably want to explore the game without being prompted, the game rewards exploration by hiding additional abilities throughout the game including healing, speed, shield, decoy, and damage. You have the freedom to choose whether to explore or not, but since the Jotun bosses are incredibly hard, you better have great technical skill if you choose to forgo the exploration. The unique hand drawn aesthetic provides the characters with a cinematic feel that enhances both the expression and beauty throughout the entire game, and is definitely the defining feature of Jotun. The game is also fully narrated in authentic Icelandic which is extremely close to Old Norse, the actual language of Vikings. The game lasts about 6-8 hours depending on how much exploration you do and how good you are, but due to the variety of worlds and unique mechanics presented in each world, those 6-8 hours are jam packed with content. The only real criticism I have of the game is that Thora seems unnecessarily slow without the speed boost ability, which can be frustrating since dodging attacks requires an already quick reaction time. If you aren’t good at this style of game or are a casual gamer, I recommend that you watch a playthrough instead because while I think everyone should enjoy the beautiful game that is Jotun, it’s definitely a game that you will be ripping your hair out over even at the first boss. For those who ARE looking for a challenge, I highly recommend you buy Jotun.\n","September 29, 2015","true","6.3"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","5","10","0","0"

But before you can fight a boss you have to complete the two levels that accompany each boss. These levels are there to let you explore this world that they have created and enjoy the artstyle, however it isn’t anything special. Each of these levels usually has one mechanic that is drove into the ground bythe end of it, making you glad that the level is over. This is problematic because the hand drawn graphics make you want to explore and see more of the level, but the mechanics either make it hard to explore or just down right tedious. I found that I was often having to pause and look at the map to reorient myself, which I don’t think should happen in a game like this because I want to be focusing on the art and the world. I want to be looking at this world that they have painstakingly hand drawn. Instead I am constantly opening up the map. Pausing in a game like this should be a sin, but the layout of some of these maps is so poor that it is a necessity. This part of the game is so incredibly boring, that I often found myself ready to quit when I was forced to do them.\n\nBut once you have suffered through two levels you can reward yourself with a boss fight. The boss fights are without a doubt the best part about this game, but they still have their flaws. One of my biggest problems with them is the combat itself. Combat consists of three attacks: fast, slow, and charge. However all three of them feel sluggish. Once you get past how slow your character is, the boss fights themselves are not particularly impressive. Each boss goes through a moveset, once it is taken below a health threshold it gets a second moveset. It is basically a memorization game. Which isn’t that big of a deal, but for a game whos main draw is the boss fights, I figured that the fights would have been a bit less formulaic than they were. I was hoping for a more reactionary fight, where the boss actually responds to what I am doing, but unfortunately that is not the case. On certain fights you can pretty much just stand in one spot and wail on them and get the best possible outcome. Not all fights are like that, some of them force you to constantly move around and dodge attacks, which was pretty fun.\n\nWith all of that in mind, I cannot recommend this game. It has good visuals and a few good boss fights, but overall the game is pretty boring and a majority of the boss fights are nothing to brag about.  It feels like a lot of people are getting swept away with the visuals in this game and are forgetting about the gameplay, which is slow, generic, and unimpressive.\n\n","January 24","false","3.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

To call it hack and slash is generous, it does hve exploratory elements to it, you play Thora.....A Viking warrior (potentially she could be seen as a shield maiden) who is killed while defending her father from her jealous brother who fears she will become leader (jarl) of thier community after thier father dies. she finds herself in the other world.......she is inbertween life and death and is tasked by the gods to entertain them, to indeed earn a place next to them in Valhalla. Odin tells Thora she is to take on a race of giants, enemies of the gods called the Jotun (pronounced YOTOON). To help you along the way you can call upon help from the gods by using the power of  Frigg's (wife to odin) Healing, Heimdall's (odin's most trusted warrior and defender of the bifrost) Shield, Loki's Decoy, Freya's (godess of the vanir and aesir - associated from everything from love to death lol so quite a busy girl) Speed, Thor's Hammer (Mjölnir - means lightning i think), and Odin's Spear (Gungnir - gungnir means 'the swaying one') . you can also stop at the well spring of life and replenish lost magic/life force. Mimir (The rememberer or the wise one) watches over the well with the eye ODIN gave him (odin traded one of his eyes with mimir in order to gain the wisdom of the ages). the game seems quite sparse of enemies to start but as you play through you find yourself relishing the next peice of story narrated by Thora. i am a lover of mythology in general from anywhere around the world but norse mythology just oozes style. i have found this game which is in my eyes is a guided tour through norse mythology with the occasional boss fight to be unputdownable (not a real word i know) and money well spent. it appears a lot of love has gone into the game itself and i personally would recommend the game to anyone who likes a story driven game with plenty of lore in it. i am quite happy to report no multiplayer option in evidence and will be keeping my peepers open for the next game this studio releases. only thing left is to give it a score:-\n\n9 out of 10 (if it had more enemies it would be 10)  - P.S. would love to see this in either a dynasty warriors or god of war vien - propper hack 'n' slash\n\n","November 27, 2015","true","172.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

The art style is amazing and most of the animations are incredibly well done.It sort of reminds me of the old disney movies , back when everything was drawn by hand.\nThe soundtrack is also great , and it fits the setting perfectly. Bosses are epic and give you the feeling of accomplishment after you beat them.\nThe levels ,although not huge , give you the feeling of a vast and rich world using some nifty pan tricks and detailed backgrounds. There are also health upgrade collectables , which you need to explore and sometimes do a puzzle (or at least figure out what to whack with your axe and how to get to it) to find.\nCombat is good, not great according to my standards ,but pretty good non the less. You cant do combos or stuff like that , and even your fast attack isnt that fast.But you are swinging a huge axe after all , so I guess thats OK.  After you roll you need a sec before you can move again , which can cost you valuable HP. Also if you start charging a heavy attack the only way to stop it is to roll , which can also cost you some health if you are surrounded by gross green death tentacles .\nStory is interesting so far , and by story I mean "you drowned but you didnt , but maybe you did , so now you have to impress the gods by beating a bunch of mythical creatures and collecting some runes". And the narration is in some Scandinavian sounding language , which really helps with the immersion.\n\nSo far 9/10","October 1, 2015","true","10.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It is also the name of a new title on Steam. Jotun is a beautiful hand-drawn single player game from Thunder Lotus Games. The visuals are absolutely amazing, it looks like you are playing a cartoon.  What Dragon’s Lair promised back in the 80’s Jotun delivers.\n\nYou play as Thora, a female viking who dies by drowning. To preserve her place in Valhalla, she must make her way through Viking purgatory. With a two handed axe, you must push your way through five jotun in order to impress the gods.  Succeed, and you will have a seat at the table within the hall in Asgard.\n\nThe game is an exploration action game.  There are several levels in the game which do not require you to kill a single enemy.  In these levels you must explore the area and find the available items all while progressing further into purgatory. Exploration is part of every level, but some levels do have enemies, and plenty of them.  When you enter the dwarven location, at first the dwarves run away from you.  They quickly gang up and you must face a horde of little hammer-wielding builders who want you out of their space.\n\nEach area involves you collecting runes. The runes are used to unlock the doors to the Jotun’s area, which is where the boss fights are located.  Each of the five Jotun you face is unique. They present a significant challenge and each fight becomes more difficult as you do more damage to the boss. One downfall, however, is that the bosses are a bit predictable.  They have set moves that, while not performed in the exact order each time,  do become predictable when you are fighting the same fight for the fifteenth time. That being said, the fights are fun and invigorating when you do finally defeat the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nOne of other items you collect are blessings from the gods.  Each area, including the introductory area, has a shrine to one of the Norse gods. When you approach it, you gain their power to use in the game.  So far I have collected four such blessings. Loki allows you to place an illusion of yourself that enemies will attack, after a while it explodes. Frigga gives you the ability to heal. Freyja gives you a speed boost. Thor gives you the power of Mjolnir in your attacks.  I am sure there are more as I still have two areas to complete, and I am looking forward to receiving those abilities.\n\nThora has only a few moves outside of her god abilities. She walks rather slowly around the map. Her basic attack feels slow when you compare it to something like Assassin’s Creed’s combat. But it does fit nicely in game’s environment. Thora also has a power swing. It is extremely slow but awesomely powerful. The best part about it is that once started, you aren’t stuck finishing the swing.  You can cancel it by doing her last ability, a roll. This has saved my life several times as I started the swing and suddenly didn’t have the time to finish it before an enemy attacked.\n\nThe hand drawn animation of the game immediately put me back into the 80s, though my wife says it looks more like the 90s era cartoons. The face of the first Jotun you face, the plant boss, immediately reminded me of Mumm-ra from Thundercats. The vistas you experience were awe inspiring enough that I made sure to stop and take screenshots so I can use them as wallpaper.\n\nThe story of the games is told through Thora’s narrative as you progress through the five areas. It is all spoken in Norse, with English subtitles. She tells you of her childhood and how she became a warrior. It's a great way to experience the story, especially since the game is so laid back.  I get enough of the story that I am interested in knowing more, but not enough to take away from the gameplay.\n\nThis game is something that young kids or casual gamers could play.  There is no blood, no gore, and no sex. But it is fun and interesting enough that adults used to mainstream games will enjoy it too. Jotun will challenge you and make you want some of the original art.  I give the game an 89. It's a great game and deserves a place in your backlog, but I would recommend playing it immediately.\n","September 29, 2015","true","3.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

You play as a norse woman who died in a shipwreck and must now fight Norse gods in Jotenheim. The gameplay consists of walking through beautifully drawn landscapes until you come to a boss that you should probably hit with that giant axe you have.\n\nThe gameplay in Jotun is okay. You have a standard attack, a power attack, a roll, and a god power. You have to dodge attacks while trying to get shots in (Dark Souls skillz for te win). There are two issues. The small issue is that the game does not tell you the controls. You have to either guess or look in the control mapping. It's not a big issue, but I didn't know how to use my god power for a couple fights.... which was fun...... The other issue is that combat is slow. It doesn;t have a sense of urgency to it that is prevalent in games like Dark Souls and Titan Souls (which I consider to be similar games to this).\n\nThe visuals are the best part of this game. They are gorgeous and interesting. Everything has a level of polish that speaks to just how much time the developers put into drawing the pictures. Good for them.\n\nOverall, Jotun is a decent game with beautiful visuals. Don't expect fast paced action, because the action tends to be quite slow. All that being said, it is quite a game.","October 2, 2015","true","1.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

In order to get to the land of eternal fighting though, she’ll have to do a bunch of, well, fighting.\n\nThora wields an enormous battle axe – seriously, it’s almost bigger than she is – and has to collect Runes, which she uses to summon the Jotun. The Jotun are described as elemental creatures, which fits well with their original Norse background. In addition, to give the game a bit more mystery (and replay value), each level will be procedurally generated. The combat is advertised as being “fast-paced and brutally hard,” with the Jotun requiring skill and strategy if Thora is to have any hope of defeating them. These Norse giants are huge, to the point that the camera has to zoom out quite a lot to even place a single Jotun on-screen with Thora. The Jotun are so huge, in fact, that a single finger would easily dwarf Thora.","September 29, 2015","true","0.2"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

I feel like a few too many of my deaths came from unclear cues. Additionally, the 2D assets don't always communicate well where they are in 3D space, which can make getting angles of attack and avoidance difficult, especially when things zoom way out.\nAbilities could tie into the fights a little better. I mostly resort to pumping out damage early to try winning before things get frustrating and too hard to manage. Simpler fights were most fun.\nEdit: reading about other people's play-throughs, it looks like I took on some of the harder stuff early. Wish there had been better clues about the optimal order.\n\nContent between the big face-offs is a little dull. Simple puzzles, long walks. Mostly easy enemies except for a few insta-death from above dudes.\nVery much would have liked to see a better map. It's difficult to be sure where I am, as the terrain isn't really marked, and there is no marker of the player's current location. I can't think of a recent game with a map that doesn't provide this. Seems like this was an attempt to make exploration a little challenging, but there are probably better obstacles that could have been placed. If I'm trying to get somewhere specific, I just find myself spamming the pause button as I move across screens to keep track of where I'm at.\n\nArt style is novel, and is a big factor in holding my attention. Some of the environments could use better contrast/shading and coloring to make it easier to navigate.\nGreat use of mythology.","October 1, 2015","true","3.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Combining exploration, some basic puzzle elements, authentic Icelandic voiceovers, and some epic, methodical boss battles, Jotun is well worth the price tag.  However, it is critical to note that it is very deliberately paced.\n\nThora, the main character, is a powerful Viking warrior swinging a giant axe and she moves how you might expect ... moderate walk speed and slow, powerful attacks, making the Jotun battles more about tactics and positioning over raw reflexes and button-mashing (though reflexes do not hurt!).  Also, the deliberate pace carries through the non-boss levels, with a premium on exploration, beautiful vistas, and atmosphere over constant combat.  In most levels, the greatest dangers are environmental and the simple challenge of puzzling through the area to find both the rune to advance and each power-up.\n\nThe art and graphics require a special shout-out.  The hand-drawn art is beautiful and perfectly matches the gameplay and story feel.  The giant enemies feel impactful and unique, Thora moves and animates beautifully, the backgrounds are lovely, and the team's interpertation of the Norse gods is great.\n\nJotun is a relatively short playthrough (about 6 hours for me with full exploration and at most 4 tries per boss) but it was a very engaging playthrough.  For the $15 price, that's plenty of entertainment for me, plus the developers are adding a New Game+ (supposedly later this year) to add extended gameplay value.\n\nTo sum up:\nPotential Pros:\n+ Beatiful hand-drawn art\n+ Methodical (if simple) combat system that rewards tactics\n+ Great, simple controls (using controller)\n+ Challenging giant bosses\n+ Great atmosphere and story with real Icelandic voice-overs (the closest modern language to how Vikings spoke)\n\nPotential Cons:\n- Slow pace of exploration and action (might turn off some)\n- Relatively short total playtime (4 to 6 hours at current)","October 6, 2015","true","5.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","2","0","0"

I wrote my original review right after rage quitting, which wasn't fair to the game. I'm changing my oppinion on it, but I'm leaving what I wrote before, because I think some of the complaints and feelings have merit.\n\nAs a tldr foreword, I'd rate this game as flawed, but worth playing.\n\nSound and art are excellent, level design is hit and miss, and combat can make the game a slog at times.  A more detailed review is below.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat went right-  Again, the aesthetic is just gorgeous.  I love the accuracy of the setting, and the voice acting is superb.  I think I would have liked to have heard the voice actress display more emotional range, such as having dialogue other than backstory and grunts, but I recognize how that could be difficult to implement.  While I see how this could have been a turn off for some, I actually really appreciate that the dialogue is in icelandic.  I assume it's Icelandic, anyway.\n\nWhat went wrong-  I still think the combat system could use some work.  There're two main gripes I have here.\n\nFirst is mobility.  Without using Freya's Speed, you move painfully slow in relation to the Jotun. While this isn't always a huge deal, as I said before, in 3/6 fights it makes a huge difference. The dodge roll is also kind of an issue, for two reasons.  First, depending on the frame of the swing animation, the dodge roll comes in a bit late as a cancel, which makes the game feel less responsive.  Second, the distance is pretty short considering the huge size of the Jotun.\n\nThe second issue is the combat mechanics. The major issue with these is tutorialization. Until it was pointed out, I didn't know that projectiles could be attacked, or that Freya's Speed sped up combat animations. Aside from tutorialization, a couple of the boss fights suffer from both too little player communication, and too much stagnant AOE.\n\nBy player communication, I mean animation and environment cues to the player. For example, when a boss in dark souls might hold up a sword for a second before swinging, letting the player know he/she needs to dodge. In a few of the fights these cues seem too short to reliably get out of the way, or don't give enough directional information to understand where to dodge.\n\nBy stagnant AOE I mean that sections of the combat space are made too dangerous to stay in, with effects lasting longer than they should. Since spaces of the map are made dangerous, sometimes even with proper player response to animation cues it becomes impossible to dodge an attack.\n\nIn conclusion, better tutorialization of mechanics would have drastically effected playabillity, while certain combat mechanics could have been implemented better.  I feel for example, that cooldown timers may have been a better idea than limited uses of powers, as after you use all your powers in a fight, it becomes nearly impossible to complete.  This would also have allowed stricter control of fight pacing.  Lastly, a "Restart" option in the menu would have been a godsend, as after taking too much damage, or running out of power uses, I'd end up just having to wait for the Jotun to kill me, which hurt the pacing.\n\n////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nSome really stupid design choices mar an otherwise nice game.  There's only two main parts of Jotun.  The art/aesthetic and the combat/user mechanics.  The art and aesthetic are beautiful, and the game is well voice acted.  The combat mechanics would have been okay in 2001.  The hit detection of a lot of the ranged weapons is just atrocious, the combat roll feels slow and clunky, as does combat in general.\n\nThe only *real* combat in the game is the boss fights against the Jotun, and while some of the fights feel alright, 3/6 do not. This is partially due to the way they implemented the god powers, and the power attack with the axe.  The power attack takes eons to wind up, leaving you open to whatever attack the boss might use, so you can only reliably use it during a boss's cooldown window.  Which happens to be very short.  God help you if any environmental effects interupt you.  This in itself wouldn't be the worst, except that the most reliable damage in the game (thor's god power) only affects your power attack.\n\nI won't say too much about the last boss fight so I won't spoil it, but it's the biggest ♥♥♥♥ing mess of the entire game.  This is where that shoddy hit detection comes in, along with a mid boggling decision to allow certain projectiles to fly around forever, or until they hit you.  You can't use your defence power against them, because they interupt you even if they deal no damage, and you have so few casts off your other damage mitigating ability that it barely helps you.  So instead, these projectiles just follow you around until they inevitably strike you because of the shoddy dodge roll.\n\n4/10.\n\n////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////","January 30","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

The structure of the game is that you go to different levels to collect a Rune within it, where once you obtain these Runes you can unlock a door that leads to a large boss character called the Jotun where in defeating all five Jotun can you finally impress the Gods.\n\nThe game is wonderfully presented with hand drawn sprites and a great art style with the focus on a large sense of scale. In every level or so the camera will zoom out to showcase some very large thing to make you seem like the incredibly tiny viking warrior you are. Similarly, all the 'Jotun' are gigantic creatures which set up fun David and Goliath boss fights. The only real drawback of this is that sometimes it's too easy to not see where your tiny ♥♥♥ character amidst all the other ♥♥♥♥ on screen, leading to some "Where the ♥♥♥♥ am I?" happenstances.\n\nOn the whole, the gameplay is good. Thora has a quick weak attack and a strong attack that must be charged. She has a roll to dodge incoming attacks which can be used to cancel her weak and strong attacks and which has enough recovery that it isn't too good of a move. Outside of that, you get 5 Blessings from the Gods which are magic attacks that run on finite uses for each versus a magic bar system. Each Blessing ranges from a speed/power buff, a trident attack to a heal. You need to find these blessings within the levels, and sometimes they are find/hard to get to, despite being on the map.\n\nLevels are designed well. Levels can range from big open spaces to tight structured areas and they usually have their own gimmick, from a large open icy lake where a large sea serpent erupts from beneath to attack you, to an area of clouds which has you strike crystals to create lightning constellations to continue your progress.\n\nOverall, its a good game. It's 6 hour run time makes it not overstay it's welcome. There are some dumb things such as not being able to see where you are on the pause screen's map. The only way to extend your life is to find Ithunn's apples in the levels but they are not marked on the map and are usually hidden in obtuse areas, which can be frustrating for some levels. Beyond that however, at 15 bucks it is worth checking out if you're interested, at least on a sale.\n","January 10","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After the first crash i started it up again and it was perfect. The camera going out puts the game in a really (possibly original) perspective, because the bosses are so huge you feel taken back and really quite scared when you encounter something so large. I also love how you can actually choose in which order to do the stages, but the game tries to tell you which boss to fight next, you don't have to (expect the first boss). There are a total of 15 stages ( including the bosses as seperate stages). This game isn't that long if you try to steam roll each boss.

I like the theme, I like the graphics, but to me it was not much fun.\n\nThe game is divided in five areas, one per each giant, plus one final boss battle. There is one exploration level per area, another one with more action and a fairly short boss battle. It is the boss battles where I had most trouble with. Bosses tend to move great distances, and then stay static so that you can catch up. And that is because your character, Thora, moves relatively slow, and attacks slower than that. Battles for a mediocre player like me end up as being a lot of movement, and not too many attacks. I get confused selecting one of the seven powers and using them (select through two buttons, use with another one), so I ended up not using them efficiently. Because of all that, the boss battles drag longer than expected, thus making me frustrated whenever I fail to impress the gods.\n\nI did not like the fact that after the first area, you are given free access to the other four ones. There is one, the fire giant, that is supposed to be harder than the rest, as the developer stated in the forums. It becomes easier to beat whenever you can spam enough powers. And to add to the odd feeling about the game, this giant falls over abruptly after an unknown number of hits and can push you into molten rock, into a cheap unnecesary death.\n\nAnd those are the small things that pile up into this non recommendation.\n\nHowever, I need to give Kudos to the developers from being active in the forums!","February 4","false","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"

I wish Thora was faster.I guess it balances out because the giants are so easy to hit. I would have rather had a faster character and harder/more hectic fights even if it broke the narrative a little. The boss fights were ok. All of them felt easy except for the last boss.  I felt like fights were lost because of Thora's skillset instead of powerful and frustrating boss skills. The final boss  broke that trend by feeling frustrating, taking a while to figure out, and then finallly defeating it.

You play as Thora, a viking warrior who has died in a shipwreck and is trying to earn her place in Valhalla. There are a few levels and at the end of each one a Boss. Defeat all  the bosses and you face the Final Boss. However, what makes it stand out is the partly the intense boss fights but mostly the world and use of Norse mythology. In my opinion the creators have translated the mythological places, events, and characters very skillfully to the game. It'll keep you busy for a few hours but don't expect to be hooked for days, my playthrough cost me about 5 hours. (including deaths) I'd like to suggest playing this game with a gamepad, as it captures the movements best. Graphics wise this game is a bit...special. It's beautiful, but in it's own "fantasy" way. Then again it is hand drawn.\n\nOne thing that bothered me is the lack of options or key bindings. Furthermore, don't mess with the sound levels. Although the music and effects are just fine, turning them up will result in a LOT of static noise.\n\nJotun is an interesting game to pass some time. Especially if you're into Norse mythology. It can be tricky but the reward of completing it makes it all worth in the end.","October 13, 2015","true","5.4"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

Not only are the levels a tutorial for the amazing boss fights to follow, giving it a 'Shadow of the Colossus' feel, but the levels themselves are amazing to look at and a true delight to play. This game is worth recommending and playing to the end, even with incredibly difficult yet rewarding boss fights. I will say that after hours of trying to beat the final boss, the feeling of triumph is not like that of any other boss fight I've ever experienced.

The structure of the game is that you go to different levels to collect a Rune within it, where once you obtain these Runes you can unlock a door that leads to a large boss character called the Jotun where in defeating all five Jotun can you finally impress the Gods.\n\nThe game is wonderfully presented with hand drawn sprites and a great art style with the focus on a large sense of scale. In every level or so the camera will zoom out to showcase some very large thing to make you seem like the incredibly tiny viking warrior you are. Similarly, all the 'Jotun' are gigantic creatures which set up fun David and Goliath boss fights. The only real drawback of this is that sometimes it's too easy to not see where your tiny ♥♥♥ character amidst all the other ♥♥♥♥ on screen, leading to some "Where the ♥♥♥♥ am I?" happenstances.\n\nOn the whole, the gameplay is good. Thora has a quick weak attack and a strong attack that must be charged. She has a roll to dodge incoming attacks which can be used to cancel her weak and strong attacks and which has enough recovery that it isn't too good of a move. Outside of that, you get 5 Blessings from the Gods which are magic attacks that run on finite uses for each versus a magic bar system. Each Blessing ranges from a speed/power buff, a trident attack to a heal. You need to find these blessings within the levels, and sometimes they are find/hard to get to, despite being on the map.\n\nLevels are designed well. Levels can range from big open spaces to tight structured areas and they usually have their own gimmick, from a large open icy lake where a large sea serpent erupts from beneath to attack you, to an area of clouds which has you strike crystals to create lightning constellations to continue your progress.\n\nOverall, its a good game. It's 6 hour run time makes it not overstay it's welcome. There are some dumb things such as not being able to see where you are on the pause screen's map. The only way to extend your life is to find Ithunn's apples in the levels but they are not marked on the map and are usually hidden in obtuse areas, which can be frustrating for some levels. Beyond that however, at 15 bucks it is worth checking out if you're interested, at least on a sale.\n","January 10","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

To those self aggrandizing cultural stalwarts who are - I present to you Jotun, the latest in an exponentially increasing list of beautifully crafted indie darlings that strengthen the art argument just about monthly.\nJotun's story is that of our heroine, a viking woman named Thora, who's life ends unceremoniously in a storm. Unable to ascend unto the halls of Valhalla, Thora must garner the reverence of the Norse gods to secure her rightful place in Asgard, all the while revealing the story of her life in pieces along the way. Thora's life is fraught with Shakespearean tragedy, told in a fashion which is somehow both autobiographical and eulogistic. Developer Thunder Lotus Games out of Montreal couples this with a hauningly minimalist landscape and score, and has created a deeply moving experience.\nThe gameplay of Jotun is deceptively simple. There are no enemies besides the bosses which the player only encounters by gathering the necessary runes from their respective area. Exploring these areas was an incredibly joyous experience for a very unique reason; the area maps are purposefully vague and do not show your location. The game remedies this in very realistic ways like zooming the camera out when you're on high ground, giving you a better lay of the land and forcing the player to navigate using a form of dead reckoning. Not all will find this as endearing as I did, but I found it added a layer of realism and difficulty to getting around and, at the very least, gives you a much better appreciation of the level design. Boss battles are the classic "notice a pattern and counter accordingly, using the abilities you've acquired thus far" but, in practice, are not so patronizingly easy and in fact can be quite the opposite.\nJotun is everything from beautiful to terrifying to heartbreakingly tragic. The gameplay, art style, and score are resonant and powerful, and the difficulty and learning curve are just right, meaning Jotun feels something like the perfect mix of Dark Souls, Shadow of the Colossus, and Transistor. Jotun could benefit from a length increase, but then again, so could most artsy indie games, and even though I found it's unique take on navigation to be charming, there was a definite need for a mini map, as I found myself pressing start just about every 2 minutes to look at it. Jotun is a fun game that is presented well enough to make you feel feelings and think thoughts which, at the end of the day, is a definition of art. Don't expect Jotun to change the way video games are perceived tomorrow, but absolutely include it in the list of games that will change that perception in a few years.","October 1, 2015","true","7.6"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

Not only are the levels a tutorial for the amazing boss fights to follow, giving it a 'Shadow of the Colossus' feel, but the levels themselves are amazing to look at and a true delight to play. This game is worth recommending and playing to the end, even with incredibly difficult yet rewarding boss fights. I will say that after hours of trying to beat the final boss, the feeling of triumph is not like that of any other boss fight I've ever experienced.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/graveson/recommended/323580/","graveson","^2@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@","http://steamcommunity.com/id/graveson/","182 products in account","Jotun is a beautifully hand-drawn game which was funded through a very successful Kickstarter campaign. In Jotun, you must prove yourself to the Norse Gods by solving puzzles in notible mythological locations until some of them desire to challenge you themselves.\n\nExploration in Jotun is not action-packed, and is rather a little bit on the slower side. Thora (the female warrior you play as) moves at a somewhat slow pace, but in my experience, it greatly helped the atmospheric effect that each individual area provided by making me slow down and take in the sights. There are some incredibly impressive locations that you can see through the game's preview screenshot showcase that give you a slight glimpse into how beautifully drawn the game actually is.\n\nIn Jotun, ingame progression is based off finishing areas in a hub world. From the biginning of the game, you can choose your own path to go. Each corner has two levels and a boss. The boss door is locked and requires two Runes to open. Each of the two levels in a corner has its own individual Rune. After finding the two Runes in a corner, the God who oversees that location will allow you to challenge them and attempt to prove your worth.\n\nWith a few exceptions, the game revolves around mostly solving puzzles until you collect a specific area's Rune. While venturing through locations to find Runes, you may find hidden collectables. They come in the form of Golden Apples, which are permanent health increases, and God Spells, activated abilities that give you a temporary power up. Each level in a corner has one Golden Apple and one God Spell. It's possible to complete the game without finding any of these, but for someone such as myself who enjoys to find and do everything possible, it did make my experience quite a bit easier.\n\nWhen it comes to Jotun's bosses, I never felt a sense of "I'm just not powerful enough for this." The game itself when it comes to combat is reminiscent of a Souls game. You have a dodge roll, and bosses are more of an endurance run than a sprint. This means that you're having to dodge quite a few projectiles and telegraphed attacks that are only possible by dodge rolling. I did feel that in almost every situation that it wouldn't have been a bad decision to increase Thora's movement speed, but it mostly just comes down to feeling the game out and improving your own gameplay. It's a refreshing feeling compared to other adventure games.\n\nI would highly recommend this game to anyone who is interested in a somewhat slow paced adventure and puzzle solving game that has a Norse mythology setting. With an above average boss difficulty, and beautiful animation I found myself frequently blown away.","January 16","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's beautifully drawn and the soundtrack is incredible. I study Old Norse myth and legend, and it is clear to me that the developers did their homework when it comes to the myths and stories behind Jotun (I also acknowledge the fact that this is the developer's interpretation of the Eddas. I never expected it to be “accurate”. It is obvious that there is a lot of attention to detail to make the narrative work and make sense, which is a challenge with the “original” sources).\nThat being said, I found the gameplay slow paced and sometimes boring. Some of the levels are designed very cleverly, but others are just annoying. The storyline lacks depth and character development. It felt like throughout the entire game the same story was being told over and over again when different aspects of Thora’s life could have been explored.\nIn the end, however, I’d definitely recommend this game.

I like the theme, I like the graphics, but to me it was not much fun.\n\nThe game is divided in five areas, one per each giant, plus one final boss battle. There is one exploration level per area, another one with more action and a fairly short boss battle. It is the boss battles where I had most trouble with. Bosses tend to move great distances, and then stay static so that you can catch up. And that is because your character, Thora, moves relatively slow, and attacks slower than that. Battles for a mediocre player like me end up as being a lot of movement, and not too many attacks. I get confused selecting one of the seven powers and using them (select through two buttons, use with another one), so I ended up not using them efficiently. Because of all that, the boss battles drag longer than expected, thus making me frustrated whenever I fail to impress the gods.\n\nI did not like the fact that after the first area, you are given free access to the other four ones. There is one, the fire giant, that is supposed to be harder than the rest, as the developer stated in the forums. It becomes easier to beat whenever you can spam enough powers. And to add to the odd feeling about the game, this giant falls over abruptly after an unknown number of hits and can push you into molten rock, into a cheap unnecesary death.\n\nAnd those are the small things that pile up into this non recommendation.\n\nHowever, I need to give Kudos to the developers from being active in the forums!","February 4","false","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"

However the exploring does feel like a bit of a chore to get to the next boss which is supposed to be the fun parts of the game.\n\nThe boss fights however are very badly designed, at least some of them. The first two were very fun and challening and I loved them. The next two were a chore though and I still haven't finished the fourth one. The problem with this game is that it limits players controll to such a degree that you get utterly frustrated and it feels like part luck if do manage to evade the bosses attacks. Your movement are hindered, your view is limited and on top of that the attack telegraphing of the bosses are hiliarously bad at times. The whole thing turns into a boss fight that is hard not because it is hard but because its hard for you to see where you are supposed to go to evade the attacks.\n\nThe game really went above and beyond in bad design when the badly telegraphed attacks hindered your view and made it so if it did hit you it blinded you and made it thus unlikely that you could evade the the next attacks that were coming. I fought the third boss for half an hour, when I did defeat it I was not in the least happy because it felt like it was mostly luck. The fourth boss feels like it will leave the same bad aftertaste in my mouth if I do defeat it so at the moment I am not sure I will have the strength to go on and finish the game. I sorely hope the last boss is better designed but frankly I don't count on it.","January 14","false","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

It's beautifully drawn and the soundtrack is incredible. I study Old Norse myth and legend, and it is clear to me that the developers did their homework when it comes to the myths and stories behind Jotun (I also acknowledge the fact that this is the developer's interpretation of the Eddas. I never expected it to be “accurate”. It is obvious that there is a lot of attention to detail to make the narrative work and make sense, which is a challenge with the “original” sources).\nThat being said, I found the gameplay slow paced and sometimes boring. Some of the levels are designed very cleverly, but others are just annoying. The storyline lacks depth and character development. It felt like throughout the entire game the same story was being told over and over again when different aspects of Thora’s life could have been explored.\nIn the end, however, I’d definitely recommend this game.

I love how it teaches you the mechanics of the moss fights when you are exploring the zones before each of the bosses. The game is slow paced and I'm fine with that, though I know that some people will not like that. I think this game deserves a lot of credit for actually being an example of how a game can teach good problem solving as well as provide a good four hours of challenging and relaxing fun.","February 24","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is at its strongest when it centers on exploration and puzzle-solving, but its reliance on randomness added to the world's threats subtracts from the experience.\n\nThis game is beautifully designed, with every frame very clearly hand-drawn at a level I would expect from a golden age Disney cartoon.  For the main character, most of your enemies, and the scenery, this works phenomenally.  I did notice some choppiness to the animation in two of the bosses, but in all the style works to the game's credit.\n\nThis game starts off deceptively simple, but quickly ramps up the difficulty.  There is very little handholding involved, but they make sure you understand a mechanic before they will let you progress.  New powers are not given, they are earned through exploration, though admittedly the shrines that give them are fairly easy to find once you realize the pause menu has a map on it.  When you earn a power, there is no text that explains it, the game instead opts to demonstrate its use.\n\nThroughout the game, Thora will occasionally give a voice-over explaining an aspect of Norse mythology, or the story of her own life.  With the exception of one level, this is well-executed, not seeming overbearing and taking place while still giving you control, allowing you to progress as she speaks, if you wish.  I did feel that the swamp level overdid it, its puzzle being to make you traverse the level to reconstruct the creation myth, but this is a small gripe.\n\nThe game's biggest struggles lie in its mechanics.  The strong attack is nearly useless, save for puzzle solving.  By my observations, it does precisely the same damage as if you just hammered the light attack for the same span of time, with the added drawback of rendering you immobile for a rediculously long period of time, praying no one around you hits you and interupts the attack.  The isometric view makes for beautiful landscapes, but hit boxes, particularly for bosses, tend to vary wildly.  In one move, a boss' entire body will be a solid object, allowing Thora to hit him even if she swings for his head which should be far above her.  In another move on the same boss, Thora will have to walk under him, swinging at his ankles again.\n\nBy far what prompted the most swearing from me, however, was its random elements.  You may be getting your powers from the Norse gods, but you will spend most of the game praying to RNGesus.  Many of the environmental dangers run off of RNG, such as random lightning strikes in a cloud level, and the bosses seem to choose from their skill sets at random.  This tends to lead to the Dark Souls problem of repeatedly throwing oneself at a boss fight, praying they don't use the one move that wrecks your face quite so often this time.\n\nIn all, though, a very enjoyable game, and one I am happy to have bought and supported.","May 16","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you have any interest in Norse mythology I'd highly recommend it. It's a slow paced game about exploration and giant bosses. Almost like a 2-D hybrid of Shadow of the Colossus and the best bosses of a game like Dark Souls. Before you can take on one of the Jotun, you must first collect it's runes in some fairly well thought out levels with lots of nods to norse mythology. Add in a variety of god powers to be found and life extending apples of Ithunn, you have yourself a scenic jaunt through Yggdrasil and the Nine Worlds. Highly, highly recommend.

Total playtime, not including breaks between sittings, was around 4.5hrs at a leisurely pace. I got pretty close to finding 100% of the stuff, too. It was mostly enjoyable and had some very memorable moments, but some parts felt more like tedious 'filler' and it's all over too quickly.\n\nOn sale?  Hell Freaking Yes. Yes Yes get it now!\nOtherwise, probably not.\n\nCons:\n- It's not a long game.\n- Offers little to no replay value.\n- Exploration/Puzzles and combat are deliberately slow and ponderous - for some, an acquired taste.\n\nPros:\n- Bossfights are ♥♥♥♥ing epic - grandiose in scale & seriously heartpounding challenges.\n- Hand-drawn Art direction is second to none especially considering it's a low budget indie.\n- Character animation, FX, Music and visual setpieces are jawdropping.\n- Story is refreshingly oldschool traditional mythology :)\n- KAUNAN OWNS YOU.\n\nSo yeah - if it's cheap and you're a fan of intense bossfights, Norse Mythology or Shadow of the Colossus get this game and enjoy it for a few hrs - it's awesome.. :)\n\nAt the regular price it's hard to say whether or not you'll get value for money - I would almost certainly recommend Hyper Light Drifter instead - it's a similar game, with *way* more bang-for-buck!!!","May 14","false","11.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There exist independently gamey elements, but they seem to have been chosen and work perfectly for just exactly what they're chosen to do.\n\nThe visuals are clean and emotive with camera panning conveying strong vistas and a sense of scope while the main character's animation feels smooth and just the right amount of visually off to place her as outsider on this ethereal plane of beings.\n\nSound design is epically rumbly and deep, establishing weight and import to the right objects and events.\n\nThe game pacing works right along with that visual scope. It is plodding and deliberate. You feel small and alone against enormous beings. Your motions and attacks feel slow but powerful; that is your connection to this place.\nHuge sections of world are effectively empty - Punctuated by the appearance of powerful forces and rare monstrous beings. (For real, one third or less of the levels have any actual enemies to fight besides bosses.)\n\nI could probably start running in circles describing how one elements leads into or support the other, but it should be clear by now that this was a fun, engaging experience with Norse myths. If you want to spend a few hours living the legends, jump in.\n\nThe possible cons that some gamers should consider:\n1. Short (Think twice if you're the bro always asking for X hours out of each gaming dollar spent.)\n2. Easy (I think all the exploration and combat fits perfectly to tell the story and theme, but the slow, deliberate fights are mechanically trivial.)","May 31","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Because her death wasn't honourable she has to prove herself to the gods by defeating the Jotun in combat.\n\nThe game's art style and sound design are both fantastic and do wonders for setting a tone in the world as well as the various Jotun fights. The combat is slow and feels very deliberate when executed. This makes fighting the giant Jotun feel like it has a better sense of scale. You feel as if you are this tiny person fighting this formidable giant who is much stronger than you.\n\nThe thing I liked the best about Jotun is that it teaches you almost all of the mechanics required for the bosses organically in the exploration phases prior to the actual boss fights. You are given an environment to learn and practice in, so when you eventually get to the Jotun there are no surprises. I say almost because there is a mechanic in one fight that isn't introduced prior to said fight. Not sure if I missed something, but that aisde Jotun does an excellent job of introducing and teaching the player through playing the game.\n\nJotun is a beautiful game that is mechanically sound and prefers to teach it's players through it's design. I think it is a fantastic game and if anything I've said here has you interested I would recommend picking it up.","June 1","true","11.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
