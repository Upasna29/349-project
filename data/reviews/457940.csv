I was appalled and rightfully outraged at the unmitigated gall these two “Developers” had shown in attempting to rip us off in such a fashion. This type of thing, while not illegal, certainly should be as it is about as anti-consumer and duplicitous as you can get.\nTo my surprise, I found out that this wasn’t even the first time Digital Homicide had done this. No, their shameless disregard for anything but their own pocket-books is shown here with Krog Wars, an space based game that is a clear redux of the old Atari Game “Alien Invaders” I was about to pass it off as harmless and I was actually going to be somewhat neutral on the game as I reviewed it. It most definitely wasn’t worth the $4 they are currently charging on steam, but once it dropped to $99 I though it might actually be worth that price. Until I noticed some striking similarities… and then some more… until I finally realized this was a reskinned “Wyatt Derp” And looking at the game mechanics and the Storefront within the games, I realized it was the same bloody game. I will actually bring up the storefront menus for both games so you can see them now. Also take a look at these games and what they do and try to tell me they’re NOT the same bloody game."\n\nSee my full critique here:\nhttps://youtu.be/3h532IZSEQA","April 19","false","0.2"," 44 of 45 people (98%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","98","44","45","3","3"

The exploit is still present, and really should be fixed, as well as the 3D/2D switching bug between successive playthroughs. The controls need tighenerd considerably, amongst a laundry list of other problems.\n\nThe pre-release review of the game that was made yesterday stands.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_CCsNv9NUM\n\nThe material for Krog Wars starts about half an hour in.\n\nAlso note that the General Discussions forum has been hidden unless you already own the game, after which point it's entirely too late for the pre-release review (which was moved there) to be of any use to you. This is an even more underhanded attempt at censorship than they've engaged in previously. If you've bought this game, I recommend you return it immediately.\n\nIf they fix the bugs and address the other issues exposed in the video, it might be okay-ish. Nothing special or spectacular, but at least okay. As it is now it's a snarled mess, representative of the name Digital Homicide has made for themselves over the last couple of years. Avoid like the plague.","April 12","false","0.2"," 51 of 60 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","51","60","0","2"

If you don't believe me, just look at their two most recent Greenlight submissions which are nearly identical.\n\nEDIT: Before I received my refund I tried pressing every key on my keyboard and found out that Tab switches 2D/3D perspective (and is absolutely nauseating) and that Space fires your missiles.","April 12","false","0.1"," 36 of 38 people (95%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","95","36","38","4","0"

Not much so it will be really short.\nThis is you another space shooter in old Space Invaders fashion. I'm sure you do remember or heard about this game released in mid 80s . Then tons of them got released over the years and here you got another one. Only that we have now 2016 not 1985 and you have tons of games like this available for free in your browser and some of them are made really good. And this one is NOT. This is extremely poor game with close to none differences between stages, garbage graphics, lazy music, sluggish and awkward controls.\nIn few words : This is yet another crappy game made with UNITY engine (hearing this already suppose to make you not buying the game) by company that is still making tons of garbage just to make few bucks here and there selling it in bundles, making few bucks on cards and so on. Game without any real value.

Problems which I never thought could be in this sort of game is in it.\n\nYou just shoot enemies in a 2D/3D environment which you can adjust at will but it takes you a while to figure out which key actually does this because the game doesn't show any sort of instructions of what you need to do.\n\nLike I said before, all of the problems that me and Kage covered in the live stream, are still present in the final version. The controls are bad no matter whether you play in the 2D or 3D mode. In the 2D mode, the controls are slippery and when you’re in the 3D mode, the controls seem restricted.The pause menu glitch that I showed in the live stream, is again still present and this was a near game breaking glitch. They still give off the idea that they made this game in a small resolution because I play on 1920x1080 screen and half of my screen was restricted on each side, only covered up by a jpeg google image of space. The enemy ships just seemed to be magnetised to the front of your ship as it just follows you and they only come one at a time. The pause menu doesn’t pause a game during boss fights either. The pause menu works on all the stages except for the boss,it pauses the ordinary enemies but doesn’t pause the boss itself. Also if you’re playing in 3D mode and try to pause the game during a boss fight, the pause menu glitches and the pause menu goes above action, blocking off nearly any view you have of the enemies. The reason for this is because the game still thinks it’s running in the 2D mode and Digital Homicide didn’t make a pause menu that was compatible with the 3D mode so they just made you switch back to 2D mode in order to pause the game and it still doesn’t fully pause because the spaceships and bosses still shoot.\n\nPlease Digital Homicide, actually listen to me now because you ignored us on the stream, please take your time, if you make a good game and take your time with it, people will enjoy i more and send less hate your way. Take your time.\n\nMy curator group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/MellowReviews","April 13","false","0.4"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","17","21","0","0"

If I was in charge of Greenlight then a Digital Homicide game would NEVER get a game Greenlit again. All Digital Homicide does is spam sh**** games onto Steam and tries to make money off of these sh**** games. It's completly and utterly ridiculous and the the Steam community would like Digital Homicide to f*** right off. This game is terrible and Digital Homicide is an absolutely terrible company that Valve needs to ban from Greenlight so we can finally get some peace and quiet on Steam.\n\nOnto the game. It's Space Invaders except it's much easier than Space Invaders which makes it incredibly boring. The game has no substance to it and it's just shoot shoot shoot until you feel your brain cells pop. This game is so boring that I played for only 4 minutes until I was just too bored to play any further. On top of being boring the game is also an asset flip and a fairly obvious one. You can tell that DigiHom did not make any of the sprites and the programming looks poorly done. Of course DigiHom has already had terrible programming with their games.\n\nDigital Homicide needs to stop making games because they really suck at it and I will obviously be requesting a refund due to how terrible this game is. If DigiHom wants to be successful in the video game industry then they could start by not being the most hated video game company of all time and actually make a game that's worth playing. Digital Homicide sucks and all their games suck.\n\n"Digital Homicide proudly presents" is the first text you see on screen. There's absolutely nothing in this game to feel proud of. In fact, Digital Homicide should feel ashamed that they made something so terrible.

Digital Homicide Studios' new masterpiece (of cra*p)!\n\nAfter failing at ripping off the most important genres in the video game industy such as platformers, dungeon crawlers, first person shooter, pac man style arcade games and more, Digital Homicide goes even further by ripping off Space Invaders and Galaxian, two games that defined the shoot'em up genre in the late 70's.\n\nKrog Wars may look a little "appealing" during the first 5 minutes of gameplay but beyond that it gets boring really fast. The "journey" consist of nothing but three waves : regular wave, bonus round and boss round. Once you kill the boss you just repeat the same thing over and over until you die with little to no variety.\n\nAside from gameplay, you can see in my video how unoptimized the game is. During my 5 minutes playthrough I experienced some freezes during wave transition as well as framerate drops when killing "too much" enemies.\n\nWhile this may be not be the worst game in Digital Homicide's curriculum, it is surely a good contenter for Worst Greenlight Game of the Year.

Being the overachiever i was, i reskinned the game and made horrible design choces to change up the game.\nWhy do i bring this up? because Krog Wars is 10 year old JDude\'s \"masterpiece\", made in unity. Enemies that home in without any sort of pattern? check. Bullets offset from thier creation, making them look as if they appear at random? bingo. Complete looping with no changes, besides a few extra minigames in between. Bravo.\nDH/10\n(not even a 0/10 would describe how simultaneously lazy and boring this game is)","June 1","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
