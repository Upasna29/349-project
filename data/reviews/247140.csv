The editor is mainly the reason why this game got so much replayability. Would I have put currently nearing 400 hours in it if it wasn't for the editor? no I wouldn't.\n\nI can't stop you from reading the negative reviews, however, I think most of them don't say correct things, so keep that in mind. You like editors? You like difficult games? You like relaxing games? with the editor and custom levels, there's bound to be stuff for you, lots of it. You can literally use any music you like, not even copyrights can stop you there.\nI guess the only real question would be whether you like rhythm games and bullet hells in general.\nFor most people, I think this would be a game you could easily get into, so why not give it a shot? perhaps this is the game you've been looking for that you can just put tons of hours into.\n\nThe game is also a bit broken, sure, that's not enough to make me not enjoy the game, but it is really annoying when they do happen. There's lots of bugs, and it feels like Bean, the developer just doesn't care anymore. On top of that, the game doesn't have the best performance, this is because the game is made in flash. While you won't really notice the lag if you're just playing normally, if you have a bad PC, or get into making really big levels however, you will notice that.\nAnd please, do NOT use 60 FPS mode.\n\nOh right, make sure to fully ignore autogen. if autogen is what you're buying the game for, and many have done this, bad choice. (edit: it's so bad because it does not sync correctly to the song at all, it just pays attention to how loud it is)\n\nI'd give it a 9 or 9.5/10, overall it's fun, editor adds replayability, but bugs and bad performance make it less good.","September 7, 2015","true","382.6"," 55 of 61 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","55","61","3","9"

A music-based bullet hell that scores you based on how perfect you can avoid sound.\n\nThe main objective, as aforementioned, is to be perfect at avoiding sound--bullets that spawn into the playing field and follow a particular rhythm and beat of the track. There are four different bullets: linears, bubbles, homers, and hearts. In game, the hearts unlock a new track that can be played as well if you seek to unlock special achievements.\n\nSoundodger+ includes user levels, an editor, and auto-gen mode (creates a randomized level with whatever song selected). By default, there are six premade stages, five that, like the advanced stages, have the heart bullet that can help unlock the same bonus tracks.\n\nMy opinions of it all:\nThe Good\nI'm finding myself enjoying the editor a lot, using my favorite songs to craft nice and partially fancy levels. And after achieving perfection with the standard songs, unlocking the advanced stages as well as a couple heart stages, I'm in a constant liking of this game. A nice time-killing on a boring day. I have yet to officially unlock all hearts and getting 100% score on more advanced and premade user levels.\n\nThe Bad\nPart of me wish there were at least another mode to this game, possibly an alternative, where the game rates how well you can collect specific bullets. Auto-gen, too, isn't very good in creating stages either, but there must be a way they're done. I don't know what more to put here...\n\nOverall\nSoundodger is a pretty amazing game with all it already has. Plus, this game is accompanied with a worthwhile soundtrack that I fell in love with the more I kept playing those particular stages. Hopefully, I'll share some of my created stages with the public later on...\n\n--Sir Hermes (the Samurai).","July 8, 2014","true","600.1"," 27 of 28 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","27","28","0","0"

It combines the best aspects of bullet-hell type games with a great soundtrack and hyper-clean visuals that are absolutely stunning on high resolutions. Not only that, but it has a built-in level editor allowing users to download and make their own patterns to music. It also has the ability to auto-generate to songs, but it's not as good as other games in the genre like Symphony.\n\nThat said, I would highly recommend this game to people who are fans of bullet-hell, music games or both.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/middlethought/recommended/247140/","middlethought","middlethought","http://steamcommunity.com/id/middlethought/","253 products in account","The sequel to the semi-popular flash game Soundodger on Adult Swim Games, Soundodger+ offers much more in terms of difficulty and replayability.\nIf you haven't already, check out the original on Adult Swim, here (it has half of the levels, and the same gameplay): http://games.adultswim.com/soundodger-puzzle-online-game.html\n\nThough it may be easy to jump right to the level editor or auto-gen mode, Soundodger+ is mostly about its single-player experience. There are many edge-of-your-seat moments where focus and concentration are key. This may not be apparent from the first few levels or trailer; the game starts off slow, easing you into the later levels with simplified versions of the patterns; it feels a little too slow moving in, and you need to beat ~10 of these levels before the advanced levels can be played. This is my only real gripe though; the level of polish and love put into the later levels is evident in spades. (Look for advanced levels indicated by a black background.)\n\nThe quality of music is also exceptional. If you peruse the Indie section of Steam often, there's a good chance that you'll recognize some of the artists; Disasterpeace, Sonic (also known as Jasper Byrne, who did all of Lone Survivor [music too]), Austin Wintory, Danny Baranowsky, Lifeformed, and Bill Kiley. That's not to say that the others not mentioned are bad; far from it. You may recognize Ghost Kollective, but other names such as Mike Forst, D. WIGHT, Anoctave and Bean proved to be exceptional with the tracks they provided.\n\nNext, the editor. Soundodger+ has plenty of very interesting mechanics; you can slow down and invert time, fill the screen with bullets, and control the movement of the outside "enemies." All of this can be accessed and used in the editor. Though initially appearing dense and convoluted, the editor makes a ton more sense after viewing the available online tutorials, and it can be a blast not only to play finished levels, but also to watch said levels as well. Be warned, Soundodger+ only accepts tracks encoded at 44.1 kHz; I ran into the problem of not being able to use some tracks I wanted to because of this.\n\nFinally, the Auto-Gen mode. I put this at the bottom because it's easily the weakest part of Soundodger+. Levels are typically created on a scale of how loud the music is, similar to Audiosurf. If you don't have loud tracks, you'll end up with a level that's too easy, on the scale of the early campaign levels. The levels generated often don't make sense either; the game creates a pattern only when there's a spike in the noise, causing bullets to fire off at seemingly random times. And again, the Auto-Gen mode only works for songs encoded at 44.1 kHz, same as the editor.\n\nTL;DR: Soundodger+ is highly recommended, especially if you're looking for something in the vein of Bit.Trip, Audiosurf, Sound Shapes or 140. Do not buy for the auto-gen; rather, buy for the single player experience.","December 19, 2013","true","897.2"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","1"

It is a game that I consider useful beyond itself. The way those patterns are designed, it's like training for how to deal with obstacles in life. Knowing when to flow and when to go against the flow, recognizing patterns, and not allowing yourself to be distracted and misled by some patterns. Especially this aspect made me smile more than once, when I noticed how the patterns were trying to throw me off balance.\nAll this, combined with the music for motivating and appealing even more to the right brain hemi, makes this game a lot more fun to me than for example Super Hexagon, which seems to be all about memorizing and twitch reflexes, while Soundodger is quite the opposite, while also reserving some exceptions from that rule.\nSuper Hexagon feels like punishment. Soundodger feels like learning, growing.\n\n(Just to be on the safe side though: I wrote this review before trying the high difficulties.)","March 17, 2015","true","1.9"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

And how there is these cool effects like the bullets reverses with the wubs and so on. This game is just brilliant and fantastic.\n\nI just had a blast while I was playing through the basic levels. I just loved how the bullets came out of the enemies then there is for example drum sound or just how beautiful it looks then bullets streams out of a enemy then a violin plays. It all just connects so well with the music.\n\nSome levels are just designed not to be challanging at all. Some levels are just designed to be that you stand in the middle and just look at the beautiful bullet patterns that just goes by the circle that you are playing as. It's just so clever and awesome. There is even a level where you only have to stand still and don't move your mouse at all!\n\nAnd after you played through the basic levels you will then unlock the "advanced levels" and those levels are hard as ♥♥♥♥. And you will spend about 50-60 hours just trying 100% these levels. Or you will just quit playing this game at that point... :p\n\nAt the time I publish this review, I have 100% this game. And it took me exactly 100 hours to do it. But it was all worth it.

Slow down and half speed modes make those nasty spots a little easier, but only just a little.  Though things slow down, the bullet keep appearing, so there is more stuff on the screen to avoid.  Use it sparingly, as the game itself recommends.  This game plays with the turntable aspect nicely too, even making the pieces move backward when the music slows and starts reversing.  Watch out :)\n\nAnother nice feature is that though you have to unlock newer levels, it doesn't make it difficult to do so.  Getting scores in the 80%+ range on each level locks another level or two.  Getting 80% is actually pretty easy to do, even if you get hit one or two times.  But, you'll probably want to replay most levels until you get the 100%.  Also, complete level editor - make your own, with your own music.\n\nControls? Pick your poison:  WASD, mouse and game controller all supported.\n\nIf you like bullet hell games, mixed with a variety of music (mostly trance/dance/chiptunes/etc), this is well worth buying.

The games that get you immersed in the music and entwined with the beat. I could never get into audiosurf because the obstacles were on the beat, which meant you had to move out of time with the music - for me this breaks the definition of rhythm game.\n\nAnd I love bullet hell; played Perfect Cherry Blossom to death (which incidentally, had great music). So how does Soundodger+ stack up?\n\nWell, the bullet hell falls short at times. In a traditional shooter you have to focus on (a) dodging and (b) being in the right position to shoot your enemy(s). Here there's no shooting, just dodging -- which I have no problem with in theory, but in practice I found some levels had large periods of time where no bullets would come my way. I had a safe spot and with no other pressure to reposition I just sat still - which didn't make for very engaging gameplay. Other levels were better, including homing missiles to keep me on my toes.\n\nHow about the rhythm? Well, there's two things that absolutely kill the rhythm of whatever song is playing. The first is the slow motion ability which you invoke via the left mouse button. This slows down the music aswell of course, and for me the effect simply doesn't work. The second occurs whenever you get hit - everything speeds up for a short time which has a hugely jarring effect on the music. I'm not suggesting death should be fun, but in a rhythm game the music makes the game, and if you kill my enjoyment of the music you kill my enjoyment of the game. Fortunately you can simply avoid activating slow motion, and there's an option ("Easy listening") to disable the speedup when you get hit. So while I don't think these are worthwhile features, I don't hold them against the game as a whole.\n\nSoundodger does a pretty good job of matching the song's energy, both in pre-made levels and the auto-generated mode (when you plug your own music in). But it suffers from the same issue I had with audiosurf - it doesn't encourage me to move with the beat, or draw me into the music.

To start with, I already love music/rythm/bullet hell games and with the option to add your own music, I know it's going to be superb. This game did it and it did it well, but with a few minor things that didn't work so good. One of those things is the audio quality after the level generation, I hear the quality go down about 30%. You can fix this by lowering the in-game music by ~50% and boosting your main volume a bit. Also the hit box isn't as good as it is in, for example Touhou.\n\nI love the fact that I can just lay on my couch, put on my headphones and relax with some smooth jazz, or liquid dnb. I will surely play this game for many hours. I recommend this game to anyone who likes the Touhou series and bullet hell games.\n\nI give this game a solid 9/10 for the relaxing theme that it has and then again, the crazy bullet hell aspect which just adds up to the experience. It is surely worth the 4€ I paid. Sorry for my grammar and have a good one!\n\n-MiracLe","October 18, 2014","true","1.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

A minimalistic stage design combined with bright and contrasting colours allows the player to see every bullet and distinugish it from your "ship" with ease. I found the game suprisingly hard at first , compared to other similar games such as Beat Hazard, but soon got addicted to the challenging gameplay and lovely contrasting colours,and as the stage fires waves of bullets upon you, based upon the tempo, bpm and other characteristics of the song, you have to try and dodge them, and with each hit taken it fastforwards the song. However, on left click you have a 'time-slow' button that allows the player to slow the song down while retaining full movement, but at the cost of not having a multiplier bonus carry through the slow, in order to make the game a bit easier.

If you collide (and the collision is very generous in the player's favour), the current enemies go zooming off as the music fast forwards, and you lose score. To get yourself out of danger, you can press a key to temporarily slow down music to give breathing space to dodge.\n\nRepeat until the music ends.\n\nIt is utterly wonderful.

I usually do not suffer from motion sickness in video games.  But the stark contrast of dark colors rotating rapidly, back and forth, on a white background was enough to make even my eyes and stomach cry mercy after little more than half an hour of play.  If you do suffer from motion sickness easily, than this is simply not the game for you.\n\nHowever, if you aren't subject to that, or play the game in small doses, then this is a pretty fun musical avoidance game.  Not unique, but well put together.  The music choices are solid.  It's easier with a mouse, but there's option to use a controller as well if you have one.  There's plenty of songs to unlock, and simply playing through a song once unlocks "Zen mode" where you can basically just have the song play through and not worry about being hit.\n\nOne other part that can be annoying for some: The game likes to mess with timing.  The things you're trying to dodge can slow down, or speed up, or even reverse, depending on the music.  This does make things more challenging.  It's somewhat frustrating, because an integral part of dodging is  being able to time things.  On the other hand, it does make for a bit more uniqueness in the game, and makes it just a little more challenging in those moments.\n\nPick the game up when it's on sale, but grab the soundtrack too - though it only has about half the songs.","April 21, 2015","true","1.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The first thing I noticed was a lack of tutorial sucking up my time when I loaded the game.  The second thing I noticed was I could not get enough of the music!!!  These two things together lead me down several of hours just rocking out in my computer chair!!  I was super stoked about this game because I dropped the extra buck during the Steam Summer Sale 2014 to get myself the sound track.  At first I thought was a colossal waste of time most built in tracks turn out to be but- srsly you guys- THE MUSIC IS GREAT.\n\nYou have a small circle you run around avoid objects like spikes, balls, and missiles that are generated from your music.  The game even has features to rewind tracks, speed time up, slow time down, pause time ect according to your music!  (Think dubstep with the WHAAA WHAAA WHAAA and the record spins.  The game will spin faster and shoot more out or either retract them backwards before spewing them back out).  The art is minimal yet stylish too.  Clear, crisp lines make it easy to distinguish where the safe white zones are without too much eye strain.\n\nI love it.

The levels in this game all feel natural and everything that fires at you fires at the right time. Think of Beat Hazard but with actual structure to it. Nothing about this game feels out of place and everything flows naturally.\n\nThe level editor, coupled with the tutorials from the developer himself, are very simple to grasp and use. And with the community making so many pretty good levels, there's plenty of content that this game provides. The auto-generated levels are not so good, as it's not even close to being as deep as the core levels are, basing more on the loudness of the track over any indtrumentation going on.\n\nAnd of course, the soundtrack is great too! It has songs that I've had on since I bought the game and listen to regurlarly. The songs fit the game perfectly with their instrumentation and melodies and provide an amazing look when paired with the visuals.\n\nIn my short time with this game, I've had tons of fun with it.

First of all it claims that it's a Music game. Yeah it is... kinda.\nThe layouts of the levels are made as if you are playing against the song but the gameplay needs no understanding of the rythm or listening when you have to do something. You just dodge what the song is throwing at you. Every tone is one "bullet" that tries to hit you. And this is really well done. You feel like the song is your enemy. BUT the game should actually be called Soundpatternlearner+. The first levels are really fun and you feel like you need skill to beat the song. But when the game starts throwing hundreds of "bullets" at you there is no way that you dodge a wave at the first try. It's just learning patterns and trial and error. Or maybe I just suck at reacting :D. BUT the presentation of the game is brilliant. The visuals look so simple but they are pleasing to the eyes like the style of an Edmund McMillen(IndieGod :D). And the music is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing. If you like electronic music this is your heaven. Chiptune, House, Dupstep this game has everything you're looking for in the sound department.\nSo the conlusion is:\nPresentation: yes\nGameplay: No\nOh yeah this game also has an auto-gen mode where the game genarates a level to a mp3 file you give it, which is awesome.\nJust buy it because of the music it's worth it :DDD\n6.5/10","March 27, 2014","true","3.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Connor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/johnisbaby/","111 products in account","This game was put together very well. Not only is the concept of the game of notes and music very good but the creativity was even better. For those of you who have played rock band or guitar hero, this game is very similar. Except for the fact that instead of hitting the notes you're trying to avoid them and instead of the notes coming in a straight line they come from circles that circle you. I definetly recommend that you get this game right now its only $3.99 or $4.99 for DLC, that will end on December 3rd, in which case it will go back to its original price, so get it while its on sale.","November 30, 2013","true","0.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zaceory/recommended/247140/","zaceory","Zack","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zaceory/","1005 products in account","Sounddoger+ is a Bullet Hell game in which you have to avoid "sound" as it comes at you in various forms such as spikes, balls and other shapes. The primary game has you playing through a succession of songs in which the higher your percentage score is, the more songs you unlock. That's essentially all there is to the game's progression outside of a few advanced levels that are unlocked by collecting hearts as you go. This doesn't leave much motivation to play for an already quite simple/boring experience. No matter how much you play, all you'll ever do is move your mouse to avoid obstacles. This isn't a horrible thing and the game can be a fun distraction in short bursts, but I wouldn't recommend spending much money on it. It's obviously very polished and well designed, but a monotonous experience is still monotonous no matter how well it's presented.\n\nIt is important to mention that there is a 'level creator' in which you can use your own sound files to create levels. This wasn't too worthwhile to me in this particular game, but others might appreciate it more. You may want to give this game a try if you get it in a bundle or a deep discount, but I definitely wouldn't recommend spending $8 on it.","September 5, 2014","false","1.7"," 12 of 26 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","12","26","0","1"

A premissa inicial, como deverão estar a pensar, não é extasiante, mas a sua execução é surpreendentemente exemplar, incluindo um editor de níveis muito completo, um gerador automático de partículas para quando queremos escolher uma música da nossa biblioteca e a possibilidade de abrandar o tempo para sobreviver em situações mais sufocantes.\nPerante um género em que a música é o motor de todos os processos, fiquei apenas desapontado com a falta de variedade de estilos. Foi obviamente uma decisão consciente já que a música utilizada vai desde a electrónica até à electrónica, independentemente dos subgéneros que engloba dentro desse universo. Apesar de ser uma boa selecção de faixas, gostaria de testar a minha perícia com, por exemplo, música clássica, jazz, rock ou mesmo folk, e sentir que cada género teria a sua própria consequência gráfica e física. Ora, para tipos caretas como eu, o jogo oferece a opção de abrir uma faixa à nossa escolha e jogá-la, o que o valoriza muito. No entanto, o gerador automático de partículas não é eficaz nem interessante o suficiente para executar as nossas faixas, tornando-as muito fáceis e monótonas do ponto de vista da jogabilidade. Em compensação, e para valorizar Soundodger+, o título permite-nos desenvolver os nossos próprios níveis e, aí sim, é possível jogar “As Quatro Estações” de Vivaldi devidamente, mas apenas após uma longa sessão de edição.\n\nGraficamente, o jogo é muito simples mas muito bonito e atraente, constituído por cores vivas e uma aparência muito poligonal. É possível que fiquemos baralhados, zonzos e/ou até deslumbrados com algumas das sequências apresentadas pelos diferentes níveis, os quais, devo dizer, estão maravilhosamente arquitectados.\nMas no fim de contas, Soundodger+ é o jogo mais casual do mundo. O que quero dizer, recorrendo à óbvia hipérbole, é que este é um jogo que pela sua ideia geradora, que não é especialmente iluminada, nunca poderia ser um marco na indústria. No entanto, é um título verdadeiramente bem executado e muito indicado para preencher algumas horas da nossa vida passadas filas de espera, salas de espera e outras situações solitárias ou “tempos mortos” em que não tenhamos sudoku, palavras cruzadas ou literatura disponível.","December 3, 2013","true","0.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

This game's main purpose is for you to dodge a barrage of bullets in a circular field that fire rhythmically with the music. The songs included are already pretty fun to listen and play to, and the game lets you add in songs of your choice and create your own map, or simply auto-generate a game for them (which isn't as fun as actually creating the bullet patterns yourself).\n\nThe game is incredibly straightforward, however, as there is only one mode of play. With the absence of variety, this game can get boring quickly, or if bullet hell games just aren't as fun to you. Personally, I stick around for the music and the sole purpose of seeing how many retries it'll take me to get a 100% before I rage quit.\n\nAs for recommending this game, I probably would not. It is a fun game, but it doesn't last, especially for its price. Perhaps, adding a few more game modes or more music (besides user-created ones, which tend to be over-the-top hard just to impress) would make this game worth buying.","November 13, 2014","false","18.6"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

A breath of fresh air from all the triple A madness that goes on around the passing holidays. If you've ever played any arcade shooter, you already played soundodger. It's far from perfect and further from being original, but you will definitely forget about that once the music kicks in! You're a little circle that dodges the particles made by the music itself.\n\nYou dodge the sounds of music eminated by the likes of Austin Wintory, Mike Forst, and Disasterpeace! If you don't, the music will become mixed up and will transport ahead of your mistake, while keeping track of your percentages. You can also enter into a bullet-time like mode, but be warned; if you do it will affect your overall percentage! You can go a whole song in this mode, but you'll never complete with a 100% because of this.\n\nIt isn't without it's faults either, unfortunately! My main problem is it's repetitive nature, of course every game like this is going to be repetitive, but this is different. Like after a while (20 minutes I'd say) you're going to be bored with it. Not to mention the tracklist starts over when you hit the new levels! The game does have a level editor, which you can import songs and track it yourself, but the problem here is it's tedium. You'll be sitting at your desk, face smooshed into the screen, trying to get that one bullet into the perfect spot.\n\nIn reality, if you have time to kill, this game is right up your ally!

Getting a decent score is important because it unlocks new levels.\n\nThis is probably my favorite "music" game out there, since rhythm isn't as necessary as in other games of this type, you can dodge the bullets the music generates, of course, if you're in flow with the music you'll understand where the bullets are coming from making the game easier.\n\nIt fills the "easy to play, hard to master" phrase to a T.","October 16, 2014","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Likely.\n\nSoundodger+ is a simple, yet elegant rhythm game that has nothing to do with the host of Daily Byte, and requires you to dodge a small variety of projectiles that shoot relatively to the beat of the music. The mechanics are extremely simple, dodge bullets with your mouse until the song ends. It obviously borrows from shmups, but don't let the term "bullet hell" scare you here: Lives are unlimited and you have a seemingly infinity slow mo (at the detriment of your final score). The less you are hit, the higher your percentage score is. That's practically it, though, the bullets shot from outside of the arena by generators range in angle, size, speed and heat-seeking ability while those said generators rotate around the arena. It comes with a decent handful of tracks, though the most fun and interesting art is to see how the auto-gen mode uses your own MP3 to thrown bullets at you.\n\nThere are also so extra user levels and you can create your own levels and bullet outputs to your music with a levle editor.\n\nThat's pretty much all to say about Soundodger+. Mouse control is smooth, vector graphics are stylized and look great when you change the settings to 60fps with "pretty" fullscreen settings. Soundodger+ is a carthartic and interesting way to experience your music. The game is worth of buy if this all sounds interesting to you.

The colors and contrast in the game is very colorful and pretty. The selections of songs they have vary from dubstep, to slower electronic music, to classical. Creating a very nice selection of music to play to. The game is basically a bullet hell dodgeball and as you finish each song, the more perecent you are closer to finidhing the song, the more it goes to unlocking more songs to play.The hitboxes on the "bullets" are only at the tips to give you more flexibility in your movements and allows for really tight dodges between two bullets. Although the selected music from the game is really nicely paced and progressively gets more challenging, the music you can load in yourself is a mixed bag of challenges depending on the song you decide to play. Most music you pick, unless it is a slow paced song, will have you mutilate the song by unsuccessfully dodging the unecessary amount of projectiles being flown at you as the game really doesn't keep a good flow to the songs you pick and analyze. It just shoots out millions of projectiles hoping you know what you're doing.\n\nAll in all, this game can keep you occupied with some really nice music when you have a boring day.\n\n8/10","January 13, 2014","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's lovely to get taken into a trance when you're doing astounding on a given song... and absolutely infuriating when you nick a triangle 80% of the way through the song.  Honestly I might have more playtime on this if it wasn't for what might seem like a petty thing - the sound it makes when you get hit.\n\nIt's like... anxiety inducing, to the point where I'm trying mostly to dodge to not hear that, because I like to play with the music moderately loud (as it's like more than half the game) and with headphones, and then if I slip up I get a very loud, zen-shattering, rewind screech that breaks my mood into pieces.  Not only did I just ruin my score, I also just got ear-wrecked.  Again, sounds petty, but it's sort of a big deal to me.  (I can likely mod a file for that or something?  But eh.)\n\nI love the game otherwise, seriously.  It's fun to swirl in circles and fluidly dance around a sweet pattern, and the light show it puts on even entertains others while they're watching.  The video is pretty all-inclusive, what you see is what you get: be a circle and dodge things to music.

However, I do have some issues:\n\nPros:\n\n* Light to run, shouldn't have any problem even on a lap top\n* Responsive mouse movement\n* Light but just about right graphics\n* TONS of replayability\n* Cool editor!\n* Visuals are in perfect rythm, you feel like playing IN the music\n\nCons:\n\n* There are just a handful of really enjoyable songs. Most are your random non-copyrighted material, but finding myself playing Mike Forst's songs 80% of the time just doesn't seem worth it at times\n* Sound quality could be better. I was playing using my AT-M50X with an E1 Sound Blaster and it just wasn't that good, I wouldn't mind the installation size if it meant better quality.\n* Generator didn't work very well for me, maybe it's the two songs I tried that weren't fit for it, but it just looked random. Still fun to play them though\n\nAfter all, I'll still play this game (But, you know, maybe just the one artist I liked) and I'll forze my brother to play a few as well. But I'd love to see some good DLC coming for this game and with better music selection.","August 10, 2015","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
