In this review i will go through the pros and cons\nof purchasing this game. I am trying to come from a perspective of someone who\nhas played this game since 2008, I have purchased this game 4 times, for Xbox\n360, PS3, Retail Box and Steam. Over the 4 versions of the game I would say that\nI have played a good 1000 hours. Yet I keep coming back for some reason. Cod4 is\none of the games that I play each and every day. I mostly play Promod, but I dip\ninto Non-modded every now and then.\n\nPros:\nMod Support, many, many mods for this game. There is a whole separate game of\njust mods. To name a few there is Prop Hunt, Promod, One in the chamber and a\nmultitude of others. Smooth uninterrupted game play, I wish more games had this these days. From the ground up this game was made to be as smooth as possible.\n\nDeveloper Console, this is a biggy in my books. Not enough games these days have this. This is the command line that you can use to edit any settings that you would like, you can load maps, change\nSensitivity aswell as other settings such as FOV and maxfps. With commands like cg_fov 80 and\ncom_maxfps 250.\n\nCons:\nThere are very few cons for this game. Some of the biggest and most prevalent are\nthe aim botters and silent aim users. If anything this is what will send you over\nthe edge. Another thing is that most of the servers are unpopulated. Don’t get me wrong,\nthere is still a huge player base in CoD4. Its just that I wish there were more.\n\nThank you for reading this review and I hope that it will influence your purchase\nin a good way.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/James060394/recommended/7940/","James060394","TheMadPolarBear","http://steamcommunity.com/id/James060394/","101 products in account","One of the best games of the franchise, the highly acclaimed Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare is a must have for a fan of the Call of Duty games. The games single player experience is phenomonal. From the beginning raid on the Russian tanker, to the cataclysmic end to the U.S campaign, to the brilliant All Ghillied Up mission, the game will keep you hooked, followed by a story that is believable, but not over the top compared to the future releases in the franchise.\n\nThe Multiplayer is where Call of Duty shines however, and Cod 4 is a thoroughly enjoyable experience but not without flaws due to a variety of reasons at this point in time. When Cod 4 was released, the game included many new features not seen in previous Call of Duty games, such as the now standard Create a Class, Killstreaks etc, all of which feel balanced and nothing too overpowered (except maybe the P90). Where the PC version differs to the console versions is the player count. Cod 4 supports up to 48 players per server and sometimes it's absolute madness, just like the old Call of Duty days. Make no mistake, it's still a really enjoyable experience but console players may find it somewhat jarring coming from console to PC but you can always join a server with less players. There is no Prestige, with ranks taking longer to achieve in its place, and dedicated servers are there which mean less lag compared to the console version.\n\nBUT unfortunately, as 2013, Cod 4's server browser and online experience is somewhat annoying. A LOT of servers which turn up in the browser have this annoying redirect mod, which you have to install. This means what may show up as Backlot, standard, TDM, 40 players may redirect you to a Hardcore, S&D, 3 player game. It's frustrating at times to find a decent game.\n\nAll in all, the game is highly recommended and along with the original Cod, UO and Cod 2. Probably the last GREAT Cod, with future games removing much of the standard PC features and instead being a console port. Buy it.","November 25, 2013","true","3.8"," 246 of 275 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","246","275","0","6"

The gameplay is great and there are now servers with some of our favourite gamemodes like DeathRun, Prop Hunt etc, alongside the classic Call Of Duty maps. Although this game isn't the same price as it's console versions, it's a different, better game entirely.

I think many will agree with me on that. i have less than 100 hours simply since i have nobody to play online with,and that i played the ♥♥♥♥ out of it on ps3 and nintendo wii. and then spent even more hours making montages i would fail at.\n\nOne of the best single players mode out there,with a neat arcade mode and cheats to use. so it has a lot more replayablity compared most other cods(espeically more recent ones).\n\nBut the mutiplayer is what really makes this game and thankfully there is plently of servers still online on PC(including fun mod ones). so the game may be dead on consoles,but on PC its worth playing. Also joining a match is pretty quick, almost instant so if you want instant action,well there you go.The gameplay style is more simple,but with enough perks and attachments to keep it from being boring,and i think it all comes down to weapon balance and pretty much every weapon in this game is useful. you can do well with almost any weapon.\n\nSo yeah the only negative is the price,its pretty fixed at 20 bucks and sales are extrememly rare,and thats coming from someone who spent hundreds of hours on. just be aware the community is much smaller and finding a decent server will take some trial and error.\n9/10 its like skyrim but with modern warfare","February 18, 2015","true","182.9"," 87 of 92 people (95%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","95","87","92","7","10"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pheabus2005/recommended/7940/","pheabus2005","Pheabus2K9","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pheabus2005/","219 products in account","Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare is the series at its Finest Hour.\nBack in 2007, it was a big year for video games, on PC we got Orange Box, Crysis, Bioshock,etc, console players had Halo 3, AC and Mass Effect, even among those big titles, Call of Duty 4 stood out. Its predecessors, namely Call of Duty and CoD2, were already highly successful, but CoD4 was simply beyond most gamers' expectation. I still remember playing this on my roommate's PC and got totally blown away by the "One shot, one kill" mission.\n\nSingleplayer Story: 9/10\nThe story is straight forward, it is not a role-playing game where you made choices, or a Hollywood movie with lots of twists, you simply move with your squad, and shoot bad guys. However, the developer still manages to put the action pieces together with a nice story, it is not perfect, but can still give you the good old "Saving Private Ryan" feeling (like it was in MOHAA). In comparsion, MW2's story tries to give you "WOW" moments, like a Michael Bay movie with lots of cool actions, but fails to deliver the glorious feel.\n\nPresentation: 9.5/10\nThe presentation is top notch in 2007, some moments are still amazing to this day, like the mission "All Ghillied Up" is an instant classic, where you crawled through emeny fields in a ghillied suit, with heavy tanks and patrols moving by, it is one of the most thrilling experiences in FPS history. The graphics are surely out-dated, but they aged elegantly. The gun models, animations and battlefield atomsphere are impeccable even in today's standards, which create great immersion. The pacing of shooting scene/intermission is perfect. There are also lots of explosions, but none feels out of place.\n\nMusic: 9/10\nThe in-game music composed by Harry Gregson-Williams suits the pace and atomsphere perfectly, whether it is the middle-eastern showdown, or the desolate pripyat city, or the ICBM lauch field, the music always bring the scene to life. It may not surpass the later MW2's music by Hans Zimmer Team, but still excellent game soundtrack.\n\nMultiplayer: 9.5/10\nThe MP mechanics was a revolution back in 2007, very fun and addictive even to this day. Most MP maps (aside from a few tiny maps) are well crafted to hold as much as 40-50 players, while still very fun to play with low player counts(8-16), also keep in mind that In later CoD (MW2 above) the player count is capped at 18, which, in my opinion, completely lost the epic battlefield feeling. This game also came before the crappy IWNet ever existed thus supports dedicated server, you can easily find a populated server with playable ping, without the worries about host-migration or host abuse, etc.\nThe weapons are balanced and diversified, not only feel great but actually have recoil(unlike those "laser guns" in later CoDs). The good old 3-5-7 killstreaks are simple and effective, as well as satisfying, you won't get ridiculous powerful killstreak (like nuke or AC-130 in later CoDs) but the result is still very rewarding.\n\nEnd of the line\nCall of Duty 4: Modern Warfare is the prime CoD experience on PC. With so many blockbuster shooters flooding the market today, you may want to pay this old game a revisit, and see what we gamers have missed all those past years.\n\nEdit: My steam profile suggests less than 1 hour CoD4 gameplay, which is not true. My in-game stats shows I played online for more than 500 hrs, coupled with another 300-400 hrs spent playing on mods, my total play time is nearly 1000 hrs.

It is by far the best Modern Warfare game of the series.\n\nSingleplayer starts the whole MW storyline, you play as "Soap", a soldier that just joined the SAS, and Jackson, an U.S. Marine.\nYou never see their faces neither they talk during the campaign, which makes it much more easy to take the role of these characters. Gampeplay in SP is rather linear, as such I'm not a very big fan of it. However, from a storyline standpoint I really like it, and in my opinion it should have ended with CoD4.\n\nMultiplayer is the core of this game. It is by far the best multiplayer experience the whole series has to offer.

Simple UAV, Air(fail)strike and Attack copter\n+10-40+ player servers\n+Mods\n+Atmospheric and interesting campaign.\n\n-No co-op.\n\nSo, 7 years after release, i decided to buy the game again. This time on Steam...obviously.\nAnd guess what ? It still stands its ground. People saying that it's the best CoD game in the franchise are not full of shait or blinded by nostalgia.\n\nI first started up the singleplayer campaign. Finished the boat mission and when the text, "Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare", appeared after the end of the first mission, i got chills. Really. It felt just like the first time i ever played the game.\nAnd it isn't the nostalgia talking. It was like a new experience...only re-lived.\nThe music, the atmosphere...everything in here is so well done.\nAtmosphere...a little sense of realism and characteristics...these are something that are missing in the latest CoD games.\nSince Black Ops 1 it has been just about explosions and over-the-top action.\nI love explosions...and i love the silly, uber-soldier action...but CoD went too far with it. You don't feel close to the characters anymore. You don't get sucked into the stories or into the world...no. It's just nonesense action. The characters in Blops games or Ghosts, they don't feel like soldiers anymore. Hell, they are not soldiers. They are superheroes.\nWhen i play a CoD game i want a game with soldiers, not a Marvel movie directed by Michael Bay...it's like Marvel Transformers...ugghhh...\n\nThe campaigns in CoD4 and MW2 are the only good campaigns in the new era of CoD. Old era (CoD 1-3) is ofc good aswell, but the gameplay in the latest CoDs is just way better.\nEDIT: OK, WaW campaign is quite decent aswell and i did enjoy Blops2 campaign 'cus it tried to be fresh and innovative but the story and characters were still just "MEH!".\n\nNow the multiplayer. This is where CoD4 shines. This is where the roosters at! It still holds up.\nI expected a dated character movement and gunplay but i was dead wrong. The gunplay is amazing! The gunplay is, in fact, better than in Blops or MW3.\nSure, the character movement is a bit smoother in, say...Blops2. But everything else is better in here.\n\nYes, the multiplayer is still alive! Hundreds, if not thousands, of servers full of people! There are 8vs8 servers, 12vs12, 16vs16, 20vs20 even!\nLatest CoDs only have 8vs8 and that's about it...maybe 12vs12 max but not more.\nCoD4 is the only CoD where you see 40 people in one server.\nIt also has one of the best multiplayer maps. MW2 had some really cool maps too and Blops2 had couple of decent maps (Nuketown and Hijacked) but CoD4 takes the cake! Pretty much every map is a masterpiece in here!\n\n\nCoD4: Modern Warfare is a must have for every FPS fan!","September 26, 2014","true","173.9"," 82 of 93 people (88%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","88","82","93","6","11"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Owlakki/recommended/7940/","Owlakki","Owlakki™ 5 days til birthday","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Owlakki/","441 products in account","Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare is one of the most influential games of the modern era. It almost single handedly paved the way towards modern military shooters becoming a trend. Gone were the days of countless World War 2, Vietnam and space shooters. Now was the relatively untapped potential of modern day shooters.\n\nPrior to Modern Warfare, modern military shooters were usually akin to sims. Games like Rainbow Six or Full Spectrum Warrior are good examples. Very tactically complex games with little run and gun action. Modern Warfare replaces run and gun with stop and pop. You use cover to your advantage and duck out with iron sights. Call of Duty 4 is the game I see as popularizing iron sights and probably utilized them the best compared to other games at the time. Moving and firing from the hip is wildly inaccurate but holding your sights down would increase your accuracy dramatically but slow your movement and narrow your field of view. It's an extremely immersive mechanic and one that was designed to compensate for the limited accuracy of analog sticks.\n\nThat's not all that Modern Warfare gave us either. Modern Warfare also paved the way for progression based multiplayer. Contrary to arena shooters, Modern Warfare instead focuses on letting you customize your arsenal with sights, scopes, underbarrel grenade launchers and even color schemes. And you unlock all of this gradually the more you play. It feels akin to an RPG where the more you play, the cooler your guns become and the more efficient you are at taking other players down. This is still the dominant system in first person shooters and even more popular franchises like Halo and Doom started to use it.\n\nAnd lastly the singleplayer in Modern Warfare is fairly good. It is a mostly scripted and linear shooter with plenty of good set pieces and moments. Along with prior staples of the series like having multiple protagonists and viewpoints across the story.\n\nOne other thing to note is how much of a PC game Modern Warfare 1 was compared to it's sequels. It has a console, a full SDK and map editor, dedicated servers and so much more. It allowed for things like bots to be added. And even close to 10 years after release you can still find enough people who want to play this game to fill a server. As derivative as later titles in this series got, you have to admire a charismatic and influential game like Modern Warfare. Very few first person shooters have such a lasting legacy that stands the test of time.","April 17","true","7.9"," 43 of 47 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","43","47","3","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/7940/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","The Call of Duty series has long been set in the theatre of World War II. The fourth instalment seeks to change this and alter the formula by taking place in modern times, where the good and bad guys are harder to define, the weapons are more powerful, and the plot is more complicated than just pushing back the Third Reich. The result is a game that is fun to play, whether alone or with others, and that sets a new benchmark for FPS games.\n\nThe game is neatly divided into two parts: single player, and multiplayer, with more than just human opponents differentiating the two modes. The single player charts the progress of the United States Marine Corps and the Special Air Services, the British equivalent, via a combatant in each. The story is short, and at a comfortable difficulty level, should take no more than half a dozen hours or so. But that's not to say it's lacking in content - on the contrary, the single player experience is intense and filled with memorable sequences and scenes. It's definitely worth playing through at least once.\n\nThe AI in the single player game is done quite well, for both the enemies and your teammates. Your teammates will stay behind cover, poking their head out to fire at the enemies, toss grenades, follow behind you when you proceed, and in general do a good job of being teammates. A little bit more fire from them would've been appreciated, though. The enemy does the same thing, hiding from your shots and tossing grenades, but they do it a little too well.\n\nThe enemy's AI, especially on the higher difficulties, borders on the ludicrous side of unfair, as they'll be able to do amazing tasks that even the best sniper couldn't. Throwing grenades a hundred feet with perfect accuracy, taking you out with three shots from an AK-47 while completely out of your view (even with a sniper rifle's scope), and even firing on you the instant you turn corners, as if they already knew you were coming. At some points, it's possible to be aiming at a doorway with a raised rifle for the enemy to appear, only to have them come through, raise their weapon, fire a couple shots, and kill you immediately, all before you could even fire once. There's a difference between a fair difficulty and a frustrating one, and COD4 definitely tends to the latter.\n\nBuying this game for the single player experience alone, however, would mean you were missing out on the bulk of the content. The multiplayer of Call of Duty 4 holds an inordinate amount of fun in it, introducing new elements and ideas that make it fresh, fun, and worth replaying again and again.\n\nThe multiplayer has a variety of modes for you to play through. There's the standard deathmatch and team deathmatch, where in the PC version, entering a game with nearly fifty players can mean staying alive for half a dozen seconds before someone finds you and shoots you. Other modes include Headquarters, where two opposing teams must capture a single point on the map (the HQ) and hold it for as long as they can to rack up points. In Sabotage, your team must find a bomb and use it to blow apart a target. On their own, the multiplayer modes are pretty fun, but they're nothing really new.\n\nThe Class system of COD4 is the first thing that adds some variety into the mix. Initially, you get to select one of a few pre-made classes, each with a specific primary weapon, secondary weapon, attachments and delightful little enhancements called 'perks'. These perks further flesh out your character by allowing him to do such things as hold extra grenades, take more damage, and sprint for longer distances. At first, there's not a whole lot unlocked: the weapons are mediocre, the perks average at best, and there isn't too much variety. But that's not all…\n\nWhere the game really gets interesting is the ability to earn experience points as you complete objectives and defeat other players. Earn enough experience and you'll move up in rank, which means unlocking features, weapons, attachments, classes, perks, and challenges. The real point of interest is unlocking the Create-a-Class feature, which allows you to invent your own class with its own weapons, perks, and so forth. As more perks and better weapons get unlocked, you'll find yourself not so helpless anymore, as your jerky, one-shot sniper rifle is replaced by a semi-automatic, your dusty handgun is replaced by a desert eagle, and your perks include such interesting abilities as the chance to take out your handgun as you lay dying and fire a few final shots at your killer, or dropping a live grenade when you die.\n\nChallenges add yet another reason to play multiplayer. As your increase your rank, you'll unlock challenges for each weapon that, upon completion, grant you attachments and extras for that particular weapon. Additionally, there are challenges that don't involve specific tools, such as leaping and falling to your death, killing a certain number of enemies while crouching/prone, or shooting down a helicopter.\n\nOverall, the multiplayer experience of Call of Duty 4 is astounding, and probably worth the price of the game by itself, as long as you don't mind playing with others. A big issue with it, however, seems to be that once you reach level 55 on the PC version, you can't proceed any further and that somewhat tempers the experience as a whole. Other than this, however, the multiplayer portion as a whole is very well done.\n\nCall of Duty 4 is an excellent game, there's really no doubt about it. Top-notch presentation combined with tight gameplay and impressive graphics make it fun to play on the single-player, but it's in the multiplayer aspect of the game that the experience is the best. As far as first-person shooters go, this is one of the best on the market, and is something anyone that's sure to interest anyone who has dabbled in the genre.","December 28, 2015","true","268.9"," 37 of 41 people (90%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","90","37","41","4","1"

No dubstep and autism here. This was when companies were trying to make the most out of the new technology they were given. Call of Duty still had that goosebump inducing storyline, it was practically the only campaign worth replaying. This game in particular gives you a single player experience that you will remember forever. If you haven't played it, stop reading and go play it NOW, you're no good to humanity alive.\n\nThe excitment didn't just stop at the single player of course. You can NEVER leave out the multiplayer that set the standard for first person shooters for years to come. Though the multiplayer has been long outvalued by the current Call of Duty games, this is where it started. For those of you just joining the franchise, it's comments like "this game sucks", "the graphics are terrible", "mechanics are clunky" that make you look like a fool. For those of us that have been playing Call of Duty from the very start, this game was the best on the market for us. It's insulting when people like you come around and try to criticize it. You can't and won't understand how great of a game this was for us.\n\nIf you play the single player, this game holds it's value at 20 dollars. Don't expect much from multiplayer these days though.\n\n","November 21, 2014","true","7.2"," 39 of 45 people (87%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","87","39","45","9","0"

The story is pretty interesting and takes place all over the world while playing as a British SAS Soap or US Marine Jackson. Personally I preferred the SAS missions because of the great characters, the professional team and more interesting missions. The US Marine missions are about war only where you are one of many and witness massive destruction around you. The most breathtaking missions include SPOILER the unforgetabble All ghillied up mission in Pripyat, UA where you play as a sniper with a task of assassination and the mission in the Middle East where you witness the Atomic bomb explosion from very close. END OF SPOILER\nAll in all, the modern graphics, action gameplay and breathtaking moments accompanied by dramatic music make this the best CoD game ever. The negative thing about it is the fact that it's multiplayer oriented and the singleplayer campaign, though totally awesome takes only 6 hours to finish, which is pretty embarassing.\n9/10","April 1, 2015","true","5.5"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","12","13","2","0"

It is definitely worth the $20 price tag and is actually playable compared to the console versions of the game (same for WaW) When I was originally going to get this game for PC, I was skeptical whether or not MP would be dead, plagued with hackers, or no vanilla esc servers. Boy was I wrong. There are plenty of servers that are populated (20+ ppl per server) that use their own Anti-Cheat, so hackers are rare. If there is a hacker, they usually get banned from the server within 10 minutes by an admin. If you are also weary about not finding any Vanilla COD 4 servers don't worry either. There are several servers that run the game in its original state without mods installed. Don't get me wrong, mods are fun and almost always make games a much better experience, but its fun to go back and play the barebones version of the game.\n\nBut seriously, if you have never played COD 4 before, BUY IT AND PLAY IT!","April 6, 2015","true","14.4"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

You could say that it's only running and shooting at pixels, but there's just something about it that makes it feel so much more than that. I think it's a campaign you really should play through, whether you like or hate Call of Duty - even if only because it's cool to hate on Call of Duty.\n\nAnd the multiplayer? Revolutionary. Levelling up, killstreak rewards and unlocking new weapons and perks. Even though some people disliked the changes, claiming there's little to no skill involved anymore, I personally think it made the multiplayer feel much better while still staying balanced most of the time. And the levels did introduce some motivation to keep you playing and getting those levels up.\n\nAmong first-person shooters, I personally find Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare to be the best of all time. And I mean it completely.","July 1, 2015","true","42.7"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","12","16","2","0"

The game which revolutionized the franchise, adding excellent and unforgettable multiplayer maps, killstreaks, guns, etc. But first, let's talk about the campaign, is not a secret that it is kinda short, but it is one of the best campaigns in the story of FPS. Excellent dialogues, great escenarios, great characters and memorable soundtrack, this and more makes this game a well done shooter.\nNow, the multiplayer, which one is incredible fun, brings new things to the CoD franchise which ones totally change the way we used to see those games. Now we are in the modern warfare, so new weapons and technology. As I said at the beginning of this review, it has enjoyable maps, we have a selection of small and some "big" maps, all well done, the killstreaks are just great for this game. I can say more and more good things about this game.\nI used to play this game a lot a few years ago in the 360. Nowadays, the multiplayer maybe is not that great as it used to be. But don't worry, you can always find a lot of servers with people, there are still a lot of mods, etc.\nBut yeah, my final words: If you for some reason don't have this game yet and you want to buy it, go and buy it, totally worth it.","December 19, 2014","true","15.2"," 15 of 22 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","15","22","0","2"

One of the best in the franchise. The single player campaign is great and arcade mode also makes it fun. Multiplayer. It is well-balanced from perks to guns and has the set 3-5-7 killstreaks. Even better about the online multiplayer is that there are admins who watch servers for hackers so you don't have to worry about that problem! Though the game has some old graphics, nothing really matches up to it.

I can now see why so many of my friends and other people around the world say how amazing Call of Duty 4 is. It's truly a masterpiece. Even though this is the only good game Infinity Ward has made, I still enjoy it a lot!\n\nThe simplicity of the game, the classic killstreaks, the maps, the gun balance, the gamemodes, the dedicated servers, and the mods is what makes this game amazing. When people think of "Classic CoD" they immediately think of Call of Duty 4. While most Call of Duty's nowadays are full of broken game mechanics and poor PC optimization, CoD 4 is a nice breath of fresh air. Even though I didn't play this game back in it's prime in 2007, people are still playing and I can see why. Even haters of Call of Duty even admit that this is "the only good CoD game" and that's saying something to me!\n\nEven though this game lacks a friends list, co-op, and has somewhat of a low playercount, I can't recommend Call of Duty 4 enough. It's a fantastic game and definitely worth the twenty bucks.\n\nMy rating 9/10","May 11, 2015","true","30.3"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","10","13","0","0"

It's similar yet somewhat dated movement system and game mechanics are likely to bring out the nostalgia within veterans of the series, and also offer new players a simpler more understandable way to play. This is beneficial to newcomers due to the recent Call of Duty installments being far too overcomplicated and unecessarily confusing to say the least.\n\nWith a memorable campaign, a fun exciting multplayer mode and with many community made maps and servers to choose from, Modern Warfare is a gaming experience that has the ability to live on in the PC community for many years to come.","February 24","true","4.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

It's not.  This game is the staple of the fps franchise, its a amazing game too. The community is still alive and well. You just need to download a few patches to make up for the lack of punkbuster, but you might not need to as most servers don't run it and have their own anticheat- yes, thats right. Their own anticheat. There are a hell of a lot of good servers avalible, and serverbob.net is the BEST hardcore server. I know its hardcore and not vanilla, but i've met a lot of nice dudes on there.

It allows you to play campaign and multiplayer mode. It is the first modern style Call of Duty so campaing is really nice and fun. Multiplayer is just fantastic and simple. You can play on ranked and unranked servers. Unranked servers allows you to play mods like sniper only, paintball, promod and zombies. Multiplayer also have normal ammount of levels so you will play game pretty long to reach max level/prestige. Is has the best guns and maps in my opinion.\n\nGame is totally worth of money! I reccommend this game to everyone who is FPS and Call of Duty fan. You will not get bored even if you're playing alone. If you want to continue campaing you will need to buy Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2.\n10/10","February 18, 2014","true","4.2"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

While I appreciated the WWII settings, I was less at ease with a nervous gameplay: bombing, shooting, running.... well, in other words, it was perhaps too fast for me.\n\nWhen I finally indulged myself in CoD Modern Warfare, I would have never though that the modern setting would be something that would make remake in my head the story. You're Soap, a new guy in Price's unit and you're going to be involded in the Russian Civil War and later, in a special team to stop the ultranationalist leader, an ex-weapon dealer. You're also Paul Jackson, a sergeant in the US Army, sent to an unknown country as part of an operation for freeing it from the rule of the new leader. You're even going to be Price but years ago...\n\nYou're playing people that are in the same moment at opposite directions and your role is to survive. The gameplay isn't only shoot, load, shoot... it's also keeping your cover, destroy tanks, be silent when you need to be silent, snipe....\n\nThe game is offering enough challenges to hook you up.\n\nYet the nervous gameplay isn't still something I like. That's probably because I'm more used to Doom or Half-Life pace.\n\nThe graphics are also quite good, though it's mainly revolving around a Middle East town or Russian forests. The only time you can enjoy something different is when you're in a plane above Price's team, clearing the path for them.\n\nCharacters are people you're getting attached to, whether you're playing them or they're NPC. Yeah, true, it's Call of Duty, which means unexpected death. In the end, Soap is alive, though badly injured, as you're him during the end of the game. Price? You don't know, though CoD Modern Warfare 2 is featuring him. Jackson? Well, he's still somewhere in that unknown country. As for the others that were with you (Griggs, Nikolai, Vasquez, McMillan or Gaz), their fate is sealed in the game. It's up to you to follow the story to find about them.\n\nAnd the game is ranking high in my "love soundtrack" meter. Really appreciated these. Really fitting.\n\nThe commands were probably the harder thing I had to master. Probably because of the cover I have to take when you're used to games without having none. And it's not always easy to fight your way through, even in the easy difficulty.\n\nAnyway, CoD Modern Warfare is really a very good game. Too bad the price is still high after all this year but hey, when there is a discount, go for it.","February 18, 2012","true","21.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I enjoyed this way better than World at War.  Black Op's campaign wasn't even as good as Modern Warfare 1 in my opinion.  I enjoyed playing the missions and some of them were challenging to get through but after a couple of tries I finished them.  Some of the missions blew my mind even Black Ops didn't have the twists that Modern Warfare did.

It was the very first game i played online when i was a kid, and it brought me into online gaming. Because of this game I became addicted to first person shooters. In my opinion this game will always be the best out of the entire series, and the only downside to this game is that the connection isn't as strong as it is in newer call of duty titles. Since this game is so old, there doesn't appear to be any servers in the multiplayer section. You need to find a website with all of the server IP's and pick a server from there. There are plenty of forrums that discuss this. Unfortunately, since this game is and isn't supported by gamebuster(a hacker detector) It can be difficult to join any servers if you don't have gamebuster installed. There are also forums to fix this.\nAll in all, I will always love this game because it was the root of my childhood gaming, and I would definitely reccomend it to anyone who can handle playing a game that's slightly outdated.","January 6, 2015","true","6.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The only legitimate complaints I have are as follows:\n-The movement system is a tad clunky compared to BO3. This is to be expected of a game as old as MW.\n-No controller support. It would be nice to pretend it's 2008 and I'm playing on my Xbox 360.\n\nOther than that, the community is still active and the game is still fun, but unfortuneatly everyone on PC seems to think hardcore (which is pretty much one-shot-one-kill) is better and I even had one guy tell me it was more realistic (lol - this is CoD). The dynamics of each weapon are squandered in hardcore and the game moves way too fast. You usually get spawnkilled for a few minutes each game. This is a community complaint though. The game is fine.\n\nThe campaign is great, the MP is great, the community is mostly great, the music is great, the aesthetic is great, the gameplay is great, and that's why this game gets a 1337/420.","May 25","true","7.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Unlocking new guns and attachments.\n\nI do not believe the Multiplayer is as good as it is in Black ops 2, but Cod4 Definitely is worth it's $20. It's a nice casual Call of Duty so you can just sit in a 24/7 server and play for as long as you like (you'll have to play the long ♥♥♥ games though if you're playing them)\n\nCod4 is a great starting Call of Duty for new players and will keep having tonnes of player for years to come. All though I prefer black ops 2 over this game Cod4 doesn't get dull for a second! I was having so much fun with my stealth class (Ak silencer, Usp Silenced, 3x Special Perk UAV jammer and Deep penatration Frag and Stun) I could get Quad- Five Feeds absolutely amazing game. Balanced and Fair and I never felt 1 gun was OP.\n\nCod4 has a fun singleplayer mode, but I'll be playing multiplayer as I've finished singleplayer numerous times.\n10/10","July 27, 2014","true","96.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RustyOnPC/recommended/7940/","RustyOnPC","#Insync.RuSty","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RustyOnPC/","411 products in account","The single player campaign is an intense, incredible experience, but it is short. To enhance the game's replay, Infinity Ward has included hidden Intel pieces in the game that, when found, unlock in-game single player cheats such as the ability to slow down the game temporarily, turn the game's colors black and white, or get infinite ammo. After finishing the game, the player also has access to an arcade mode, in which you try to get through the game or a single level with a limited amount of lives for the chance to get the high score. Call of Duty 4 comes with innovative and incredibly fun multiplayer.\n\nAnd now onto the multiplayer; the dedicated servers makes it lag free, which is one of the most vital things in multiplayer. The drip feed method of leveling up and unlocking guns as you progress is done at the right pace. The multiplayer consists of sixteen different maps with modes that include the traditional deathmatch, team deathmatch, and free-for-all. Other game modes include Domination, in which players fight to secure objective points, Sabotage, in which players must plant bombs by an enemy objective, and Search and Destroy, in which one team defends an objective while the other team attacks. The multiplayer is set up for fast, frenzied gameplay, with wide open maps that have multiple methods of ingress for most areas. There aren't a lot of places in any of the maps that are conducive to camping, which forces most players to stay on the run to survive. Also, whenever you are killed, you are shown your death from the enemy's point of view. This is a cool feature, which lets you know who killed you and how, but it also reveals hiding spots and other player's strategies. The savvy player will watch the killcam replay and seek out their killer's hiding spot, which is a point of controversy, although the killcam can be turned off in private matches. Ultimately, the best strategy in multiplayer is to keep moving at all times and keep a pair of eyes in the back of your head. Customization of the guns make everyone's play style possible, and it also keeps you wanting to play to unlock more things for each gun. Everyone has a unique character, you can be a stealthy sniper, fast shot-gunner, etc. It keeps it fresh and unique. The weapons are fun to use realistic, and are balanced too. The sniper rifles are awesome.\n\nOverall, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare is an intense gaming experience from start to finish. The story is conveyed much better than the average FPS, the gameplay is varied enough to stay fresh, the graphics and sound both deliver, and the multiplayer is addictive. If Call of Duty 4 can attract enough fanboys away from Halo 3 to experience it, we may have a new contender for FPS of the year. Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare proves that you don't have to have Spartan superwarriors, wrenches, portals, or sci-fi to create a great shooter game.\n\nIt is worth purchasing. Buy it!\nMy Rating - "Phenomenal"\nTraditional Rating - 10/10.","August 3, 2014","true","784.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","2"

I can directly say that In my opinion this is the best cod in gameplay perspective. I was really emersed in many levels, and it felt like I was in the game. Sadly later it was harder to get emersed because on veteran difficulty you will see some problems. The main ones: infinite spawning enemies, some bad checkpoints, enemies spawning at triggered points and enemies throwing to many grenades. Also this game can feel at some parts a little old. The graphics are not that impressive anymore ( I still think it is good, but it could use some more color ) and the audio is not that great. I think the story wasn't that special, but I still liked that it wasn't pro-army. Afterall I would recommend for people who never played the sp from cod 4 to play it on normal because it can be irritating sometimes.\n\nMultiplayer:\nI can say it is still getting great support from the community. There are many great mods And there is still enough people playing even at this moment. I also think that will stay so for many years because there is no 'better' replacement for the fans. Because the later cod's don't get mod support + are seen as less balanced. I also agree that this is the best cod for multiplayer.\n\nIn short:\nPlay the game in normal. This is ( in my opinion ) the best cod if you look at the gameplay from sp & mp perspective.\nGame can maybe look/feel old somethimes. Multiplayer is still alive and kicking.","July 6, 2014","true","13.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You have to work to find them.\n+Free DLC!\n\nCONS:\n-Still some broken multiplayer options ie noob tubes, juggernaut perk, martyrdom, last stand, and frag x3. A number of servers auto-kick players for using these weapons/perks, though.\n-Some useless perks in Multiplayer, ie eavesdrop.\n-Little replayability beyond Multiplayer.\n\nIf you loved CoD 4 in the old days, you can pick this up and play without worries. If you want a fun FPS to play, you can grab this and have a blast. It's easily one of the best games of the 2000s.","March 17","true","20.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The hitboxes are more accurate, the GUI is extremely simple and easy to grasp. Each gun has their own unique feel which really grasps the player into the game. The graphics from when the game was made is indeed playable, graphics isn't an issue in this game as the mechanics and engine run so smooth.\n\nI'd suggest getting this on PC due to cheat protection software, punkbuster. The servers are also player hosted and you get a server-list so that you can choose whether or not you want to play with mods and interfere with annoying hackers. Consoles do not offer this.\n\nAnd the campaign has a amazing story so I have no review on that for the time being because you need to enjoy it for yourself.","June 20, 2014","true","33.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The campaign's missions are all creative and fun to play. All Ghillied Up, No Fighting in the War Room and Mile High Club are among the best missions in any COD. Finishing Mile High Club on Veteran was one of the most rewarding achievements I've ever recieved. Such an amazing campaign...except for that ending of One Shot, One Kill where you have to wait on the helicopter. That was horrible on veteran.\n\nMultiplayer is obviously why COD makes the billions and COD4 is arguably the peak of the franchise. Struck the perfect formula of leveling and unlocking in a competitve FPS. Subsequent CODs simply added more killstreaks, maps, guns, modes etc to keep things fresh, but they are all building off of the success that COD4 created.

If you are a mulyplayer gamer, buy this game! Don't worry about other negitave reviews because these servers are hosted, ran, dedicated, and monitored by real accual people who also likes playing fair! Cod4 never even needed punkbuster! So if you're a hacker, better luck MW2 because leades of the server can kick you out, player report you and even IP ban you so you wont be able to join anymore unless you buy another copy or if u have a billion routers but they can still keep kicking you out. Sure there are bad server hosts but there are also good and responsible ones also and trust me... Most hosts are extremely strict about hacking and you can host your own. This is the most uniqe call of duty you will ever play on the PC or maybe your life! Why? Because there are servers that run Zombie survival, Bot training, Deathrun/codjumper(Parkour/surf), Normal nostalgic modes, custom weapons, Brutally hard Clan servers, and much more! Some servers even have their own website, fourms, teamspeak, steam groups, Etc. and they are like communities. Its like the Call Of Duty version of Gmod! So what are you waiting for!? Buy the game now for the BEST call of duty fun experience of your life! You might even be the next person who invents a new popular gamemode! By the way dont be that person who stays in a server for a while then say that the game sucks. Play the custom games that i mentioned earlier, get the feel, then write a review. Also, please dont say that you hate the game for being too hard. Every game takes time... Give it a second or a first chance and there are literally too many things to do in the game.

CoD 4 has proven that what really makes a multiplayer game such as this great is the dedicated servers--and the admins that run it. To give a specific example, the FF (Fatal Forces) servers have been around for years and still have a many dedicated admins and a large playerbase. There are even servers with different player made game modes, most notable being zombie survival.\n\nThis game is also a better example of what a first person shooter should be than the later CoDs. There are less gimmicks and ridiculous exploits (like quickscoping or commando knifing) while still having mechanics like C4 traps (and knifing but without the commando perk) that can still liven and diversify the gameplay. The killstreaks are not overpowered, making it more difficult for a single player to dominate the game (especially if they are hacking) and consequently putting more emphasis on gun firefights and teamwork.\n\nSo if you are ever going to buy a Call of Duty game, this is the only one you will ever need.","September 3, 2015","true","145.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've had an issue with punkbuster and loading the server menu. I've found that if there are no server's listed you make a few names and the server list will appear. I've tried the cache.dat file that didnt seem to work. the punkbuster issue I had to find legacy punkbuster, Game play is very good. So if you need legacy punkbuster you will have to look on the internet. So a great game.

If you are a mulyplayer gamer, buy this game! Don't worry about other negitave reviews because these servers are hosted, ran, dedicated, and monitored by real accual people who also likes playing fair! Cod4 never even needed punkbuster! So if you're a hacker, better luck MW2 because leades of the server can kick you out, player report you and even IP ban you so you wont be able to join anymore unless you buy another copy or if u have a billion routers but they can still keep kicking you out. Sure there are bad server hosts but there are also good and responsible ones also and trust me... Most hosts are extremely strict about hacking and you can host your own. This is the most uniqe call of duty you will ever play on the PC or maybe your life! Why? Because there are servers that run Zombie survival, Bot training, Deathrun/codjumper(Parkour/surf), Normal nostalgic modes, custom weapons, Brutally hard Clan servers, and much more! Some servers even have their own website, fourms, teamspeak, steam groups, Etc. and they are like communities. Its like the Call Of Duty version of Gmod! So what are you waiting for!? Buy the game now for the BEST call of duty fun experience of your life! You might even be the next person who invents a new popular gamemode! By the way dont be that person who stays in a server for a while then say that the game sucks. Play the custom games that i mentioned earlier, get the feel, then write a review. Also, please dont say that you hate the game for being too hard. Every game takes time... Give it a second or a first chance and there are literally too many things to do in the game. Thanks for reading! Happy Hacker-Free Cod Utopia that you have always dreamed of!","July 9, 2014","true","637.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/OmegaCS/recommended/7940/","OmegaCS","Omegaa","http://steamcommunity.com/id/OmegaCS/","28 products in account","War rages on in the fourth edition of Activision's acclaimed war game. For the first time in the series, Call of Duty moves away from WWII to the modern battlefield. Armed with an arsenal of advanced and powerful modern day firepower, players are transported to treacherous hotspots around the globe to take on a rogue enemy group threatening the world. As both a U.S Marine and British S.A.S. soldier fighting through an unfolding story full of twists and turns, players use sophisticated technology, superior firepower and coordinated land and air strikes on a battlefield where speed, accuracy and communication are essential to victory. The epic title also delivers an added depth of multiplayer action providing online fans an all-new community of persistence, addictive and customizable gameplay.\n\nOf course, if you're looking for longevity, that's where the multiplayer comes in. Up to 18 players can get online and get into a match on one of 16 different maps. Many of the levels are taken from portions of the single-player and they offer a healthy mix of wide-open, sniper-friendly areas and tight, almost cramped spaces where grenades and shotguns are the order of the day. There are six game modes to choose from. The old standby is team deathmatch, though you can also play in a free-for-all deathmatch, which isn't as much fun as the team modes. The other modes are more objective-oriented, and a couple of those have you lugging bombs across the map to blow up enemy equipment, or preventing the enemy from blowing up your base. Others have you capturing control points. Lastly, you can change up the game rules a bit with a hardcore setting that makes weapons more realistically damaging or an old-school mode that puts weapons on the ground as pickups and generally moves away from the simulation side of things.","May 3","true","13.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The reason is not because of it's gameplay mechanics or its graphics - but its story. Throughout the game people die, people suffer, and the story is quite captivating and manages to keep on pace even if you tend to die a lot in FPS games. So get this game, if for nothing else, for the story, because it's totally worth it.\n\nPros\n-Fantastic Story\n-Excellent Characters/Cast\n-Wonderful Locations\n-Good Graphics\n-Great Performance (very few buggies)\n\nCons\n-Repetitive Gameplay (shooting, shooting, more shooting)\n-Somewhat Crappy Mechanics (can't "feel" the guns or explosions)\n-Lackluster UI/Menus (so Sarah Plain and Tall)\n\nVerdict: Get it.

But this is the best Call of Duty game ever made, no doubt about it. Unfortunately, it was so good that the huge boost in popularity this game made for the series led to it being stigmatized as "the beginning of the end" for CoD. I more consider it the last full, good game of the series, seeing as how the developers were all fired before Modern Warfare 2 was fully fleshed out and every "Infinity Ward" made CoD since then has just been riding on the success of this particular game.\n\nSearch and Destroy on Call of Duty for is truly a tactical experience, and CoD4 on PC is probably the only place you can enjoy that since in every other CoD after it the only gametype people play is Team Deathmatch. It's also the last Call of Duty to do dedicated servers and mod support correctly. The lifespan of this game is indefinite. To this day I have absolutely no trouble finding a server playing whatever gametype I want.\n\nNot to mention the campaign. This game has this best campaign I've ever seen in a Call of Duty. I couldn't tell you how many times I have replayed it, and every time it feels like I'm the main character in a badass action movie. If you don't already own this game, you are ♥♥♥♥ing insane.\n\nLet me put it this way: there's more than twice as many people playing this as there are playing Ghosts\nhttp://www.gametracker.com/search/cod4/?searchipp=50&sort=c_numplayers&order=DESC#search","April 14, 2014","true","109.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

But this is the best Call of Duty game ever made, no doubt about it. Unfortunately, it was so good that the huge boost in popularity this game made for the series led to it being stigmatized as "the beginning of the end" for CoD. I more consider it the last full, good game of the series, seeing as how the developers were all fired before Modern Warfare 2 was fully fleshed out and every "Infinity Ward" made CoD since then has just been riding on the success of this particular game.\n\nSearch and Destroy on Call of Duty for is truly a tactical experience, and CoD4 on PC is probably the only place you can enjoy that since in every other CoD after it the only gametype people play is Team Deathmatch. It's also the last Call of Duty to do dedicated servers and mod support correctly. The lifespan of this game is indefinite. To this day I have absolutely no trouble finding a server playing whatever gametype I want.\n\nNot to mention the campaign. This game has this best campaign I've ever seen in a Call of Duty. I couldn't tell you how many times I have replayed it, and every time it feels like I'm the main character in a badass action movie. If you don't already own this game, you are ♥♥♥♥ing insane.\n\nLet me put it this way: there's more than twice as many people playing this as there are playing Ghosts\nhttp://www.gametracker.com/search/cod4/?searchipp=50&sort=c_numplayers&order=DESC#search","April 14, 2014","true","109.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

If you're a lazy f**k and just want to play multiplayer but don't wanna do the campain. Scroll down.\n\nThe games starts you off with some borderline autistic charcter named Soap. The reason I say this is because Soap says nothing of value. Soap contributes as much plot as Speedwagon, he stands in the background awkwardly and does what he is told to do. Oh, and you are british I guess. You also have some guy named "Gas", who is named this because he farts alot.\nThere's also some bearded guy with a gay hat named "Price", he yells at you by saying "Soap you muppet, do this or something...I don't know." you do some training and after being horrible and called a ♥♥♥, Price says you're ready to go.\nYou go onto a ship to check out whats on board, and then murder everyone for British pride. But then you find out "OH MY GOD PRICE A BOMB!", so as you start getting the f**k out of dodge, a plane says "HI HONEY I'M HOME FOR A IMPORTANT PLOT MOMENT OF BLACK SCREENS AND DISORIENTATION! DID YOU ALSO ASKED FOR A 'RUN TO THE FINISH IN A CERTAIN AMMOUNT OF TIME MOMENT?", as this happens, you hear some SAS bloke scream "JUMP FOR IT!", which is stupid, where am I jumping to exactly? The oceam? The Helicopter? This game never bothers to tell you so you just assume you jump to the heli.\nMEANWHILE, you go into the vision of some autistic quiet President named Obam-wait, sorry my bad, "Yasir Al-Fulani". This bloke goes through a silky smoth 30FPS level of seeing his country go to ♥♥♥♥ or something, also you see some ♥♥♥ in a blue jacket who is SPOILERS:Important late game, you starting to see a patern here? Oh, and Fulani gets shot in the face by some weeb named Khaled Al-Asad, who also happens to have a anime collection. Oh and he also has some golden Deagle, this made all the 12 year old boys go like "WHOAAAAA THAT DEAGLE SHOT WAS SO REALISTIC! AND HE ALSO HAD IT GOLD IT'S SOOOOO COOL!" I'm surprised he didn't miss that shot, the gold plating, holding the deagle with one hand, and trying to aim with sh!ty sunglasses should have made him miss his first shot.\nSo now you go back to Soap and go to some place in russia or something to find some bloke that I forgot the name of, I think he's some resistance leader, also SPOILERS HE'S TOTS IMPORTANT AT THE END OF THE GAME XDDDDDD\nSpeaking of important charcters that will appear in either the "ending" or "next game", we meet NIKOLAI! (Who has a little bird in his pants) Nikolai is some ruskie that's important because "reasons" and you save him I guess.\nMEANWHILEEEEEEE\nUSA goes in and tries to blow everything up to kill Al-Asad, you know, rather than cuffin' him, taking him to a prision to rot, we do it in typical american fassion of "SHOOT ALL THE BROWN PEOPLE!"...i'm not joking, nobody every said "Hey, because he might be important, lets cuff him or something!", no, just shoot everyone. So here we play as some other borderline autistic kid named "Paul Jackson", he's an American soldier bloke who won't be with us long, more on that later.\nAnyway, not much plot here, just shoot some stuff I guess...i'm really not joking, there is some black guy who's cool I guess but you really just sort of shoot everything.\nMeanwhile, with Soap and friends! Your chopper gets shot down and you go do stuff, and there's an AC-130 segment, everyone thought it was cool but it was really just a drawn out turret segment.\nMEANWHILE AGAIN!\nYou go back to Paul Jackson and shoot some more stuff and then you go to "WHO KNOWS" and shoot at some more stuff with the "SHOOT STUFF UP" brigade. Theres also some chick pilot you save I guess, not a good waifu though.\nOh yeah and then theres a nuclear explosion and Paul dies from radiation because everyone is a casual scrub that dies to exploisions.\nMeanwhile with the Brits, Nikolai says some stuff about where Al-Asad is and then you go and shoot him a bunch, but THEN Price gets some phonecall n Al's phone and says "THAT BLOKE THAT CALLED ME WAS IMRAN ZAKHAEV!"\nSo now we go throught he boulvard of broken dreams with flashbacks where we play as Price and some other autistic sniper bloke. You both shoot at a bunch of things and then shoot Zakhaev. *NOW I DON'T F**KING CARE WHAT YOU SAY, HE SHOULD HAVE DIED. HE LOST AN ARM, AND WAS BLEEDING EVERYWHERE. AND WAS SHOT BY A F**KING 50 CAL. NOBODY SHOULD EVER SURVIVE THAT AND THIS GAME'S LOGIC IS FLAWED.*\nRant aside, Sniper bloke gets hurt and you go through a spooky mission with dogs. The end there.\nSo now we are back with the SAS blokes who get shot at a bunch but get away because PLOT.\nAnd then we see the Black dude from the USMC come back, and now it's a Joint Op with USMC and SAS blokes, making it the "SLIGHTLY QUIET BUT AT THE SAME TIME LOUD BLOKES THAT BLOW STUFF UP" brigade.\nSo in this next level called "The Sins of the Father", (No i'm not making a joke it's litterally called that.)\nYou go to some base and cross dress as russian Prostitues to lure in Zakhaev's son. So he comes along and says "YO GIMMIE DA PUSSI BOSS!", but Gas says "NAW BOSS YOU UNDER ARREST!" and then Zakhaev's son in the gool ol' Japanese anime style fassion, shoots himself in the head....yeah there's no sugar coating there, he litterally just shoots himself. And then Zakhaev gets edgy about it and starts cutting himself to Linkin Park and Three Days Of Grace.\nYou then find out "OH NOES! ZAKHAEV IS LAUNCHIN' NUKES!"\nSo you go to the power station and Black Man gets captured, so you save Black Man and then walk around a bit and then OH MY JESUS CHRIST WTF!\nYeah Zakhaev launches nukes.\nSo you go in and start shooting at some ruskies and then you go inside the launch facility and then you find out OH HEY ZAKHAEV IS OVER THERE!\nSo you race away and then get shot at by some helicopters who were related to Mr. Plot Plane from the begining of the game, and then you get horribly rekt because a bunch of SAS operators can't drive worth crap. A helicopter "SWHOSHES IN" and takes you all out. So heres what happens...\nBlack guy dies first.\nGas gets shot in the head/spine IDFK.\nPrice throws a 1911 at you and says "SHOOT THEM YOU MUPPET!"\nAnd then you kill russian man Zakhaev.\nAlso remeber the guy from the begining of the game I said would be important some how? Yeah the resistance leader says "YOU WILL BE ALL RIGHT COMMRADE! 99 BOTTLE OF VODKA ON THE WALL!"\nAnd then you get pulled away too space.\nTHE END.\ntl;dr RUSSIANS, NUKES, AMERICA F**K YEAH, SAS BEST UNIT, KILL RUSSIAN MAN BLOKE.\nIn all honesty, this story made more sense then all the other CoD games, so you should try out the story for "sh*ts" and giggles.\nAlso theres a in-game cheat that turns on "Classic style" which speeds up the game a little and plays fancy music over everything.\n2/-1 It's okay.\nAnd probably the only good CoD game there will ever be for the rest of time.","August 14, 2015","true","30.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PhdZemph/recommended/7940/","PhdZemph","600piecesof8","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PhdZemph/","48 products in account","Wow, 7 years after the initial release, I play CoD MW for the first time (since it was now officially available in Europe for a reasonable price). So I guess I won't reveal anything new, strange or exciting, but for the fellas who like reading my reviews my (re-)view on this game:\n\nThe overall story is ludicrous and as someone wrote here earlier with which I totally agree: It is a Neo-Cons wet dream. The bad Russian baddy and the evil Arab doing something mega-evil to make sure US weapons get sold worldwide and their soldiers got a reason to invade foreign countries.\nThis is accompanied by the typical US mistakes: Well, being "currently No.2 of the Middle East" is as daft as the Hamburg Safehouse which is located in Berlin on the CoD map - besides all the US water towers spread throughout Russia (like in HL2) or a (major mistake in such a game) the wrong crosshair for the Dragunov (the real one might be too complicated?) and its false classification as a Sniper Rifle. In reality it bridges the gap between an assault and a sniper rifle and is called a Designated Marksman Rifle.\nThe gameplay and the missions are the most realistic I have ever seen in any shooter up to date. From the gibberish of the soldiers to situations having to get back into just abandonned territory now in the enemy's hand, being abused as Snipers for local warlords, etc.\nThis is sooo ♥♥♥♥ing realistic, it is unbelievable and points to professionell advisory. All gameplay is set in an as realistic as possible environment: You got only 2 gun slots and not 10. Handgrenades ain't just a nuisance, but really kill. Another plus of the game is the NPC AI which doesn't bother you as much as your squad in HL2. The whole campaign missions offer nothing unrealistic - negatively spoken, nothing too exciting either.\nAnd here you got also the games greatest weakness: The realism makes the game quite boring and repetitive and the mechanics are completely contrary to a realistic gameplay, because enemies spawn non-stop and you have no other option but to run and gun your way through to the next waypoint, to stop the spawning in order to advance.\nNot realistic and no different to capturing a base in TF2 - and this for mostly ultra short levels. The shortest of all the HL-franchise (besides Lost Coast), the HL2Ep1 add-on took me about the same time to finish the first time.\nI am quite a slow gamer, enjoy scenery and like to explore, but this is by pace and the really tight level design impossible. There is not a single acre too much texture and the bare minimum of houses you need. Then again, Special Ops ain't on vacation either ;) .\nGraphics are still sound even 7 years after, but I experienced a critical overheating on Win7 64bit with Geforce GTX 760, which was supposedly due to a Nvdia bug and seemed fixed in a later update. Still, with asking nearly 50% of the initial release price even 7 years after, I expected better but the game runs uneven on modern PC's.\n\nConclusion: The game shows 90% of the real life encounters of a special forces member and is a fast-paced FPS which tends to be repetitive and contradicting its realism, by the AI's spawning policies. If you got real life theatre experience, are a professionell soldier or just someone who likes fast-paced Run & Gun action, you'll love the game. If you are more into the intelligent way of solving situations as in the HL series or love to set traps for groups of enemies, this game might be less satisfying for you.\n\nMultiplayer is a mega feature on MW & MW2, but frankly, haven't tried it out as of yet... ;)","June 7, 2014","true","18.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

In reality it bridges the gap between an assault and a sniper rifle and is called a Designated Marksman Rifle.\nThe gameplay and the missions are the most realistic I have ever seen in any shooter up to date. From the gibberish of the soldiers to situations having to get back into just abandonned territory now in the enemy's hand, being abused as Snipers for local warlords, etc.\nThis is sooo ♥♥♥♥ing realistic, it is unbelievable and points to professionell advisory. All gameplay is set in an as realistic as possible environment: You got only 2 gun slots and not 10. Handgrenades ain't just a nuisance, but really kill. Another plus of the game is the NPC AI which doesn't bother you as much as your squad in HL2. The whole campaign missions offer nothing unrealistic - negatively spoken, nothing too exciting either.\nAnd here you got also the games greatest weakness: The realism makes the game quite boring and repetitive and the mechanics are completely contrary to a realistic gameplay, because enemies spawn non-stop and you have no other option but to run and gun your way through to the next waypoint, to stop the spawning in order to advance.\nNot realistic and no different to capturing a base in TF2 - and this for mostly ultra short levels. The shortest of all the HL-franchise (besides Lost Coast), the HL2Ep1 add-on took me about the same time to finish the first time.\nI am quite a slow gamer, enjoy scenery and like to explore, but this is by pace and the really tight level design impossible. There is not a single acre too much texture and the bare minimum of houses you need. Then again, Special Ops ain't on vacation either ;) .\nGraphics are still sound even 7 years after, but I experienced a critical overheating on Win7 64bit with Geforce GTX 760, which was supposedly due to a Nvdia bug and seemed fixed in a later update. Still, with asking nearly 50% of the initial release price even 7 years after, I expected better but the game runs uneven on modern PC's.\n\nConclusion: The game shows 90% of the real life encounters of a special forces member and is a fast-paced FPS which tends to be repetitive and contradicting its realism, by the AI's spawning policies. If you got real life theatre experience, are a professionell soldier or just someone who likes fast-paced Run & Gun action, you'll love the game. If you are more into the intelligent way of solving situations as in the HL series or love to set traps for groups of enemies, this game might be less satisfying for you.\n\nMultiplayer is a mega feature on MW & MW2, but frankly, haven't tried it out as of yet... ;)","June 7, 2014","true","18.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Whether or not Modern Warfare has done so for the better is debatable, but make no mistake that this entry Call of Duty has had an enormous impact on the games we play today.\n\nOn the single player side, Modern Warfare offers nothing more than a generic plot with repetitive gameplay elements. You hide in cover and eliminate waves of enemies. There are a few spectacular set pieces, but not enough to have me praise the campaign whole heartedly.\n\nThe multiplayer is a fast paced, adrenaline pumping, and solid first person shooter. Every key stroke translates into an immediate reaction. Immediately gunning down foes with a few clicks is undoubtedly satisfying. The only downsides are the kill streaks which reward good players, putting casual players at a disadvantage and the swiftness of your demise.\n\nAs a game which style is now heavily borrowed by others, Modern Warfare is worth a look.\n\nGrade: B","January 9, 2012","true","1.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Absolutely excellent storytelling, suprising-as-hell twists that really manages to leave you feeling like you've been punched in the stomach (in a good way) and a multiplayer that was great and open to modding.\n\nCall of Duty 4: Modern Warfare is the top of the tri-angle and for good reason. It is the first of the series to implement kill-streaks without going over-the-top, it is also the last of the Infinity Ward games that provides a believable and compelling story that gives you the proper highs and lows rather than just simply pumping you up over and over.\n\nCoD4's story is the closest you get to a military "drama" in that it properly uses the highs and lows of successes and failures.

Partly that's because that's just how Activision does things with it's franchises that do well. The other part is that this game is genuinely good, and they've been trying (and failing) to match its quality ever since. There are shooters with better stories, gameplay, and multiplayer, but the combined package you get here is very hard to dismiss. It's all superb quality... well, I can't speak to multiplayer because I barely touched that, but the rest certainly is. It's got the best single-player campaign of the series, with lots of variety in the missions ranging from a night raid on a container ship at sea, massive intense firefights with insane amounts of gunfire, tense sneaky missions where stealth and precision are essential, and an eerie and dehumanizing ride in an AC-130 gunship where you blow away dozens of hostiles from thousands of feet in the air who can't do anything back to you. It's all excellent gameplay, and the story you get with it is, while not totally spectacular, much better than average for first person shooters.\n\nEven if you find this series at present irritating and bland (I do), this game at least is still worth checking out. After having played it, it's not hard to understand why its immediate sequels were breaking sales records.","November 29, 2013","true","46.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The player plays as various characters in the story. Yet the narrative is linear and the game looking to get a cinematic effect .\n\nCOD 4 Modern Warfare renewed the graphics engine of the previous games in the series in a big way. It had great success and to some extent became the spiritual successor of Counter Strike . It had two sequels that continue the story to its end in Modern Warfare 3. The game has a very mature multiplayer component where the player can call air attacks and reconnaissance vehicles.\n\nCall of Duty 4 Modern Warfare really innovated in the genre. It took the war to the modern era , a battle without pause and film like scenes. Hundreds of shots , stealth, sniper attacks , and a variety of weapons immerse us in this world war. In fact , although the following Call of Duty are much more up to date, they seem an extension of this brilliant game . The feeling of being in the ghost town near  Pipriat Chernobyl is shocking , COD MW4 was technologically wonderful in 2007.\n\nThe game sold over 13 million copies in two years and obtained a score of 94 out of 100 on sites like Metacritic or GameRankings .\n\nThe game was released for Windows PC , PS3 and XBOX 360. The windows version required  DirectX 9.0c API  . While it requires a graphics card, the game has very low requirements for the graphic quality it has.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nESPAÑOL\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEl Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare es un videojuego de acción en primera persona desarrollado por Infinity Ward en 2007 y distribuido por Activision.\n\nGrupos de Marines y SAS britanicos deben combatir a un grupo ultranacionalista  que planea una tercera guerra mundial.

Aún así la narrativa es muy lineal y el juego busca conseguir un efecto cinemático.\n\nEl COD Modern Warfare renovó en gran forma el motor gráfico de los anteriores juegos de la serie. Tuvo grán éxito y en alguna medida se convirtió en el sucesor espiritual del Counter Strike. Tuvo dos secuelas que continúan con la historia hasta su fin en el Modern Warfare 3.  El juego tiene un componente multijugador muy desarrollado donde el jugador puede llamar a vehículos aéreos de ataque y reconocimiento.\n\nEl Call of Duty Modern Warfare realmente innovó en el género. Nos llevó por primera vez a la guerra moderna, con un combate sin pausa y escenas "de película" soprendentes. Centenares de disparos, sigilo, ataques Sniper, y una gran variedad de armas nos sumergen en este mundo en guerra. De hecho, si bien los siguientes Call of Duty son mucho mas modernos, parecen una extensión de este brillante juego. La sensación de estar en la ciudad fantasma de Pipriat cerca de Chernobil es impactante, tecnológicamente el COD MW4 fue una maravilla del 2007.\n\nEl juego vendió mas de 13 millones de copias en dos años y obtuvo un puntaje de 94 sobre 100 en sitios de críticos como Metacritic o GameRankings.\n\nEl juego se lanzó para PC bajo Windows, PS3 y XBOX 360. La versión de windows requería la API DirectX 9.0c. Si bien requería una tarjeta gráfica medianamente buena, es un juego que posee requerimientos bastante bajos para la calidad que tiene.","November 25, 2013","true","2.0"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

This is where it all began people. No stupid overpowered 1-hit-kill pistol shot to the foot known as GHOSTS, but a real FPS at its origins,\n\nThe campaign is by far the best one in the entire CoD franchise. There's good pacing, ♥♥♥♥ing excellent stand out moments and you don't spend every mission shooting foreigners who don't deserve it.\n\nThe multiplayer is...broken. Well, it is somewhat fixable, but you shouldn't have to wave through 50 google searches to fix the problems. The first problem is punkbuster, the anti cheat. It's not being updated anymore so some people have to upadte it manually. Servers don't show up unless you spend 10 minutes replacing some random DLL file. I can't join ANY of the servers without getting kicked, so I have to use GameTracker to find a server that works for me!\n\nCurrently the only server I can even use properly is Europe Cracked (Which you can find on Gametracker.com/cod4 google it) And it's 24/7 TDM.

The easiest difficulty is even hard at some parts where death is possible if 1 wrong move is made.
