"http://steamcommunity.com/id/takfly/recommended/447270/","takfly","Mr Takfly","http://steamcommunity.com/id/takfly/","150 products in account","It's so lifelike!\n\nI only went in for a cheap desk lamp, but after 30 minutes of being shepherded through the store without stopping, I found my path blocked by a couple arguing over soft furnishings whilst their child threw a tantrum over getting a hotdog and an ice-cream. I went around them and wandered a little more (on rails as per the store layout) and eventually stopped for minute to look at some bedroom furniture however I realised that I am in fact not a giant and therefore do not have 16ft ceilings in my bedroom ergo they wouldn't fit (BUGFIX: I think there may be scaling issues). Unfortunately, the couple had caught up with me and were still arguing only this time over the mans commitment to the shopping trip. The child was complaining that it needed to go to the toilet. As if by magic an NPC in a yellow polo neck T-Shirt appeared from behind a mirror (I think no-clip was left on by mistake) and started filling up a pencil dispenser but before anyone could ask the way to the restroom it vanished behind a stack of pillows. I then walked for another 10 minutes until I found the lamp section. I found one I liked but the bulbs were some weird triangle shape that I'd never seen before so I decided to wander round and see if one of the NPCs had any clues. I eventually found what appeared to be an enormous warehouse full of boxes. There was an old man bending to lift a flat-pack bunkbed while his wife looked round nervously with a "excuse me young man could you help" look on her face (the graphics are astonishing) ... I decided to offer my help as I thought it might be a side-quest... Unfortunately, the box was slightly too big for the trolley so I had to help them all the way to the checkout while the old lady did more to make it fall off than help (she meant well). In a moment of sheer determination to finish the quest I decided to help them to the car. Sadly, I got distracted by the sound of a child screaming "BUT I DON'T LIKE STRAWBERRY SYRUP ON MY ICE-CREAM" at full volume followed by crying as I left the store and I forgot to ask the nearby NPC about the lamp. By the time I remembered, I was outside waiting for the old man (Collin) to fetch the car (BUG REPORT: the bollards have odd collision boxes that the trolley won’t fit through). It was a 1993 Nissan Micra. Even after removing the basket of knitting supplies, 1972 AA road atlas of Great Britain, and full tool set including kneeling pad from the boot; I realised the box wouldn't fit. I tried everything as the old woman looked on expectantly but no luck. Sadly, we unboxed the item in a bid to make it fit (Nice Tetris clone mini-game) and it meant the item could not be returned so I had to restart the quest.\n\nExcellent game 10/10\n","April 7","true","0.8"," 25 of 30 people (83%) found this review helpful 36 people found this review funny","83","25","30","36","0"

However, as far as VR Experiences go I was quite disappointed. Too many items can't be picked up and the resolution looks fairly low. In the end I kept asking myself why I was still in that experience.\n\nWith all the negative aspects out of the way, I do applaud that Ikea has embraced this VR experiment and I do hope they will continue with this work. If I can at some point build my kitchen or living room on my PC and walk through it in VR before I order all items with a glance at the checkout button then I'll be quite happy.","May 16","false","0.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

Although the models and physics are pretty basic, your brain will forget about these things and accept it as reality. You often forget you can walk through objects and it feels wrong to do so. It's not hard to imagine something that builds off of this, like distructable models and generative worlds -- stuff that we can already do but just haven't yet for VR.\n\nAlso one thing that's fun to do in this switch heights to small, sit down, then switch heights back to normal. It will assume you are standing up and so the room becomes very small. Like you're in a doll house or something. Very amusing.","June 3","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
