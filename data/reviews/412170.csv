Combat is pretty fun and you'll have a few skills/ weapons to help you even the odds or can decide to use a grenade to kill enemies outside of a battle, if you have one and don't mind not getting any loot. Each character has skills you can unlock using points gained from completing quests and they'll slowly follow archetypes you're familiar with (damage dealer, tank etc).\n\nCombat can also get a bit frustrating at times, enemies can hit hard and bad luck might mean you might get a character near KO quite quickly if you're not careful. KOs will influence party Morale and this is a game mechanic I wasn't completely happy with, while I'm fine with it having an effect in combat I was annoyed at finding out it can also prevent characters from lockpicking/ hacking if it gets too low. You can restore morale using a certain medical consumable but it honestly feels like a gimmick that gets in the way of the fun and made me just reload a save if a fight made it drop too low.\n\nFor the most part City of Chains was a smooth ride though and felt like a competent game with a good mix of combat and exploration: it's not overly long and its brand of dystopian sci-fi isn't horribly original but it works well and it's fun to play.","April 10","true","7.3"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","14","14","0","0"

After breaking out of prison with a few fellow prisoners, Holt must evade the police while getting to the bottom of a big conspiracy.\n\nGameplay consists of completing tasks (quests) such as rescuing other prisoners or disabling defenses to gain skill points and advance the story. Skillpoints can be spent on passive combat bonuses or on other skills such as hacking, lockpicking, or speech (charisma). Interestingly, a lot of fights can be directly avoided using skills you have learned, such as using the hacking skill to disable robot sentries or using speech skills to talk your way through hostile situations.\n\n═══════════════════════════════════\nPROS & CONS\n\nPros:\nMultiple solutions to hostile enemies, sneak past them or use craftable grenades instead of fighting head on\nVariety of equipment and skillpoints to customize your squad\nClean, smooth animations, and fitting soundtrack\nChoices your forced to make that may or may not influence the ending of the game\nAmmo/other supplies are limited forcing you to explore more to find them\nInteresting crafting system for grenades/medicine\n\nCons:\nLack of a map\nNo health bars for enemies\nSecondary characters don't have much backstory\n═══════════════════════════════════\n\nSUMMARY & FINAL RATING\nThis is a unique RPG Maker game that contains elements from games such as Deus Ex or the Shadowrun games. If you like tactical games set in a dark and dystopian setting this is the game for you!\n\n═══════════════════════════════════\nFor more recommendations on quality indie games or ones with high potential follow our group reviews  here","December 11, 2015","true","4.8"," 32 of 48 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","32","48","2","1"

It feels a bit nostalgic, reminded me of '80-'90 movies.\n- OST.\n- Choices matter. There are different endings depending on your decisions.\n- Everything is well proportioned. No chibis. I'm a bit tired of rpg maker's kind of games where all character's body are 3/4 head.\n- Full controller support.\n\n\nCons:\n\n- Outdated graphics, just like old good games on SNES. It didn't bother me at all but some people do.\n- It doesn't support HD screen, game is windowed.\n- Clunky control, as all games of this style are.\n- You can't see how much ammo you have left during battles.\n- Steam Overlay doesn't work.\n\n\nIf the cons aren't a big deal for you i highly recommend this game.","April 24","true","15.8"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

I try to only review games I think I'll enjoy, thus the lack of negatives\n\nCity of Chains takes the foundations of a retro-inspired RPG and attempts to combine them with an ambitious array of modern gameplay mechanics. Does it succeed or is it's scope too broad?\nRead on for my humble opinion ...\n\nNew Reality Games have brought forward the unique presentation of their sister title Atonement: Scourge of Time and repeated it here, this time with a cyberpunk sc-fi setting. Do you remember your early gaming years when there were still games that intrigued you with their unique look? Atonement: SOT reminded me of those days so I'm glad to see the same overall aesthetics return here.\n\nAs an RPG Maker game, there is an impressive amount of custom, 'from-the-ground-up' work evident here. In fact, the entire game comes across as a very unique experience which I doubt you will find in many other places. The town and battle menus are standard and you might hear 1 or 2 familiar default sounds in there, but the character models, animations and scenery have a unique charm to them that I really enjoyed. Combat takes your typical turn-based approach and applies an extra layer of interesting stats and weaknesses. Even on casual difficulty, you'll find yourself considering your turns carefully for some of the boss encounters.\n\nCity of Chains incorporates many modern features usually non-existent in these games such as:\nDialogue Options With Consequences: the decisions you make at these crossroads have an impact on the story going forward. You'll definitely find yourself considering those\n\ncarefully.\nNon-combative Skills: My favorite example is the Charisma skill, which can be used to coerce NPCs or totally avoid combat. Since there is no EXP system here (only skill points which are rewarded after completing tasks), it's always a satisfying victory!\nItem and Crafting System: Weapons come in various forms and provide new skills to the user, all of which have their own animations. A basic crafting system can be used to create healing items and grenades.\nTactical Elements: Find and use control panels to disable bots and security measures or weaken bosses. The higher your hacking skill, the greater the dampening effect will be. This is a really nice touch!\nStats & Skills: Morale can be boosted or lowered which can have consequences for you and your foes, in and out of battle. A wide variety of active and passive skills keep things interesting.\nThe story will take you on a very fast-paced, enjoyable romp through a dark cyberpunk World where you'll meet many characters and make many important choices along the way. A little bit of exploration is allowed and some of the cities are designed really nicely, with shops and apartment building to wander around. While your story begins in rather dark and grim environments, this is not always the case. Music and sounds are suitably dark/cyberpunk and you'll hear new background music almost every few minutes.\n\nI'm very impressed with the range of skills, items and features present in City of Chains, which you would not expect to see in this niche. While they are not deeply developed, their scope is perfectly matched to the games relatively modest runtime (for an RPG) and nothing ever feels like it takes too much of your time away from the action and story. You will be hacking, smashing and shooting your way through the game and leveling up your skills at a really nice pace, everything feels very rewarding and I think the perfect balance has been struck here.\n\nSome small additions to the game I believe would be useful are:\nan in-battle ammo count\na quick crafting how-to.\nIf the unique retro feel of City of Chains piqued your curiosity enough to read this review or want to find out more, I would say go for it and give it a try.\n\nI put together a short preview video in case you want to take a look: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQjEsBrf06Y\n\nGiveaway here (ends December 30th 2015): https://www.bobmanbob.com","December 14, 2015","true","11.0"," 17 of 30 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","17","30","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RuneForumwalker/recommended/412170/","RuneForumwalker","Muuro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RuneForumwalker/","193 products in account","Having currently completed about roughly 3/4ths of the game so far, I'd have to say the narrative feels a bit lacking.  It's very much like Deus Ex in the setting, but I don't feel the story or characters are much more than average.  However what sets this game apart from others is the fact that it takes chances in other areas, notably gameplay.\n\nNot many RPG's don't give you the standard levelups.  What I mean by standard is that killing enemies grants you experience and at certain experience amounts you gain levels which increase your base stats and unlock skills and attacks.  No, rather this game takes a cue from the original Deus Ex in that you gain skill points for completing objectives (or tasks as the game calls them).  You use the skill points to buy skills for a character.  The character has a certain set of skills to choose from, and you get to choose which one you would like unlocked.  Certain skills also unlock the ability to gain other skills.  Not many RPG's use this type of system, which is a shame as it offers greater depth and customization.\n\nThere are also multiple paths that can be taken through levels as well as choices to be made throughout the game.  I can't say for sure how the choices affect the ending, but it seems like you may get the three base endings no matter what.  Perhaps though small things change in each one depending on other choices, that will be interesting.\n\nThere's a lot of good about this game.  I wish the story could be a bit better, but it's a solid effort to put forth something new and different.","May 26","true","9.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
