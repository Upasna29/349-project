Take it easy, shoot some pool like a pro and relax.  That's what you have Pool Nation for.  It's zero pressure, it's zero chaos. It's 100% cool, daddy-o.  It's got some great physics too, so you can shoot pool and feel like a king.\n\nBecause some times, you need to come home and pretend that you're a slick mo-fo pool shark.

If you're not already a billiards fan, Pool Nation won't make you one. Conversely, for those dying to scratch the billiards itch, Pool Nation is sure to satisfy. An entertaining, highly varied and technically excellent pool game, even if lacking in innovation or new elements for its genre.With Pool Nation you'll get a pooling experience that you've never had before. The simulator delivers several game modes and a lot of options to choose from. Every kind of shot that you can imagine is possible to make in the game and because of that you can truly speak of a great simulator. Another big plus are the graphics, which are truly stunning for a low budget title. Overall, Cherry Pop Games's first endeavour has left us with a fantastic billiards game featuring stunning visuals, great audio and even better physics. The lengthy, albeit difficult career mode, will give you plenty of play time but perhaps for the wrong reasons. If you're looking for a realistic, stylish, and fun billiards game, Pool Nation is the cream of the crop.","July 5, 2014","true","43.4"," 54 of 62 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","54","62","0","4"

The solid gameplay and controls were not enough for Cherry Pop Games, they went ahead and added some beautiful locations each offered during day, sunset, and neon lit night time.

The game modes for single player include 3ball, 8ball, 9ball, endurance, golf, killer, rotation, speed, and straight. In addition, you can play online versus friends in a friendly match or choose to be competitive in tournament mode.

Lots of different game modes like 9-ball, 8-ball, endurance, and tournaments. Plus you can play online versus friends. The game offers good graphics, although they can be a little bit on the shiny side. The cue control system is mostly user friendly even though sometimes it can feel like a chore to set up a trick shot just right. Straight shots are extremely intuitive and the angle assistance makes it really easy to sink shots. Although bank shots and combos aren't so straightforward.\n\nThis is the first real pool game that I have played on the PC and quite frankly I wouldn't be surprised if it was the last.

Released as the maiden offering from Cherry Pop Games, it’s gorgeous visuals, multiple game modes, lengthy campaign and lots of unlockables will keep Pool fans coming back for more.\n\nCampaign | Gameplay: Gamers have the choice of playing standard 8-ball or variations like 9-ball, Rotation, Endurance, Sudden Death etc across a variety of visually stunning locations / pool halls. A lengthy campaign mode (against AI opponents) allows you to perfect your game and strive toward numerous unlockables including new locations, pool table decals, new ball styles and cue styles. Additionally, the online mode allows you to match up with friends or other online players in single matches, Tournaments or King of the Hill events. Multiple difficulty levels (from Novice to Pro), a spot on physics engine, responsive controls, and a great soundtrack make this the best Pool game to date.\n\nFlaws: In considering its biggest issues – 1. Game Stability is poor (Tabbing to windows results in an insta-crash) and 2. Online Gaming is largely dead (Bring your own friends). Additionally, the developers have pushed the previously promised ‘Trick Shot’ mode to the next release, and the lack of Co-op play is disappointing as well.\n\nOverall, ‘Pool Nation’ is the best conception of a Billiards game to date and fans of the real game will find this a fun, polished distraction. But, even ardent fans soon realize that Pool without the smoky basement rooms, uneven cues, pitchers of beer, chatty girls, side-bets and bar-room trash talk, is a somewhat hollow experience.

Most billiards games like to focus only on either 8- or 9-ball.  Those games are here, but they do not stop at that.  Along the game, other games like Rotation and Golf are in the mix.  With nine different ways currently available with Snooker and Trick coming soon, there are plenty of ways to play.\n\nAnother strong point about the game is the controls.  Like in any other pool game, being able to control the cue ball is important.  Most games simply allow you to aim the ball and adjust the power.  Even though most games stop at this, there are more options to offer.  By being able to adjust the angle of the cue stick as well as where on the cue ball to aim, it gives the option of doing jump and swerve shots, something most billiard games leave out.  Additionally, with a full tutorial teaching how to do all of these moves, it does not take long before they become second nature.\n\nBeyond all the gameplay details, a nice touch about the game is the amount of customization available.  Even games that try to simulate pro billiards tend to stick to a single, sometimes sponsored look throughout the game.  This one goes beyond the basics.  As soon as you start a game, the highly detailed and moving locals make it feel like you are in what could be a real location.  As you keep progressing, at least a dozen locals, cue sticks, ball sets, and even table decals make it that regardless your taste, there is plenty to see even from a visual standpoint.\n\nOnce the single-player game is over, there is still more to play.  Through online multiplayer, it is possible to keep playing with others.  It is even possible to create tournaments to learn who the best player is.  However, the one drawback is that there is no local multiplayer mode available.  This means that in order to play with another person in the same room, the two of you must play through a network.  This feels like a major oversight.  A simple hot seat patch would have made that the game could be a great party game.  Even without local multiplayer, this is still a great package that any billiards fan can easily enjoy.","July 13, 2014","true","62.9"," 17 of 25 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","17","25","0","0"

Beautiful textures, great physics and enough variation in games to keep you busy for a while. Best of all it runs great on my old-as-dirt PC.\n\nMultiplayer is a blast, especially if you can get a group together for a tournament. The free roaming camera allows for amazingly framed shots when you are brodcasting the game. Your spectators won't get bored!\n\nMultiple levels of difficulty are present, and should gbe used if you are looking for a challenge. The novice mode is only good for the first few rounds, as it reveals quite a bit of the ball paths. My only complaint here is that champion mode perhaps reveals too much as well (Cue ball only).\n\nTricks shots are a blast to pull of and never get old. Experimenting with angles and english prove to be highly satisfying. Especially when you pot the winning shot with a knifes edge.\n\nLooking forward to the new mode: Box of Tricks, and maybe Trading cards?

I will explain: The english in Pool Nation does not accurately represent the way in which a ball would travel with said spin. Top and bottom english when making a cut shot can cause the cue ball to travel more left or right on the deflection, and this is not represented at all.\n\nLeft/right english isn't actually as useful on a pool table as an amateur might think. I rarely use left/right english in real pool, as top/bottom english can account for most necessary ball control.\n\nAs I can best explain it: Top and bottom english account most for how the cue ball deflects off the object ball, and left/right english effects the way the cue ball deflects off rails. There is a small amount of effect with left/right on ball deflection, and top/bottom on rail deflection, but it is very slight.\n\nThis has to do with the fact that the rail is a solid unmovable force, and ball deflection is sympathetic to mass/friction.\n\nMy previous pool experience makes this game very unintuitive!","May 6, 2015","false","0.9"," 32 of 56 people (57%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","57","32","56","6","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/254440/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","Pool Nation is one of the most polished indie games of 2013- the animations are shiny and smooth, the gameplay is responsive and the physics are realistic. You won't find yourself screaming at this game for bouncing your balls in the wrong direction, or glitching out and dropping your cue ball through the table. With eleven game modes including tournaments, online play, and single-player endurance mode; as well as a slew of collectables to unlock, Pool Nation has no shortage of goodies to keep gameplay fresh.\n\nThe single player component revolves primarily around tournaments where you take on AI challengers of ever increasing difficulty. Each match has an associated list of challenges, and completing them unlocks a variety of cosmetic changes like cues and balls. Standard games like 9 ball are present along with more interesting options like Golf, which challenges you to put specific balls into specific pockets. There’s also a time attack style mode, where balls spawn on the table and you have to sink as many as possible in the time limit. There are Free Play, Versus, and Online modes present too, but I had a hard time finding anyone to challenge online.\n\nPool Nation is a great looking game that features bright and shiny graphics that makes each game, literally, feel new and different. There are some good themes on the game's soundtrack, and though the game's controls look difficult to use, they aren't difficult to learn. There are also options that can be easily turned on or off to give players assists in a game including arrows that point at the next balls that need to be hit or arrows that show where a ball will travel when hit. All of these features combine to make an excellent presentation for Pool Nation.\n\nBut is it fun? In short stints I definitely enjoyed playing the game, but it isn’t the type of thing I’d want to play for hours at a time. Having said that, I think Pool Nation is the kind of experience that would be a hit at a house party. If you’ve been searching far and wide for a Billiards simulator, and don’t have room for an actual table, Pool Nation is probably the solution. The physics are solid, the controls allow for extreme fine tuning of shots, and everything looks super shiny. A few more game types would be welcome, but for $10 Pool Nation is the gold standard in the category.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=382462339\n\nHighly Recommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","January 27, 2015","true","5.8"," 23 of 39 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","23","39","2","0"

I wanted a lobby system where people could link up and pick rooms, and servers to play in with friends. I wanted it more social (like old yahoo pool) where you could have many people watching, chatting in the chat box and getting ready to play winner.

It makes the grade in the areas critical to this type of game:  the physics are sound,the shot-making is clean, and there's enough variety in the game types to keep things fresh for a while.  On top of that, the game is downright beautiful.\n\nThere are some flaws, but nothing game-breaking.  The most glaring (for me, anyway) was that the game feels literally empty.  When shooting, you're shooting in a seemingly deserted hall.  There's no crowd, no opponent squirming in the chair as you knock the balls down.  Speaking of your opponents, while their descriptions are modestly humorous, there's little to differentiate them from one to the next.  At times it feels a bit sterile.  Again, this isn't really game-breaking.  But part of the allure of playing at the bar or hall is the atmosphere, and the game is lacking in that regard.\n\nAll in all, though, the plusses outweigh the minuses.

Let me make this as plain as possible. If you like pool and can find this cheap, check it out. It's not bad at all. I think the controls are better here in many ways than I've seen in previous PC pool games, but what's the game really like? You get nine ball, eight ball, and a few mini-games. There is a trick mode that hasn't been put into the game yet apparently. The humor is painful mostly, but not always bad. Just never very clever or subtle.\n\nAs for the negative stuff: I think it gets repetitious. It's also buggy. I don't like the AI at all, as it sometimes seems too transparent what's happening in the game. Some of the rounds a really good AI player will goof several times in a row to give me a chance to beat it. Other times it feels like it's cheating to win.  Sometimes the match challenges don't appear to count properly or are too literally applied, and it seems inconsistant with its application of what meets the requirements of a given challenge. For example, I played a match that wanted me to get a 3 ball streak with a jump shot. I got a 4 ball streak with a jump at the end and it didn't count it. The next time I played, it seemed to count it. So I just don't trust the AI at all. Also, some of the designer ball sets that you can unlock confuse me visually because the stripes and solids look too similar to me from a distance. The settings are very colorful, which isn't necessarily bad, but can be VERY loud.\n\nAnyway, even though this seems a negative review, it's not meant to be. The devs say they are working to improve it, and if they do I think it has a lot of potential. As it is, if you can get it for a very low price and you like pool, try it. I've enjoyed playing it, but it can be frustrating at times.","August 29, 2014","true","44.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Once, it actually crashed as I was hitting the 8 ball in for a win.\nThank goodness, that seems to have stopped, though the exit problem still persists. It's a minor glitch, which alone, will certainly not stop me from playing.\nI mean, it would be nice if they'd fix it... but, honestly, in my mind, task manager has pretty much become the default mode of exit now, anyway.\n\nNote: I bought this during a Steam sale for less than half the regular price.

Let me make this as plain as possible. If you like pool and can find this cheap, check it out. It's not bad at all. I think the controls are better here in many ways than I've seen in previous PC pool games, but what's the game really like? You get nine ball, eight ball, and a few mini-games. There is a trick mode that hasn't been put into the game yet apparently. The humor is painful mostly, but not always bad. Just never very clever or subtle.\n\nAs for the negative stuff: I think it gets repetitious. It's also buggy. I don't like the AI at all, as it sometimes seems too transparent what's happening in the game. Some of the rounds a really good AI player will goof several times in a row to give me a chance to beat it. Other times it feels like it's cheating to win.  Sometimes the match challenges don't appear to count properly or are too literally applied, and it seems inconsistant with its application of what meets the requirements of a given challenge. For example, I played a match that wanted me to get a 3 ball streak with a jump shot. I got a 4 ball streak with a jump at the end and it didn't count it. The next time I played, it seemed to count it. So I just don't trust the AI at all. Also, some of the designer ball sets that you can unlock confuse me visually because the stripes and solids look too similar to me from a distance. The settings are very colorful, which isn't necessarily bad, but can be VERY loud.\n\nAnyway, even though this seems a negative review, it's not meant to be. The devs say they are working to improve it, and if they do I think it has a lot of potential. As it is, if you can get it for a very low price and you like pool, try it. I've enjoyed playing it, but it can be frustrating at times.","August 29, 2014","true","44.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

There are a lot of opponents but they felt very identical to play against.  However, I wasn't working towards the challenges against each opponent and going for those could be fun, although they're usually pretty same-y (x match score, x-ball streak).  Additionally, there are actual stand-alone challenges but of the few I played they were pretty boring.  While they did break up gameplay when I found it necessary, the AI is so unpredictable  that modes like speed challenge or 3 ball just aren't that much fun.\n\nAs a 8-Ball and 9-ball simulator, though, this game is pretty excellent.  The physics work, there's a guiding shot marker to help  you learn how to shoot better (this can also be turned off, or reduced) and the game is pretty.  Pool Nations ia  large step up from those crappy flash games.\n\nOnline play seems functional.  At the very least I didn't have any issues with it.  For online play there are a lot of interesting game modes past 8 and 9 ball including 3 ball, straight, rotation, speed, and killer.  Of those I only tried killer (possibly speed in the campaign) and it was fun, though it felt more like a quick distraction between a few rounds of 8 ball.\n\nSo yes, I recommend this game.  It's much, much better for me than driving down to the Pool Hall, especially when I can't guarantee I'll have anyone to play.  This is something I needed in my life and it's nice to have, but I also recognize that it's probably not for everyone.  I've only played a handful of times and only for a few hours total.  It's definitely a pick up and play for a few rounds and then put it down for a few weeks kind of game, though that is exactly what I wanted.\n\nOh, and I guess there are features that haven't been implemented yet but are on their way like the box of tricks.  That mode seems fairly interesting.","October 13, 2014","true","5.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mctittles/recommended/254440/","mctittles","Baldwin Kombat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mctittles/","325 products in account","First off, this is the best looking pool game I have ever played.  Period.\nBeautiful pool tables, balls, and environments that are fully fleshed out and animated to give you a real sense of immersion.\n\nThe game is full of details that kept surprising me.  Some of them are so subtle that you can't even notice it unless you are watching the replay.  Here are a few things you will find:\n\n* 3rd dimension: this isn't a simple pool game where balls stick to the table.  All pool balls can be knocked off, up in the air, and over other balls (given enough force).\n* When hit certain ways, chalk will fall off stick and sprinkle on the table.\n* Tiny woven texture on table material when you zoom in close\n* Sides of table (bumpers) actually give and bend in when a ball hits them with force (very hard to notice without replay!)\n\nFor single player there is enough to keep you busy for awhile with tournaments in various game types against different AI.  One thing I found keeping my interest is bonuses you can try for on each game in a tournament.  For instance one might have a bonus for pulling off a jump shot during the match.  You can still win the game, but there will be a bonus for doing the jump shot.  Earning these stars while winning makes for a fun challenge.\nThere are also many ball styles, cue sticks, and locations to unlock through single player.  So far every ball set I have unlocked has been great looking and is a good incentive to keep playing and unlock more.\n\nFor multiplayer, it is fully functional in both same computer and online play.  Unsurprisingly you have to wait awhile for a game to show up, but that's less the fault of the game and more of the popularity of online pool :).\n\nLast I should go over the physics.  This is a tough point to argue because so many factors go into pool physics and without a doubt there is no game out there that is 100% accurate.  If you have ever seen a ball hit another ball at high speed in close up slow motion you'll see what I mean.  Not to mention there are many different ball sizes/weight, table materials and cue sticks used in different areas that add to the difficulty in comparing this to the real world.\n\nAll I can say for sure is the physics seem real and have been really fun.  Added to the ability to hit the ball just where I want at power levels I never could in RL the game makes you feel like a pool master.\n\nGame is on sale for $1.99 currently.

It is most certainly a woppingly spiffing game, and I must say, it does rather feel as if you are really playing this fine game in real life! You are able to do tournaments, do some rather excellent trick shots and although the challenges make me want to throw my tea across the room sometimes (which would be a scandal!) it only makes you want to play it more and take those challenges head on. By golly! I give this riveting game 4 Cups of Tea out of 5! Tally-Ho!","May 21, 2014","true","24.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

There is a ton of achievements to be unlocked and replayability is great.\n\nThere are, however, a few problems with this game:\na) If you simply want a quick game, it isn't so quick, because there are lots of menus to go through, and the cutscenes before the game starts are painfully long.\nb) the graphics are great, beautiful, but some of them very unrealistic when it comes to pool tables. The developers did a great job exploring the rendering engine they had in hand, but I believe there was no need for so many fancy and colored pool tables and balls. IMHO, a pool table has to be green. Forget about everything else, because it just gets in the way of the game.\n\nNeverthless, Pool Nation is a great game, worth every penny. I am not afraid to say it is possibly the best pool game ever made, and the closest thing to a pool/billiard/snooker simulator.\n\nIf the developers ever read this, I have a suggestion: make it possible to create custom game rules, like we do in real life.","May 22, 2014","true","13.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I think it is even the only pool table game on Steam! That is great because I love pool table.\n\nThe graphics are fantastic, and the style is very modern. You are usually playing in a tall apartment building.\n\nThe AI's are very smart, I wish they could use the AI's as a feature. They could make two AI's play against each other, creating a randomly generated game of pool table. I think it would be fun to watch!\n\nAnyways, I read some reviews about the .exe crashing, and unfortunately, as good as this game is, the glitch is true. The game does crash, almost every play through. I got one in my first minute opening the game. Then I tried again, and then it happened after 30 minutes of playing. It is really hard to sit down and enjoy the game when it randomly crashes. You never know when either, sometimes it's during the splash screen, and sometimes during gameplay.\n\nIt is hard to sit down, relax, and enjoy the game, when it crashes spontaneously. The developers have a gem, and they are letting a stupid glitch put it to waste.\n\nPlease fix the game. And also do the AI thing! I'd love to see 2 AI's play against each other.

Full HD, good physics, nice gfx & sfx, local and also online mp wich is easy to access and uses steam functions like invite friend from friendlist. The difficulty in the standart setting for a experienced pool player is way to easy - you will feel like a billiardproof when having all the helping lines turn on. IF you turn off the helping lines or just set them to one of the 4 other presets like champion the game will become more like the real feeling because not every shot will be a putting. Different type of Billiard games makes it interesting to play again. And there is also a snooker mode announced wich i look forward too. Play this with a friend online or local is the most fun, but also the single player option serve some fun. For experienced and for newcomers this game is worth every penny. You can even train your real skills this way without killing some poolshops tables ^^. As some kind of bonus you can customize your tables , cues and also all the billiard balls.","January 16, 2014","true","17.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Controls feel great, especially using the mouse as a virtual cue system. Graphics are crisp and colourful with great reflections on balls. Sound is good, music isn't too annoying buy can be turned off if you prefer (which I do). Its challaneging with every game in its tournaments having 3 stars you can unlock for doing specific things like skill shots or winning without losing a frame etc. This means even if you win the tournaments you can go back to specific matches in the tournaments to try and unlock the stars. Lots of unlockable cues, ball sets, locations and decals for the tables.\n\nMy only downside would be that I hoped more people would be playing this game online. I have found and played people online but there doesn't appear to be many.

This is great, relaxing and fun pool game, many gaming modes and lots of fun. The only thing I don't like about it is the fact it doesn't gave PUB location. All locations are a bit way too shiny for me. So, we do need PUB location, not so shiny balls and an option to insert our own music to game via jukebox in the corner, because to be honest, music in the game is as far away from the pool as I can imagine it.\n\nIf you want to play a nice game of pool, look no further, Pool Nation is great.","January 25, 2014","true","9.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/okram/recommended/254440/","okram","okram2k","http://steamcommunity.com/id/okram/","289 products in account","This game really caught my eye on steam, and how could it not, it’s so very very shiny. Released originally on PSN Cherry Pop ported their billiards game over to the PC and is available for $10 via steam.\n\nWhat we have here is really a modern pool game. A sparkling beautiful graphics engine combined with an impressive realistic physics engine all to send shiny balls flying around a table. It’s smooth, it’s pretty, it’s gorgeous. (click on some of my high-res screenshots and see for yourself!) Really what else do you need to know? If you like pool games then it’s for you, if you don’t, all the shiny graphics in the world probably won’t change your mind. What you might expect from a pool game is all here, an 8-ball and 9-ball tour to play through with slowly increasing difficulty as well as some other game modes to throw in some variety.\n\nThere are also arbitrary points systems that award you points based upon added difficulty of shots (kinda like the way skater games give you points for harder tricks) and as you progress through each tour there are challenges to meet in each match to unlock extra goodies. It’s all your typical completionist fluff we’ve grown to expect from games these days but they do add some extra challenge and drives you to try to be more creative as you play. I also found I enjoyed most of the challenge modes that are unlocked during the tour play although a couple get a little tedious and boring.\n\nEverything in the game is well crafted, the table is high textured, the balls well polished and reflective, and even the backgrounds are rich with detail and eye candy. The art style is beautiful and there’s even interesting little blurbs written about each opponent you play against. But all of this eye candy is just background noise to distract you from pocketing those balls! The game really shines though when it comes to trick-shots. Jump shots, draw backs, kick shots, even riding the rail is all possible with the engine. With full control to put on as much english and angle on your shot as you’d like you can put together some pretty sweet shots. Thanks to the shot guides they are not very difficult to learn and once you start pulling them off with regularity your options with each shot open wide. Best of all, the AI knows and uses them just as well which creates quite a challenge as you progress through the game.\n\nThe trick-shots are definitely best seen in video as screenshots cannot do them proper justice. You’ll be hopping over balls and making crazy draw backs in no time making you feel quite the awesome player. The game is, however, not without it’s flaws. A common complaint I have of many games, the music started to get annoying to me but this is not the first game I’ve had to mute the music and play my own. It is also clear that it is a port rather than designed specifically for the PC.\n\nThe menus sometimes feel a bit awkward navigating with a mouse and I feel some of the controls are awkward. For example rotating my cue around the cue ball to line up a shot only involves moving mouse left or right, yet my natural inclination is to try to circle the mouse around the cue ball. It made for some very frustrating moments until I realized this. Also I found the video replay system to be- clunky at best. Still even with these small complaints I’d definitely recommend the game if you ever find yourself wanting to shoot some pool.\nNailed it!\n\nNailed it!\nFinal Score:\nGraphics: 10/10\nGame Play: 8/10\nMusic / Ambiance: 8/10\nStory: -/10\nValue: 8/10\nOverall: 8.5/10\n\nRead more indy game reviews on my blog!\nhttp://markofithian.com","November 26, 2013","true","6.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

People buying it know exactly what the game is: billiards.  It's not like there is at all any surprise.  You don't get surprised that Taco Bell serves tacos so why would you be surprised a game called Pool Nation is anything but pool?\n\nOverall I found it to be addictive fun.  When I bought it, the game was at I'd say a dollar and it was the best thing I've ever bought with only one dollar (NOT EVEN TAX!) I could have bought gum or soda with that $1 but that won't last me and is not as enjoyable as something you can share in an online session with.\n\nIf you like or would want to learn about playing pool, this game is honestly the best (and only) pool game I know of.  The only con is that because it is for the computer, the gameplay takes some time to get used to (whether you use the keyboard or a controller).  However, the amount of time it takes you to learn how to play with buttons (versus using an actual pool stick) is time that you also gain experience and tips; so realistically you are not losing anything but gaining more than you pay for!  Being taught how to play a sport (that can be used for real life) is so worth paying only a dollar for.  McDonald's doesn't even have a dollar menu anymore; it's like $1.50.  Though I was fortunate at the time and the game is back to its' original price, the pirce is $9.99 (NOT EVEN $10!!) so it's not too bad a price.\n\nI SAY GET IT!!! But who am I to say?  See for yourself.  You won't be displeased.\n\n+Physics: Way too realistic! :)\n+Price: Cheap!!! :)\n+Customizable: To some degree.\n+ Music: Relaxing (If you are immature like me, I thought of porno background music).\n","December 29, 2014","true","6.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I'm a long time Virtual Pool player (15+ years). Physics could be a teeny bit better, like the english (ball spin) physics. In real life, pockets on a pool table have angled cushions around the pocket to help your ball in, should you hit them correctly...In this game however, if you don't hit the ball straight into the pocket, it's not going in. If you hit the angled portion around the pocket, it will just reject your ball much of the time, really unforgiving but challenging. Hard to explain...think of a basketball hoop where if you didn't swish the ball, the ball would never go in.\n\nI don't use that aim assist or flashback bullcrap either. That's for sissies!\n\nEasy on the eyes and shiny as hell, though. I think the lighting on the balls (ha, balls) could be a lot better. Also, like the virtual pool series, it's a great game to play and mute all the in-game sound if you're in the mood to rock out to some of your mp3s, you can fully enjoy your music and the game at the same time.\n\nThe game is still in development so I think it will improve over time.

Graphically, it borders on being a tech demo for high end lighting and reflection effects. It's ridiculously shiny. The felt looks like felt. (I would not be surprised to see this game come bundled with every graphics card released in the next five years. It makes your GPU look like a hero.) The physics are just as good: crisp and consistent. Lots of game modes. Lots of cue sticks, balls, table decals, and pool halls to unlock. (I've played for 9 hours, I'm reasonably good at pool, and I've only opened up the easiest fourth of the unlockables.) Thanks to the quirky descriptions of your opponents before the matches, the game ends up having a ton of personality, considering it doesn't render the players at all, only their ghostly, floating sticks. It's got solid multiplayer, at least for two people. By people I mean friends. You can play big tournaments, in theory, with larger groups of strangers.\n\nPerhaps most importantly in the context of 2014 gaming, Pool Nation is getting continued love and support from its devs. Snooker and "Box of Tricks" are both coming soon as free updates, and the devs are active in the forums.\n\nAs I write this, the game is on sale for $1.50.

The control of the cue, the physics of the balls, and the plausibility of the shots either make me feel like I'm being guided through the game or is so uncomfortable playing that it's just not enjoyable.  Video billiards has always reminded my of video pinball in that there just isn't a video game that can capture the feel of playing.  While this game "Pool Nation" won't replace the actual feel of playing actual billiards... it's miles ahead of many billiards video game I've played that are out there.  The only comparable game is "Virtual Pool 4", which is a good simulation but "Pool Nation" graphics are a bit better and this game seems a little more reactive to your intent for playing.  In other words, this game "Pool Nation"seems to be a bit more user friendly when trying to do what you want on the table than VP4 is.\n\nThe game gives you excellent control of the cue that includes spin, english, angle, and power.  The controls are easy to learn but I highly recommend the tutorial in game to learn it.  It's short enough not to get boring and you need to learn the skills to play the game and the tutorial treats each lesson as a segment to complete and check off.  The ball physics are a good feel.  I can see myself lining up the shots and predicting the shots as I would on a regular billiard table.  Nothing's perfect of course but the devs did a good job here in my opinion.\n\nThere are billiard circuits to play for single player and multiplayer.  There's leaderboards, achievements, and trading cards.  Steam Workshop seems like a natural for this type of game where you should be able to customize locations, cues, tables, rooms, or even players etc.. A good pool game for a nice price... on sale of course.","July 4, 2014","true","4.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cannedfeces/recommended/254440/","cannedfeces","ploq","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cannedfeces/","255 products in account","I think Pool Nation is one of those games that knows exactly what it is, and doesn't try to be anything it's not. Pool Nation is a billiards game, that's it. It's a slick-looking multiplayer/singleplayer campain billiards game.\n\nAnd it's fun as hell.\n\nWeirdly enough, I'm comparing this to Sniper Elite V2. While the two games' topics are in no way similar, both play out in coincidentaly similar ways. For example, both Pool Nation and Sniper Elite V2 hav slick, shiny graphics that look AMAZING. The graphics on both games look professionally made and I just love it. Graphics haven't been a huge thing for me, but wow, Pool Nation's graphics are actually better that Call of Duty Ghosts, and to top it off, my computer can run it.\n\nAnother weird similarity is the "killcams". In Sniper Elite V2, if you hit the enemy in a certain place, the camera pans out to the bullet or the enemy, and you get to watch the enemy get shot up close. In Pool Nation, if you make a Skill Shot or just a nice looking shot, the camera sets up on the hole, and you watch the ball fly in. The only difference is, Pool Nation does this less. For me, almost every shot in Sniper Elite was a killcam, and it got annoying as hell (except the ball shots). But the killcams only happen periodically in Pool Nation, and THANK YOU SO MUCH for doing so.\n\nAnd the last thing, if you think about it just a tad, playing pool is almost like sniping. You have to aim carefully at a specifis target (and in some cases many targets) and shoot. Not only to you target all if the solid or striped balls in pool, but you also aim at a certain hole and shoot! How weird is that?\n\nSo now you know why I compared Pool Nation and Sniper Elite V2. Pretty good comparision if you ask me, but overall I think Pool Nation is worth your money. It's an amazing pool game, but its not Steam's only pool game.Buy it and hit me up.","August 2, 2014","true","6.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JamieTheD/recommended/254440/","JamieTheD","JamieTheD","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JamieTheD/","745 products in account","Good Stuff: Pool Nation is pretty. Well, okay, you can quite plainly see that, but it's fairly pretty gameplay wise, too. Once you get the hang of the controls... Which is easy enough, because the tutorials are quite helpful, and the aiming sight, even on default settings, is actually useful for everything except hardcore kick shots... The game gives you that little bit of extra motivation to up your game by asking you to do challenges while you beat the AI's ♥♥♥.\n\n...Okay, the AI is also quite fair in this game, and so sometimes (especially on 3-ball, an event you'll love to hate) it'll kick your ♥♥♥. Beat a certain number of challenges, you'll get bonus levels. Beat bonus levels, or certain characters, and you'll get customisation for your table decals, cue decals, and ball style.\n\nProblems: There *is* online multiplayer for this game, but sadly, it's very, very dead, presumably because pool afficianados prefer a local fix (I sure do!) Also... The high reflection on the balls can sometimes make it difficult to tell what's what, even in Overhead view. Finally, the soundtrack, while chill, gets a little repetitive at times, and doesn't really cover that "Playin' Pool/Billiards in a pub/club" feel.\n\nConclusion: Even for the non-sale price, this game is worth the cash (5 hours in, and while I could *theoretically* beat the AI players in that time, 100%ing each players' challenges is a slightly different story), and for something to relax to, then wonder "Wait a minute, wasn't it 6PM a minute ago?", there's few better things than a game of 'puter Pool.","August 4, 2014","true","27.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

What is good about the game\n2. What is not so good\n\nTHE GOOD\nFirst off, the game is absolutely beautiful in every way; beautifully optimized, beautiful physics, beautiful graphics, etc.\nI've always enjoyed playing pool ever since I was young, whether it be at the arcade, bowling alley, or pool hall, I always enjoyed it; and up until this game, I considered the ONLY GOOD pool video game in existence is Pool Paradise[en.wikipedia.org], which I had owned for the Nintendo Gamecube and still have for pc. Pool Nation is a more modern version of Pool Paradise, doesn't have as many features as Pool Paradise (like Darts, Crazy Tables, Skee Ball, that canon and coconuts game, among things)\nI feel Pool Nation doesn't really live up to Pool Paradise, but is a good pool game, nonetheless; less than five minutes into my first playthrough of Pool Nation, I was immediately addicted to it.\n\nBut enough rambling, let's get down to what's good in Pool Nation.\nQuality:\nWithout a doubt, for an indie game, the quality is amazing. The optimization, which is usually lacking in indie games, is perfect.\nPhysics:\nThe physics engine is awesome, right up there with Pool Paradise. When I'd look at other pool games, other than Pool Paradise, the physics would be a disaster, either too stiff or too loose; Pool Nation's physics are as true to the real game as you can get. With precise cue control, you can curve, give spin, jump, etc, to your heart's content!\nTextures:\nThe textures are beautiful; from the detailed wood grain of the cues, to the fine threads of the pool table mat, everything's in stunning detail. With realtime ball reflections to stunning environments, Pool Nation is in a league all its own!\nMusic:\nAn awesome soundtrack is there to set the mood and keep you company while you play. From light piano music, to downright funky, it's got you set. With each location having its own custom music pieces, the variety is right up there.\nUnlocks:\nAs you progress and beat certain challenges, you can unlock new cues, ball sets, and mat decals; a vast array to accompany anyone's tastes and wants!\nSound:\nAs a sound designer, this is my bread and butter. Pool Nation's sounds are top notch; everything from the cue hitting the cue ball, the balls hitting each other, hitting the cushions, going into the pockets, and to bouncing off the table and hitting the floor are superb. I was actually surprised when I heard the ball bouncing on the floor after it left the table, nice and lively with reverb!\nEndurance:\nNot my most favorite gamemode ever, but it certainly is one that'll keep you on the edge of your seat, your palms will sweat, your heart will race, and will truly test how good and quick you are.\nSlow mo:\nThe slow mo feature is a nice touch. Your last ball is going for the pocket, you're not sure if it'll make it, the slow mo kicks in showing the pocket, as the ball eases in in stunning, glossy, detail, it slowly reaches the end of the mat, you're on the edge of your seat...BOOM it tips off the edge and goes in, you win! It's also great for those action shots with the ball cruising into the pocket.\nReplay:\nThe replay is awesome. Just pulled off the most amazing shot ever and want to see it again in slow mo? No problem, the replay feature's got your back! Everything from chalk dust to cushion distension can be seen in replay, and features allow you to slow down and move the camera to get a nice look on all the action that took place! (UPDATE, read below)\n\n\nTHE BAD\nIt pains me to say it but, not everything's perfect in this game.\n\nBUGS:\nOccasionally, the music will cut out and all you can hear is the ambience and regular sounds. Sometimes the music will come back, but sometimes it doesn't.\nRandom crashes. The game's full of them. Crashed on startup, crashed multiple times after beating and opponent. I think it's due to the saving. Trying to return to the game after Alt+Tabbing also causes the game to crash sometimes, other times you CAN'T get back in.\nChat. When typing in chat, sometimes a key will appear as though it was pressed more than once and sometimes not at all, causing "Sttuf  likkeths.  You knw wha   I mn?"\nYour cue, balls, and mat decal will sometimes reset to default. It always resets after restarting the game.\nCertain moves will not register, especially banks and kicks at certain times.\n\n\nEVERYTHING ELSE:\nThe chat can sometimes interfere with a shot.\nSome hud/menu things can also interfere with gameplay.\nSpin from the cue ball does not transfer to the object ball. A feature that takes away the realism. It's common physics, "for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction." The cue ball is spinning right, and when it hits the object ball, the object ball should spin left, therefore adding more control; even Pool Paradise had this feature.\nBag of Tricks REQUIRES purchasing dlc packs, without said dlc, you get a very small number of "Starter" objects, which don't help you create anything worth while.\nThe replay mechanic has been changed. You can no longer slow replays, it's either start off slow or build up to faster, or, reverse slow or build up. You can't start off normal speed and then do a dramatic slow down. The controls were changed, too and are, in my opinion, pretty condescending.\nA new dlc has been put in the store that will unlock ALL unlockables (other than dlc unlocks) without the need of having to progress which is, in my opinion, the lazy man's dlc.\n\nOther than that, this game is a must have for anybody who loves pool!","June 25, 2014","true","43.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game deserves a solid 9/10, losing out on full marks quite simply because the only thing it’s missing is pornstars wandering around in 6inch stilettos and lines of coke and rolled up 20 dollar bills laying haphazardly about the place.  What this game does extremely well, is that it makes you feel important. It draws you into a world where you can be the person you’ve always wanted to be in real life, a world where paying $15 for a drink wouldn’t make you penniless by end of the evening, a world where every woman wants to blow you and every dude……. Well who gives a f*#k if every chick wants to blow you right?? Pool Nation offers something different than any other pool game I’ve seen before. You can’t quite tell what it is but it’s shinier, sexier, it’s got more curves and it leaves you wanting more every time.

The single player and all its unlocks are fairly entertaining but the real joy is found in playing with friends. Unless you turn off the aim assist then you will soon find that you can breeze through the AI players without too much difficulty but, even with it on, it's not so easy to make all the unlocks as it is to win matches. This game is often found on sale (I picked it up from HumbleBundle for around £1.50) and represents astounding value for money. The graphics are clean and sharp and the ball physics are adequately realistic with the exception of some inexplicable ball-off-the-table incidents if you use too much power. 98% - There is simply no better computer simulation of Pool.","May 6, 2014","true","11.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The ability to play on your own in the lobby while waiting for friends to connect is one example of a small feature that makes a world of difference.\n\nThe other wonderful thing has been the active and friendly development staff who have been available online to answer questions, address bugs, and take suggestions for improvements and changes.

What is good about the game\n2. What is not so good\n\nTHE GOOD\nFirst off, the game is absolutely beautiful in every way; beautifully optimized, beautiful physics, beautiful graphics, etc.\nI've always enjoyed playing pool ever since I was young, whether it be at the arcade, bowling alley, or pool hall, I always enjoyed it; and up until this game, I considered the ONLY GOOD pool video game in existence is Pool Paradise[en.wikipedia.org], which I had owned for the Nintendo Gamecube and still have for pc. Pool Nation is a more modern version of Pool Paradise, doesn't have as many features as Pool Paradise (like Darts, Crazy Tables, Skee Ball, that canon and coconuts game, among things)\nI feel Pool Nation doesn't really live up to Pool Paradise, but is a good pool game, nonetheless; less than five minutes into my first playthrough of Pool Nation, I was immediately addicted to it.\n\nBut enough rambling, let's get down to what's good in Pool Nation.\nQuality:\nWithout a doubt, for an indie game, the quality is amazing. The optimization, which is usually lacking in indie games, is perfect.\nPhysics:\nThe physics engine is awesome, right up there with Pool Paradise. When I'd look at other pool games, other than Pool Paradise, the physics would be a disaster, either too stiff or too loose; Pool Nation's physics are as true to the real game as you can get. With precise cue control, you can curve, give spin, jump, etc, to your heart's content!\nTextures:\nThe textures are beautiful; from the detailed wood grain of the cues, to the fine threads of the pool table mat, everything's in stunning detail. With realtime ball reflections to stunning environments, Pool Nation is in a league all its own!\nMusic:\nAn awesome soundtrack is there to set the mood and keep you company while you play. From light piano music, to downright funky, it's got you set. With each location having its own custom music pieces, the variety is right up there.\nUnlocks:\nAs you progress and beat certain challenges, you can unlock new cues, ball sets, and mat decals; a vast array to accompany anyone's tastes and wants!\nSound:\nAs a sound designer, this is my bread and butter. Pool Nation's sounds are top notch; everything from the cue hitting the cue ball, the balls hitting each other, hitting the cushions, going into the pockets, and to bouncing off the table and hitting the floor are superb. I was actually surprised when I heard the ball bouncing on the floor after it left the table, nice and lively with reverb!\nEndurance:\nNot my most favorite gamemode ever, but it certainly is one that'll keep you on the edge of your seat, your palms will sweat, your heart will race, and will truly test how good and quick you are.\nSlow mo:\nThe slow mo feature is a nice touch. Your last ball is going for the pocket, you're not sure if it'll make it, the slow mo kicks in showing the pocket, as the ball eases in in stunning, glossy, detail, it slowly reaches the end of the mat, you're on the edge of your seat...BOOM it tips off the edge and goes in, you win! It's also great for those action shots with the ball cruising into the pocket.\nReplay:\nThe replay is awesome. Just pulled off the most amazing shot ever and want to see it again in slow mo? No problem, the replay feature's got your back! Everything from chalk dust to cushion distension can be seen in replay, and features allow you to slow down and move the camera to get a nice look on all the action that took place! (UPDATE, read below)\n\n\nTHE BAD\nIt pains me to say it but, not everything's perfect in this game.\n\nBUGS:\nOccasionally, the music will cut out and all you can hear is the ambience and regular sounds. Sometimes the music will come back, but sometimes it doesn't.\nRandom crashes. The game's full of them. Crashed on startup, crashed multiple times after beating and opponent. I think it's due to the saving. Trying to return to the game after Alt+Tabbing also causes the game to crash sometimes, other times you CAN'T get back in.\nChat. When typing in chat, sometimes a key will appear as though it was pressed more than once and sometimes not at all, causing "Sttuf  likkeths.  You knw wha   I mn?"\nYour cue, balls, and mat decal will sometimes reset to default. It always resets after restarting the game.\nCertain moves will not register, especially banks and kicks at certain times.\n\n\nEVERYTHING ELSE:\nThe chat can sometimes interfere with a shot.\nSome hud/menu things can also interfere with gameplay.\nSpin from the cue ball does not transfer to the object ball. A feature that takes away the realism. It's common physics, "for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction." The cue ball is spinning right, and when it hits the object ball, the object ball should spin left, therefore adding more control; even Pool Paradise had this feature.\nBag of Tricks REQUIRES purchasing dlc packs, without said dlc, you get a very small number of "Starter" objects, which don't help you create anything worth while.\nThe replay mechanic has been changed. You can no longer slow replays, it's either start off slow or build up to faster, or, reverse slow or build up. You can't start off normal speed and then do a dramatic slow down. The controls were changed, too and are, in my opinion, pretty condescending.\nA new dlc has been put in the store that will unlock ALL unlockables (other than dlc unlocks) without the need of having to progress which is, in my opinion, the lazy man's dlc.\n\nOther than that, this game is a must have for anybody who loves pool!","June 25, 2014","true","43.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game deserves a solid 9/10, losing out on full marks quite simply because the only thing it’s missing is pornstars wandering around in 6inch stilettos and lines of coke and rolled up 20 dollar bills laying haphazardly about the place.  What this game does extremely well, is that it makes you feel important. It draws you into a world where you can be the person you’ve always wanted to be in real life, a world where paying $15 for a drink wouldn’t make you penniless by end of the evening, a world where every woman wants to blow you and every dude……. Well who gives a f*#k if every chick wants to blow you right?? Pool Nation offers something different than any other pool game I’ve seen before.

Actually, that's not really accurate, because there are a great many components of the game that work seamlessly together, including the lobby, multiplayer connection, freeplay for practicing for a no-stress way to improve your game, and a wry sense of humor. The ability to play on your own in the lobby while waiting for friends to connect is one example of a small feature that makes a world of difference.\n\nThe other wonderful thing has been the active and friendly development staff who have been available online to answer questions, address bugs, and take suggestions for improvements and changes. All in all a wonderful effort at a great price, and I hope the devs are able to continue to support it and continue bringing their level of quality control to their next game.","February 7, 2014","true","33.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The control of the cue, the physics of the balls, and the plausibility of the shots either make me feel like I'm being guided through the game or is so uncomfortable playing that it's just not enjoyable.  Video billiards has always reminded my of video pinball in that there just isn't a video game that can capture the feel of playing.  While this game "Pool Nation" won't replace the actual feel of playing actual billiards... it's miles ahead of many billiards video game I've played that are out there.  The only comparable game is "Virtual Pool 4", which is a good simulation but "Pool Nation" graphics are a bit better and this game seems a little more reactive to your intent for playing.  In other words, this game "Pool Nation"seems to be a bit more user friendly when trying to do what you want on the table than VP4 is.\n\nThe game gives you excellent control of the cue that includes spin, english, angle, and power.  The controls are easy to learn but I highly recommend the tutorial in game to learn it.  It's short enough not to get boring and you need to learn the skills to play the game and the tutorial treats each lesson as a segment to complete and check off.  The ball physics are a good feel.  I can see myself lining up the shots and predicting the shots as I would on a regular billiard table.  Nothing's perfect of course but the devs did a good job here in my opinion.\n\nThere are billiard circuits to play for single player and multiplayer.  There's leaderboards, achievements, and trading cards.  Steam Workshop seems like a natural for this type of game where you should be able to customize locations, cues, tables, rooms, or even players etc.. A good pool game for a nice price... on sale of course.","July 4, 2014","true","4.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

What is good about the game\n2. What is not so good\n\nTHE GOOD\nFirst off, the game is absolutely beautiful in every way; beautifully optimized, beautiful physics, beautiful graphics, etc.\nI've always enjoyed playing pool ever since I was young, whether it be at the arcade, bowling alley, or pool hall, I always enjoyed it; and up until this game, I considered the ONLY GOOD pool video game in existence is Pool Paradise[en.wikipedia.org], which I had owned for the Nintendo Gamecube and still have for pc. Pool Nation is a more modern version of Pool Paradise, doesn't have as many features as Pool Paradise (like Darts, Crazy Tables, Skee Ball, that canon and coconuts game, among things)\nI feel Pool Nation doesn't really live up to Pool Paradise, but is a good pool game, nonetheless; less than five minutes into my first playthrough of Pool Nation, I was immediately addicted to it.\n\nBut enough rambling, let's get down to what's good in Pool Nation.\nQuality:\nWithout a doubt, for an indie game, the quality is amazing. The optimization, which is usually lacking in indie games, is perfect.\nPhysics:\nThe physics engine is awesome, right up there with Pool Paradise. When I'd look at other pool games, other than Pool Paradise, the physics would be a disaster, either too stiff or too loose; Pool Nation's physics are as true to the real game as you can get. With precise cue control, you can curve, give spin, jump, etc, to your heart's content!\nTextures:\nThe textures are beautiful; from the detailed wood grain of the cues, to the fine threads of the pool table mat, everything's in stunning detail. With realtime ball reflections to stunning environments, Pool Nation is in a league all its own!\nMusic:\nAn awesome soundtrack is there to set the mood and keep you company while you play. From light piano music, to downright funky, it's got you set. With each location having its own custom music pieces, the variety is right up there.\nUnlocks:\nAs you progress and beat certain challenges, you can unlock new cues, ball sets, and mat decals; a vast array to accompany anyone's tastes and wants!\nSound:\nAs a sound designer, this is my bread and butter. Pool Nation's sounds are top notch; everything from the cue hitting the cue ball, the balls hitting each other, hitting the cushions, going into the pockets, and to bouncing off the table and hitting the floor are superb. I was actually surprised when I heard the ball bouncing on the floor after it left the table, nice and lively with reverb!\nEndurance:\nNot my most favorite gamemode ever, but it certainly is one that'll keep you on the edge of your seat, your palms will sweat, your heart will race, and will truly test how good and quick you are.\nSlow mo:\nThe slow mo feature is a nice touch. Your last ball is going for the pocket, you're not sure if it'll make it, the slow mo kicks in showing the pocket, as the ball eases in in stunning, glossy, detail, it slowly reaches the end of the mat, you're on the edge of your seat...BOOM it tips off the edge and goes in, you win! It's also great for those action shots with the ball cruising into the pocket.\nReplay:\nThe replay is awesome. Just pulled off the most amazing shot ever and want to see it again in slow mo? No problem, the replay feature's got your back! Everything from chalk dust to cushion distension can be seen in replay, and features allow you to slow down and move the camera to get a nice look on all the action that took place! (UPDATE, read below)\n\n\nTHE BAD\nIt pains me to say it but, not everything's perfect in this game.\n\nBUGS:\nOccasionally, the music will cut out and all you can hear is the ambience and regular sounds. Sometimes the music will come back, but sometimes it doesn't.\nRandom crashes. The game's full of them. Crashed on startup, crashed multiple times after beating and opponent. I think it's due to the saving. Trying to return to the game after Alt+Tabbing also causes the game to crash sometimes, other times you CAN'T get back in.\nChat. When typing in chat, sometimes a key will appear as though it was pressed more than once and sometimes not at all, causing "Sttuf  likkeths.  You knw wha   I mn?"\nYour cue, balls, and mat decal will sometimes reset to default. It always resets after restarting the game.\nCertain moves will not register, especially banks and kicks at certain times.\n\n\nEVERYTHING ELSE:\nThe chat can sometimes interfere with a shot.\nSome hud/menu things can also interfere with gameplay.\nSpin from the cue ball does not transfer to the object ball. A feature that takes away the realism. It's common physics, "for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction." The cue ball is spinning right, and when it hits the object ball, the object ball should spin left, therefore adding more control; even Pool Paradise had this feature.\nBag of Tricks REQUIRES purchasing dlc packs, without said dlc, you get a very small number of "Starter" objects, which don't help you create anything worth while.\nThe replay mechanic has been changed. You can no longer slow replays, it's either start off slow or build up to faster, or, reverse slow or build up. You can't start off normal speed and then do a dramatic slow down. The controls were changed, too and are, in my opinion, pretty condescending.\nA new dlc has been put in the store that will unlock ALL unlockables (other than dlc unlocks) without the need of having to progress which is, in my opinion, the lazy man's dlc.\n\nOther than that, this game is a must have for anybody who loves pool!","June 25, 2014","true","43.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thirdrail1/recommended/254440/","thirdrail1","shark music","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thirdrail1/","181 products in account","Hands down the best pool game I've played. Graphically, it borders on being a tech demo for high end lighting and reflection effects. It's ridiculously shiny. The felt looks like felt. (I would not be surprised to see this game come bundled with every graphics card released in the next five years. It makes your GPU look like a hero.) The physics are just as good: crisp and consistent. Lots of game modes. Lots of cue sticks, balls, table decals, and pool halls to unlock. (I've played for 9 hours, I'm reasonably good at pool, and I've only opened up the easiest fourth of the unlockables.) Thanks to the quirky descriptions of your opponents before the matches, the game ends up having a ton of personality, considering it doesn't render the players at all, only their ghostly, floating sticks. It's got solid multiplayer, at least for two people. By people I mean friends. You can play big tournaments, in theory, with larger groups of strangers.\n\nPerhaps most importantly in the context of 2014 gaming, Pool Nation is getting continued love and support from its devs. Snooker and "Box of Tricks" are both coming soon as free updates, and the devs are active in the forums.\n\nAs I write this, the game is on sale for $1.50. It's correctly priced at $10, so $1.50 is a steal.","August 1, 2014","true","16.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Please add more tournaments featuring more game types:\na. British 8-ball\nb. Snooker\nc. Straight\nd. anything else you can think of...\n2.  Maybe add more types of tables... at my local pool hall, there are, at least, three distinct styles of tables:\na. Quarter-drop - small green, big pockets\nb. Big/Big - big green, big pockets\nc. Big/Little - big green, itty-bitty pockets\nd. Is "Bumper Pool" a real thing? I'd play it...\n3.  I am far more likely to pay for decals, cues, balls, and locations, than I am for trick-shot materials.\n4.

Essentially, that's pretty much what I got! At first, I wasn't sure if I liked the "feel" of it as much, but once I'd played a good few games, I find I do like it a lot! The only bad things I have to say about it (and it's not even that bad) is that there is a slight difference in the movement of the cue stick between single player, and multiplayer. I'm not sure if it's just my pc or not, but for me, single player feels very 1:1 in terms of how much I expect the cue stick to move in relation to how much (and quickly) I move the mouse. In multiplayer for me, it feels like there is a very very slight delay between me moving the mouse, and it moving the cue. When I say very very slight, I really mean it. It's easily the kind of thing you can get used to, and after playing several games, I barely even notice it myself, unless I actually jump from playing single player, straight in to an online game.\nThe only other disappointing thing, is that it doesn't have Snooker. If it did, this would be the penultimate pool game! Certainly not a deal breaker though! If you like pool games, or are a fan of the Virtual Pool series, you won't regret purchasing this at all. I've played many many games online with a friend of mine (usually several matches a day!) and we both get great enjoyment from doing so! As you can see from my playtime, I've already spent a significant amount of time playing this, and it's only going to grow further!\nTrick shots are hard to master, but once you get your head around how to do jump shots and curve shots, whole new ways of playing become apparent, and you truly start to feel like a master!\nThe single player is challenging and fun, and having mini goals in each round keeps you coming back for more, since usually completing those goals, leads to unlocking new locations, balls, decals and cues.\nAt it's current price of $1.49, you'd be crazy not to grab a copy! I think I payed $3 or $5 for it at the time of purchase, but I would say that even if it was $10-$15, it's still worth every cent!","April 16, 2015","true","87.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It went on sale for a great price so I picked it up. I'm not great at pool, but I have always enjoyed playing it and figured it was worth the try.\n\n-I can say that the physics seem spot on. I played as well in the game as I do in reality, with the balls reacting in very familiar ways.\n\n-The sound is crisp and enjoyable. The music is soothing, though at times the looping can get tiresome.\n\n-Visuals shouldn't be the focal point of this type of game, but it does look great. Devs went above and beyond in that regard. The presentation seems very hip, and has unique charm.\n\n-The UI can be a bit troublesome at times, like when you want to select one thing with your mouse, and you end up selecting the menu option next to it for example. That is the only issue here, though. You aren't going to get lost in crazy menus, or complex brackets or anything. Very easy to navigate.\n\n-The challenge is adjustable so that beginners and pros alike can sharpen their skills or just enjoy the experience.\n\nI'm currently halfway through the first tournament, so I can't say much as far as the amount of content or number of play modes. There are small challenges to complete during each match, making those who want completion take special consideration within each. I might update this later on, who knows.\n\nIf you can catch this game on sale, go for it. It is worth the $10 price tag in my opinion, but I do have a soft spot for pool in general, so take that for what you will.","April 17, 2015","true","8.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The ability to take trick shots is well balanced with practical physics, making for an enthralling sim.  ...this game makes me laugh & smile.  If you're new Pool Nation is accomodating, featuring a few different ways to practice & easy to learn (if a bit slippery at first) controls.  A pro can appreciate the tournament structures, the spot on rulesets, the tricks, & the challenges, which are a bit like wagers in a bar.  Quite realistic, that.  Pool Nation is rendered beautifully & has all the charm & atmosphere of Poker Night 2's outlandish settings.  The music is well mixed, adding to the full effect.  Everyone should own this game.

While there are a few options on steam, Pool Nation is by far the best option. I am quite satisfied playing it and, have lost track of time too often! The physics are great, it plays great and has a lot of different game options. The only thing I wish it had was Snooker, but it seems that most pool games do either 8-Ball & 9-Ball, or just Snooker.\n\nI picked this up while it was on sale and have been quite happy!

It lacks a bit of the old time sleazy pool-hall atmosphere, which, to me is a big part of the game. The settings are a little too modern for me but having said that, the game is solid. I like the aiming system and the AI players really need to be kept at bay or on the higher levels, they will run the table even though they can miss some very easy shots but like humans, they just plain miss now and then. I have not tried the trick shots much so I can not speak about those but if you just want to play some decent 8 or 9 ball, get this. It sells pretty cheap too. It just needs some snooker !\nOh, and some more pub-like settings. I want to hear my mates swearing in the background :)\n\nNote, there are many complaints now about the devs abandoning the game and not updating in a bit so if that is an issue for you, take heed.","July 9, 2015","true","15.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I'm on the final 8 ball tournament level now, and the AI has the same skill level as it was in the beginning. Your controls get worse as the game progresses and there are glitches that will force you to lose the game.

Customize your balls and cue (but who cares really)... all in all not a bad game if you can get it for cheap (I got it for 2.99), certainaly better than online flash based pool, but not by all that much considering it's still just billards...","January 18, 2014","true","13.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The UI is nice and easy to use as well although, whislt the controls have had there names changed. It still asks you to press A, B, Start and Back whenever you want to do something. That is more of a monor niggle though\n\nGameplay\nThe Pool on display here is very nice. The balls all act realistically and as far as I can tell things like friction have been modeled very well. In the close up slow-mo shots you get sometimes when a ball is potted you can see that the balls are lifting up and sliding about realistically. The sound design helps to sell this as well, with nice clear sound making it all the more satisfying when the ball drops.\n\nMultiplayer\nAs far as I can tell the multiplayer for this game is dead. Which is a shame and slightly confusing. I couldn't seem to find any games at all in any mode so unless one of your friends has the game it is most likely gonna be solo play for you.\n\nOverall\nConsidering The lack of a decent Pool game on PC and the promise of the release of the Trick Shot mode soon I would say this game is well worth picking up","December 28, 2013","true","34.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

My God, those balls are super shiny.","December 27, 2013","true","9.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

One of my favorite "sports" games (let's not get into the semantics of whether pool is a sport) of all time has been the original Virtual Pool by Celeris. Since it's been literally years since I played the game, Pool Nation struck all the right chords with me: low price (on sale for $5), great artwork and graphics (ooh, shiny!), and those pangs of nostalgia that I'd been craving.\n\nPool Nation sports a reasonably good tutorial mode and even teaches you how to pull off expert moves like jump shots, knife-edges, and all sorts of careful maneuvers with curving and banking. And those moves will generally score you loads of style points (which, as far as I can tell, are only useful on the in-game leaderboards - there's no way to spend them, and all the unlockables come from milestones in the Tournament modes).\n\nIf I have only one complaint about Pool Nation, it's that the AI suffers from what I like to refer to as "Worms Syndrome"; in short, the AI will alternate between being a complete and utter stooge (like pocketing the cueball) and being freakishly perfect at their shots (I've seen even low-tier opponents like Cousin Merl pull off insane curving bank shots and manage to pot two or more balls in one hit, on occasion).\n\nOf course, this ceases to matter if your intention is playing with friends. This is also a bit of a problem, though, as the online scene for Pool Nation is...well, pretty much nonexistant. You'll pretty much need to talk your friends into buying it if you want to play against anybody other than the AI opponents (or the timer in Endurance Mode). This said, though, given the game's low price, that shouldn't be too hard.\n\nAnd then, yes, there's the graphics. Everything in this game is really shiny. Not "bloom and HDR" shiny, but nice and reflective and smooth. The pool halls you compete in (there are several!) are lovingly rendered and actually remind me of the city from Mirror's Edge. Then there's the character artwork, which is occasionally hilarious (Cousin Merl and Beef Chillingham both elicited chuckles from my usual Livestream audience).\n\nSo, yes, I give Pool Nation my recommendation. There are no crazy arcade elements (you won't see explosions or fancy particle effects); it's pretty much straight pool with a nice coat of gloss and some solid physics.","December 22, 2013","true","5.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The physics feel very good its not perfect and some of the time it just feels a little off but its very good.\n\nI like the unlock system but for whatever reason they made it progressively difficult with 3 stars needed later on to unlock some stuff. However the worst is some of them are busted and dont work like they should. The jump shot is needed to unlock on of the stars and I have done it and not gotten credit for it. Its annoying. A few of the others are just based on luck and thats very annoying as well. The locations you play pool in are very well detailed and looks super great. Sound of the pool is very good. The music can get annoying so I turn it down a lot. Not prefect but very fun and more then worth the $1.50 its on sale for.","May 29, 2014","true","17.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

That's about the only nice things I have to say. I'm not going to rip this game a new one or pretend that I'm AVGN. The only things that ♥♥♥♥ me off is the controls. One slight twitch and away your cue aim goes. For a fast pace game you have to play slowly in order to even succed. I also hate the points system, it over shadows the whole "clear up to win" aspect of pool giving the impression that highest points wins. Why couldn't they just tally up a score at the end after you win, sort of like a Street Fighter kind of way.

Lining up shots is a chore with iffy mouse controls. This is one of those games where you are controlling something with the mouse (the cue stick), but there is still a mouse pointer in a different area of the screen and they don't correspond at all. It is frustrating and distracting and something I didn't expect to see this side of glitchy Windows XP games. It's like half of the game was designed around a controller and the other half was made for keyboard and mouse.\n\nI'm sure there is a bit of a gem buried in here if I dig long enough but it just doesn't seem worth the effort.\n\nOn the plus side you can totally cheat using a straight edge on your monitor to line up your shots, if you cared enough.\n\nBought on sale for $1.49.\n\n12-28-14 edit: Achievements are working again.","November 21, 2014","false","4.0"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

The right joystick on a 360 pad is used to not only select shot power (pulling back the stick), but also to execute a shot (pushing up on the stick).  With all the strategy that goes into each shot, it's too easy to accidentally execute a shot in this manner.  Worse still, it is possible to push up on the stick with no options set, executing a medium power shot with no options set (power, stick angle, ball spin).  In the options, I could see where to remap some things, but not this.  I really want shot execute to be a button, not a stick that I can bump...otherwise, fantastic game, great price!

We use 2 Steam Controllers and play via my Steam Link.\n\nThis is a fun little pool game that is great for players of all skill levels.  The controls are very intuitive and have been easily picked up by my 75 year old father and others.   We all like the music and find it contributes nicely to the overall relaxing nature of 2 player pool.\n\nOne of the great features is the versatile aiming aid which shows players the exact path of the cue ball and object ball as they aim and adjust spin and power.  As players get better they can shorten the length of the aid to increase the player skill required to make the shots.  In 2 player local co-op each player may choose the length of the aiming aid independent of the other player.  This means experts can have a very short aiming aid while less-experienced players may have a longer one.  This is a nifty way to handicap games that doesn't make new players feel pandered-to in my experience.\n\nA couple of negatives are that the physics are a bit questionable at times, and the aiming aid can permit some absolutely ludicrous shots that would be impossible outside of a physics simulation.  The single player career seems to be nothing more than a way to purposefully gate content... even though you bought the game if you want all the locations and wingdings unlocked you have to buy the "unlock" DLC or slog through the laborious and completely unfun "career".\n\nAll in all, I recommend this game for local co-op play and pretty much no other reason.  Several times I've checked out the online lobbies and couldn't find anybody to ever play with though YMMV.","January 27","true","28.4"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

Why don't have the balls scratches? Why is everything so d. shiny, everything looks like through a filter?\n\nAnd then the controls. Neither with gamepad  nor mouse good to play. Inprecise controls plus stiff camera. It doesn't feel like playing  pool at all. Kind of sad.\n\nI would give it a 6 out of 10. If the "story mode" is any good later on maybe a 7/10.

More abysmal controller support.\n\nAfter having a lot of fun with this on my console, I grabbed it on Steam. Unfortunately like several "controller enabled" titles here, the input progarmming is only half complete. Instead of having a fully functional control mapping feature, it simply picks up input devices and automatically assigns them to functions in the game. This means that if you have other controllers besides a gamepad, like throttles and sliders, menus and views will constantly scroll or move until you find the offending device and unplug or otherwise disable it.\n\nThis is a fun little game, but I have no desire to constantly unplug or reconfigure controllers just to play, only to have to reconfigure again to play games which use those controllers.\n\nOn top of this, there was no consideration for alternate resolutions (such as multiple monitor setups). The 3d portion of the game functions, but 2d elements such as splash screens fail to scale properly, making them unreadable.\n\nEither make PC games or don't make them. I have no interest in a product that not only doesn't fully support my platform, but forces me to disable features of the platform in order to make the product usable.\n","February 6, 2014","false","0.2"," 7 of 26 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","7","26","0","0"

No ordinary truck, this one was Holy White, and the gold Delivery logo sparkled like a thousand suns reflected through shards of the purest ice formed with unadulterated water collected at the beginning of the universe. The driver, clad in a robe colored the softest of white, floated towards me on the cool fog of a hundred fire extinguishers. He smiled benevolently, like a father looking down upon his only child, and handed me a package wrapped in gold beaten thin to the point where you could see through it. I didn't have to sign, because the driver could see within my heart, and knew that I was pure. Upon opening the package, an angelic choir started to sing, and reached a crescendo as I laid this disc into my system. Instantly, my antiquated equipment transformed into components made from the clearest diamond-semiconductor. The game knew where to install, and hooked itself into the correct directories without help from me - all the while, the choir sang praises to the almighty digital god. With trepidation, I pushed "play," and was instantly enveloped in a sound that echoed the creation of all matter, a sound that vibrated every cell in my body to perfection. I was instantly taken to the next plane, where I saw the all-father. I knew with my entire soul, that all was good in the world.\n\nBut then I realized the game was blue, so I only gave it one star.

Also unlockable cues, ball sets, venues (most are just times of day changes) and table decals.","May 14, 2014","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has nine-ball pool (pot the balls in sequence and whoever pots the last ball is the winner), eight-ball pool (the stripes and solids version), trick shots and online play.\n\nEvery match in the campaign mode has extra challenges that make each game different and help to ramp up the difficulty. For example, a challenge might be to get a four-ball streak, perform a kick shot, etc. There’s also a few bonus rounds with different modes of play.\n\nTutorials are excellent. It guides you through each step of the shot and makes it very easy to perform impressive stuff like kick shots, jump shots, combo shots, swerve shots and more. There's a surprisingly large amount of ways to hit a ball.\n\nYou can unlock different designs for the tables, cues and balls. You also unlock different locations to play pool in. These are purely cosmetic, but they look great and add to the overall experience.\n\nIf the idea of playing pool appeals to you - definitely get this. I personally have very minimal interest in pool, but it’s all so well done that I'm enjoying it anyway.","March 7, 2015","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You hit balls, get them in the pots, battle against AI or online, and rage at your friends for their skill at games. But there are a few flaws in this that make the game's screenshots exagerate how the game actually is.\n\nFirst of all, the physics in the balls are AWFUL. Atleast 20 times (not exageration) during my career I got the ball stuck RIGHT AT THE POT and it didn't go in. If we got it to atleast the edge, give us credit or something. It happens to everybody playing pool, but come on, you didn't have to make it THAT realistic. Besides, who has two extra fingers on each hand?\n\nSecond, the camera controls are amazingly crap. You MOVE YOUR MOUSE to move the camera. That's nice. How about when I'm trying to hit the ball? Can you KEEP THE CAMERA WHERE IT'S AT????? Half the time I'm trying to fix my camera or looking down the cue or I'm a 500 feet tall man that looks on the very top of the pool table.\n\nLast, the AI in this game is the hardest I've ever played. If you don't hit a ball, this AI will hit every striped/coloured ball it sees and you realise that you should use your time wisely because he hit all the balls, he's ready to hit the 8 ball, and you have to hurry and hit all your balls. It took me 3 times to beat the first guy. THE FIRST GUY. I have played pool as well, and I've went through the tutorial.\n\nMy honest review is that if this game is on sale, don't get your hopes too high but you could buy it. If it's at it's regular $10 price, it's not worth your money.","February 12, 2015","false","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Secondly, I have less than 1 hour of play time, just enough to play the tutorial.\n\nOkay, so that out of the way, for a game that I bought for less than $2 USD, this game is amazing.  Best billards/pool game I have ever played.  Beautiful graphics also. I give it a 9/10, just because no game is perfect.  One thing so far I have noticed is the lack of customizable music.  I'd like to listen to my own tunes while playing.  Just to give it more of a bar or bowling alley feel.  I do understand its supposed to be tournement/pro type of play, so that's okay.  Anyways, if anyone happens to read this while its ever on sale and is a billards fan, just buy the game.  I don't think I would have ever paid the full price for it, but that's not because its not a good game, I just like to find good deals on games.\n\nAlso, it would be cool if players could have custom decal or felt for the table also.","August 2, 2014","true","11.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I guess the cons are the way characters in this game exist, but I can forgive all that.\n-When any balls fly out the pool table, the ball just vanishes.

It really is quite impressive, you can pull off just about any shot you can imagine if you have the know how. The AI players start off easy enough for you to get used to the control scheme (which isn't actually that intuitive, but once you get used to it, it's pretty damn good) and the game in general, and they range up to players so hard that if you give them an opportunity, they will clear almost any table. For some, that may be off putting, but it's not too far from reality, a lot of top players will clear almost any table if theyre having a good day.\n\nOnly issue i have really is that after a while, it gets kinda dull. Caning each AI player one after the other gets too easy after a while, and the only way to lose is to try and get 3 stars for the 3 challenges per match, but providing they don't ask you to do something that actually requires any thought, like a bank or kick shot, you have no excuse not to get all 3 stars.\n\nThey also try and spice it up with bonus matches of different disciplines of pool, which again is cool for a while, I still haven't mastered them all.\n\nI don't really know what to suggest to make it better, it's pretty much as good as I can imagine a pool game getting, barring adding some kind of trick shot challenge, but then again, you may aswell make all shots a trick shot once you're used to the game.\n\n8/10 - A very good time killer","June 21, 2014","true","17.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
