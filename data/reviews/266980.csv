Most of the puzzles are mazes and inventory fetch quests. Much of the story is told through journals. If you don't like the sound of that, then this game is probably not for you. But if that's your speed and you want an adventure game experience with high artistry and a sense of exploration, this is a must-play.\n\nThe world of the Labyrinth is a patchwork of surrealism, Art Deco, and classical architecture. The art direction is mesmerizing. There is simply nothing else like it in any game. Every room is with worth seeing, every useless inventory item worth examining, every dead-end worth the trek. The dark, horror-influnced soundtrack reinforces the idea that the Labyrinth is a truly alien place, and the light-sci-fi archaeological time travel story is also fairly entertaining.\n\nBy the end of the game, the constant backtracking and repetitive mazes might get a little tiring. But if you want an adventure game driven by its art and atmosphere, The Labyrinth of Time deserves the highest praise and recommendation.","November 29, 2014","true","0.8"," 57 of 61 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","57","61","0","0"

Filled with music that is part of a general tv background music from the late 80's and early 90's. I loved this game back then and I still love it. fun adventure game with a slight sassy streak.\n\nusing all the quarters in the middle of the mirror maze on that machine is worth doing once. (you have to use it on that one phone to get a ton back first)\n\nAnd make sure to use the sword on the window on the moon! Just fyi ;)","December 12, 2014","true","2.6"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","17","21","0","1"
