A furry.\n2. Confused.\n\nIf you fall into that first category, this might be a game for you (as a self-professed fandom member, I don't think I can help but be a little biased). If you fall into the second category, you might want to think more carefully. Either way, I can't wholeheartedly recommend this game (although I would love to), but can only advise that you think very carefully. I'll try to explain all that, and I'll try to be as thorough as I can in this review, because information on this game is very scarce online.\n\nThe story is pretty simple, although it tries to have some depth. Everyone is a walking, talking animal (they actually try to explain this, but it's all left very intentionally vague and mysterious. You should have no trouble picking up what it's getting at). The citizens possess a magical orb that allows them to predict the weather, and without it things will get pretty chaotic. You play as Rif, a fox who happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time; that is to say, the orb is stolen, and everyone blames you. Because all foxes are thieves, apparently. Rif's girlfriend is kidnapped and he's given a limited amount of time to recover the orb and prove his innocence. Otherwise, bad things will happen. You're accompanied by an Elk and a Boar from two respective tribes, and thus your quest begins. You'll meet some interesting characters and some are actually pretty cool, if underdeveloped. The game's too short to really give any character besides Rif a lot of time to shine, but the developers made the characters fun and lively. Some of the problems with the script result from issues within the developing company. Apparently they wanted to make a rather mature game, with themes and issues and characters adults could enjoy; traces of this shine through. In one conversation I had, a character made some veiled innuendos and (very tame) sexual advances (the kind of thing no child would ever pick up on). And although the developers were pushing for a mature game, the publishers saw animals and immediately assumed it was a game for kids. The script was toned down and scenes were cut, as were all scenes involving death. The result of this dispute is a little sloppy. The story never quite lives up to its potential and everything feels just a little too cheery. It turns what could have been a decent adventure into something much more suitable for children. That's not to say an adult couldn't enjoy it; it just isn't what it could have been.\n\nInherit the Earth is a point-and-click adventure game. If you don't like those, you're going to hate this. You're not going to be fighting enemies, platforming, shooting, racing, looting, or grinding. You're going to be walking around, picking things up, and taking them other places. You might have to use one item on something to open a new path. It's that kind of game.\nIt's biggest flaw is that it isn't very deep. The characters are fun and the graphics are very nice (more on that later), but there isn't too much to the gameplay. Myst and its sequels are some of my favorite games, and their draw is incredibly difficult puzzle solving. Those games are the pinnacle of the point-and-click genre. Inherit the Earth, on the other hand, does not have any real puzzles. It doesn't have much that could confuse or stump you. There were only a handful of moments where I wasn't sure what to do. That may be because I'm a seasoned adventure gamer -- I'm not sure. It would definitely give a younger player a bigger challenge.\n\nMusic... Eh. You're not going to like it. There's very little music here, aside from fifteen second loops that go on and on and on... But I can't fault them. Some of the little loops are a little catchy and, hey, they add to the game's charm if nothing else. The sound effects all sound fine, and the game's fully voice acted. The actors don't do a bad job, but they're not going to be winning any awards for their performances either. But I do applaud the decision to add voice acting. In a game like this, where the story and gameplay are both rather thin, the cast of characters is going to be one of the bigger selling points, and I couldn't help but be won over by these characters. Rif in particular was a joy to play, and the little, sometimes stupid things he would say as I guided him around made him altogether very likeable. Every character was like that, to their own degree. The world really felt alive with its characters; it was even hard not to like the bad characters. And for that, I say the voice acting is a major plus.\n\nThe graphics are one of the game's biggest selling points. They're not phenomenal or anything. On today's computers they look pixelated at best, but somehow they still look excellent. Unfortunately, the camera angle is almost always zoomed in extraordinarily closely. It made even the nicest of environments hard to see sometimes, and sometimes made the game harder to play. However, when entering new rooms or areas, the developers occasionally opted to display the new room/area in a smaller window overlapping the first one. It was a neat effect, and while it didn't add much to the gameplay, it aided the overall look of the game, which I found myself liking more and more as I played. The animations are, for the most part, clean and well executed, and the sprites large and detailed. Everything is vibrant and drawn in a wonderful art style and helps sell this game's charm.\n\nAnd that's really what this game has going for it -- charm. It's not the most terrifically fun game to play, and the story isn't really going to make you think. But the world itself is lovely and the characters entertaining. I thoroughly enjoyed every minute I spent playing this game (which took me 5 hours to beat), and I think you will too, if you're looking for something that will make you smile or feel like a kid again.\n\nWhen all's said and done, this game is probably better suited to kids, and when I have children of my own I'll look forward to the day I can sit down and play this with them.\n\nAs I said earlier, I can't wholeheartedly recommend it. It's flawed, yes, very much so, but it does have some wonderful things in its favor. Furries and adventure gamers might find more to enjoy here than the average player, but it's simple and breezy enough to make anybody smile. There's a lot that isn't working, but if you can look past all that, you'll find a very charming game with a lot of heart.","August 9, 2015","true","5.1"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","13","17","0","0"

But if you love adventure games, this shouldn't bother you. This is a real overlooked classic of the genre.\n\nNice graphics, nice music, good voice acting, and it runs natively on modern machines. It does not use DOSBox or ScummVM. They actually ported this to modern systems.\n\nThe only negative thing I have to say about this game, is that it ends with somewhat of a cliffhanger. Hoping for a sequel! I think it's in the works currently, with Patreon support.\n\nBottom line: A solid retro adventure game with a huge nostalgia factor.","October 10, 2015","true","4.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/piratefox/recommended/257260/","piratefox","Pirate Fox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/piratefox/","791 products in account","Inherit the Earth is a very nice LucasArts-style 1990s adventure game. The game has mostly-solid voice acting, beautiful pixel art and an interesting setting (at least for some of us ;3). It has some very large isometric areas to explore, which seem daunting at first, but are always manageable. One or two Eye of the Beholder -esque first-person mazes in the game require manually making a map on paper, although I unfortunately cheated through the biggest one using a walkthrough. I recommend that you do not, as mapping such areas is surprisingly satisfying.\n\nIn the end, the game is a little short, but I enjoyed every second of it. If you dig oldschool adventure games and/or fuzzy things, you should definitely check this one out. There isn't really anything else much like it, which is why I really hope the current sequel project comes to fruition.\n\nThere's one unfortunately pretty noticeable problem with the port. The game's original resolution is 320x200, which would conventionally fully use a 4:3 monitor, with slightly nonsquare pixels. The port scales the pixels as if they were squares, which isn't what you'd expect to see on an old CRT monitor. The result is that the graphics are a bit stretched horizontally. Fortunately, you can use ScummVM to run the game instead, and it has the option to correct this.","April 6, 2015","true","9.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Though, I feel like it was such a small piece of the pie, because it ends off at a cliff hanger where very little is resolved and we don't discover what happened in the lore.  There's apparently a web comic that finishes everything.\n\nIn terms of game design, the beginning suffers from a few old-school problems (fetch quests with repeating mazes).  However, after a certain point, it starts feeling a bit more like a good adventure game, like King's Quest or Monkey Island.  The lore and story get more interesting, as well, as you get a sense of the bigger picture.  Lore is one of the game's more emphasized points, and puzzles are fairly light.  I feel that the lore spoke a lot louder than the actual narrative, and I found myself reacting more to what I would see in the backgrounds on the journey, rather than what was happening in the moment.  I felt it was intentional, as there is a recurring theme of solving puzzles throughout the narrative, and maybe the lore is meant to be that puzzle.  The narrative itself is average for a video game.  You are on a quest and go through puzzles to complete it.  Pretty much like any of the KQ games.\n\nIf you find the beginning a bit boring or tedious, try and stick it out, because it will get better (more puzzles and less mazes).  I felt like the characters became more interesting as well, after that turning point.  I adored the dog prince, rather than the boar king, despite them both sharing the same kind of role.  The wild cat tribe was very interesting and refreshing, in comparison to the prior tribes I met.  I also liked Shiala, who seemed to have a good bit of character to her.  She seemed more genuine and three dimensional, as well.  Most of these characters show up later.  The voices are fairly decent, considering how old it is.  I think the art assets are fairly good, although not quite as beautiful as the later KQ art.  In terms of difficulty, this is one of the easier adventure games I've played, with, for reference, Dragonsphere being on the harder end.\n\nI liked it, and think it's worth a play through.  If you're really stringent on your adventure games, you could probably pass this one.  But if you like most adventure games, this one is worth getting.","November 28, 2015","true","9.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

The game looks and feels like something out of a Disney movie, presenting a sweet cute storyline with charming characters from the very first scene.\n\nAs a 90s point-and-click game, expect lots of exploration and puzzle-solving that will require good amounts of trial and error - or just a keen eye. There's definitely no hand-holding, so don't be afraid to pick up a piece of paper and draw a map of the dungeons, if you need, or refer to the web as a last resort.\n\nThe only negative aspects of the game are the length and lack of replay value, since there's not much outside the main storyline and once you get to the end your next playthrough will take minutes. Also, the game was planned to have a sequel that never came, but the authors stayed true to their work and published a webcomic, which you can read for free on the internet. The comic sheds a different light on some events of the game and adds a plethora of new characters and adventures. The art is definitely not a strong point, but the world of Inherit the Earth is just too sweet and interesting, so I keep coming back to that comic. It's worth mentioning that the comic is still being published as I write this review!\n\nAll in all, I'd recommend this game to anyone who enjoys the 90s feeling of point-and-click adventures and is looking for a  laidback experience.","February 28, 2015","true","6.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/notsue/recommended/257260/","notsue","I'm Not Sue","http://steamcommunity.com/id/notsue/","465 products in account","Note : There are no failstates in this game.\n\nA furry-centric point and click game that keeps to its own world building pretty well, so if you are expecting modern fandom stereotypes there really aren't here.  The story is more of a child-level medieval hero tale, with a formally mannered protagonist and straightforward characters.  Like every point and click adventure game there are always a few naggling puzzles that would be confusing to solve, however this one confounds that a bit further by way of having several perception mazes and an absolutely horrible scene POV for many areas that shows far too little of the map you are walking on.  This is presumably so every scene did not need to be hand drawn to show a sense of scale, but ends up making even small town areas feel vast and confusing.  The aforementioned mazes are mappable if you have a pen, paper, and some common sense.\n\nVoice acting is fairly good and while characters are somewhat stereotyped, they feel well presented.  The story is extemely rushed at the start, with the protagonist being assigned the motivating quest within 5 minutes because of arbitrary and specist law enforcement giving you the duty of saving your civilization from disaster just because somebody said you could've been at fault for it.  In the same way that I could've personally caused 9/11.  Y'know, because nobody where I was the night before.  The story is a bit of a stretch at the start, as I said.  It progresses fairly well, leading to some interesting events and ending in a rushed sort of way similar to the intro.\n\nIts not a bad game and has it's charm.  There are better point & click games if you just want a good title, but this isn't a bad game by any means.

In the worst way possible. Let's break it down:\n\nPros - Nice animation, good voice acting, interesting premise.\n\nCons - Absolutely none of that is used in an interesting way. You don't explore the premise at all, you barely solve any puzzles, the few interesting interactions you have are just pauses between walking sessions.\n\nFor most of the game, your task consists of "walk and find". Go into a huge 3d town, made of entirely copy-pasted pastures, and walk through it to find out which identical door leads to the one hot spot of interest you need to access to continue the game. Of COURSE you don't get any directions or a map, don't be silly. As a reward, you have access to... a long maze. Hope you brought your charting paper gamefaqs instructions along. Done with the maze? Navigate an actual map screen. Find out in which one of the dozen forest clearings, scattered around the map, a plot-relevant character spawned. He spawns at random, so it's definitely going to be the last place you check. Found him? Great, you can now go into... another maze!\n\nDon't buy this game.\n\nMy impressions at length[xander77.livejournal.com] on my journal.\n\nEdit - I've played this game using ScummVM, which allows you to play the game in fullscreen, without the graphics becoming all stretched and blurry. It also lets you load a save game when you start, without being forced to skip several intro sequences, neither of which is an option in the steam version. That's why my playtime is listed as 0.5 hours.","October 6, 2015","false","0.5"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","6","15","0","0"

It's not that bad of a game, but the humor is corny beyond all measure and the story is quite cliche.
