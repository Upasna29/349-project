After  collecting hundreds of them over the years, I was expecting something  with at least some innovation, and much better graphics.   Hmmm! well....... maybe the space invader like levels  are different, but overall Breakout Invaders is a poor second cousin  removed to many of the breakouts I've played over the years.   Some freeware  versions  have been   more challenging, and look better graphically than  this game.  It's not seriously bad, but   compared to  a lot of the more recent breakout games I've played, it looks   dated , even though some of the level designs are quite interesting.\n\nThe  game felt sluggish with my mouse (a Razer Naga), the graphics are a retrograde step when compared to the likes of games like Magic Ball 2, 3 and 4, Strikeball 2 and 3 (to name just a few of the  more well known ones - for some reason Alawar changed the name of  the Magic Ball series to Smash Frenzy).  The original, released  over 10 years ago, is the only one in the Magic Ball series that looks and plays worse than today's game.  The second in the Magic Ball series   looked better than today's game  (released way back in 2005), had  more power ups and played well. The third in the series had a major graphics update (see video link below).   Compare Breakout Invaders to the likes of the Magic Ball games,  Ricochet Infinity  and Shatter, the latter two of which are  available via Steam.  They are worlds  apart in quality and game play.  Breakouts were my first love w.r.t. arcade games  (next to shmups and TD games).  All that said,  Breakout Invaders is only £1.99, soooo.... despite my disappointment, it's not a great loss; I've still got thousands of free levels   to play via Ricochet infinity.  :)\n\nYou can  compare videos of  the  breakouts I mentioned above by clicking on their names.  Magic Ball 3,  Magic Ball 2,  Ricochet Infinity,  Shatter,  Breakout Invaders,  and the freeware game Chak's Temple.","April 25, 2015","false","2.1"," 21 of 32 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","21","32","0","0"

Some of the more memorable boards are the the space invader ones, some of the cities, & they should have had more with the 4 bumpers though it was one of the harder levels to get used to.\n\nIf you like this review check out my steam group\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/Blinkdog","October 13, 2015","true","3.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

I also love the concept of this game, but I'm sad that its not a little bit more polished. Better resolution options and enhanched textures would really have helped and boost the quality and polish of this title.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/366700/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","Breakout Invaders is a mash up of both Space Invaders and Breakout. If you are not familiar with those titles one is a vertical shoot em up and  the other is pretty much reverse Pong in where you try to break all the blocks and not let the ball pass your goal. There are 100 levels and each level usually changes how the game plays. One mission you will be tasked with breaking all the blocks and in the next you may be tasked with defending blocks from aliens using your ball and lasers as a weapon. Lasers are used by either right clicking or using the alt key and can be used to destroy blocks or damage enemies though whether you have unlimited ammo depends level from level. You also have a missile which causes far more damage and has splash damage but you can only carry up to 10. In later levels they introduce metal gates that won't allow you to shoot blocks and must use a ball to reach them.\n\nThat is easier said than done. The physics in Breakout Invaders are completely insane and have no logic behind them at times. Your ball is the bounciest thing in the universe and hitting it with the edge of your paddle does not bounce it to the side like you would expect. It's a hard thing to explain but imagine playing Pong and the ball always going straight up instead of being able to bounce it off the sides of the screen when you learn to hit it properly.  Unlike Breakout or Space Invaders this has a pinball like perspective to the maps instead of a simple 2D plane, so that adds some more complexity to it. Destroying castles and cites is great fun even though most of the times you will break blocks by chance instead of skill. Unfortunately later on they introduce small pipes that you must shoot your ball into to reach an area but the controls and physics are just not up to par to require the precision they so those end up being a pain.\n\nYou can control the game with either your mouse or your arrow keys but the mouse is way too sensitive for my liking. It works perfectly fine with the arrows keys but in some levels you are required to use the mouse which is pretty annoying. Which brings me to my biggest gripe with the game. Every level seems to have some kind of cheap gimmick like having 10 balls on screen for 2 minutes or having to destroy some blocks but having one paddle and goal on each side of the screen, making it feel like a game of Warlords that makes you have to control all players at once . The game is at it's best when it has you just breaking blocks yet every level has some kind of nuisance to break the flow once you start to actually have fun. It really makes it feel like a collection of mini games instead of modes built around the basic mechanics of Breakout and would have benefited from having them as extra features instead of being forced into the base game.\n\nAnother good portion of the game will have you fighting the aliens from Space Invaders and these are in my opinion the worst part of the game. Your paddle is way too large and makes avoiding projectiles a real pain plus you still have to worry about your ball. It's like being the fat guy in a game of paintball and having to text your boss in the middle of a gunfight. You do usually have infinite ammo for your laser but when you are down to the last few aliens they become extremely bullet spongy. It is insane how many hits they take and I actually thought my game was glitched until one of the three finally exploded. That is due to the tacked on upgrade system this game has. You will need to collect money to buy new ships or to upgrade your firepower. The problem is the game is incredibly stingy with money and the only way to get more is completing a level so you have two options, either grind some prior levels or deal with it. With that and having a gimmick every level it is like the devs think we have the attention span of a newt  and need some kind of motive to play the game instead of it simply playing for the fun of it like say the two games they so proudly mention.\n\nBoth Space Invaders and Breakout were about skill. They were both based around improving the player, not the ship with extra firepower or the paddle with more speed. They gave you all the tools you  needed from the get go and designed the game around that. Breakout Invader on the other hand simply beefs up the enemies and hopes you spent your limited cash correctly if you don't want to spend the next couple of minutes slowly chipping off the enemies health. It honestly would have been a better game if you had a single ship, no upgrades and optional game modes like the games it was inspired by. Moving on from that rant, there are other power-ups besides rockets and lasers.  There are meteors that will destroy parts of the map, items that either shrink or increase your paddle and one that makes balls move faster. One small gripe is that items come down too slowly and would benefit from a bit more speed going down. Can be a bit bothersome waiting for it to makes its way down the screen while keeping track of the ball.\n\nEnvironments are not pretty bland and takes quite some time to see any new ones. Music is a mixed bag, it ranges from good to terrible. Some sound effects sound right out of the late 70's which is nice. It was a fun game when it played like Breakout but with power ups, though every other gimmick was sub-par. If you are a fan of Space Invaders I wouldn't bother with this game. If you are a fan of Breakout there is a bit of fun to be had here but the good will ultimately be outweighed due to having to put up with gimmick after gimmick just to get to the next level that plays like Breakout. It is such an annoying design decision, it is like playing one level of one game, switching to a few other games and then going back to the one you actually like. Having them as different game modes instead of lumping them together to have “100 levels” would have been preferred.  It's a shame, it could have been a decent little throwback but the devs spread themselves too thin and choose quantity over the quality of the gameplay.","July 1, 2015","false","3.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

Maybe if I could put on some glowing neons and race strips on my spaceships...\n- Unbelievable FPS drop. Yeah, I'm not owning a Core i5 (lol), but it runs with ~500FPS normally. But when action begins (20-30 balls + explosions) it falls down to 10 (!!) FPS.\n- Difficulty: Easy is okay, enjoyable. Didn't tried the normal yet, but the hard one... Yeah, I agree, tha ball needs more speed and whatsoever, but almost unbreakable bricks? That's not hard, that's just streching time!\n- Sound effects: just mediocre\n- Resolution change and/or graphics settings: nope, you can't. Graphics? Ugly\n- Steam overlay problems, so you can't just do a screenshot as usual. Also somekind of hidden error shows up after exit.\n- Level design: I know, it's 3D, move on etc. But since the perspective, can't see the balls! Also some of the levels are a**holes.\n- Invaders: not adding too much content to the game at all.\n\nI can't recommend this game.\nIf I could recommend any game in this genre (3D Breakout) on Steam then...\nMaybe Ionball 2: Ionstorm and Caromble?\nJust stick to the 2D ones, like Shatter, Reaxxion (oldschool).\n\nPls release these breakout games on Steam!

Normal levels are your usual breakout level in 3D... The 3D view makes thing a little bit weird and prevent to see the ball(s) on numerous occasion.  Because of the perspective, the distance between the brick and the player looks really small... it is OK because the ball(s) go(es) generally slow and that makes the game a little bit borring.  Then comes the levels that includes space invaders and that is where you start losing life quickly due to some impossible multitasking and the bricks being extremely closed to the player make the level even harder to play.
