When you start the game, you'll be greeted with Start, More Game and Credit. You're not allowed to adjust any options for the game, including screen size and fullscreen option. Also note that there are no pause and save option. Also no Steam overlay, so cannot capture screenshot via Steam.\n\nWhen you start the game, you'll get a letter then off you go.In the beginning you only have shotgun as weapon. Zombies will appear randomly and rely too much on jumpscare. Seriously cheap. To attack the zombies, you have to click on the shotgun icon on the inventory list on top of the screen then click on the zombie. Too slow, you die, restart from beginning.\n\nDuring exploration, theres no indication on where to go. You just click on the screen then it will transit to next screen. No highlight making it hard to progress. There’s no horror feeling in this game.\n\nGraphic just so-so. No animation involved, including zombies. They just come out of nowhere and start biting you without getting their mouth open and splashing blood on screen. Some of the images are creepy though, but nothing original.\n\nNothing impressive about this game at all. Plus, using jumpscare is cheap. Just another crap game from Greenlight.","May 28, 2014","false","0.3"," 57 of 62 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","57","62","0","0"

Well here comes Paradigm Shift crawling on the floor covered in its own vomit missing legs and both of its arms. Its a hastily thrown together game devoid of interesting puzzles. The game excels at startling you if you take too long on a screen. Horrifying zombies pop in screaming when you least expect them.\n\nThere are a few death traps such as gas leaks that you'll need to simply back out of. You need to be hasty though, sticking around in one area too long will kill you in one way or another. Like the zombie apocalypse, you need to get from point A to point B as quick as possible and you do that through trial and error. The game plays out quick and it feels like there's a small amount here to keep it interesting. You can be done with everything in less than ten minutes. Its ultimately a death trap. A price for a horrifying jack-in-the box. You never know when its coming, but it'll jump out.\n\nYou are packing a shotgun, but it feels useless. Even when you have the time to pull it out and shoot a zombie, it does nothing, but it could be out of ammunition when you first get it. The game needs to specify such things or at least have a click. The game's instructions say that a blast can take out most enemies. What's even stranger is facing off against a girl crying in a corner removes the shotgun from the inventory time and time again. I would say its to prevent from hurting her, but you still have a screwdriver.\n\nYou can find a few descriptions of flavor text, but the game feels empty and vacant. Your mouse cursor never changes, it just stays as an arrow forcing me to click like mad. The toughest part about the game is finding little doors, nooks and crannies. Clicking around to find everything even if it looks like nothing.\n\nIts obvious that its someone's first game. There's the cheap price and the Click Fusion icon still on the game. When you start up Paradigm Shift you're greeted with more external links than anything else. There are no options or settings, you play the game in a window rather than having a choice. Its bare bones.\n\nThe environments look good, gritty and downright cheap, but it fits for a horror game. There's no animation, just static photos. Even when zombies pop in they're just pasted on your screen and in a way that adds more drama. Their eyes are cut out, mouths pasted on their lips. The editing of real people is disturbing and does add a unique flair to the game. The real problem with the atmosphere is that its all ruined when the game forces you to stay in a window rather than full screen. Its scary seeing my kitten wallpaper on my desktop among still frames of burning buildings.\n\nAs for the puzzles, you have things like a simple keypad and you need to find the combination that's somewhere close at hand. You have a door lock that you need to pick. When you do so it returns you to the hallway you were already in. Its all so quick between game overs that it never gets a chance to be dull. I kept up a rapid pace through memorizing what to do and where to go.\n\nTo the game's credit there is tense music that adds something to a dirt cheap game. It hastens your pace and adds intensity to a bare bones game. There's budget and then there's cheap. It still feels gritty, but its nothing I can ever recommend.\n\nIf you're big into jump scares and little more than pictures and clicking, Paradigm Shift is a cheap enough game to be worth your time. To the other majority of people, avoid this game, because you never know when a horrifying zombie with all the animation of a cardboard cutout will burst into the area and start blood staining your screen.","October 1, 2015","false","0.7"," 32 of 34 people (94%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","94","32","34","12","0"

So I  briefly read the reviews on Steam.  I see almost all negative reviews, and most reviewers seem to only spend an average of 15 minutes or so.  I thought I could give it a try and spend a few minutes, just for fun, to see bad this point and click game is.\n\nBut I ended up spending a couple of hours on it.  The game itself is very short, but if you really want to finish the game, you'd have to start the game over and over again; because there is no save, and instant inevitable death everywhere.  At one point, I just want to give up, because I keep dying and restarting.  And even when you idle for a couple of minutes, a zombie will come out of nowhere and then game over.  So I tried to motivate myself to keep playing, telling myself that this is one of those cool horror movie where you stuck in a nightmare loop that you keep starting over from the beginning after you die.\n\nAnyways, this game starts off with this windowed 640x480 resolution(I think, because there is no menu to change the resolution or make it full screen).  And when I maximize the window, it has white boarder around it.  And you just can't minimize it back, the only way is to just quit the game by right clicking the icon on your taskbar.\n\nThis game is pretty dark for the most part, just hard to see anything.  Most objects and even passages are very well hidden; of course there is no option or setting to change the brightness and contrast.  The only thing that is not well hidden are those poster and CDs I saw in the game; and when you click on that, it will open up your browser to the soundtrack page of this game.  Shameless, shameless plug.\n\nYou'd probably have more fun reading Wikipedia on the phrase, Paradigm Shift, what a waste of a fancy title on a game like this.  And what a waste of time playing this.","January 6, 2015","false","1.7"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","92","24","26","4","0"

The music is obnoxious and repetitive within under a minute of playing, the graphics are done in a "grainy" or "weathered" sort of style that seems designed to make finding anything a pixel hunt, the scares are jumpscares with lousy (or, really, non-existent) animation, and the "fighting" system, so far as I can tell, is simply a way to make sure that if you spend too long not finding anything (see above concerning pixel hunting) you'll get killed by a zombie as you've found yourself out of ways to defend yourself, which, at the very least, brings the music to an end.\n\nThis could, with some serious work, be a pretty cool typical Flash horror game, but the above problems all prevent that from being so - and, even if they were fixed, I can't honestly say I'd pay five bucks for it when numerous other similar games exist for free, and many of them far more compelling.\n\n2/10 - would not not bang.","July 22, 2014","false","0.1"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","21","23","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/recommended/299820/","Humanure","Belphegore","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/","1597 products in account","In Paradigm Shift, you are an unnamed man who is looking for his girlfriend in the midst of a virus outbreak; in the game her name is Marcy, on the store page her name is Jenny. The virus has transformed all of the recently deceased into cannibals, or in other words... zombies. The game is a point and click adventure title by Evilized Productions, and it was originally a free iOS title.\n\nSo, your home town of River Lake has been overrun by zombies thanks to the explosion at the neuroscience laboratory. Your ultimate goal is to make it to a gas station, from your apartment, and get the heck out of dodge; while, hopefully, your girlfriend Marcy/Jenny is able to meet you there. From the trailer and screenshots on the store page, the game looks promisingly dark and grim, and while this is the case, the game is horrendously short and rather boring.\n\nThe title can be completed in as little as 5-6 minutes. There is no save feature, and the chances of running into a zombie is slim. During my first playthrough I saw two, during my second I saw none. They just pop up randomly, and you kill them with the shotgun that you pick up at the very beginning of the game. There aren't any puzzles to solve, save getting the code for a keypad. The rest is pretty much self explanatory. Although the store page says that there are multiple endings, I could only find one the two times that I played the game, and I couldn't bring myself to continue trying to reach a different ending; there's really no point, and the game is incredibly dull.\n\nThe final verdict is that Paradigm Shift is a point and click that shows promise on the store page, but ultimately fails in delivering anything substantial. The photo-manipulation artwork is decent to look at, although it is heavy with filters, and the soundtrack is just okay. The storyline is a dime-a-dozen in this day and age, as everything to do with zombies has been ground into the dirt; in this case, it's just extremely generic. The absolute kicker is, is that there is no actual paradigm shift in the game. The game is pretty well a waste of half an hour total, and it should be avoided. If you're really itching for a great horror point and click experience, try Sanitarium or I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream.\n\nRating: 0.5/5.0 - Abysmal, avoid it like the plague.Belphegore's Hell House Reviews (Group)","April 25","false","0.4"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","3"
