If the game clocked hours before it came to Steam I would be in the thousands. So let's talk about URW.\n\nURW is a roguelike survival game set in Iron Age Finland. It has been made (mostly) by one person and has been in development since 1992. That's 24 years. Talk about dedication.\n\nYou survive through the four seasons by hunting, gathering, fishing, trading, trapping and farming. You can make a huge variety of items ranging from wooden pots to your very own house and sauna. You will learn the importance of shelter, fire and the advantages of a ranged weapon. Will you be a fisherman hermit? A travelling merchant? Or maybe a proud warrior? You can play the game however you want.\n\nThere's a steep learning curve to the game since there is simply so much to do. The number of hotkeys on the keyboard rivals Microsoft Flight Simulator. The game does have a good manual and plenty of flavor text for history geeks. And let's not forget the lovely LARP pictures for all the characters.\n\nVenture into the Far North. And don't forget to tan your hides.","February 26","true","160.6"," 184 of 191 people (96%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","96","184","191","15","0"

You really need to lighten up, Champ. Dad says you've been bumming Mom out something fierce. Well Debby-Downer, you're in luck! You can now channel that real world "inner" (watch those finger quotes) masochist into something more productive. Namely, The UnReal World.\n\nHere's what you do, roll an Owl-tribe bowsman and start in winter as a runaway slave because you're a BAD*SS. Then, promptly get kicked in the head to death by a Njerpez Housewive--(insert heavy Russian accent) In iron-age Finland, red shirts kill you!. Next, make a Seal-tribe trapper, spend 4 real life days setting up traps only to blunder into one of them and die miserably. Finally, create Driikilainen fisherman, amass immeasurable wealth, build a house, start a family, enter your sheep pen to butcher up some dinner for said family and get hooved to death by terrified sheep. Rage quit.\n\nSh*t just got UnReal. BOOM.\n\nUnReal World is special in the way it combines unparalleled player agency, deep simulation and a unique, low-fantasy mythos to produce original narratives derived through emergent gameplay. It's not a game I'd recommend to anybody but, it's a game I'd recommend to you, the person who yearns for immersive complexity and depth, the person who understands that Losing Is Fun™. Be warned though, once you venture into the far north--there is no coming back.\n\nOkay, the rest of you "survival" (mentally visualize those finger quotes) crafting games can go home now, UnReal World has come to Steam--and it is good.","February 26","true","76.7"," 130 of 139 people (94%) found this review helpful 94 people found this review funny","94","130","139","94","2"

Considerable learning curve. Awesome community & devs. Unlike anything else you're likely to find. Try it for free: http://unrealworld.fi/\n\nGeneral Info\nIt's certainly not for everyone... but it's also one of the most unique and fun games I've ever had the pleasure of playing (that's coming from someone who's been playing video games for over 20 years, and with over 1000 games on Steam alone).\n\nRoguelikes, as a genre, seem to have had a resurgence in popularity in recent years; ever since Minecraft rocked the gaming world, the whole survival-crafting-building genre has only increased in popularity.\n\nUnReal World mixes all of this and gives you a peerless roguelike survival crafting experience. There are no zombies to find here, only bears and Njerpez (not to mention the hunger and cold), but they're more than trouble enough. You'll wish you had something as easy as zombies to deal with! (except, no, hopefully not... no more zombies... too many zombies everywhere)\n\nDespite its name, UnReal World also provides one of the most realistic survival experiences I've seen in a game to date (probably the most realistic, really).\n\nDo you want to hang out in the highly-populated Driik lands for access to their large villages and have an easy life of crafting and trading? Or perhaps you'd prefer living out in the middle of nowhere to see if you can survive completely on your own, without help from anyone? Maybe you want to see a lot of combat and one day hope to eradicate all the Njerpez?\n\nAny of this is possible, and so much more. It's up to you.\n\nGameplay\nUnReal World won't hold your hand; iron-age pseudo-Finland is a brutal place in which to try and survive, no doubt.\n\nA lot of modern gamers might be turned off by the initial time investment required to learn how to play the game (not to mention the oldschool graphics; no fancy 3D & particle effects here), but for those that bother, they'll be rewarded with incredibly deep survival gameplay and an experience like no other.\n\nThe keyboard-based nature of the game might seem unwieldly at first (and yes, there are a lot of keys to memorize) but it offers very smooth gameplay once you get used to it. You can use the mouse for most/a lot of things, but I'd suggest gtting used to the hotkeys; they can drastically improve your experience.\n\nUnReal World is a sandbox. There are no set goals beyond "survive". How you go about doing that is up to you.\n\nThe map is huge, and mostly wilderness. The game's ten different playable cultures (and one non-playable; the Njerpez) all have their own "area" of the map, which determines where you can find settlements. The most interesting of these for a new player would be the Driikiläiset, which can be found in the south-west, as they are the most "urban" and have the biggest villages (which means more trading, which can make one's life much easier).\n\nWhen you create a new character, you choose which culture you come from; each has their strengths and weaknesses in terms of min/max stats, which affects a variety of things. You can also choose which general area of the map you want to start in, and a few other things.\n\nOnce you begin your game, what you do is entirely up to you. There are no set goals; this is a free-form sandbox game (though quests are coming in a future update!).\n\nYou can hunt, fish, explore, craft, trade, build yourself a house. Try to settle down, or live as a nomad. Summertime, and the livin' is easy... but you best be prepared for when winter comes around...\n\nCombat\n[coming soon]\n\nCrafting\n[coming soon]\n\nPricing\n[coming soon]\n\nParting Thoughts\nDon't dive into this game expecting to know how to play right away. There are semi-tutorials which will help you along with the basics (start with "Living in the Wild"), but this is a game with a lot of intricacies that you'll learn over time, with experience and trial & error. Easy to learn, hard to master, as they say. Patience is well-rewarded.\n\nUnReal World may be new to Steam, but it's been around for a very long time. Its first iteration dates all the way back to 1992! Of course, the game has changed a lot over the years, and will continue to do so for a long time still.\n\nSome useful resources, if you need help, are the official forum[z3.invisionfree.com] and the wiki[unrealworld.wikia.com]. Of course, there's also the Steam forum and no doubt some enterprising players will write Steam guides (though none are yet available at the time of this writing).\n\nThe UnReal World is a great game with a great community: if you have any questions, ask, someone will be happy to help!","February 26","true","3.8"," 95 of 106 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","95","106","3","4"

It's got a lot of attributes of a rogue-like: turn-based movement, permanent death, lots of stuff to discover, lots of stuff to craft. Somewhere in its development, more than 10 years ago, it strayed from the path of being a fantasy game to being a simulation of iron-age Finland.\n\nThe combat system is straight-forward, but unforgiving. The character has skills for various weapons; combat results are based on attacker and defender results; damage is allocated to hit locations after accounting for armor. Positioning matters: getting behind an opponent allows unblocked attacks. Injuries matter: serious blows to the legs can lame or cripple a creature, a hard blow to the head or even torso can stun. Combat can be drawn out or over quickly, depending on the hidden rng and positioning, so new players are advised to tread carefully at first. Or, you can accept that it's a rogue-like, and just get killed and restart.\n\nIf your character can survive or avoid combats, time will pass. You'll have to keep your character fed or starvation penalties will mount. You'll have to think about water, and warmth, and shelter. And eventually, maybe before your character is fully prepared, winter will arrive. In the UnReal World, winter changes the game. For about five game-months you need to stay warm and stay fed. Every day will be short. Every night will be long. The leading cause of death in winter might be boredom; the cabin fever and the routine of safe survival becomes too much and the player takes a character out to adventure in the great white north, into the teeth of a blizzard. Some of them make it back to their cabins. Having said that, with good fur clothes and ski equipment, a character can do a lot of hunting and trapping through the winter, or timberwork, or any number of other tasks.\n\nI think my characters have died every way possible in this game. I'll let you discover the various ways, and head off myself for further adventures.

I've also played the game a lot longer before it came to steam.\n\nThere is so much to say about Unreal World, but first I want to start off by saying that this is not a game that everyone will enjoy. Go check out the game on their website for free: http://www.unrealworld.fi/\nYou have to put in some effort to learn the controls (which don't take long, depending on how custom you are with roguelikes and basic keyboard layout) You also need to be able to use your imagination (which is our greatest gift for video games) to immerse yourself in your own world. Once you feel comfortable with that, you are set.\n\nUnreal World sets the player close to the iron age of human history ( 800 - 1200 A.D.) located in Finland. You can see from the start as soon as you launch the game that the traditional and folklore of the finnish culture is in place by listening to the music. The Kantele is being used which is part of the Finnish culture and it immediately tries to immerse the player in its rich world.\n\nYou choose a culture and then roll some stats. The world is then randomly generated and you get to choose a beginning "story" or setup to how you will play the first moments of the game. Each scenario has some sort of interesting background to help you be ready and immersed in the world. They are all interesting and some provide tools to help you get started.\n\nIf you survive your initial scenario (depending if you chose a violent one) you are then free to do what you wish. Ultimately Unreal World is a simulator of sorts to show the player how our world is a dangerous one without the need of zombies and Rust like 24/7 violence. Like the Finnish Proverb says "The world will surely teach one; if nothing else, than to walk slowly." It's very true!\nI won't go into details of what you can do because basically there are SO many things you can do and everything necessary is there to survive. If you were someone that read this because you thought you wouldn't be able to learn this or hate it for the graphics; well good for you b/c there are mods, in-game tutorials, encylopedia, and online guides.\n\nPros + Very Immersive\n+ A game that allows players to use their imagination\n+ Awesome Developers (Thanks Sami and Erkka)\n+ In Depth Combat System\n+ In Depth Injury System from cuts/bruises, to diseases and so much more\n+ Accurate Historical Items and Folklore\n+ Easily Moddable\n+ High Replayability\n\nCons -Roguelike Graphics: This is a con for some players used to modern graphics (Latest Update Improved them and mods help)\n-Slight learning curve with keys (but is easily fluid once you get used to it)\n-Could use more sounds IMO but overall very well done\n-Pictures are somewhat corny but overall they do well (personal taste and easily moddable and mods help)\n\nOverall, this is the TRUE survival game. I have over 400 hours of Rust and have played just about every survival game out there, but Unreal World just keeps pulling me back in for its in depth system of how we humans are adapted to survive in the impossible. This game allows me to use my imagination and do what I cannot do in my daily life.\n\nFinal Score: 95/100 Thank you so much for reading!","February 28","true","7.0"," 61 of 63 people (97%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","97","61","63","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/galenor/recommended/351700/","galenor","Catbag","http://steamcommunity.com/id/galenor/","503 products in account","Before I start, I just need to add: you can download this game for free from the official UnReal World website! The free version is practically (if not entirely) identical to the Steam version. Even if you're totally enamoured with this game by the looks of the descriptions and reviews, I still urge people to play the free version before grabbing the Steam one. Once you've given it a shot, you can make a much better decision on if you want to drop money on it. I told myself that if I played the free version for longer than eight hours, I'd buy the Steam version even if I never boot it up again. I clocked about ten hours, bought it on Steam, then continued to play it for however long it says I have at the top of this review.\n\nI really love this game. It's deep, but I've never felt truly lost; when you make a character, you can pick to have a goal-orientated quest system that teaches you how to play. This ranges from 'This is how you drink water, you gigantic idiot' to building your own house and trading for animals. Once you've grasped the basics, the game opens up as the survival roguelike it aims to be. If you want to know all the cool mechanics that come with the game, the other positive reviews go into passionate detail about what makes the game great. To avoid clashing with people who have literally hundreds of hours of gametime over me, I'll instead relay something that's unique to me; an in-game story.\n\nFur is really important in UnReal World. It's valuable, it's useful, and it'll stop you from freezing to death when Snow Hell decides to pay a visit. Unfortunately, being a total newbie at the game, the only hides I can get are from squirrels, hares, and ermines. Not very prestigious. The only big hides I had managed to score was one of a bear and an elk, and that's because they fell into a pit trap I set up and became a sitting duck for my volley of arrows. Basically, I'm a bad hunter.\n\nOne day I'm out in the snow in my bear fur clothes, checking my pit traps to see if any more suckers have taken pity on my awful hunting skills. The traps are on the border between a mire and a forest, set up to channel and capture any animals walking from one area to another. This time, I noticed a wolf on the world map standing in the mire, so I zoom in on the action to see what's going on.\n\nTurns out, it's not a wolf. It's a pack of them.\n\nAt this point of the game, the most dangerous thing I've successfully managed to hunt (that wasn't sitting in a pit and woefully awaiting death) is a fox. All the animals I've come across are basically 'let's see how close I can get before it runs away at the speed of light'. The wolves didn't do that. They decided that I'm up for dinner. They charge at me ("What? Animals attack you in this game?!") and suddenly I'm reaching for my bow. I thought I was a goner, but it turns out that shooting an arrow into the shoulder of a charging wolf is a good deterrent (who knew?). It became a game of scoring a single wound on each attacking wolf to scare them and make them flee. I scored a particularly good hit on one wolf, and I chased down its limping self and attacked its head for a kill. Skinned its fur and butchered its meat and fat. Good stuff.\n\nThat's when I discovered why wolves were even here in the first place; lying in the middle of the field was a wolf-torn elk. I approached it and checked the hide, and was surprised to see the wolves hadn't mangled it beyond recognition. It was about a quarter of the way through skinning it that I realised the wolves were still around -- just keeping their distance. I decided to grab the skin and forget the butchering, get out while I still could. I didn't need the meat, the fur was the real gold here.\n\nSo I walk home with some wolf and elk fur under my arms. The total sum of the furs I had back home came to something like 8lbs; the fur I was carring totalled 30lbs. A good catch! I set the wolf fur down and use its fat from the butchering to tan it. I then set the elk fur down and -- wait! I didn't butcher the elk! I don't have any fat to tan it with! 20lbs of fur was threaning to go rotten on me if I didn't find a solution, and fast.\n\nI dumped the fur in my cold, 'please don't rot on me' cellar and made a return to the elk. Turns out, so had the wolves, and they had regained their courage. Some nasty nips later, I decided my life wasn't worth some fat and fled.\n\nI looked up about the tanning process to try to find alternatives for my elk fur. Turns out, you don't have to use fat. The skinned barks of alder and rowan trees work just as well. Big problem; I lived in a gigantic forest of pine and birch. So begins the race against time to find an alder or rowan tree before my goldmine attracts flies rather than merchants.\n\nSo I'm darting around the world map, cursing every pine and birch that I see. That's when I find a herd of reindeer milling around. I decided to try my luck, so I zoomed in and took a less-than-hopeful shot at the nearest one, expecting a total miss and all the reindeer to flee. It hits. Fire off a second arrow before the victim has a chance to run. Second one hits.\n\nOh crap. So this is what hunting feels like.\n\nThe reindeer has been so badly hit, it's practically crawling its way across the floor. I catch up with it and start trying to unload arrows into its head. My aim is so bad that it ends up hitting the shoulder, body, and even one hit on the knee, at which point I reprimanded UnReal World for its poor choice of meme references. It was around the time I decided to equip a javelin and start poking its head that my character falls asleep. Turns out, fighting wolves and lugging fur across a continent really tires a man out. Who knew?\n\nI awoke with the reindeer nowhere in sight. I followed its tracks and found it only a short run away, still desperately trying to crawl its way to freedom. I started poking at its head with the javelin until it dies, skinned it, made sure to grab the fat this time, and recovered the arrows I had fired. The fat of the reindeer was enough to tan its own hide, but not enough to tan the elk's. The hunt for the tree was still on.\n\nI read up on alder and rowan trees, and found out that they mostly grow in and around villages. So I poked my head into the local village and -- sure enough -- sitting in the middle of the field all proud of itself was an alder tree. The villagers were probably weirded out to see a man walk into their village, cry 'YES!' and then begin frantically carving the bark off of one of their trees. I didn't care. Elk fur was back in fashion, baby.\n\nSo that's how I went from Small Game Extraordinaire to sleeping in the furs of a wolf, elk, and reindeer, all because I decided to go check my traps for a bit. My bear fur clothes had some nasty wolf bites in them and I had sufffered a few nasty scratches myself, but I could probably line the entirety of my house in fur now. It was about this time I realised that maybe, just maybe, UnReal World is an awesome game and that I'm glad I got it.\n\nStay safe in the cold North, folks!","March 15","true","26.5"," 57 of 58 people (98%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","98","57","58","5","0"

I've had this game for around a decade, and the developer has kindly supplied me with a key for the Steam version.)\n\nSee the bottom of the review for TL;DR.\n\nI rarely write positive reviews, but to me, the devotion that Sami shows to his supporters and fans is nothing short of remarkable. He went through the trouble of walking me through the steps of getting my key re-sent and updated despite me having very little of the original information I had when originally purchasing the game, and also has made a point of giving Steam keys to those who own lifetime registration keys.\n\nThough, this is a review about URW, not about the developer.\n\nURW takes a somewhat different approach to things than a lot of roguelikes, especially the ones usually seen on Steam. Rather than abstracting concepts like HP, satiation, exhaustion, deities, combat, and so on, URW tries as well as it is able to approach things more realistically. Fans of Dwarf Fortress Adventurer Mode shouldn't be too out of their element here.\n\nRather than being about killing dragons and getting amulets, URW is more generally about surviving in the wilderness. Trying to, anyway. Combat poses a very real threat. One missed blow could get you a concussion, or swept off of your feet and getting a spear through your chest, or teeth at your throat. This is made all the more painful, because your characters and the worlds they live in are indeed very permanent. You might build a house and make a type of farm, trading regularly with a nearby village. Make a smokehouse to cure your meats, make a sauna, get drunk, do what people from Finland do.\n\nBut the combat itself isn't the only problem. You also have to worry about things like your wounds getting infected, illnesses, starvation, dehydration, hypothermia, sleep deprivation. Of course, when you're injured, it becomes even harder to care for yourself... but that might be skipping ahead a little too far. Depending on whatever choice of background and scenario you pick, your first priority might be making a temporary shelter out of sticks and leaves, fending off a wolf, or escaping from captivity.\n\nAfter you make yourself marginally more comfortable, you need to start working on feeding yourself, and making (or trading for, or looting, or stealing) tools as a means to accomplish this. Whether that means hunting for food, fishing, foraging, robbing other people, stealing from them, or just plain killing them and eating them. (The gods won't mind. Really.) But while eating raw food might be okay sometimes, you should probably consider cooking it, making a dish of it, or maybe a bit later on, working on a means of preparing it for long-term storage, like digging a cold-storage cellar, or curing it with salt, or in a smokehouse.\n\nOnce you have a somewhat reliable means of feeding yourself and living comfortably in the trees, and have a nice axe, hopefully without too many people's blood on it, you could think about building a house for yourself! Or you could live like a nomad. Your choice, really. Either way, once you're on your feet, you can get niceties by trading things like cured furs and pelts to village traders and other wanderers possibly like yourself.\n\nAlthough there are arbitrary goals that can reward you with things, ultimately they are optional and there is no endgame or final goal of URW besides what you dictate.\n\nURW is definitely not for everyone, and I do recommend trying the free version first. Don't let my review make the game sound more hypeworthy than it is. See for yourself if you like it or not. Even if you think you like roguelikes, this one might not sit well with you.\n\ntl;dr Mostly-realistic wilderness survival roguelike that eventually turns into a violent Harvest Moon with permadeath.\nTRY THE FREE VERSION FIRST.","February 27","true","10.5"," 67 of 78 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","67","78","4","11"

There are numerous tasks always available for you to do, and the objective is simply to survive. But almost inevitably: you won't.\n\nYour character struggles mostly against nature (and the occasional bandit or warrior). The weather, the ice, the BEARS. Go fishing, go hunting, go trading. Make tools and weapons and traps. Whatever you think you could do in an Iron-Age Scandinavian forest, you can do it in this game, with astonishing attention to detail and realism.\n\nThe animal A.I. is amazing. Wolves split and converge over long-distances with their packs, howling for communication. Kill the biggest reindeer in a pack (the leader) and the other reindeer will become aimless until they're picked off by other prey.\n\nCombat, while not action-based, has a cold realism to it unlike anything I've seen. Your life isn't measured in "Hit points"... Rather your body, your limbs, your blood, your senses: they can all be attacked and taken away from you -- or you can take them away from your enemy. One hit in the right spot will debilitate you. Game over. But its a death that will make you smile. Dying is a part of nature, and a part of this game. Fight against it, but realize that its what makes your character's adventure... complete.\n\nHunting in this game is a challenge and never a guaranteed success. You, the player, as a person, need to learn the value of patience and deligence. But when you finally manage to track down your first elk or stag through vast reaches of forest, until at last the animal is too fatigued to run anymore... there is NO "kill" in a videogame I've found as satisfying as this. Yesterday I got really lucky, and chased a panicked reindeer that injured itself trying to scale down a cliff -- but when I finally caught up to it, a wolf had half-eaten its corpse, ruining the precious fur and making off with some of the meat.\n\nSmoke/Dry the meat, tan the skin, feed your dog, and donate a cut of meat to the "gods" for letting you live another day. Work on building your cabin, or preparing the cold soil for future agriculture. There is so much to do, and it is all vital, well-designed, brilliant. This is a brilliant one-of-a-kind game that throws you into a real world like no other game I've ever played. There is no game I would more enthusiastically urge people to try. I am so happy this game has come to Steam, thus coming to my attention, and I have never been more happy to give a developer my money (thank you, Sami).

I'm fairly sure that latter one can still happen. Don't mess with lynxes. Their silent meows are a premonition of terror and violence.)\n\nI'm not very good at getting myself set up, so here's how I usually end up playing:\n\n- Making a primitive bow and arrows, then hunting while I gradually starve to death.\n- Fishing (maybe with a fishing pole, maybe by stabbing the water repeatedly with a stick)... while I gradually starve to death.\n- Setting a bunch of traps in apparently unfavorable areas. Getting frostbite (or just really frustrated) as I try to check them over and over, even though they haven't brought in any game.\n- Finally making enough headway to build a cabin. Playing an awkward, hilarious, terrifying game of cat and mouse with a lynx that wanders onto my property, until I can manage to get a fence and traps up.\n\nMy last game, I started out trying to hunt with a bow/arrow. I brought down a bunch of birds with it, but I was gradually starving. I found a grouse that had been partially eaten by a goshawk. Fine, I'm not picky. That's a pound of grouse meat. I ate it. I was tracking a herd of reindeer for days, and when I went up to the mountain to scout out where they'd gotten to, I saw that there were wolves chasing them. I weighed the options, decided I was starving and I'd try to avoid the wolves. Came within a screen of wolves twice, but managed to avoid them, and found a reindeer that the wolves had taken down and started eating. Fine. I'm not picky. I skinned it, butchered it, and brought the meat home.\n\nFinally, my trap pits started bringing in big game. Too much big game, in fact -- something like 4-5 reindeer and stags within the period of a week or so. I lost one of the hides when it rotted while I was scrambling to butcher everything, tan the hides, reset the traps, and haul meat up to the closest village before it went bad.\n\nSo I got sloppy and left a bunch of meat next to one of the traps, where I'd butchered a reindeer but couldn't carry everything back. When I came back for the rest, a wolf was there, attracted by the meat. He lunged at me and took me down in two attacks.\n\nAnyway, if you like roguelikes or sandbox games, especially wilderness survival, get this. I always come back to it, that's how good it is, and it's constantly being improved (dynamic weather, predator-prey interaction, and more realistic animal spawning are all very new, and they're amazing, and I'm sure we can expect more of the same quality changes in the future). It's got a heck of a learning curve, but it basically defined sandbox games for me, way back before Minecraft was even a thing.","February 26","true","35.1"," 42 of 45 people (93%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","93","42","45","5","0"

It provides a real sense of accomplishment as well.\n\nThe first time I finally killed a large animal was as exciting as anything I've experienced in a game.  I had to sit back and just enjoy the accomplishment for several minutes.  When I made the mistake of building a fire too close to my log cabin that I had spent months (in game) and hours (in real life) building, and watched it burn down, I felt a real sense of loss, but also that I had learned something, and was ready to jump back in and try again.  The game's depth and pacing are, in my opinion, what set up these moments.\n\nIf you enjoy the survival genre, you owe it to yourself to give this a try.\n\nAn additional note: the development cycle for this game has been great over the years.  The developers (all two of them) keep the community informed and are constantly making improvements to the game.","February 26","true","1.3"," 43 of 47 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","43","47","2","0"

It's nice to see it up on steam where it will get more exposure and bring a great deal of enjoyment to many others who discover it.\n\nIt is a rich single-player world where you will have to survive.  No, not one wave after another of enemies, but the harsh realities of living in a land where even the weather can be your enemy.  Yes, there are some (NPC) people whom you might have to fight with, but many more whom you will trade with and develop a relationship for mutual survival.  You pick a spot to make your cabin.  Cut the trees to make the logs.  Fish.  Hunt.  Plant.  Make your tools or trade for them with nearby villagers.  Stock up on foods, make warm clothing and much, much more... and maybe,  just maybe, you'll survive the cold, dark winter.\n\nI enjoy the turn-based aspect of this game, allowing me to go at my own pace.  Graphics are tiled top-down and not spectacular, but with each iteration of the game, they get better and better.  This latest version the graphics (particularly the lighting) add a lot to immersion.   It doesn't really matter though, because you soon get lost in the details and become immersed in the world no matter what.  How much snow fell while you were sleeping, do I need to use my skis?  Has it been cold enough to go out on the ice?  The edges of the lake are solid, but is the middle safe enough to walk on?  Did I hear a Elk in the distance to my left?  I better check my trap lines.  I wonder if the village I discovered earlier last week has some better spears to trade for.  There were  rumors of a bear in the area and it's hide would make nice warm clothing for cold winter days.... and on it goes.\n\nModding is easy and enjoyable, especially with this new version, allowing you to tweak many things or make completely new ones.  The creators of the game are also responsive to the community and very friendly.\n\nI don't really have anything negative to say. It might take a little time to get used to the key commands, but the help file is easily accessible after hitting the ESC key.  The game does what it's suppose to and just gets better and more detailed with every iteration.  It's turn-based, survival, wilderness simulation that makes for a great afternoon or evening of play.  I'd say try it out, the price is very reasonable.","February 26","true","46.5"," 38 of 40 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","38","40","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/feuerzeuge/recommended/351700/","feuerzeuge","fleur","http://steamcommunity.com/id/feuerzeuge/","211 products in account","Have you ever wondered what being a Finn was like before the invention of alcoholism, anime, severe depression and murdering Russians? Well now, through the magic of computer roleplaying, you can at last find out!\n\nThis game is a pretty innovative blend of roguelike and survival simulator that dates back to several decades before the current survival game craze. The presentation and interface are true to that era, and so really shouldn't be a hindrance unless you're a millenial casual babby, in which case I congratulate you on managing to read this far without losing interest and playing with your smartphone, you little ♥♥♥♥.\n\nThe only area where this doesn't really hold is with certain repeated commands - putting down several fishing nets in succession involves a number of awkward key combinations, and the process of chopping down trees and hauling them to a location (which you WILL need to do if you want a house) will inevitably strain your fingers to the point where you will certainly come to sympathize with your likewise strained and fatigued character.\n\nBesides that, the graphics are charming and effective - the sprites stand out, look good and tell you what you need to know, and the menus are decorated with quaint images of Finnish cosplayers in their natural habitat.\n\nBut enough about that nonsense! You want to hear about gameplay! The areas where this game really excels are its depth, realism and immersiveness. You begin play at a season of your choice, either in the wilderness or in a friendly, desolate or hostile settlement, depending on the starting scenario of your choice, equipped with either very little or nothing at all to help you weather the oncoming trials. From that point on, you have just one overarching goal: survive.\n\nThis isn't nearly as easy as you might think - not because everything is trying to kill you (in fact, the opposite is more likely to be true), but rather because getting the necessities of life is hard. Hunting, for example, requires that you first find prey - which involves a great deal of fruitless wandering and scouring the land for tracks. You might follow a fresh and promising trail to the point where you're only a hair's breadth away from your quarry, only to have it suddenly go cold, prompting profound disappointment. If you do find prey, your problems only multiply, as you then have to make a decision - do you close the distance and risk spooking the game in order to get a better shot? Or take the one you have, and risk missing to the same effect?\n\nManaging risks and resources is in many ways the core of the gameplay. You have to choose not only how to conduct your activities, but which activities to embark on, as each have their associated risks and rewards. A hunt is likely to fail, can be dangerous, and is wont to leave you far from home and exhausted come night time. Fishing is safe, but consumes large amounts of your time and might return nothing at all, or an insufficient catch. There are no sure bets, however, and you'll inevitably have to go all in at some point. Sometimes you'll fail. That's just life.\n\nLikewise, every activity has its associated costs. Not necessarily in resources, but always in your character's time and energy. Building a house will give you a leg up, but chopping down trees and hewing logs is hard work that's sure to leave you with an appetite, and to make it worse, all that time you spent doing that was time you didn't spend acquiring food. Consequently, much of the earlier game is an exercise in building a big enough stockpile to be able to do more time-intensive work without worrying about what you'll eat tomorrow. This is difficult, as the most easily acquired foods (fish and meat) spoil rapidly without some means to preserve them, and even if you do get lucky enough to kill an elk early on, there's no way you can eat all the resultant meat all by yourself before it will spoil.\n\nStill, though, overcoming all of those challenges as they come at you brings on a sense of elation like little else in video games. Sure, half of it might just be dying in the cold and worrying about tomorrow's meals, and sure, the Njerpez will kill your favourite dog, and sure, you might acidentally give your pants away for a handful of peas, but everything becomes worth it when you can sit down and look with pride upon your big house, blooming fields and cellarful of dried meats. It's an extremely immersive game, equal parts harsh and rewarding, and frighteningly easy to get lost in. There's far less cannibalism involved than I remember from the last time I played it, but I would still highly recommend it if you're into deep and immersive sandbox RPGs.","March 10","true","30.0"," 37 of 44 people (84%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","84","37","44","24","3"

My first impressions of the game; looking at the trailer and screenshots.\n\nI decided to randomly look at a video of this game being explained. Before I knew it I was slightly interested.\n\nMy slight interest and curiosity got me to download the free version of this game and give it a good college try. After about an hour I knew this was something special. Something I could play for years if not for once in a while.\n\nYou are in control of a tribesmen or women of sorts set to survive in the great iron north. You can customize your starting story which impacts your starting gear and situation respectively. You can also customize where you start and whether the tutorial is active or not. From there is up to you create a marvelous adventure filled with peril, exhaustion, starvation, infection, and whatever else might kill you.\n\nThe game mechanics make sense and feel realistic. Chopping a tree down with a knife takes hours unlike using an axe, chasing down a reindeer or badger is unlikely, etc. It’s not perfect but it works.\n\nThis game kind of reminds me of a ‘create your own adventure book/board game’. Time progresses as you perform actions and move around the world. This gives you time to think about your next action. Do you try and sneak up on that wild pig or do you chunk this rock on the ground at it knowing that if you miss it’s probably going to get away? Should I eat this spoiled food knowing it might make me sick?\n\nDeath is permanent so make every choice count!\n\nEvery action performed is checked against multiple stats. Reminds me of the old DnD days. Makes the world feel more immersive and the combat feel richer. You want to throw that spear? How fatigued are you? What’s you skill in spears? Are you injured? How far away is the target? I don’t know all the exact stats but I know there is a lot going on in the background for everything you do.\n\nI recommend that you just watch a couple video and try it out for yourself. Download the free version at their website.\nIf this sounds good to you then you owe it to yourself to give it a good college try like I did.\n\nI will leave you with a brief adventure that I had in the Unreal World…\n\nAlone, cold, and starving I come across a lonely reindeer in the middle of a lush forest. He doesn’t notice me so make a slow approach. As I approach I snap a small branch beneath my foot like an idiot which alerts the reindeer to jump to attention. It’s now or never. I draw and shoot my bow. The shot is steady and accurate but the reindeer is already in motion. The arrow penetrates just below the reindeer’s shoulder. It takes off into the dense woods. I follow. After a short while I start to lose sight of it and I am relying on my tracking ability alone. At this point it’s getting dark and I am starting to lose hope. My starvation and chill are taking a hold of me I am beginning to fail. Then I hear something to my south. A yell of an animal. Do I continue on the tracks or follow the sound? I hear the yell again. I decide to forget the trail of reindeer tracks and follow the sound. After about 10 minutes of travelling south I see it… It’s the reindeer I shot earlier. It doubled backed on me. It’s injured, crippled and fatigued. “You’re mine now!” I draw and fire my bow. I am so fatigued the arrow hits the tree next to it. Again! I draw and shot my bow. The arrow flies true and I hit it straight in the neck; blood rushes out. It slows and after a few steps passes out. I approach and finish the job. I take a moment to rest. I gather some branches and firewood and make a fire. After skinning the animal I butcher it. I am so hungry I feast on it raw like a ravenous dog. Its late, taking satisfaction of a good kill I decide to sleep for the night. Unfortunately the fire goes out in the middle of the night and I awake in the early hours of the morning chilled yet again. As I approach my partially butchered reindeer I notices something… bear tracks… My reindeer has been feasted upon. Just as I turn to follow the bear tracks I see the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ himself. I take a step back and it approaches. I draw my bow, it becomes enraged. My shot is steady and true puncturing the bear in the front of his chest. It’s not enough. It swipes its massive claw and gashes my arm and chest wide open. I fall back… I reach for my knife but it’s over. It finishes me off with a mighty blow.\n\nThis is just one of many wonderful adventures that await you in the Unreal World.\n\n10 bear tracks out of 10.","March 27","true","23.9"," 27 of 28 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","27","28","2","0"

I'm twenty-four years old so this game has been "In-Dev" my entire existence and it shows through in some good and bad ways*. When I saw UnReal World on Steam my jaw dropped, I loaded $25 onto my wallet, and bought it immediately. No regrets.\n\nI'm going to do a light Pros & Cons to sum the why of it up.\n\nPros:\n\n+ Deep game mechanics.\n+ Actually a survival game. (Unlike Rust/The Forest/ and others that make the claim)\n+ High Replayability.\n+ Immersive Lore.\n+ Progressive skills.\n+ Massive crafting system.\n+ Extensive Medical system.\n+ Many mods made by the community and refined over time.\n+ Easy to create your own mods. Google the resources you need and the system is easy to learn.\n\nCons:\n\n-- Mixture of Traditional & Digitized sprites for graphics.\n-- Complex context menus required for maneveuring through the game.\n- Basic/dated sound effects.\n\n\nNeutral (Because this could be a plus for some, a negative for others.)\n\n* +/- Overall a dated old-school look and feel.\n\n+/- A slight lack of "end-game" content, but reaching the end-game takes plenty of time and new updates are planned to rectify this.  A few of the planned updates are: family management, village ceremonies, and more. This is all detailed on the development page.\n\n+/- End game content  by 3rd party developers. I think that a game's merit shouldn't be based off the content created by the community, but while you're waiting on new updates things like the Shaman mod can give you your fix of additional content. It adds many "rituals" that feel lore-friendly and allow you to delve into spiritual magic and ultimately align yourself with light or darkness.\n\n+/- It is lacking in music overall, but the new title screen music is promising.\n\n\nDue to the time when the project was initially started the game has been stuck in the past as far as graphics, sound, and the general presentation goes.\n\nThe skin isn't beautiful, but the meat is sturdy and supple. [It must be a Kaumo.]\nFor those who aren't deterred by the time investment it takes to learn this game it is worthwhile and has more to come.\n\nYou can check out the developer's plans over on the website under the Development tab.\n\nhttp://www.unrealworld.fi/urw_development.html\n\nProtips for those who intend to buy it/already have:\n\n(I'll update this as I think of more.)\n\n! Use the mouse wheel to zoom in/out. This is very useful for hunting.\n\n! The help menu is your friend. Even for seasoned veterans.\n\n! Dogs are man's best friends for a reason. They make hunting much easier.\n\n! Humans used to use a method called "Persistence Hunting" to hunt down big game. The short of it is you use your incredible endurance to run an animal down and track it until it collapses from exhaustion then shower it with arrows or beat it to death in its sleep. How metal is that?\n\n! Try to spawn close to the Driikiläiset people (Cyan on the map, toggle culture colors on) so that you can trade with their massive amounts of shops if you find a village. You'll do quite well for yourself by peddling your crafts to them for various supplies.\n\n! Trap fences can be difficult to get the hang of, but making a house relatively near one can help guarantee your cellar stays stocked throughout the winter.\n\n! When starving and tracking down an animal have ranged weaponry.\nYou miss 100% of the shots you don't take -Lebron James on hunting, maybe.\n\n!!! Don't give up. Every death is a chance to learn or try something different although it is frustrating to lose your progress. If you really don't want to lose out on it (and this is often frowned upon, but your own choice) then you pull up task manager (Control + Alt + Delete) and end the URW.exe process before going through the menu that deletes your character/progress. Everything that happened up to your death will be the same when you reload the game. You lose out on the experience, but it is your purchase and decision.\n\n\nEDIT:  Actually, since I was born in 1992 and the game was released then it has been in-dev all my life.

Unreal World is both of these, along with many other themes that are so incredibly rare to find bundled into a single game. I know anything I say in this review will not come close to doing the game justice, but I hope I can sway any readers into trying this wonderful gem if they are a fan of this kind of game.\n\nUnreal World is based on Finland during the late iron age, roughly 800 - 1200 AD. While there a few fantasy themes in Unreal World, I consider this game to be pretty realistic. The fantasy themes I mentioned are mostly your character's religous beliefs, which are modeled after Finnish beliefs during the time period. If you have to swim across a river for example, it is a good idea to perform a ritual to "banish the evil water guardian" so that you will be less likely to drown in the process.\n\nThe game is a huge world to explore, randomly generated for every character you make. When you create your character, after selecting what tribe you are from, picking a character portrait, and other things, you will be able to pick a starting scenario if you wish. The scenario doesn't affect the gameplay, only the circumstances you begin the game with. Will you be an aspiring farmer, starting the game with a shovel and some seeds to start your very own farm? Or perhaps you have come across an abandoned campsite, with its creator nowhere to be found? There are many ways to start your game, and as many ways to play the game as you can imagine.\n\nThere are no restrictions of what you can and can not do. Will you build a cabin far off into the woods, trapping animals and selling their fur to a nearby village? Or maybe you prefer the life of a hermit, living off the land, avoiding human contact completely.\n\nI can ramble all day about this game, but like I said, anything I say in this review is not going to even come close to how great this game is. If you are a fan of wilderness survival games, this game is for you. Some people may be turned away because of the old school graphics, but I can tell you without any doubt in my mind that this game more than makes up for that with the incredible amount of realism it contains, along with a refreshing break from the modern world to a time so long ago, it seems totally unreal.","February 27","true","41.6"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","24","26","0","0"

I escaped from slavery, my Njerpez captors far behind me. Lost in the wilderness with nothing but the clothes on my back and a knife, with which I have crafted a javelin, I am desperately searching for a village.\n\nMy search brings me across an open marshland, a place where I spot wild sow tracks! I follow the tracks until I spot her, and I try to sneak closer. The injuries I sustained from my escape and not eating for a few days have weakend my skills, and the sow spots me - she squeals in fright and takes off! I give chase across the marshland until I see she has trapped herself in a spit of land surrounded by deeper water. I think about throwing my javelin at her, but don't want to risk losing it in the water if I miss, so I take position on the strip of land she must cross by to escape. She doesn't have much of a choice and tries to bolt past me. Using my javelin like a spear I thrust at her as she goes past, and it lands!

Actually, it started out way back (it's in development since 1992) as a fairly standard fantasy game, but then slowly transformed into a realistic life simulator in the setting of iron age Finland.\n\nYou will have to survive by crafting needed stuff, hunting/gathering/fishing/putting out traps and get food, wood and pelts to make items and/or to trade for things you can't craft like axes or pots, and get better armor and weapons to fight off wild beasts and nasty humans (they come in the form of either bloodthirsty Njerpez warriors that will only settle for your death, or simple robbers that will try to get your stuff either by talking or by bludgeoning you over the head). Also of course you'll get tired and need to sleep, eat, and drink.\n\nThe game has a day-night cycle, full-on weather and seasons system: in summer the temperatures are bearable even without being covered head to toe in furs, berries and plants to eat are readily available, there's plenty of game to hunt and life is generally easier (you will get mauled by a bear nonetheless, don't worry)\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, winter is harsh: days are short and nights are long, it gets freezing cold and you WILL die from hypothermia so you have to build shelter, possibly an elaborate log cabin complete with fireplace, table and bed, make enough firewood to keep warm and get a decent source of food or a good plan for having enough in those long, boring months. Ice will cover the rivers and lakes so to fish you'll have to poke holes in it, and if you're not careful you can walk on thin ice that will break and drop you into freezing water. Also snow accumulates on the ground and unless you have skis, you won't be able to walk very long without getting incredibly tired so you better have everything you need not too far away. On the upside it also allows you to spot tracks much easier. Too bad there are few animals around in winter...\n\nI could speak about the game all day but this would become too long, so I'll just say one last thing, and it's the thing that impressed me most:\n\nThis game is a labor of love. Over the many years I've been playing this, a LOT of things have changed, and always for the better. Just since last year or so, there's a totally new trading / reputation system with villages, most exploits have been squashed and replaced with sensible mechanics, you can command your pet dog and it's even more of a killing machine, new animal AI especially for predators that will actively hunt their prey (have sheeps in a pen? be careful of wolves!), addition of more birds and seals you can club, and the list goes on and on. It's a truly well supported game that is worth at least double what they're asking, so if you're interested in this kind of game and don't mind that it's keyboard-heavy and has 2d graphics, it is a MUST BUY.","February 26","true","26.6"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","18","19","0","0"

I have read that water is the first priorty so I went looking for some and found a frozen lake. Of course stupid me I walked out onto the lake and fell through! I got back to shore and my character was prone and freezing to death.\n\nSo, I decided f*** it I cut a hole in the ice and had my drink. Then I spotted a fallen log so I crawled to it to make a fire, no luck, needed more timber. So I went to a tree and cut 11 pieces of branches off of it. It took me a while but I figured out how to pick it up. Crawled back to falled log, dropped the timber on it and tried several times to make a fire...finally success and I was able to warm right back up and get it.\n\nIt seems trivival but really it was very exciting to figure out the controls and save myself from freezing to death! Keep in mind playing this on steam is the first time I have ever played this game. my character is still alive. Though he came very very very close to dying of dehydration. I found water, and I had to tear up some of my clothes to make cords but I have successfully made a stone axe, and also I have also successfully crafted a primative bow.\n\nNow I need feathers. I found a bird and hit it with a rock, which I believe wounded it but did not kill it, then I chased it down and threw my spear and missed, kept going after it and collected my spear. Got next to the bird, attacked and killed it, my first kill.\n\nI need to collect the feathers from the bird and clean it so I can cook it. How do I collect the feathers from the bird? (I think I can figure out cleaning and cooking it.)\nThese are the types of experiences you will have with this game, it is complicated to control at first but the game has a lot of tutorials and also a helpful community, so if you are looking for a hardcore survival experience, look no further, you have found it, and even though I do believe you can get the game for free, I highly suggest buying it and supporting this developer, special games like this do not come around very often.\n\n\n","March 19","true","5.5"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","18","19","0","2"

In solid, continuous development since 1992, URW has no end in sight, with Enormous Elk (developers Sami and Erkka) continuing their work in bringing Iron Age Totally-Not-Finland to life.\n\nURW is the epitome of survival games, yet predates the current craze by literally decades. It's realistic, it's tough, it's unforgiving, and extremely rewarding to play. There is a lot of depth and complexity to explore, and you can live your (probably short) life as a fisherman, hunter, trader, hermit, cannibal, raider... whatever strikes your fancy.\n\nRoguelike mechanics, charming tileset graphics, and harsh survival interweaved with a touch of mysticism and the spirit of nature (which is simulated in great detail, from plants to animals to weather and seasons). Playing URW is simultaneously zen, and at times stressful (when you fall from a tree and break all your limbs and freeze to death, or almost anything to do with bears).\n\nHighly recommended, and sold for a pittance. If you have doubts, check out the developers' website for the free version. If you find yourself enjoying the game, pitch in on Steam to support it years to come. This is a true labour of love, and with all things going well, will see years and years of improvements ahead.","February 26","true","0.7"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","14","14","0","0"

Starvation is a very real threat, along with temperature. On top of the survival aspects, there are also hostile npcs who will easily kill you unless you get hold of some good equipment. The game uses text to describe what is happening, and does so very very well, combat is espescially savage, with the wounds inflicted described in immense detail.

The game is definitely amazing, but fun is something only you can decide.\n\nOn that note, buying it here exists only to support the developer and give it some recognition.

The camp has pretty much everything I need except water so I take off looking for water. I must have been wandering snowblind and dehydrated because when I snap out of my stupor I'm standing in the middle of a frozen lake. I learn this just in time to fall through the ice.\n\nI am finally able to get out of the water and back on to the ice, so I then start crawling for the shore. I get to the shore and I realize "hey, I can make a hole in the ice and drink the water". As I am raising my axe to punch the hole, some tribesman I do not know walks up and politely informs me that I will donate all my stuff to him. I tell him to go to hell and as bad as I just wanted a drink of that cool water, I turn the axe on the interloper who then whistles for his friend (up to this point I though that his use of the words "us" and "we" was just an eccentricity...like the royal "We").\n\nWith an axe in one hand and a knife in the other I am getting the better of this upstart worm of a thief, but I can see his friend has come out of the treeline with a huge - what I can only describe as a "pole". I guess it was supposed to be a staff but no normal man would wield this giant piece of wood as a staff. I get back to the business at hand and I have finally killed the thief who started this whole affair.  When I look up again the other thief has closed the distance and brains me with this monstrous tree that he has carried with him.

This is a game that has been in development since the 1990's. Its graphic appearance and mechanics also draw their lineage to this hazy age of nostalgia, gameplay experimentation and one-man development operations.\n\nNow that this warning is out of the way, listen closely. UnReal World is as close as you can get to a realistic depiction of a sparsely populated iron age sandbox game. You will grow hungry as your fishing nets stay empty, game eludes your arrows and spears and trap fences stay empty. You will become desperate in your pleas for the forest spirits so they'd take pity on your starving and cold form that struggles to hang onto life in the cold forest. You will curse that handaxe you lost in the mire and think of the piles of as direly needed equipment you'll have to give away, so the village tradesman will grant you a new axe.\n\nThis game is a roguelike, but you'll only find cold and dark in the pitiful caves in this game. It will punish you, until you learn how to play it. Then, when you sauna is lit, the walls are filled with drying meat, the fur and leather piles grow in your hut and the cellar is full of potatoes and salt, you will sit back and enjoy rewards of your hard-learned and earned labours, some pissy Njerpez will stumble on your farm and score a lucky hit on your forehead with an axe he probably found where you lost it, sending your head and save game flying into the horizon.\n\nSuch is life, as the Finnish proverb goes.

It is in an early iron age setting though you can choose to start needing to make a stone axe. Unlike flashy graphic games it has an easier to work with modding allowing you to insert objects you think a survivor could make without having to learn 3d graphics. The combat is far more realistic than many with it being quite dangerous so plan, equip and stalk not go in as a fantasy magic warrior. Healing is likewise based on more realistic needs of days to heal, impaired skills and the possibility of infections leading to death a week after the battle.\nFirst got the game years ago. At times I do play the other 3d games yet they never seem to have the inner core of survival any where as good as this one. It is a game you can play through then come back. The dollar vs playtime is extremely good.\nWith the choice for 2d and easy modding there is already big changes to the game possible through the work of modders. I made my own to add a handful of things.\nI will also add if you are planning major real life trips this is much better to teach the mindset and needs than other games. Of course study from books and so forth but the investment of time and yields are far more realistic in this.\nIn terms of the gaming industry this is one of the games showing that a cottage industry for game developers is possible. Literally. He lives in near-wilds of Finland and himself uses a bow, builds fires and so forth.\nFor anthropology (study of human cultures) the basis on the early iron age Finland gives you a chance to see a presentation of another side of humanity. It does include a ritual magic system that I look on as a "slow magic" where you don't get fireballs or wizz-bangs but improvements like to increased chances of a trap working. Never quite sure if the ritual made the difference or if you just got lucky. Those rituals though often have a basis in the oral traditionds that did show skill, like the chant for fire building describes a good arrangement of the woods.","February 26","true","122.9"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

UnReal World has been around and in active development a long time. The very first version was in 1992, which was vastly different from the game we have now. I personally have owned it for 10 years now, and in that time it has just kept getting better and better. I can't even begin to guess how many thousands of hours I've played this game over the years. I come back after every major update to find fresh new features to explore, with the basic meat of the game just as fun as I have always found it.\n\nIt's an amazing iron age survival simulation, the best I have played.\n\nYou create a character, choosing a tribe - each with their own genetics (affects attributes, height, build), knowledge (skills, auto-identification of certain plants, which rituals you might start with), and starting gear. Then you can select from a variety of starts to get things rolling - like being an escaping slave (good luck getting away from the camp full of your former masters) or an unfortunate hunting trip (will you kill the animal that killed your father, or flee?). You also pick which season to start in - each with their own challenges. From there you can either do the basic missions, which are there to get you acquainted with the game and give you attainable early goals; do the advanced missions, which are a bit more difficult and require more time; or just strike off and do your own thing.\n\nLike any good survival game, you need to provide the basics for your character. You'll need a steady source of food - from hunting, fishing, trapping, foraging, farming, or trading. Just make sure you don't misidentify that mushroom and eat a poisoned one, and don't fall in your own trap pit - especially if you filled it with spikes.\n\nYou will also need shelter. Options here are a very basic lean to made from spruce branches, a kota (Finnish tent) made from hides that you can pack up and move with you, or a permanent log cabin. Having a smoke house with a fireplace comes in handy for smoking meat, which is one of the easiest ways to preserve your meat. Cellars are also handy to keep your food fresher longer. Need some help building your cabin? Hire a woodsman to cut some trees down for you, some good food may be all he wants.\n\nAnd warm clothes are a must for when the temperature drops, so don't forget to skin that stag and tan its fur for a nice warm set of clothes. Or just for trading, a good fur is valuable. Maybe you'll use it to buy a dog to come along as your companion, helping to keep you safe from robbers and dangerous animals - just don't forget to feed it.\n\nThe hunting in this game is challenging and fun. Most animals are faster than you, but you have more endurance and you can sneak. Hounding an elk and running it down until it tires out is possible if your character's speed and endurance are decent, as long as you can track it well enough through the woods as it flees to keep on it. Especially if you manage to put an arrow or javelin in it when you first spot it, as a wounded animal runs slower. If you don't have luck actively hunting, you can set traps. From small loop snares all the way up to large lever traps and spiked trap pits, you can set a trap for whatever animal you're trying to hunt. Don't forget to bait them with meat if you're after carnivores.\n\nIf hunting isn't your style, you can fish. Fishing rods, clubs, or spears round out the active fishing options. Or get yourself a punt or raft and some nets for passive fishing.\n\nOr be a farmer and supplement your diet with a variety of grown crops - peas, turnips, rye, beans, hemp, and more.\n\nOr you could go straight up vegetarian, eating berries and bread and porridge and farmed vegetables. Just don't expect a vegetarian life to be easy in Iron Age Finland - meat and fish are the best sources of protein around. A balanced diet is easier to manage.\n\nThe animal AI in the game makes for some fun scenarios. Here is an example of a hunt I had recently:\n\nI saw an Elk in the distance from the mountain near where I was building my homestead, and decide it's time to stock up on meat before the weather gets too hot for drying (started in Spring, still early enough).\n\nI go hunting for it, and put an arrow in it when I find it - giving it a bleeding wound in the thorax. It runs and I begin the chase, relying on my good tracking skill and endurance to make up for its speed advantage. Soon I notice new tracks intermingled with the Elk. Bear tracks! I continue following the Elk, and the Bear tracks are right there with it all the way.\n\nAfter a while of tracking I finally find my prey, still carrying my arrow... on the ground partially eaten! Bear tracks lead away to the west.

UnReal World has been around and in active development a long time. The very first version was in 1992, which was vastly different from the game we have now. I personally have owned it for 10 years now, and in that time it has just kept getting better and better. I can't even begin to guess how many thousands of hours I've played this game over the years. I come back after every major update to find fresh new features to explore, with the basic meat of the game just as fun as I have always found it.\n\nIt's an amazing iron age survival simulation, the best I have played.\n\nYou create a character, choosing a tribe - each with their own genetics (affects attributes, height, build), knowledge (skills, auto-identification of certain plants, which rituals you might start with), and starting gear. Then you can select from a variety of starts to get things rolling - like being an escaping slave (good luck getting away from the camp full of your former masters) or an unfortunate hunting trip (will you kill the animal that killed your father, or flee?). You also pick which season to start in - each with their own challenges. From there you can either do the basic missions, which are there to get you acquainted with the game and give you attainable early goals; do the advanced missions, which are a bit more difficult and require more time; or just strike off and do your own thing.\n\nLike any good survival game, you need to provide the basics for your character. You'll need a steady source of food - from hunting, fishing, trapping, foraging, farming, or trading. Just make sure you don't misidentify that mushroom and eat a poisoned one, and don't fall in your own trap pit - especially if you filled it with spikes.\n\nYou will also need shelter. Options here are a very basic lean to made from spruce branches, a kota (Finnish tent) made from hides that you can pack up and move with you, or a permanent log cabin. Having a smoke house with a fireplace comes in handy for smoking meat, which is one of the easiest ways to preserve your meat. Cellars are also handy to keep your food fresher longer. Need some help building your cabin? Hire a woodsman to cut some trees down for you, some good food may be all he wants.\n\nAnd warm clothes are a must for when the temperature drops, so don't forget to skin that stag and tan its fur for a nice warm set of clothes. Or just for trading, a good fur is valuable. Maybe you'll use it to buy a dog to come along as your companion, helping to keep you safe from robbers and dangerous animals - just don't forget to feed it.\n\nThe hunting in this game is challenging and fun. Most animals are faster than you, but you have more endurance and you can sneak. Hounding an elk and running it down until it tires out is possible if your character's speed and endurance are decent, as long as you can track it well enough through the woods as it flees to keep on it. Especially if you manage to put an arrow or javelin in it when you first spot it, as a wounded animal runs slower. If you don't have luck actively hunting, you can set traps. From small loop snares all the way up to large lever traps and spiked trap pits, you can set a trap for whatever animal you're trying to hunt. Don't forget to bait them with meat if you're after carnivores.\n\nIf hunting isn't your style, you can fish. Fishing rods, clubs, or spears round out the active fishing options. Or get yourself a punt or raft and some nets for passive fishing.\n\nOr be a farmer and supplement your diet with a variety of grown crops - peas, turnips, rye, beans, hemp, and more.\n\nOr you could go straight up vegetarian, eating berries and bread and porridge and farmed vegetables. Just don't expect a vegetarian life to be easy in Iron Age Finland - meat and fish are the best sources of protein around. A balanced diet is easier to manage.\n\nThe animal AI in the game makes for some fun scenarios. Here is an example of a hunt I had recently:\n\nI saw an Elk in the distance from the mountain near where I was building my homestead, and decide it's time to stock up on meat before the weather gets too hot for drying (started in Spring, still early enough).\n\nI go hunting for it, and put an arrow in it when I find it - giving it a bleeding wound in the thorax. It runs and I begin the chase, relying on my good tracking skill and endurance to make up for its speed advantage. Soon I notice new tracks intermingled with the Elk. Bear tracks! I continue following the Elk, and the Bear tracks are right there with it all the way.\n\nAfter a while of tracking I finally find my prey, still carrying my arrow... on the ground partially eaten! Bear tracks lead away to the west. As I already have plenty of meat right in front of me, I left my fellow hunter to his own devices and skinned and butchered the gift he left for me instead of going off after him.\n\nIt's little details like this that make this game amazing.","March 9","true","42.9"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","10","10","2","0"

I saw this gem there and read the discription about how it was an Iron Age Simulation of Finnland. I thought to myself, "Okay I love survival simulation games, and it seems to be rougelike which I also enjoy, and the reviews say it's pretty hard and complex, let's give it a go!"\n\nFirst, the controls take some getting used to.  Also if graphics are a deal breaker for you then don't bother. I however find the elegant simplicity of the game charming and it allows for the imagination to really immerse yourself in the world the developers are trying to create.\n\nThe developers are both amazingly awesome individuals and I highly recommend checking out their webiste and blog.\n\nI'll share with you my first experience of this game.\n\n~~~\n\nAfter making some javelines, getting a basecamps set up and being largely unsuccesful at gaining much food I found myself slowly starving to death with very poor nutrition. I had tried climbing up nearby trees to see if I could spot game anywhere near my vicenity with largly no luck, and then I slipped on one of the branches and banged my head.  It wasn't life threatening but it shook me up enough to not try climbing again, as wounds take a fairly realistic number of in game days to heal.\n\nSuddenly while walking back to my camp as the sun was setting, I spy a caraboo herd.  Not only that it looks like they were looking for a place to bed down for the night!\n\nPerfect!  I can just follow them, and then sneak in close and try to kill one of the caraboo before I die myself!\n\nAs they lay sleeping I edged closer, javilen in hand with a tip hardened by the fire I created with the local spruce trees. My target in sight I steady my javilin.\n\nThrow and a hit!  The whole herd wakes up!  It's chaos!  The caraboo I hit was only injured in it's hind leg but it was bleeding so by following the blood and it's tracks it was fairly easy to keep up! It looks like I was saved!\n\nHours pass and it's now night.  The caraboo stopped bleeding and I can only hope that the tracks that I'm currently following belong to the caraboo that I did indeed injure.\n\nOne full day passes and into the night again.  I make a stop by a stream for water and try to hit a nearby squirrel with my javilen in a tree.  I miss and it taunts me, jeering and chittering at me as my head throbs and my stomach grows ever more empty while I retreive my javilen from its resting place in a tree trunk.\n\nI continue following the trail one more full day.  My health is low and I can barely keep the tracks focused.  Suddenly I hear a grunt of a caraboo.\n\nThis is it!  I'll finally get that animal! I start to sneak.  I creep closer, and closer, I see the animal and it's injured.  It's the same one!  The gods smile on me!\n\nOne, step. Two step, three step.  TWIGSNAP!\n\nThe caraboo's head jerks up! I hold my breath hoping it doesn't see me.\n\nTwo heartbeats pass and the caraboo bolts!  I must have been upwind!\n\nMy heart sinks.\n\nMy javilen loose in my hand as I stare at the ground where I"m likely to die.  This place isn't so bad.  It's got a nice breeze, fir trees, a stream...\n\nWait a minute... it's got a stream!\n\nI take off running in the direction the caraboo bolted!\n\nSqeezing past ancient firs and by long forgotten boulders I run!  My last ounces of strength leaving me with each step!\n\nI'm able to catch up with the caraboo as it's calmed down and then run at it full speed with the wind at my back!\n\nI may not be faster than this animal.  But I'm smarter.  I am a human.  I'm one of the people.\n\nExpectedly the caraboo bolts!  It's more tired than me and injured worse.\n\nMy plan is working.  It's headed straight for the stream!\n\nOnce it gets to the banks of the water it dives in trying to evade it's persuer.  I walk up to the bank as the fatigued animal vainly tries to splash around in the water using the last of it's energy.  I then take my aim gripping my javilen with all my might and throw aiming for the neck of the magestic beast!\n\nA hit! Hot blood pours into the water around the caraboo.  It staggers back onto shore, falters, and falls.  It's breathing labored I stand over it.\n\nThis animal who is no different than me, whom I have tracked for three days lies at my feet.  The same place I would be had I not caught it.  There is no good or evil here.\n\nThere is just life.\n\nLater after a fire is made, roasted caraboo in my belly, and a hide tanning on a nearby fallen log.  I pack the remaining several dozen pounds of roasted meat into my pack.  There was a village not a few days from here that would be willing to trade some useful supplies for this meat.  There my journey will continue.  For I am one of the people.\n","March 8","true","1.5"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"

For now this is my 2nd livestream and exprerience with this game:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWYcKY7PVG8\n\nWow!  if you are looking for a deep, engaging, procedural survival game that will offer you a complete sandbox and tons of game choices, options, and endless possible games (no two games will be the same, guaranteed)... then LOOK NO FURTHER.\n\nThis game is vast.  This game is mind-boggling at all of its choices, options, and different scenarios.\n\nTruly amazing.\n\nThis score might change as I play the game more, and ain't such a darn 'noob' at all its vast possibilties...  But after 2 hours... I think I can give this game a pretty accurate first impressions score based on my own scoring system...\n\nVALUE:  40 out of 40  -  Yes you can play it for free on the games website, but why not get the best and most up-to-date version of this game, and help support the developer who has made this masterfully done game and been working on it since 1992!  Value is through the roof even at the regular price of $10.99 USD.  No brainer, max value here people.\n\nFUN:  26 out of 30  -  This part of the game is the part that will likely vary the most and be more subjective depending on who you are and what kind of games personally enjoy.  But to me, this game offers a very rich and deep game, the kind of game that can only be accessed by using the power of your imagination to truly immerse you in its world.\n\nCONTROLS & BUGS: 20 out of 20 - The controls are many in this game, and the UI (user interface) takes a bit of learning, but there is plenty of in-game help and features to help you learn.  Beautifully done with more options that you can throw a stick at!\n\nGRAPHICS & SOUND: 6 out of 10 - This is going to be the lowest score for this game and again, it's a bit subjective.  I'm giving this game a "6" based on the TYPE of game it is, and thinking its very clear what is a rock, what is water, what is a tree, etc.  Other people may give this game a 1 or a 2 score here out of 10, but again, this is a different type of game and in my opinion needs to be scored as the type of game it is, so it gets a 6 out of 10 from me.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nMY TOTAL LAUNCH DAY ON STEAM\nFIRST IMPRESSIONS (2 HOURS) SCORE:  92%\n\nEasily a MUST BUY for any person who likes good RPG games like this and isn't concerned about not having 3D next gen graphics to enjoy it!

The update cycle is a bit long compared to the industry, but they never give up, they never declare "It's done" and move on to something else. Expect a major update that adds something big about once a year, minor updates a little more often, and a burst of hotfixes at every major interval to squash bugs.\n\nLast, and most importantly, the simulation is realistic. It isn't watered down with artificial difficulty like swarms of monsters at night or gamey magic potions that fix all your boo-boos.\n\nSo what is Unreal World?\nUnreal world is roguelike survival simulation in a procedural world inspired by iron age Finland. Your primary goal in the game is to survive as long as you can. Sort of imagine if Don't Starve had a love child with Robinson's Requiem.\n\nIt uses a skill based system, with improvement by use. Equipment is varied by both type and quality. Armor and clothing is by location with overlap across more than a dozen body locations. The seasons are fully realized with weather, effects on plants and wildlife and hazards such as heat exhaustion or frostbite. The health system is detailed; tracking individual injuries, pain and infection all with realistic treatment options. Wounds take time to heal and affect your fuctioning.\n\nIt includes multiple survival strategies to utilize, each modeled to reflect the actual nature of that activity. Hunting, for instance, involves lots of tracking followed by frantic quick shots and pursuit of prey. It's easy to lose your quarry but a successful kill will keep you fed for a long while. Trapping involves a lot of work up front but gives sporadic gains. Farming is a nearly guaranteed result assuming you can live until harvest.\n\nYou can hunt, fish, farm, trap, raid or trade with villages, raft down rivers or across lakes, capture or buy and then raise animals, build shelters and cabins, fence in areas, gather seasonal plants mushrooms and medicinal herbs, fight with a variety of weapons, craft or trade for and wear a variety of tools clothing and armor.\n\nThe game is mod friendly. I had the good fortune to be one of the first modders (I added ironworking and clothmaking). Want to change your starting skills? You can mod it. You can alter the item recipes or even add ones the developer didn't include. Heck, you can even add in new plants and mushrooms!\n\nIf you like roguelikes or survival games, this is a 'must try'.","February 27","true","182.3"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

I tried farming once, but in early summer an elk ravaged my fields and ate everything. The spirits seem to prefer me living a hunters life instead.\n\nThe AI is especially remarkable with realistic animal behaviour. They roam through the land, depending on the season, the terrain, spirits' favour and chance. The world is much more complex and dynamic than in other survival games such as the Long Dark.\nThere are loads and loads of plants. Dont know a mushroom because your herblore skill is too low? better dont eat it, you might get sick and die. Thank the spirits, there are also plants that help your body in a variaty of ways, some ease fever and help you getting rid of toxins. Or ease that flu you got after sleeping in the rain. Better know some. winter time? no plants for you then, except maybe some cloudberries that ripen extremely late in the year.\n\ncoolest crafting system i know. Want to smoke your meat because you cant eat the whole elk before it spoils? Well, you need a smoking hut. fell some trees, big ones. Make logs from the trunks, build walls. split some trunks into boards, make a door. get smaller trees and boards for the roof. a window, if you are fancy. For each step you need an axe. while it is possible to fell trees with a flimsy stone-axe, you better have some nice big axe (different axes are ideal for different work) or this will take a while...\ncollect a whole bunch of stones to build a stove. get firewood and smoke it up. dont forget some tying equipment to hang the meat from the roof (craftable from clothes or hides). And then the meat will taste terrible because your cooking skill is too low =)\n\nA Bear mauled you? well this game has the most complex system of injuries i have ever seen in a game. if he just broke some ribs, lucky you. Maybe your legs are total waste and you cant stand up. good luck hunting now, you better have some emergency food stache to last you until everything is healed. Got a nice warm bear fur coat? good for you, but without gloves you'll get frostbite on your hands in winter. Better make a fire and warm yourself up regularly. You met a raider with a cuirass and your weapon is rather flimsy? aim for the legs and run! more than a dozen different zones of your body can get injured with different effects an armor parts realistically cover different parts. Different materials protect differently against point (e.g. spear, arrows), blade(sword), impact (club, reindeer hooves) damage and cold. bleeding is seperately discounted for. better have a bandage or you will bleed out, good if you know the blood staunching prayer.\n\nawesome game and great support, too! for example there used to be a rare issue with the game not starting up on ubuntu. posted on the forum, the developer replied quickly and fixed it. The fix is coming in the next update and in the meantime he even provided beta access to the fix.\n\nThe community has a forum, a wiki and lots of friendly, helpful people you can ask if you like spearfishing but keep starving or if you are wondering where to find herbs to help dresssing wounds.

There is a free version the creators website, but it is an older version. The latest version on steam has a revamped graphics and new features. The new graphical upgrade does look better. You can zoom out and see much further or zoom in close to your character. This game may not have eye candy graphics but its gameplay pulls you in. Its a survivalist game where the details can kill you. You have to think about what you are going to do next, based on your characters condition and the environment, how much food you have, fatigue and sleep etc. Merely eating any food wont in the long run do you any good if you stick to fish for example because your nutrition will suffer, which means you get fatigued faster. You can trap, track and hunt game. But its not easy, often they get away, but some game are easier to catch than others like squirrels for example. One time i was nearly straving and came back to my camp before it got dark and discovered one of my small deadfall traps had my dinner. There are aspects of the game i havent delved into yet, such as owning a dog which can help out with hunting. The game is turn based, but you can still get into trouble with burning your food if you go off and do a long consuming task or sleep, or you can have your food spoil if you do not eat it in a reasonable time or preserve it. There are NPC in the game whom you can trade with to get better quality gear which makes doing tasks much faster eg. chopping down trees with an iron axe instead of a stone axe. There is many skills you can invest into and level up. Some other features in the pipeline sound interesting, such as being able to marry and have offsrping which when your character dies you can resume as one of your offspring.

Add in the fact that the devs treat this game like a dev should, that is to say with absolute love and care, and you've got something that's one of a kind.\n\nIt will take a lot of effort to get use to the control scheme, but most really good games from a pure gameplay stand point are that way.\n\nI can not recommend this game enough.  What's more, if you can't afford to play it on steam, feel free to check out the dev's site and get the entire game for free.  Then, once you've realized how amazing this game is, throw them some money for their effort (or come back and buy it here so you don't have to bother with updating your game yourself.)\n","March 3","true","89.9"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

I live in a country town surrounded by Australian bushland and so my imagination was sparked very early on. To cut a long story short after getting a small taste of survival gaming with minecraft and watching probably too much Bear Grylls to be healthy I started looking formore hardcore experiences that would get me closer to living my dream.  So one fateful day I stumble upon this masterpeice of a game.\n\nI fell in love with the hardships I faced and the small victories I could claw from the grasp of mother nature. But I admit I got frustrated when I got so far and lost it all due to a silly mistake, then I learned the incredible art of BACKUP SAVES!

I've been playing it now for around 6 years outside of Steam and it's one of those games you keep coming back to.  It's got a tremendous amount of complexity, which can be very daunting for new players.  Once you make it past the substantial learning curve, you'll find a deeply rewarding survival simulator with a unique setting: medieval Finland.\n\nI would term this game a "rogue-like life simulator" if anything.  With the majority of the ongoing game development being focused on adding real-life depth, this means the graphical end of things is more along the lines of the traditional rogue-like games, being more minimalistic.  That also means there's a staggering amount of things you can do in the game.  First timers will more than likely be completely overwhelmed by the different abilities and skills available.  You may want to watch a video or two of someone playing the game to get an idea of things you can do and how to survive in general as you are likely to die rather quickly in the beginning of the most basic of things, like not finding water.\n\nThis game won't be for everyone.  The high amount of focus on real-life features means you'll be spending a lot of time doing basic survival things like gathering just enough food and water to live off of at the moment.  You also need to be concerned about the variety of your diet the same as in real life.  There's no true in game goal other than to survive as long as possible.  Again, these are things you should be able to tell pretty quickly if they're for you or not by finding a couple of videos of the game being played.\n\nIf you're into survival games and living off the land in the wilderness sounds like fun to you, this is the game to get.","February 26","true","0.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

The learning curve is a bit steep, simply because of the massive amount of things to do, including fishing, farming, hunting/trapping, and building.  Character creation involved choosing your name, gender, cultures, and bonuses for several skills.  In addition, you can choose your starting scenario, ensuring that even starting over doesn't get boring.\n\nI can't recommend it for everyone, because of the large learning curve and non-standard controls (I made sure the last laptop I bought had a number pad specifically for this game). The mouse is rarely, if ever, used; instead, nearly every action has a hotkey or two.

Played the free version on and off in the past before buying it on Steam to show my modest support and appreciation for the Devs.\n\nBeing developed and consistently updated for over 20 years, Unreal World is set in a world resembling ancient Finland in the Iron Age. The gameplay has a ton of freedom and depth, and the setting is rich in its historical atmosphere and lore.\n\nThere are many ways to play, you could be a farmer, hunter, a gatherer, a fisherman, a adventurer or trader as you find your path in this harsh, gritty world. There are no set rules, you decide where to go and what to do. Despite the simple graphics the gameplay is very realistic. It takes creativity and experience to accomplish some of the harder tasks like hunting. You really feel like you're part of the world as you make your way through the four seasons every year.\n\nThe game has its roots as a ASCII-based roguelike. If you've never played one of those before it might seem daunting to learn the controls, since for these games there're a lot of commands, akin to playing a flight simulator on the keyboard. It honestly isn't too hard to learn, and the in-game help browser and beginner game course is actually very helpful.

You create a character from scratch with tons of skills at your disposal. The player is given a lot of freedom and tools which grants a lot of variety. You can play vastly different and try various survival tactics in order to overcome nature and it's threats. Be a fisherman, farmer, hunter, gatherer or a bandit. You're given the choice.\n\nThe world itself is vast and filled with tons of items, creatures, immersion, lore and danger. It's very intricate and engaging with a great amount of detail. Every task that action that you perform has consequences and keeping your characters alive is really a challenge, furthermore the entire game is designed in a realistic way which only enhances the immersion. From fishing to hideworking or combat, everything is rough and has detail. It's a engrossing and hostile world.\n\nA great aspect is the interactive story, despite not having a full blown campaign. You can chose from a variety of character backgrounds which vastly changes the start of your adventure. Start as a well equipped hunter or fisherman but if you're up for the challenge you can play as a runaway slave that is being hunted. You make your own story and it's done with such detail that you feel really immersed. Even though the minimalistic graphics aren't that advanced, the presentation is solid. The small amount of songs and sound effect will still grab your attention, as for the rest the text provides enough flavor to really make you feel like this lonesome adventurer. This is pretty much standard for most roguelike though but this theme really resonates with me compared to other dungeon crawlers.\n\nThe interface and controls are somewhat unintuitive but once you get used to it, it's really not that much of a deal. It might be a hassle at first to browse through the various menus but it's all set up in a reasonable fashion. That might be the biggest issue about this game, also there aren't many sound effects but it's still solid enough.\n\nOverall this is a very lovely game and crafted with such dedication, if this type of game doesn't appeal to you. You will probably get frustrated and not really enjoy it. But if you do, you will be rewarded with a great survival game that actually makes you think about provide a good challenge, while having a strong theme with a realistic tone.\n\nDefinitely worth the price.

I *think* that makes it the game with the longest development time - at least more so than either Dwarf Frotress or the Duke Nukem. 24 years of work, as of the time of this review in 2016.\n\nSo what can you do in this game? Good question. You might recall how Todd Howard likes to say of Bethesda's releases that you can 'climb any mountain' or 'do anything' - well, you couldn't. In UrW you can come a whole lot closer to doing anything, though!\n\nEvery aspect of life (bar taking a ♥♥♥♥ and ♥♥♥♥ing someone, which is probably for the best) is covered. A massive amount of attention to detail has been made, and there are absolutely shedloads of historically accurate items, foods and activites you can access. What's more, the game (despite being a roguelike and keyboard-based, which may initially pout a lot of people off) is very accessible due to its fantastic in-game wiki.\n\nWhat I've always loved in particular is that you set your own goals, something that no other RPG I've ever seen has done so well:\n\n* Want to hunt a bear? Sure, get tracking! But first you need to make sure you're well prepared. Should you take the spear, the bow or both? Is it worth buying a hunting dog to help you out? Maybe you'll need a companion from a local village to cover your back? How much food will you need for the journey? There are so many things to consider.\n\n* Exploration is crazy in this game! I mean, the gameworld is literally Finland. The very size. It's enormous.\n\n* Perhaps it's time to settle down; building a settlement in UrW is incredibly rewarding, but by no means easy work! I've never found anything as satisfying in a game as having completed a gleaming wooden longhall, complete with mead benches and a roaring hearth. It took me several in-game months to achieve and arrived just in time for winter. Winter is brutal in this game!\n\n* If you somehow feel your options aren't already wide enough, the game is incredibly easy to mod! Making and adding mods are both simple processes and widely expand the gameplay; what's more, since modding for the most aprt relies on adding .txt and .png files, there's practically a 0% chance that you could damage your game with mods (unlike certain other franchises), so go crazy!\n\nA final note is that the UrW forums having been running for years and in that time the developers Sami and Erkka have been amazing; they have listened to every player suggestion, answered every question they could and are highly aware of what can make the game better. There never has been, and never will be, a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ update. It's been getting better for 24 continuous years, and can only improve in the future! Make sure to visit the game's website and check the future development goals.\n\nThanks for reading this far!","February 27","true","0.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I can't write a review without playing the game? That makes a lot of sense actually.\n\nAs I write this, the game is installing. Yes, thats a very short playtime for a game before writing a review. Is it though? I've been playing this game off and on since 2006. I was excited when I heard it was coming to steam. Back in the day, they had different sort of payment plans where you could buy a liscense for the game. I bought 3 of them. They got rid of that system though, thats fine. they needed the cash. UnReal World wasn't always the best financed game at the time after all.\n\nIn short, this game is the base, the very core of what I am now. I would not be playing the games I play if it were not for UnReal World. I would not know the people I know or be the person I am without UnReal World. It is a turning point in my character. This game shaped my hobbies and the way I look at games.\n\nAs a side note, when I first played this game back in 2006, I got so hype over surviving in the wilderness that I went out into my back yard and built a leanto, made a stone axe, and cut several small trees down with it. Of course, you shouldn't do that, but I was just so damn excited about the whole thing.","February 27","true","37.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Back then it was unique, an ironman survival game where you could build and alter the terrain, with hunger, disease and fatigue, and crafting to combat all these challenges.  Now I return to it and find that it is still a pleasure to play, both calming and gentle and pleasingly challenging: don't walk on the ice in the springtime, be aware that malnutrition is a dangerous spiral, even minor injuries can lead to much bigger problems if untreated.\n\nI would recommend for fans of Rimworld, classic roguelikes (e.g ADOM), Minecraft survival maps, and anyone with even a passing curiosity or interest in Finnish culture.\n\n10/10, would die in my sleep next to a half-finished hut again.","March 30","true","9.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Then this probably isn't the game for you. I'm going to be going through a couple of the points why I think someone wouldn't like this game, and then get to why I love it.\n\nWhen they say open-ended, they mean it. You are literally dropped in the middle of the forest, with only the tools given to you. From here, you create your own story. Several background scenarios do add background, create added and varied challenges, and guide in the gameplay but at the end of the day, It's all up to you.\n\nThis is a game that has been in development for much of my life, and it shows. Check out the pictures of the game, the trailer, and the free version. If what you see UI and graphics wise is not your cup of tea, then you know what you are getting into.\n\nDespite what I've mentioned above, this game is absolutely amazing once you do get into it. The multitude of positive reviews should hint to that fact. The mechanics and depth of gameplay implemented is quite amazing, the theme is very powerful and well developed, and the game simply has a way of making me long for getting back to nature.\n\nMost importantly, it's the only game that I've been playing on and off for the past decade (well over, actually). It's a game I've been surprised by every time I play, finding new ways to survive and thrive (and, admittedly, die). It's a game I know I'll be checking out for the next decade as well.\n\nGive it a couple of lives, read a survival guide, and then decide if it's a game for you.

Then sitting here bored one day I decided to try it again.\n\nThe first real attempt I made was also pretty pitiful. I learned a few things. I think maybe I starved to death or just plain quit. Tried out different skills and races. Read the wiki. I've been playing it for almost a week straight now. Ive had some epic fails and learned how just about everything works. I'm still trying to survive my first winter. I've managed to survive summer through fall, when the cold comes though I have yet to be fully prepared to deal with it.\n\nThe only thin I can say bad about it so far is the keyboard. I hate having to use the keyboard. You can click on most of the menus but to get into the menus requires hitting a hotkey. I just wish it had a better clickable UI.

The base of these stats are dependent on your characters chosen tribe and their physical scores, randomly generated as you create your character. Your skills are then improved as you practice using them.\n\nThe game was first released in 1992, and it shows, in some ways. The UI can definitely be improved in some areas, among other things, but the devs are constantly improving the game and it is possible these issues are fixed later on. As an example of the overall attention to detail from the developer, The latest update (the first version released on Steam) added improved winter mechanics, making snow and ice thicker and thinner as winter comes and goes and adding the possibility of breaking the ice, adding another highly plausible way of dying during winter. Something else that has been in the game for some time is one of (if not THE most) advanced animal AI that isn't just randomly walking around, like other games.\n\nIn summary, it's a highly competent survival game, and the Steam version is currently just a way to pay the devs for the amazing amount of work they have done. If you feel like playing the game, go to their website and try the free non-Steam version first before buying it here.","February 29","true","2.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I play it for ~9 years now and hell, I haven't scratched the surface of true surviving yet. Once you got through the steep learning curve you certainly get to enjoy a masterpiece that easily makes you realize the dedication of the creator(s)! Being a hunter, farmer, fisherman or gatherer or whatever you want you are pretty much completely free to do whatever you want and you'll certainly die trying! Climb a tree and break your legs or mug a wanderer and loot his inventory to make it through the winter... There is a very granular level of detail in regards to the skills to apply and ways to play the game and you will most likely have to forget all those gather-wood-to-build-a-workbench-then-place-a-furnace-games' concepts as here you have to think about your next steps very carefully so you don't freeze to death, drown in a pond, starve or poison yourself or become prey...there is no comparison to that feeling when you finally manage to find and kill that big game you pursued for days after you hit it with your spear, following trails of its blood while hoping it will fall into one of your tediously setup traps! Build a tent or a house and settle down at the riverside or try to befriend a nearby village and trade with the people...not just some specific NPC, no, anyone. The sheer amount of possibilities in this game will make you question all those "realistic" RPGs and survival games out there for sure. Take your time to read into the manual, though!!\n\nIf you're willing to dive into this game you probably aren't the "but the graphics" type of person. Buckle up as every single key on your keyboard will be used and you will read a lot!\n\nDo I recommend this game? Oh yes, I keep a copy* around to gift it for you just to make sure you experience that magic yourself.\n\n(* might be gone once you read this, ha)","February 26","true","8.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I further did research online, and though the developer doesn't have a FB or Twitter account I was able to pull up very high reviews of this game and fans hashtags on twitter. I own and play games like Radiation Island, SurvivalCraft (over Minecraft), KoDP and few other survival/RPG type games, so I had to check this out.\n\nTo cut right to the chase this URW is awesome!\n\nFor this game to be 20 something y/o and still going strong with devouted fans and newbies (like myself) is amazing! After purchase, I actually didn't start playing till maybe 5 days later for I was reading up on the URW wiki on my tablet due to work and being on the go. But when downtime came I loaded it up and must say at first the whole key command took a little getting use to but afterwhile I slowly got the hang of it. Whenever I was in doubt, I would always refer to wiki via my tablet to free up space on my monitor, or hit (SHIFT + ?) for the layout of the key commands. I'm playing on a Mac so I think the key layout might be a just a little different from PC, but no big deal.  Still have a ways to go by getting full grasp of this game, but overall I love it and have no regrets spending $ for I didn't know the game was free till after purchase. Plus I love to support game developers who create games and take there work seriously.\n\nIn closing I just want to say when URW came out as well as other favorite gems (KoDP, Avernum/Avadon), computers weren't affordable as they are now so I missed out. But now with companies submitting games to Steam as well as porting games to Tablets, it's a privellage to get a chance to play those games that I may have missed out on.\n\nWould love to see URW on iPad one day if possible.","March 6","true","14.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The historical and all in all very realistic setting is enchanting. The game is open ended, but there are various challenges and game modes you can try out. URW teaches you the basics of survival, weatherlore, trapping, crafting and so on, but it does not hold your hand. There are plenty of things you need to explore and figure out yourself. There is a learning curve, but as you get familiar with the game, you easily get carried away with all the possibilities.

There are a myriad of keyboard commands you need to remember by heart. Using a mouse as input is not an option, everything is done strictly by keyboard. I'm the kind of gamer who likes to sit back and relax in my chair while clicking on my mouse, rather than hunch over the keyboard in an upright position, so I wasn't pleased in the beginning. The dozens of keyboard commands are difficult to remember and will force you to consult the "help" page every so often.\n\nHowever, if you can tolerate this, Unreal World becomes a beautiful sandbox game. You can do whatever you want, whether it be to become a farmer, hunter, lumberjack, fisherman, bandit, serial killer etc. The main "goal" is to survive winter, which is harsh and deadly, so most of your time will be devoted to hunting and gathering food, and building a suitable shelter for the cold season. How you approach this is up to you.\n\nMy main complaint (besides the unfriendly UI) is that the game world can feel lonely at times. At present, you're not able to marry anyone or have kids. You do have the option of hiring adventurers and workers, but they will only stay with you for a short time and then leave. You can't move into a village or improve it. The game makes you feel like you're an outcast with no friends or something. You can almost call it a hermit simulator.\n\nOverall, though, I find the game enjoyable. If you're into survival or roguelikes, UW is a very good choice.","March 11","true","47.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","3"

Create a character and determine your path to thriving (or dying) in dark ages Finland. Become a settled trapper, an itinerant fisher, a barbaric warmonger, a hunter, a farmer, a trader... many potential paths lie before you, and you may well find yourself taking all of them over the course of a character's life.\n\nForemost, UrW is both brutal and beautiful, crafting a deep narrative through your struggle to survive in a harsh world, where the environment itself can be as deadly as those that dwell in it. I could tell you a hundred stories from my times playing, of cunning victories, cozy campfires, and unexpected demises, but you'd be far better served spending that time creating your own.\n\nIn Brief:\n\nGenerate a unique world and roll a character to embark in it. You may also select a starting scenario (take the runaway slave in winter for hardcore mode or one of the training tutorials for a little early boost). From there, you must seek out a source of food, drink, and shelter. How you do so is truly in your hands. Craft items to aid in your endeavor. Collect berries and cook wonderful meals. Tire of lovely vegetarian fare. Set a fence trap and slaughter some wild beasts. Trade hides with foreign merchants for some coveted metal arms. Capture and tame a wild bear, then hire some fellow adventurers and raid a Njeperz camp. Cut their clothes into bandages and roast their bodies over open flames. And most important, establish a base camp to survive the coming cold, for WINTER _IS_ COMING.\n\nIf you die, it is permanent, which makes every encounter tense and rewarding. I really can't say enough how amazing this game is.\n\nFinally, the developer Sami Maaranen is incredible in his dedication to his game and its playerbase. He is always responsive and friendly, and has been continually working on improving the UrW experience for over two decades. If there's anyone in the indie industry that deserves your money, it's him. I first bought UrW after saving for weeks at my minimum wage job in high school over a decade ago. What I got was worth ten times that.\n\nBUY THIS GAME! DON'T WAIT! And then play it, and share your stories wide and far.","February 28","true","65.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I've been playing this game like crazy for the past few days though. I saw the game in my discovery queue and thought it looked interesting. I'm a bit of a cheapskate though and I've been burned by so many games in the past that I didn't want to jump right on it. As I'm reading through the comments, I see mention that you can download and play the game from the developer's website. So I gave it a shot. At first I was a bit overwhelmed but after looking over a couple guides, I started figuring it out a bit.\n\nSo I've been playing a bunch for the last couple days and I'm really loving the game. At this point, I decided that I was going to buy this game and support the developer. This isn't some big company. It's a small indie thing and this guy has a huge set of cojones making his game available for free while also selling it on Stream. That shows confidence in your work. It IS that good. It's worth buying even though I could play it for free. I've already talked it up to a couple friends and they're going to try it out as well. Get the word of mouth going on this one.\n\nSo actually talking about the game itself. The graphics aren't anything to speak of but they don't need to be. This isn't a splashing graphical game for the Xbox crowd. This is an old school game but it's got depth that the old school games couldn't pull off. You start the world as a Nordic person back in the Iron Age. In most of the scenarios (there are many you can choose from) you start off alone. Usually you've got some basic supplies and a day or two worth of food. From here you've got to find food, build shelter, and stay alive! I've been starting in the summer. My goal has been to build a cabin before the winter hits. That's not an easy task. It's not like other survival games where it's simplified. Building takes lots of time and effort. Fishing, hunting, and trapping are difficult! It's easy to get lost in this game for hours.\n\nHighly reccommended!","March 2","true","295.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

UnReal World... Where do I start? I started playing  it back in december of 2014 and since then, I am hooked! the graffics may not be the best (the new ones look great, dont get me wrong) but who needs graphics when you have such an emersive, rich game that can take you to places you always wished you could go! For me, what got me into this game at first was curiosity, but I had a feeling I would like it, and oh boy do I! You start off with a multitude of scenarios, wich can greatly challenge you or make life easier for your character. And if you're into challenges, make up your own! with a multitude of skills to learn and master. But skills in UnReal World aren't like skyrim or Unturned, its a pore realistic approach where the more you practice, the better you get IE, you want to raise your cooking skill, cook stuff! But what you can cook doesnt depend on your cooking skill, the taste depends on your skill. For crafting skills, there's obviously no taste, quality is the factor. All and all, the game itself is HUGE, not in size itself, but in its potential for your mind to create more of the game. right now, I've started a new character for the steam release, but before that, I played with a character for a WHOLE 9 MONTHS... IRL. and I didn't get bored once. I have to admit I got my fair share of near death experiences, which is scary since the game is PERMADEATH. Oh and by the way, if you haven't already deducted, I LOVE this game and I would like to say thanks to SAMI MAARANEN.","February 28","true","62.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The in-game encyclopedia alone can cost you quite some time just reading articles... The game itself is turn-based and requires some learning as well as a bit of planning ahead.

If you can live with the graphics you get one of the deepest, most realistic sandbox survival games in return. Don't be put off by the appearance though, the game is surprisingly approachable if you pick the "Surviving in the wild" scenario. The game will teach you the necessary basics as you go along, and the rest can be found in the built-in help. Everything else is up to you though, there's no handholding or NPCs with exclamation marks over their heads telling you what you need to do.","February 27","true","28.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Just like the life! and i continued playing and playing, and now, after 6 months that i play this game, it came out on steam, with tons of new stuff, etc.\nIf you want a trully survival experience, UrW is for you, its not a simple game, its another way of life.","February 27","true","20.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
