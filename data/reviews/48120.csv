"http://steamcommunity.com/id/evanbgood/recommended/48120/","evanbgood","SketchyGalore","http://steamcommunity.com/id/evanbgood/","843 products in account","In my opinion, this was one of the first and greatest victims of the DRM wave of the past few years. While other games like Assassin's Creed had people up in arms about "Always On" DRM systems, they were still popular enough to be successful. Settlers 7, on the other hand, never stood a chance. As a strategy/city building game with a lot of unusual mechanics and a bit of a learning curve, this game was never going to appeal to everyone. But, thanks to a giant dose of Ubisoft bad PR, the target audience avoided it like the plague. And that's a MASSIVE shame, because it's great!\n\nSettlers falls into that odd "almost a sim game" category of strategy, with a slower pace and less of a direct combat focus than your average RTS game (such as Starcraft). Personally, I love this genre, but good examples of it are unfortunately rare. In the past, series like Dungeon Keeper, Stronghold, Startopia, and earlier versions of Settlers itself had a good cult following, but these days they're a bit harder to find, with lesser-known titles such as the Anno series (also heavily damaged by Ubisoft DRM), or independant titles like Reus, Towns, or Gnomoria. Unfortunately, this is further harmed by the sorry state of the Sim genre itself, with the majority of city builders being money-sucking Facebook-inspired social "games", and major blunders like the reboot of SimCity.\n\nBut, politics aside, how does The Settlers 7 stand up on its own? It's a game full of interesting ideas. Similar to the afforementioned Anno and Stronghold series (which, to be fair, were probably inspired by The Settlers to begin with), the majority of the game is spent handling production chain strategies. The number of these chains is VERY daunting to those who don't enjoy such systems, but they're pretty intuative once learned, such as farm -> wheat -> bakery -> bread. The unique twist here is the division of science, trade, and military tactics. All three require development of these production chains in various ways, but unlike most games, they don't require you to do all three simultaneously. In fact, the game heavily encourages specialization in one or two of those choices in order to monopolize (i.e. steal all the best techs, steal all the best trade posts, or have the most military muscle). Thanks to an interesting "Victory Point" system, you can win the game in a variety of ways other than just destroying your enemy. In my many playthroughs, this resulted in some wonderfully bizarre situations, including winning a game mere seconds before an army destroyed my most valuable city by just barely holding out long enough with my economic strategy.\n\nPresentation-wise, I always loved the way the game manages to paint a board game-like set of zones to be settled, painted into breathtakingly beautiful maps, resulting in surprisingly natural-looking landscapes for a game that asks the player to flood the place with roads and buildings. Technologically, it's nothing crazy (the game is three years old at time of writing), but it has a wonderful fairy tale asthetic, light-hearted, but with more of a focus on beauty than goofiness. The campaign is a bit campy, but I found it quite enjoyable, with good voice acting and a good method of injecting each character's personality into their tactics.\n\nOverall, I understand how this game doesn't appeal to the hardcore, as I'm sure its complexities could easily be exploited if the game was played in an ultra-competative way. On the other hand, the more casual gamer could be easily scared away by the game's unfamiliar systems. And everyone else? They were already scared away by the DRM, it seems! But, if you are in that middle group, I highly encourage you to overlook all that and just have fun. The game is a bit old now and Ubisofts money-grabs have been abandoned (at time of writing, all DLC is included with the game), so while you won't find any strangers to play with or anything, there's still plenty of content and great city-building strategy fun to be had!","February 9, 2014","true","57.3"," 493 of 526 people (94%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","94","493","526","6","17"

But, given recent updates, there's no way in hell I'm playing this game anymore - I'm not downloading the Ubisoft DRM, or as their advertising team would probably call it, "community portal." I don't want to be part of Ubisoft's crappy community; that's why I have Steam.\n\nSteam is already essentially DRM; for some reason, however, Ubisoft feels this isn't enough, and requires you to sign into their proprietary service as well. I don't know about the average Steam user, but a large portion of why I use this platform is so I don't have to have an account for every game I want to play, and because I know, once a game is authorized with Steam, I can play it on any of my computers, with or without an internet connection. Ubisoft's proprietary overlay DRM is not only redundant - it's unreliable, requires an internet connection at all times, and lest we forget, defeats the purpose of downloading a game through Steam to begin with.\n\nThe community aspects of Steam are are a large aspect of why I use it. In my eyes, therefore, letting Ubisoft stomp all over that by requiring the use of their servers isn't just inconsiderate for Steam users, it devalues Steam as a whole. And I don't know about you, but I don't want to go back to the mid 2000s where I had to have an account for every game I played. So, seriously, cut this ♥♥♥♥ out - I bought the game, and in doing that, I submitted to Steam's DRM. I did this for the convenience and the community having one centralized platform for mine and my friends gaming provides. Don't ♥♥♥♥ it up by letting terrible companies like Ubisoft take a Steaming (hah, see what I did there?) dump by complicating what is otherwise a fantastic gaming platform. Ubisoft, even if your games are occasionally half decent, stop being a raging ♥♥♥♥ and let me play them when I want to, you bloated, antiquated tumor of a company.\n\nAnd yes, I know this review went on a little too long, and it probably sounds a bit foolish. I guess I just get a little pissy when a company that already has my money makes it more complicated to play an already mediocre game. I'm out.","November 11, 2015","false","9.7"," 206 of 265 people (78%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","78","206","265","16","9"

No doubt, but I do miss a couple of things from the previous Settlers games. Such as the freedom to construct your own walls and move your armies freely. Though I see the point in having a pre-built wall/fortification model as it opens up the possibility to win by other means than through brute force. As I to be honest prefer to win this way, it is a bit of a downer that one has restrictions for your military such as: A maximum number of units in an army (35), limited number of generals which you share with the other players (meaning that you can buy all the extra generals and prevent the other players from being able to recruit more than 35 soldiers) and not being able to move your troops freely. Though I see why they have done so, it conceals the army from your city when it is inactive--which is nice, as you don't really need to see it when it is inactive.\n\nThe city simulation is really well made and entertaining to watch, the transport system of goods is solved nicely by utilizing storehouses and the same goes for population capacity, they have made the buildings useful whilst maintaining its function as a population cap raiser by adding work yards to the residences and the other buildings (such as mines).\n\nThe victory point system backs up the separating of the military, technology and trade 'route' as every map has victory points for each of the three ways of progressing. So does the territories on the map, as they have three ways of being conquered, one for each way of playing (through force, trade or by using clerics (tech)). I do like the VP system, but it is has its drawbacks, they do force you to play in a given way if you want to win and they are not customizable.\n\nThe three 'routes' are all interesting and fun to play in their own way and none of them are superior to the other in my opinion, they all have pros and cons.\n\nThe visuals are suberb, I love how the game looks, it has maintained its image from the previous games whilst improving the quality. I have no comments on the music as I usually turn that off.\n\nThe major issue I have with this game is the lack of possible players and the map size, it honestly sucks that you can't have more than four players in a single game and most of the maps--and territories--available are pretty small and they lack some freedom to chose where to expand as the borders between territories feels so fixed. The combat in this game is also pretty boring to watch, it's like watching those old regiments of soldiers lining up and then wait for their leader to say 'attack' before they have a go at each other, you have no way of changing the outcome of the fights as you cannot control your army in other ways than ordering them from one sector to another.\n\nOn a scale from one to six, I would give this game a 4.5.\nDespite the negative things I've mentioned above I do enjoy playing this game from time to time. It is fun, but the lack of players prevents me from giving it a better score than that. I would have loved to play this with more than just one friend versus the AI or other players at a time (max players is four). It is not a perfect game, but it is a lot of fun none the less.","February 23, 2014","true","322.8"," 41 of 55 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","41","55","2","0"

If you like the idea of RTS, but don't like the super fast twitch gameplay that requires you to have a certain number of "actions per mniute" to feel like you're being successful, this might be the game for you.\n\n*First, I want to address UPlay.  I've been playing this game recently and UPlay with it works great.  I've had no issues (Oct 2015) even though this game is so old.  I had to contact Ubisoft because I bought this so long ago it was apparently registered to an old account of mine.  Their customer service let me know the account name, and I logged and was able to play since I remembered the password.  So, thanks to their customer service I didn't have to re-buy this gem.  New buyers obviously won't have this problem anyway.*\n\nThis game is a nice mix of "casual, but deep".  The setting is fairly light-hearted and casual, but the game is by no means easy if you ramp up the difficulty!  It has a very satisfying campaign, but skirmish modes are where the real replayability is.  You can adjust maps and scenarios to your hearts content to make for some really interesting matches.  Much more customizable than any other RTS I know.  Additionally, you can design how your own castle on the map looks for your skirmish or multplayer games.\n\nI couldn't recommend this game more.  It's too bad people feel the need to rip on a fantastic game because their ideology is against UPlay requirements.  But that's what it is.  If you take that into account, you'll notice that this game doesn't actually get mixed reviews from the people who take the time to actually review it; it gets great reviews (and looks how many years later!).","October 25, 2015","true","50.3"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

It's all based around production, as the video explains, but its much faster than other BB titles like Dawn of Discovery. You have the ability to jump right into the action if you want to roll military. Or you can rush tech. The victory points offer a variety of ways to win the game. If you can turtle and hit all 5-7 victory points you will win after 3 or 4 hours in a 4 player game. The stock game comes with a good amount of maps that you can play around with. I would suggest playing the first 20 minutes of a skirmish over and over until you get the hang of how production and your choices in prestige affect your over all strategy. Because of the difficulty to really get in and enjoy the game I would give this a solid 3.5 of 5.

City building is good. There are many different resources to collect. Research is good. Expansion is good. That's about it. The combat in this game is complete crap. You click on a sector of the map, your troops go there. If there are enemies, they attack them. That's it. There is no other way to control your troops other than that. If good combat in a strategy is a necessity to you, stay far away from this game. If not, give it a try.","January 9","true","38.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Settlers 7 focuses on complex build-chains routes than DoD's large scale trade routes.  while Settlers 7 could be played in a couple of hours DoD can easily take several days.\n\nBoth DoD and Settlers 7 offer something unique and are both gorgeous to look at.  why not get both?!","December 24, 2010","true","160.1"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","8","14","2","0"

Although I had a lot of fun as a demigod and making beautiful cities I'd have to say The Settlers 7 is the next step up. This game is much more strategic due to the depth of the economy system. There are so many things you can do and the best way to win is to adapt to your surroundings. The most important, and fun, part is achieving your goals by building from the ground up every little step along the way. Adapting to the different maps, planning ahead, and intricate knowledge of the supply chain come together like a true work of art.","January 5, 2011","true","36.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","2"

It's sort of a RTS mixed in with some city-building functions with trading and technology advancement. I spent countless hours with it, it has a certain magic feeling to it. The pace is much slower than other RTSs such as SC2, and you have to manage more resources than just two.","February 14, 2011","true","137.3"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","0"

It's a mix of classic Settler's style management with new age strategy. The Graphics, music and sound effects are fantastic. Customizing your castle is a neat feature too.

This is definitely one to check out. :)","February 21, 2014","true","12.7"," 10 of 23 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","10","23","0","0"

It's really a great strategy game with alternate ways of winning rather than always having the biggest and baddest army. It's mostly because of this system that makes it stand out from it's own series and other RTS's. The graphics are superb and the newly added co-op mode is a nice change of pace to the competitive gameplay..!","June 21, 2011","true","20.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
