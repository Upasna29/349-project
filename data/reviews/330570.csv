This is certainly the case with Noct. Great proof-of-concept and base for a game, but nothing yet to really do.\n\nAt this point, the game is just a set of instructions telling you to walk to a point, and then walk to the next. The scenery is boring and repetitive. Walking around structures is fairly dumb. The biggest challenge was deciding if I could fit through that crack in the wall (which I could not).\n\nI finished one round (found one survivor). I only needed the stick on the controller and did it with a coffee in the other hand. We yawned a lot. Respectfully, once again, it is a great base for a game, but needs the game.\n\nPros:\n+Graphical style has potential. Will it be realized? We'll see.\n+Ambient music is ok. Will it fit the game? We'll see. It is fairly calm, so it won't be good if the game goes more horror, etc.\n\nCons:\n-Will the game proper be good? Who knows. It is certainly not worth ten bones at this point.\n-We found the black and white inversion from going inside/outside buildings to be hard on our eyes. It is cool, but not easy to watch.\n-Way too many guns laying around. In fact other than an occasional water and medkit, that was all that was laying around or interactable with.\n-Environment and buildings were so repetitive and boring.\n\nIts Early Access, and its ten bucks. I cannot even begin to recommend because there is nothing here. This could be really cool when its done (if it ever is), or it could suck.\n\nPeace,","April 30","false","0.3"," 78 of 95 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","78","95","0","0"

Rich survival mechanics include instant death on contact with terrifying NPCs that can walk through objects, melee attacks by other players, and bullets - manage your entirely immobile food and health meters with food and health pickups which will often pop into existence on a timer in front of you, and drink liters of water to jog a few steps.\n\nThe 'narrative' is a set of three or four long-distance walking objectives with brief, short-sentence dialog between the player and a radio voice consisting of mostly meaningless "go here push button" "why?" "because I told you to". If you don't mess around, it offers a scintillating 20~30 minutes of markers to walk to.\n\nIn its current state, it's a nice proof of concept. It has a beautiful ambient soundtrack. It would make a nice deathmatch sandbox if it was smaller, and a great survival sandbox with some more content and some actual use for food and health. The spinning FLIR camera point of view is disorienting and fun. I hope they make a game on it some day.","December 18, 2015","false","1.0"," 64 of 81 people (79%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","79","64","81","19","3"

Hopefully you can find this place useful for your exploring with other people.\n\nWhat can I say?  NOCT is simply put, a game with incredible potential. If you feel interested, pick it up. The devs have been improving the game since day 1 and answered all the stupid questions I made in the forum.\n\n+ Devolver and C3SK werent messing around. This game IS terrifying and nerve wracking. Play it alone, at night, with good speakers and a cup of nerve-calms, this game is Silent Hill 2 all over again.\n\n+Atmosphere is a total YES. Calm, but unnerving, you really, REALLY get the feeling that things can go deadly wrong at any time. Its opressive and to be honest, almost masochist to play this game\n\n+Hard as hell. One hit = One death , you cannot even trust your OWN friends, monsters can randomly appear when you least expect it. It all makes the world feel vastly superior to you, and that nothing can save you.\n\n+The soundtrack, stellar. Makes walking alone intense, and fights scary as f**k\n\n+Weapons are in low amounts, ammo is rare, ANY supply is rare- Get ready to test your friends and normal people\n\n+ This game , as I said before, its scary. But not so much in "BOO!", its more of a feeling , a psicological shiver that you are powerless to those...things.\n\n+Game looks amazing, runs great, fantastic optimization so far.\n\n+World tells a story of a ruined Dark-Souls-like civilazation, and the monsters themselves are.... lets just say mother nature can be f**ked up\n\n\n-/+ Have good brightness, or the game will be hard to look at.\n\n-/+ Its highly polished and playable, there's just not many people around\n\n-/+ The nature of the game can lead to people shooting on sight , no chat made to even say "friendly". Just bang bang\n\n\n- For the ones looking for fun, God help you if you think you'll play having fun. Its unnerving, challenging, and frustrating.\n\n- Water? I cant find any yet, and due to the sprinting, its rather nessesary.\n\nNEW - Crashes are present, some people suffer more. I only had one, when exiting to main menu.\n\n\n\n8.5/10  The game has an incredible potential for LAN and online terror with friends.\nCant wait to see how this goes!","October 21, 2015","true","2.3"," 44 of 55 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","44","55","3","0"

It's multiplayer, but there's never anyone online. Do not buy it if you are expecting much of a game. That said, I'm eager to see where this one goes.\n\nLong version: As of its latest patch, Noct no longer has a tutorial or campaign, and as a result has no scripted scares nor gameplay goals. It can still be played solo or online. Regardless as to how you choose to play, Noct can be summed up in one word: empty. The map is large and filled with empty placeholder buildings. Sprinting is extremely limited, so you cannot simply run from one landmark to another. There are no objectives and enemies can easily be defeated our outrun, making the "survival" aspect of the game rather bland.\n\nThe game doesn't have any official dedicated servers, however the developers run official playtest sessions after every update. Times for these are posted on the forums. In multiplayer sessions, other players are invisible when behind cover, however the game has a radar screen that shows the location of living players, firefights, loot and any messages players have sent.\n\nSeeking players out in this way is pretty great, but once you actually find them there's never anything to do. Griefing is a non-issue, due to the low number of players and the lack of interesting loot. Chatting is difficult, considering the small character count of messages. Teaming up for survival like the trailer suggests provides no real advantage. So basically all that's left to do is play Marco Polo.\n\nThat said, Noct is an interesting concept and has some nice moments. Combat, when it does happen, is surprisingly tense. The standard survival horror shooter tropes are in play (limited ammo, one-hit-wonder characters, limited sprint, terrible visibility indoors), but what made it interesting for me was the mouse-angled radar that can be used to spot the outlines of unseen enemies. It's great for making mad dashes between hiding spots. It's horrifying when it gets knocked out.\n\nSo despite the long list of negatives, I'd say this is one to keep an eye on, even if I can't recommend the $10 price tag just yet. I'm excited to see what the developers have in store for it.","May 3","true","2.0"," 27 of 29 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","27","29","2","0"

This is not a future review of what the game could be, it is a review of the game as it stands in Early Access.\n\n\nThe good\n- The world and presentation was great. Art, sound, noises, all fantastic and add to the overall mood.\n- Multiplayer works, which is not always the case.  No clue if it was cross-platform as I am not even sure what other platforms are supported.\n- No tutorial. Dropped in to an unknown world not knowing how to do things makes things get real, real fast. Added to the horror aspect of the game.\n- Perspective. Sat nav view of me and the rotating map is something I have never seen done before.\n\n\nThe bad\n- No tutorial. The other side of this beast, no clue I had filters or could access a map. Still not even sure what the filters were for.\n- Lack of variety in gameplay. The gameplay loop is run to an area, pickup something, shoot monsters/bugs. Rinse and repeat.\n- Long open areas between waypoints. There is nothing to do between waypoints execpt run away from monsters.\n- Noct monsters. There isn't a point to engage with them if they aren't attacking me or if they aren't surrounding a waypoint.\n\n\nThe Ugly\n- Crashes. After two hours I had crashed the game three times. If I can't play your game I can't help you.\n- Controller support not listed on the Steam Store page. I honestly almost didn't by this twin stick shooter because it didn't list it on the store page. When I went into the controls I noticed it mentioned X360 controller mapping.\n- After about 30-45 minutes I had seen everything the game has had to offer. Plain in simple after two hours of repeating the same content 3 times, I have no drive to return to the game.\n\n\nBottom line: It feels like it needs 6 more months of work in-oder for me to be able to sell it to a friend for multiplayer. There just isn't a enough meat on the bone at this stage for it to be fun and engaging gameplay.","October 22, 2015","false","2.3"," 65 of 93 people (70%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","70","65","93","8","13"

Mainly due to lack of content - 28 minutes that I've played is all there is. It basically feels a little like tutorial, and after you finish it you can explore and survive on your own, but there is no point really. Same looking buildings, with the same items in them (ammo, food, water) and lots of walking and doing nothing. Sometimes a monster shows up, but they are easy to deal with and killing them results in nothing (you might as well ignore them). So the only thing you can actually do is to walk around.\n\nThe game has potential. It's presented as a top-down surveillance view. There are 2 people interacting with each other - person behind cct cameras and a survivor (that the player controls). When you die as the survivor, the surveillance person searches out another human and you take over. All you get to learn is that the hostile creatures are called Nocturnals and there may have been some sort of catastrophe. Not much else to it for now. Each survivor you get to control wants to be saved, but the surveillance person actually tries to save everyone, so he/she persuades people to do some vital tasks first, which in turn may end up badly for the select individuals. This concept is amazing and could pair really well if for example the overseer had some ulterior motive ;) But for now there are just some few short menial tasks, without any consequences or follow up. Accomplishing them doesn't result in anything meaningful.\n\nMy verdict is - wait till release.\nI will be revisiting the game after launch myself (and rewriting the review, because I always evaluate current state of the game, not the potential of what might/ might not be). The game certainly has piqued my interest. I'm curious about the underlying lore/history and how it all progresses. I enjoy the presentation & general feel. I can easily imagine Noct turning into something really neat when it gets more fleshed out & more contents is added. But for now there is just not enough substance.","January 14","false","0.5"," 37 of 48 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","37","48","0","0"

It also controls sublimely with keyboard and mouse or as a twin-stick shooter, is one of the most atmospheric games of 2015 and will scare the pants off you when you least expect it.\n\nThe atmosphere comes in part from its fairly unique graphical look. So OK, there are other black and white games out there but Noct does it in a way that feels special. You control your character through an ‘Eye in the Sky’ camera with various military style filters, think night vision and you will be on the right track. Couple this with some truly brilliant atmospheric audio cues and ambient backing tracks from none other than Robin Finck of NiN and you just know that this game will get inside you and force you to turn the lights back on.\n\nIn Noct you get to play one of the unlucky survivors of armageddon, an apocalyptic purge of hellfire and death that leaves you in a barren wasteland surrounded by a ruined civilization, dust storms and a smattering of the biggest, ugliest, death dealing monsters you have ever had the misfortune to encounter, the Nocturnal. Do not despair though because someone, somewhere is watching and guiding you through the ‘eye in the sky’ and is leading you to your salvation, or so you hope!\n\nNoct is perfectly playable as a solo event however the game is designed around multiplayer and as such others can join your world and help or hinder your progress as you are guided by the mysterious stranger who watches from above. The end result is looking to be a vast adventure where you are never quite sure who you can trust or what the end goal really is. Could it be your salvation or your doom? The only way to find out is to play and hope that we are all on the same side come the end of days.\n\nEquip yourself with various guns or a rather handy melee attack and step out into a brooding, dark world of black, white and shadow. Collect items and complete objectives, form lasting friendships or find your nemesis and start your journey in the dark. The Noct are coming for you.","October 22, 2015","true","14.1"," 22 of 28 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","22","28","0","0"

Adding bullet calibres and ordinance types explosive, flame etc.\nNo noticeable way to track down other players could leave a trail of blood or heat from shoes for a good hunt.\nLack of backpack or consumables amount capacity indicators. Why not make the backpack images high resolution.\nNeeds a good deal of game modes and story arcs plus definable objectives and progression trees or buffs perks / Armour buff pickups.\nDropping server connections is not explained as local hosting is terminated.\nCould do with some permanent servers.\nLooking through the drones night vision for other survivors is a bit of cat and mouse as you see enemy deaths.\nCentipede best enemy with mini enemy could do with quite a few extra.\nAfter engaging the enemy the weapon drops disappear in buildings, an observation.\nShould have place names for each village or town.\nCould include resource collection for bases, turrets, lights, barricades, heat or thermal loss issues to player.\nI guess a back story could be longer or even explain what “xmit” and “recv” mean, the protagonists.\nWait long enough next to a building and loot drops.\nHow close do you have to be for text to appear on the other players hud? If I see them I should be able to communicate.\nErasing the player can sometimes require a hike to get to the waypoints, which is not much fun.\nPerhaps open up the map more as more player enter the arena. I traversed the map and it’s a defined space but too easy to know where to go. Possibly have different maps or more to it once at full game release.\nDefined characters i.e. bandits, enclave, religious order, maniac, humies, mutant.\nHave other player choose whether to orchestrate the drama by dropping enemies or being able to play as enemies or faster zombies see Game CRAWL for example.\nCurrently in need of objectives and reasons to communicate with other players, possibly add Non Player Characters and personamlities to the mixture.\nI like the idea of horde or rush enemies and the idea of barricading and holding positions to rescue survivors.\n\n\nPlenty of potential, and a well executed 2D game idea looking for ward to the final release.\n\n\n","April 27","true","4.3"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"

The game is a 2D top down survival horror game that seems to have been inspired from games such as DayZ as well as Zombi U. The game puts you in control of a survivor in a post-apocalyptic world that has been ravaged by hideous monsters.  The purpose of the game is to survive the hellish wasteland as long as possible while carrying out missions given to you by an omnipresent character who gives you missions and provides directions via your walkie-talkie. The game is incredibly challenging, and the limited resources and ammunition combined with the limited vision and hulking beasts that can kill you in one hit create quite the nerve-wracking experience. The dark shroud of mystery and terror that is created by the games use of a top down black and white thermal image view paired with the intense soundtrack kept me on the edge of my seat as I played through the game wondering when the next monstrous beast was going to emerge from the shadows and devour me.\n\nWhile the game does have an omnipresent character telling you where to go, it does not by any means attempt to hold your hand, the game takes a little bit of playing to get a proper feel for which lead to me going through my first dozen or so survivors and dying as soon as I came across my first monster, after becoming accustomed to how the game plays everything becomes highly satisfying, your first kill, your first mission completion, finally finding some decent loot, surviving long enough to require a new clip of ammunition… you learn to appreciate every little thing you manage to accomplish in the game that much more because of how hard you had to struggle to reach that point. This is certainly a game of repetition, as you will die over and over, but you will use the skills and tips you learn from each play through to help better your odds of surviving that much longer and besting your play through record.\n\nWhile the game is certainly scary enough as a solo campaign, the game becomes even that much more terrifying when you add the unpredictability of human players to the mix, will they befriend you to accomplish missions? Will they kill you on sight? The game creates the same multiplayer survival horror feel that DayZ manages to create by adding the element of not knowing what the other player will do; I once had a session of DayZ where I played for several hours with a Norwegian man who couldn’t speak one bit of English, it was one of the most interesting moments of gaming I ever experienced in my life, we overcame a language barrier and travelled together for over five hours killing zombies and gathering weapons together. He started typing words into the chat that he said he had translated from google translate and asked if I would be his friend on Steam, I immediately shot him in the head and stole all of his loot, I was sweating profusely and was shaking and laughing manically all at the same time, the feelings were real, the bond was real, and the betrayal was real, and in that moment I became the horror element of the game. Noct manages to capitalize on the exact same formula and use the player’s emotions, fear, and trust to create the same level of horror.\n\nWhile the game isn’t perfect, the devs are dedicated and actively working to improve the game and I can say that I would highly recommend that anyone who is one the fence take the jump and support the devs and immerse yourself in the horror filled world of Noct.\n\n\nhttp://noobsthatplaygames.com/","October 26, 2015","true","2.5"," 19 of 26 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","19","26","0","0"

It has a great deal of potential and could be a really cool, intersting unique game down the line.\n\nBut as for right now, it's very barebones. There is less than 30 minutes of fairly generic post apoc story (took me 23 minutes), after which you are told "There's no more objectives, just wander around and survive/find survivors). The map is a pretty good size, compounded on by a slow move speed. There are basic survival needs (food, water, etc) but all that they seem to do is allow you to sprint for a short time. Food was fairly common but water was not. Didn't really seem to mater either way, the 1 water resource I found replenished about 15 seconds of sprint and then I was thirsty again.\n\nThe combat is pretty functional, standard twin stick shooter controls. Various weapons, grenades, a melee, etc. Not sure what the weapon variety did, due to the biggest issue I had. There wasn't really any reason to shoot. The day time is empty of enemies (I'm assuming other players will be the threat then, but there's no MP yet), and the night time is slightly more populated by monsters, but I never saw more than 1 or 2 per night. They were about as slow as the player is non-sprinting, plus they didn't just beeline for the player, they zigzaged and wandered, so  it was very easy to out run them. Night didn't even seem to last very long, maybe 1/4th the length of day. The only time I felt even slightly threatened was the scripted death right at the start. Even a part during the story where the guy on the comms says "♥♥♥♥, get out of there now!" I just walked out of the building without sprinting, and only saw an enemy on the edge of the flashlight that didnt even seem to be chasing me. The design of the monsters I saw were cool, ranging from giant spiders to smaller caterpiler looking things.\n\nTL;DR dont buy it, but keep tabs on it.

Why? Because never have I seen a game with this special style of gameplay.\nLets dwelve into it\n\nEARLY ACCESS REVIEW\n\nPlayability/Core game - 5/10\nSo sincethis is an early access game, bugs are bound to happen. However, so far I havent seen any, given my low playtime. The game is meant to be played online, and sadly, there seem no current servers open, so you are left with aproximatly 30 minutes of generic story, which i'll get to in a minute. The controls are easy to master, and the mouse feels acurate. The visuals does not blend into each other, and its easy to see where you go.\n\nGraphics - 7/10\nSo you are looking down on your playable character from orbit, via an infared camera. Everything is black and white, and it helps add a sense of suspense in the game. The amount of pixels are not incredibly high, but it is easily overlooked, since you consentrate less on visuals, and more on the sound.\n\nCombat - 6/10\nAs you progress in the story, you are constantly attacked by Nocturnals (And players) and you have a decent set of weapons to obtain, including you SMG's, riffles, pistols, and grenades. Each type has about two or three different weapons, but besides the pistol and grenade, you feel like their strength is somewhat the same, with riffles having slightly more range and damage, though this could save you life. Did I mention the enemies are terrifying and will kill you in one hit? Well they are, and can. Dont try clubber them with your bat. Trust me on this.\n\nMechanics - 7/10\nYou have a set of very basic needs. Water, food, and health. These can be replenished by optaining items hidden in houses, but this poses a greater threat than you might imagine. First of all, you cannot see inside a house till you are inside, so be careul of ambushes, but you cannot look out while inside. This has caused a lot of death to me as i managed to find something nice, and instantly get killed by a Nocturnal in the doorframe. Good scary moments.\nThe game features a text based chat, with the text howering above your head, so only people who can see you, can "hear" you. There is NO voice chat, and I hope it stays this way, since you get paranoid with people.\n\nScares - 4/10\nThis might just be my opinion, but the scares are minimum in the game. I discussed the house moments a line ago, but thats as close to scares as you get. You do however feel slightly scared of running into the Nocturnals, as you have a very limited supply of ammunition, and it takes a ♥♥♥♥-ton of bullets to take one of the big guys down. But again this might just be my opinion.\n\nStory - 3/10\nAs stated, so far there is only 30 minutes of singleplayer campain, but thats perfectly fine, though i still score it low. Its one of your generic "Fetch" quests where you are tasked to go to one end of the map, to get an item to the other-other end of the map, and so on. The developer has spread out a nice amount of things to make it not so repetetive, and it helps a bit, but not a lot. Again, this is supposed to be multiplayer, not singleplayer.\n\nSound - 8/10\nNOCT does a lot right on this point, and for good reason. It has very little music, and that is good! You feel like you are helping an actual person around, and seeing it via Infared. The ambience is low and humming, but you can still hear cracks, gunshots (drumbeats) scittering and so on. Not a lot more can be said, but it works REALLY well.\n\nThe final score - 8/10\nOverall NOCT is a good game, and despite it being early access, and to my knowledge only has one Dev, its well made, is special, and needs more love. Play it is my advice, since it has such a low cost. And most importantly, get friends along, and start your own little server, and see if your trust in each other is big enough.","February 27","true","0.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

This can also lead to some eyestrain as well.\n- Inability to "hoard" resources means that you have a very low upper limit of player agency and power, which may not be to the liking of some.\n- Enemy encounters can surprisingly sneak up on players with the enemies able to fade into the background (requiring usage of the player's flashlight to shine them) leading to very cheap deaths if not situationally aware.\n- Player deaths can be very punishing, akin to the Souls games.","December 23, 2015","true","0.7"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","10","14","0","0"

There are few games that deliver this amount of atmosphere and just pure suspense\nwith so little tools. Everything in this game makes it probably one of the best survival horror games to be released this year.\n\nSure right now we only have a tiny sliver of the actual game and you can beat it in probably under a hour depending on how you play, it still gives us already a great idea of what the game might become once it gets its full release in January.\n\nThough where I think this game really will shine is when you play this game with some friends kinda like Left 4 Dead or Nazi Zombies from CoD. Its one of those games that could make for a very fun friday night with some friends.\n\n+ Atmosphere\n+ Soundtrack\n+ Multiplayer\n+ Unique take on 2D\n\n\n\nThe Bad\nSure this game has some good things but there are surely also some bad things right?\n\nYes and no, most of the problems I had so far with this game are already being addressed by the developers.\nI had frequent and irregular crashes, but when checking the forum over here on steam i saw that the devs are\nactively trying to tackle all these issues already, which shows this just isn't one of those release without any progress after they get your money.\n\nSo far the story is a bit too short for my liking, I played it below in my video for the first time in about 30 minutes, I know its still in early access and that the game will get more content down the line but still its pretty annoying to be playing the game and to hit a point where there is just without any heads up no content anymore. Again this is something I'm sure will get fixed.\n\nAlso another thing that really annoyed me was how there was no real tutorial, a lot of things you will need to find yourself. like the controller support. It never said i could use my controller until i saw the settings for it in the settings menu.\n\n\n\n- Crashes\n- Short story mode\n- No tutorial\n\n\nEnd Verdict\nSo far I would give this game a 6-7/10 which will probably rise up in the future with more content being added, because that's where the game really slacks right now, the multiplayer is just not enough to keep someone busy for more then a hour, two at most.\n\nBellow is a video with my first experience of the game.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0njPorbJM8\n\n","October 24, 2015","true","1.8"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","65","13","20","3","0"

Aside from that, the the strategy necessary to survive is simpleton and bland. The playing field is closed-ended, and there is really nowhere to go. There's no direction or real goal other than hoarding resources (they regenerate randomly in the buildings after a few minutes, and monsters don't go in buildings), shooting down or avoiding monsters, or walking around the same-'ol island you cannot get off. There are usually no servers to play with others when I'm on, but even when there are others to play with, where do I go?\n\nOh yeah, med-kits are basically worthless because all the monsters appear to kill you instantly.\n\nA few suggestions:\n*Stop all the one-hit kills. Add a health counter that affects the survivor negatively the lower the health is. This also makes med-kits useful.\n\n*Add a leveling system, a profession system, or a skill tree that allows you customize your character and play. I appreciate the rogue-like aspect of starting from scratch, and skills could be randomized and only under control of the player after spawning, not before, to force players to adapt.\n\n*Scavenging. This is a SURVIVAL-horror game, and many times the resource regeneration does not give you food or water that you need to run. This is not "Do Not Starve", but the only "surviving" is hiding in buildings and running away.\n\n*Balance the monster encounters and resources so that there is more action. Yes, suspense is best served when there is time between encounters, but too much time between encounters means it is boring. Why aren't there monsters in the forests, only in cities?\n\n*Add AI survivors or NPCs where you can trade inventory for items you need.\n\n*Give me more information about what I am holding. How many grenades do I really have? How many bullets can my mag hold? How many mags do I have? How long can I run? How much water do I have? How thirsty am I? How do I know one rifle is better than another? These do not have to be your standard dials, but give me more than "OK" or "LOW'.\n\n*Finally, a journal, scraps of paper, or some other way to gather information on monsters, locations, equipment, skills, story line, history of the ancient evil, etc.\n\nSorry, I cannot recommend this quite yet. I will probably put it on the shelf and pick it back up when there is another update, or until the final release comes out.","May 14","false","1.2"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

But it's not that big and hard to stray.\n\nOverall? I don't know yet. If this is all that game can show us, well it will be disapointing.

Instead, it's more of a story driven game than I'd imagined, with the player being given X tasks to complete, and with both scripted and unscripted enemies coming to mess things up. I'll be honest, I'm not a fan of that scripting as it then becomes repetitive to the user, BUT that said, it still has a fantastic feel. Even when I know what's coming, when a wall is broken down, I still jump. The art style is GORGEOUS, the score is really interesting and immersive. I'd say beyond just my expectations being somewhat shifted, the only major complaint I'd have is the inventory/weapons system being a bit unclear/clunky. Still, overall, a fun and gritty little indie exploration game.\n\nPROS-\nAmazing visuals\nImmersive atmosphere/audio\nSimple but easy to grasp gameplay\n\nCONS-\nAfter playing once, some of the "scares" are expected, thus diminished/repetitive\nUI and item/weapon are a bit clunky","January 30","true","1.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Thank you.\nTl;DrIn it's current state, Noct is a little bit lackluster, but is heading in the right direction and will definitely grow into an amazing game. Port to forward is 26500\nThe Good!Now, with that out of the way, I'm just going to say that Noct is a very atmospheric and amazing game. The concept is very much on-point and is definitely heading in the right direction. The art style is quite different from other games that I have seen, and is what caught my attention the most. The game revolves (literally) around you, the unfortunate survivor of the outbreak of the Nocturnals, which are giant abominations of nature (or "Nopes" as the developer nicknames them). Your camera is a top-down perspective with a sort of thermal imaging style outlining you, your enemies, and faintly showing your enviornment and surroundings. Someone, somewhere, is watching you from high up, through a sattelite or a scout plane of sorts, and decides to contact you and give you a series of tasks to "save everyone." Most of these put you in danger, but honestly, when are you not in danger? Because this game has a line-of-sight mechanic (which sort of contradicts with the whole sattelite drone watching you from above), you could turn a corner and you'd be in the mouth of a bigass spider. There are a variety of monsters, some small, plenty large, and some large ones that spawn smaller ones.\nNow for the bad part...To be entirely honest, it's not exactly that hard to survive once you've watched a video or two prior to playing this game. To avoid most Nocturnals, contrary to common sense, and improve your chances of survival, you simply just stand outside and avoid most towns. The story, or the little bits of dialogue that tell you where to go, isn't even close to being finished and actually leaves you hanging once the last programmed objective has been completed without much indication. I guess this is to keep the flow of immersion going, but it left me confused for a while. This should be expected, though, since this is early access and the developer is probably more focused in completed the mechanics than the story right now. As for the survival elements, they have barely any functionality. Food doesn't work, water is basically just a sprint charge meter, and Health I haven't actually checked yet, but I think it might be working in multiplayer, since all monsters kill you in one hit (and mangle your body if you find it again). You have to port forward to host multiplayer games, and that's not much of an issue besides the fact that I couldn't find the port that required forwarding without having to look on the forums two or three posts down on a thread. Still, that's just a minor issue. Also the port you need to forward is 26500.\nReview+Very atmospheric\n+Good ambient soundtrack and sound design\n+Very interesting art style\n+Nice array and well thought-out enemies\n+Good selection of weapons\n+Line of sight awareness\n+Multiplayer support\n+Large map\n+Reasonable price for it's current state and future updates to come\n-Lackluster story (more will be added, I'm sure)\n-Somewhat easy survival, but can be caught off guard sometimes\n-Barely functional survival mechanics\n~Have to dig around to find out how to host servers\nDo I recommend this?Absolutely; for the price and the good start that it has right now with no-doubt amazing content soon to come, it's definitely worth it. I highly doubt this will become another Star Forge.","October 24, 2015","true","1.9"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

The survivor is contacted by a stranger known only by his communication code, "XMIT". XMIT gives you a series of objectives, making vague statements about saving humanity. If your current survivor dies, XMIT contacts a new survivor, failing to mention that his instructions may have led directly to the previous guy's death. Who is this stranger? Can he be trusted? Does he really want to save humanity?\n\nThis early tutorial section, which poses these questions and draws the player into the game world, is awesome. Unfortunately it is also over way too soon. The game pretty much ends here.\n\nAfter completing XMIT's objectives, you're told to keep yourself alive. and find more survivors. Survival gameplay consists mostly of checking buildings for different weapons and more ammunition. You can also find meds/food/water, but missing these items only seems to result in minor inconvenience rather than outright death. Lacking water means you can't sprint, and lacking food results in slower movement speed overall (I think). Moving slower doesn't massively impact your ability to fend off the creatures, so ammunition is your biggest limitation, but during my playtime I never managed to run out of it.\n\nThere's a solid variety of firearms which are split into three categories: Pistols, Rifles, and SMGs. Ammunition packs are unrealistically split into these vague categories. So your AK47 takes the same ammo as all the various Colt firearms you can find. There may be differences in damage each firearm is capable of dishing out, but if there is, it's not obvious. I found myself using whatever weapon I had the most ammunition for at any given time, and no matter what I had managed to scrounge up, it was always powerful enough to deal with the threats I encountered.\n\nOver the course of my admittedly pretty short playtime (just under an hour as of this writing), I was only attacked by four different types of enemies, two of which could be killed in one hit via melee. I discovered no NPC survivors.\n\nPretty soon I found myself wondering where the sense of danger was, what I was supposed to do exactly. This game is, after all, billed as survival horror. But survival is a non-issue and the game world seems to hold nothing of interest by itself.\n\nWhich leads me to my next point. The game is obviously supposed to be played online (the description page on Steam flat out says as much). But like most indie games with an online component, the player-base is non-existent, and expecting that to change, ever, would be unrealistic. So for the most part we are stuck with whatever content single player has to offer.\n\nI could write most of these gripes off as a byproduct of the game still being in Early Access, but the developer has also made the statement, "most of the content already integrated into the game". I hope this is just referring most very basic gameplay elements, because that's really all we've got currently, and it isn't enough to carry Noct right now at its asking price of $10 or even half that if you catch it on sale.\n\n\nPros:\n+Atmosphere.\n+Simple, but incredibly effective audio design.\n+Amazing soundtrack.\n+Lots of potential. I'd love to see the gameplay expanded with random missions from XMIT, which can be accepted or ignored with varying consequences.\n\nCons:\n-ALMOST NO GAMEPLAY CONTENT (as of 3/21/2016, anyway)\n\nBottom Line:\nUltimately, there just isn't enough content in Noct at the time of this writing for it to deserve a full recommendation. With that said, it still merits a very weak thumbs up as there is a lot of potential here and I hope this project doesn't get abandoned. Also the soundtrack is already completed, and it's pretty phenomenal. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZodtpxHeL5c","March 21","true","0.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The atmosphere is outstanding with a unique visual style (viewed thru a blanc/white satellite cam) and great ambient music. The controls are simple and responsive, the creatures are spooky on the occasions when they appear, and all around it feels nice to play. The major drawback at present is that there isn't much _play._ There's very little to do, and only a bit more to see. As it stands, I love what's there, and the idea of what's to come, but until then I'd only recommend it to people who KNOW they will like this style of game. I personally love it, but 10$ is too high an asking price for what's currently there.

I really like the visual presentation of this. It makes me very curious about what happened to the world, who is watching the player from this satellite, and what these creatures are.\nThe gameplay and music are so good in creating tension in exploration. When you see the 'uh oh' above your little guy's head, turning a corner too fast, or going into a dark house blind could mean death. The sparse ammo makes salvaging bullets a must and you must choose your battles. I really like the sort of 'flashlight' effect on your line of sight. It's cool to be able to see clearly what you're aiming at and really helpful when you're looking out for a creature.\n\nI'm torn between making it a recommended game right now though. As an early access, I can't fairly judge it especially since its very void of content now.\n\nThere's nothing to find except roaming creepy crawlers and empty buildings that have weapons and ammo laying around.\nIn the short time I played it, I got bored quickly since there was nothing to do but rip and tear monsters and find guns. A level system would add a lot to longevity, but it would ruin a rogue-like which I'm guessing this game is supposed to be.\nThere was barely any water to find which you need to run, and you'll be doing that a lot.\nI'm guessing these monsters can one-hit you so that its required to band together with people, which I can't even do since there's no one online. Since I can't find anyone to team up with to take on these monsters, I'm not sure what health packs are for. Friendly fire? Poison damage? Smaller enemies planned for the future?\nNot sure why you would want to kill other people; why would you kill anyone for loot if there's almost no inventory system? Ammo and Mag count are either 'OK' or 'LOW' so there's a good idea of how much you have, but its a little hard to ration out ammo when 'OK' is all you know about how many bullets you have left.\nI'm hoping that the lore and story for this game is good; personally I'm a sucker for apocalyptic scenarios, especially when they involve horrendous creatures.\n\nI'll give it a recommend as I like what they've given me, and with a year or even more to develop a story and improve on its features, I'm optimistic. It isn't really worth the price right now, but I got it in a bundle, so I'm not complaining.","June 2","true","0.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I was lucky enough to get an early alpha access key from the developer a few months back, and when I played back then, the game was a queit, creepy romp through a wasteland with the fear of being eaten by a giant spider looming. I'm so happy to say that as this game has continued to be developed, it's only driving that further and further. With the introduction of different characters and interactions based on the death of your past life, the feeling of a living, breathing world is very well created. This survival game won't hold your hand as it guides you to peril.\n\nMultiplayer is what you can come to expect from an open world survival horror game. While sometimes I've found players eager to explore and fight by my side, you're just as likely to meet somebody who will blow your head off for your loot. Some enjoy that freedom, but others, not so much. As it stands, multiplayer is very rewarding, and can lead to some pretty great interactions, but does have a few setbacks inherent to the nature of mulitiplayer gaming.\n\nI'm glad the game is in Early Access, because by no means is it perfect. The loot drop system is pretty skewed, leaving you feeling like you're always missing one thing to feel safe in the game. While this may be a design standpoint, it wouldn't hurt to make ammo a little bit easier to find. Another low was the story, as it is now. Missions have you going from one decrepid building to another, picking up this and activating that, but doesn't really go anywhere. It isn't until one of the last moments in the game's current storyline does it start to describe the world the player is in, but it is quickly dropped and never brought up again. I do hope later versions of the game improve the quality of mission and get more involved in worldbuilding.\n\nAll in all, Noct is a beautifully terrifing experience. Though it certainly has room to improve, it delivers a real sense of dread and nervousness. The wasteland of Noct is creepy, quiet and full of legitimant scares to be had. As I've watched the game develop, it's only getting better and better. I hope that the talented, one-man team, C3SK, keeps his vision in mind to create a scary exploration game and blows us away with a game people will want to talk about. As it stands, Noct is still one of the best horror games on Steam, even in it's early state.","November 30, 2015","true","2.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This game is like a demo, which doesn't have a lot of things to do.\nThe background story of this game is in total mystery.

I met a friendly stranger and went on exploring with him or her, and then I believed I got killed by a landmind or something, and then I quit.\n\nAfter all, the game itself feels like a concept presentation, there's not many contents to play with.

I nearly died like this to a monster I couldn't see, so the house mechanics still need to be worked on.\n\nThe ammunition system is a little ambiguous, only saying "Ok", Low" or "Out", but I reckon it could do with a "Med" setting, used when you aren't at full ammo, but aren't two or three clips away.\n\nThere's very limited structures around the map, and not much to do with them so if there were barricaded doors or something, then you'd have to whack them open, alerting monsters and players in the area. Maybe windows could be a good idea, who knows?\n\nFor a multiplayer game, there aren't a lot of aspects that distinguish it from single player, so maybe you could drop ammo or rations for other players it's make sticking together much more worthwhile.\n\nAnd finally, the monsters. I think instead of having all monsters behaving the same way, you could have some chase relentlessly or hide behind walls to make monsters a bit more diverse, even going as far to have them interact with each other, would make it a lot more immersive.\n\nNonetheless, this game is a beautiful concept and will be very interesting when more players join.

I can safely say that this game continues on in the style of that (amazing) game. Devolver is proving that they're willing to put money into polishing/delivering concepts that are stylish and enjoyable.\n\nThe atmosphere in this game is awesome, very dark and involved. Personally I dig the overhead, infrared camera style of gameplay, but it won't be for everyone. The music in this game is contemplative, moody, dark, and thoughtful...not unlike Boards of Canada's more minimalistic stuff.\n\nGameplay is tight in terms of movement, but I must say that in terms of aiming the controls are a bit sensitive. Please bear in mind though that I'm using a mouse and keyboard, and turning down the DPI did help somewhat. While the combat is fairly intuitive, there will be some cheap deaths experienced immediately after leaving a building.\n\nIt is important to note though that cheap deaths these days are often just a sign that we're all being spoiled by games that are way too easy. What I'm trying to say is that this game has a whole lot of promise for being in early access, and much like BroForce I have every confidence that Devolver will deliver a very polished product in the end.\n\nAt the price point especially...what's not to love?","October 22, 2015","true","1.7"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

The 2D top down survival horror game has a unique way of setting you up in a bleak world carrying out tasks, trying to survive what comes at you.

It's implemented well and also accompanied by a soundtrack that really sets the mood of exploring creepy areas.

At this stage in development all "Noct" is really lacking is a full length story mode (which im sure will be available in the full release) and improvements to the survival aspects of the game for as of right now health means nothing as monster kill you instantly, food indicator affects nothing and water is only gathered to allow for sprinting.

But some might feel it's really on the jumpscaring? (Did i mention there's PVP?)\n\nA potato like mine isn't good enough to run Noct, but on another system i've got, it runs gorgeously. The entire flair and particle effect really drives up that environment. And i'm sure several people will find that online multiplayering interesting.\n\nAlso to note, the dev has increased the monster agitation against people who grief and murder players consistently. So a decent balancing factor there.\n\nAnd lastly. It's Early Access atm. There's no real way to determine how the game will play out. But C3Sk seems really chill and listening of the community.\n\nSo if you dig survival horror games, maybe keep Noct under you're watch.

It is in EA and what you see is what you get on the store pages video. It gives a good sense of danger without throwing monsters at every turn. Reminds me a little of project zomboid in that sources are limited and in how the players view is limited to where he/she is facing. It has a interesting art style but is overly taxing on old low end hardware even at 720p (i3/AMD6400HD). It doesn't look like it should be either, but effects are no doubt the offender.

It's not a jumpscare horror game, it's a suspense thriller. With amazing sound effects and visuals, Noct successfully puts you on the edge of your seat as you are running away from giant worm things. That is another amazing part of this game, you dont know anything about the enemies. The enemies look like they just crawled out of the groud and started killing everyone, which adds to the horror.\n\nBut, like any game, Noct has some flaws. The gameplay can be repetitive after playing for a little while.  Also, since Noct is a multiplayer game that has friendly fire, people will kill you. Like, a lot. The space between waypoints can also be quite large making journeys between each a little long.\n\nOverall I think Noct is worth it at only $10. But it is in Early Access, so if you don't like that aspect then go ahead and hold off until it comes out of Early Access.\n","October 29, 2015","true","0.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

The enemies are not threatening at all once you learn how to deal with them. Oh, and don't forget the atrocious pvp.\n\nIt's also not scary, not remotely so, the reviews really misled me into thinking this game was frightening, but this ended up being not at all scary and more a just boring walking simulator. Unless you're scared by seeing the same three or four generic monsters slide along at you over and over, you're not going to get scared.\n\nAnd it really isn't hard, where did that implication come from? The monsters are easily killed with a single magazine of a rifle, and ammo is abundant, like in every house there is a gun and all the supplies you can hold. After about five minutes of gameplay, I couldn't die unless the game bugged. And that's only because I figured out the controls by that point.\n\nDon't bother playing online, I set up a server and it filled with 12 year olds DM-ing in a specific town, the monsters are not a threat at all but players just shoot on sight, and melee is instant death so the best strategy is to just run at them and mash your attack. I see zero reasons to play this online, co-op is pointless and any server with random people just becomes a bad case of shoot-on-sight. That problem has killed plenty of open-world multiplayer survival games, there's no interaction between players, it just becomes a boring run of finding people named "Player" or random numbers and watching them shoot at you the second you come into vision. It's not fun and honestly just makes the multiplayer feel like a bad alternative to single player, but there's not much to do regardless.\n\nThe monsters are intimidating at first, but quickly become boring to come across, any threat is instantly nulled by a giant acknowledgement by your character that an enemy is nearby, and even then as long as you keep your distance it's hard to die, except when enemies spawn on top of you, this happened several times. I even returned to the site of my death to see if they could have come from anywhere, but unless enemies can fall from the sky they managed to simply spawn on top of me, killing me instantly with no time to react, I barely processed what happened, keep in mind this happened twice and it was outdoors, so I didn't just get jumped.\n\nThere is barely an aspect of survival, everything is easy unless you run into a player, monsters will only kill you if you ignore the warning signs and let them phase through, err, "break" through the wall to kill you. You can kill pretty much everything with how abundant ammo is, I never once had to resort to melee on smaller enemies. Enemies just kill you in one hit, blanking the screen out, which is, not very interesting but not bad I guess. The prospect of fear in this game was lost pretty quickly, as enemies became nothing more than small deterrents that were easily removed, and running into players just ended up with me trying to avoid them. So multiplayer just turns the game into a mediocre pvp freeforall with occasional monsters.\n\nThere really needs to be more content, even if this is an early access title, I've learned from experience that doesn't always mean it's going to get better. In it's current state, it's a rather empty singleplayer, or if you so choose, a topdown Rust, with all the PK intact.\n\nI'd like to see enemies be more threatening, the world be more populated and with reasons to survive, and have multiplayer improved, as right now it's abysmal to do anything online. Honestly the pvp adds nothing but nuisance.","February 26","false","3.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I hardly played it, but I did. Some people criticize games like The Stanley Parable for being a walking simulator, but this game really deserves that title. This is a game about walking in a straight line towards a glowy diamond on your hud while you get yelled at by text and walk past the slowest moving monsters in the universe. They present no threat unless you walk straight towards them and even if they do start to catch up, you can just shoot them with the very easily available weaponry. At one point not a few minutes after starting the game, it glitched out and the HUD disappeared and I almost felt like this was a step up because now I didn't have to look at the contrasting sprawling pixelized text across the middle of my screen between 2 characters that I don't care about. I almost fell asleep while playing. In the end, I died because I got bored and walked straight towards an enemy which it proceeded to instantly send me to a game over screen after touching me with no sound effects or anything. Not only is this game not scary in even the slightest amount, but it is also boring as all hell. Even multiplayer didn't fix this as half of it was us trying to find each other and the other half was walking in a straight line. If I wanted a non-threatening straight line journey that didn't require any engagement, I'd play American Truck Sim.\n\nTLDR; This game is boring and not scary. Story is forced and uninteresting.

The graphics and mood are really well done, but you also find your character bumping into invisible walls and boundaries at times, and the scratchiness of the overall look can make it tough to realize you're not actually moving anywhere for a second or two. Biggest problem is with combat though. the monsters are all giant, all invisible until they're within an inch or two of you, and all kill you instantly and permanently if they even lightly brush up against you. Right now I have a room full of like 7 corpses, all the weapons, a quest item, and one big monster. I re-spawn, go back to get the guns and quest items, and am instantly killed by the giant monster. How many shots would I have to get off to take it down? Have I even shot it yet? Have I even fired at it? the game's not entirely clear about any of that.\nIt's the first monster I've encountered. There don't appear to be any smaller ones, or way to test out how the gun works, if it works at all. There's a lot of uncertainty, like being partially blind and deaf, and absolutely zero learning curve.\nI've gone back at it for a half hour or so now because the atmosphere is so well done, but to be honest, I'm not an unintelligent person or an inexperienced gamer, but I have absolutely no idea if I'm making any progress or not, and that's a pretty serious design problem.

SteelRaven","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RaggedTBagged/","116 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nNoct is a very atmospheric game. For players who like a good scare here and then and a very dark mood, this would typically be the game for them. The reason I would not recommend this game to other is that I feel it is not developed enough to be worth the £7. I started the game with a set of instruction. I followed them for about 10 minutes, until I was told i'm on my own. Which was fine until I realised after minutes of roaming around there was nothing but the same building painted around the world with sparce supplies. I never saw a monster again (which I found quite scary) I then decided to play with others as it was a survival game. But to my surprise, there was only 2 servers available each with 2 players. What made it worse was I couldnt connect to the servers at all.\n\nNoct has potential to be a brilliant horror game! They definitely sets the mood. But thats all it is. Atmosphere. So until it gets developed further I believe it is not worth the money.","May 3","false","0.9"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/buttholecentral/recommended/330570/","buttholecentral","SpittingCamel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/buttholecentral/","157 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nLet me tell you a story.\n\nSome time ago, while purusing the internet and reading some "Top 10" articles, I stumbled upon a few games which peaked my interest. One of these games was NOCT. ♥♥♥♥ING NOCT. I cried at the thought of this game: a exploration and player-story driven drama where the odds are stakced against you, you are surrounded by unspeakably and realistcally scary monsters of immense variety who relentlessly haunt you in a sort of cat-and-mouse situation, each with different tactics, all under the veil of a deep and interesting backstory involving ancient monsters and sadness and hoplessness. A story of pure survival with a heaping helping of horror and open worldly goodness. THIS IS WHAT NOCT IS SUPPOSED TO BE.\n\nAs of right now NOCT is barely any of these things: the map is small, barren, the monster events grow old fast, and they are not nearly as dynamic as they were supposed to be. The game is very dark and has a boring landscape, and frustrating as all hell. Personally I think the implementation of the story is done very bad. IF you die during a mission, you have to go back to your body and recover your possessions, which is required if you want to progress in the game. Most of the times you will die from some huge monster, who will INSTANTLY spawn right next to you when you recover your items from your old dead body. This is immersion breaking and is downright annoying as every hit is a one-hit kill, so you must keep going back to your dead body over and over again, inching to the exit of the area and finally escaping the monster. I admit, this was my fault as I took a wrong exit in a building and found myself cornered. But it would be very helpful if the monsters at least spawned in their original location so I could actually move more than a few feet every time I recovered my possesions. And after the story is finished, you are left with the boring area that we have right now, which is only made fun in my opinion by multiplayer, although that crashes quite often.\n\nHOWEVER*******************************\n\nThis game is EARLY ACCESS, and I have no doubt in my mind that the creator, c3sk, is working diligently on all of the issues. He has stated that the game is near completion, and although it is very disapointing that the early access is, at the moment, the same thing as the beta, there is much more cut off area from the map which shows that the map is indeed very large, and hopefully popualted with more buildings. I have undying fate in the creator right now, and although I am contradicting all I said right now, it is becasue I love NOCT no matter what, and write the above portion as a fair warning to all others. NOCT will always hold a place in my heart as it brings back so many memories, and although i am disapointed, I realize that this is very early access and that MANY changes are to come. If you have been following NOCT as long as I have and wish to play it, then by all means, but it. But If you are hesitating and have only recently found this game, I suggest waiting a few more months before more content is added.\n\n\nI also would lime to say that c3sk is the most active and passionate game creator i've met; he has responded to almost everyone's posts, has actually implemented things throughtout the development that we've suggested, and continues to do so and obiously plans on keeping up with us. He has been very patient and kind with everybody and I would like for him to get some recogntion for this. Keep up the good fight, c3sk.\n\n-Connor","October 23, 2015","true","12.8"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

The original visual concept is interesting and the initial part with going around following the objective and killing few monsters while managing weapons and supplies (sort of) made me believe the game was done right  and then, that's it no more special objectives or tasks to do... Only one: SURVIVE!\n\nFor real?  So here you are with nothing else to do than just walking around to look for stuff and potential survivors (assuming  you can connect to a server, I did not succeed so far but yeah it is in early access so no finger pointing on that)... And you realize 5 min later besides the great atmosphere the game had during what seems to be a tutorial, the game has nothing else to offer and just walking around in some virtual world (even supposedly scary) becomes  pretty much boring really really really fast especially when you have to look for monster to kill).\n\nIt's in early access and at the moment, the game to me does not look like a game... It's just a big sandbox where you pretty much have nothing to do because there are not enough interactions or good task to accomplish.  I really hope the developer will greatly enhance this game adding more mission and other campaign stuff but this early access is the bulk of the game, don't go for it, there are better game in the same genre out there like subterrain.\n","April 28","false","0.6"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"
