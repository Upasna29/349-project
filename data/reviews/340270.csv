The world has lost its force, in the physical sense of the word, and it has halted any progression save for the player, and a rather major antagonist. This is where TIMEframe sets off.\n\nThere is this direct punch to the game that is very powerful. It hits the right notes with its initial choice of music and spawn-point. Before you there is a giant sun glaring at you, signifying cleverly the player's path forward. This in tandem with the music that is constituted by this bright powerful guitar strums and finger-picking with some nice alternative tunings (I assume). And once you step out of the edifice you spawned in, it becomes overwhelmingly beautiful. Direct comparisons would lead to Journey, only without the fluidity and particle effects, which makes sense due to the time-flux problematic we have at hand. But aesthetically there is this similar orange hew filling the screen, but in a darker, more abrasive way. It is not as soft as Journey, and following the lines of this jaggedness, there are bare polygons, but they themselves create a mosaic image of different shades of dust and desert. It is not as soft, but still beautiful enough to warrant a response of some kind. Slightly reminiscent of something like Shelter, although a bit more subtle.\n\nFollowing the Journey comparison, there is also a vastness of space, seemingly unimportant considering time is stood still, but for the player the vast is still vast. Journey combated this with an incredible movement system, with sand being sweetly pushed aside by the fluidity of your garment. In TIMEframe we have a slightly less satisfying way to move forward, making the vast feel like a hindrance, instead of a joyous sign of there being a lot to explore. Even with the slight drudgery that accompanies moving through the spatial, the atmosphere makes up for it. You start feeling like you're not that far away, and there are always things to look at that distract you from the menial process of getting there. The sky seems like a dome of fire that, even though static, feels vibrant.\n\nTIMEframe gives you a time-frame within which you are supposed to explore. The idea is to explore. The game gives you a lot more to explore than mere buildings or statues. It accompanies each finding with a text, each one filling the game with more and more – not only content, that I imagine you're interested in – but with a sort of depth. Ruins do not merely mean tourist attraction, or “exploration”, as the game had written it is much more: “Memories lost to death streams can sometimes be revealed through stone”. It is rare I feel a strong need to quote a game. Or a game that with its mechanics and aesthetic, with its concept, signify an idea much greater than its medium. Everything is connected in TIMEframe, you are playing through a thought out game, a concept realized.\n\nFor what TIMEframe sets out to do is fantastic. Its selected writings and setting symbolizes something very special. Something I've had trouble with articulating succinctly. Annihilation is inevitable, impermanence is a fact, and before its imminent strike, there are things to explore, a world to live through and with, and a past world all the same. This game reads like a love-letter to the history of ideas and lost civilizations that with a direct causal link built ours. There are multiple philosophical ideas, mostly existential, that are tackled in this game, all that are bound to at least evoke some type of reaction in the player. Attempts have been made to create a philosophically inscribed game, but it has often failed due to either being far too pretentious or far too insecure in its elucidation of the concepts themselves, either through text or aesthetics – or mechanics! TIMEframe hits a balance, despite not being the most graphically advanced or aesthetically out there, it follows a theme and it does it very well.\n\nI expected a minimalist exploration game, but I found something almost incredible. This is a game that actually deals with the looming threat of death. It deals with surrendering, with acquiescence, with the rationalist defeat against the overwhelming cruelty of nature. Mind does not defeat matter. Memory and mind, dies with the death of the stream, mind and memory dies with you. The they-self, as Heidegger put it, and the equivalence of Flesh, as Francis Bacon put it, both realize, along with this game, the sadness and destructive force of the world. Stones lives on, memories do not. Artifacts are preserved, humans wither away, humans become dust. And that dust is you. The message is strong enough for revivalists to abandon their practice.\n\nIt's an effective game. The musical cues are on point, soft acoustic goes into orchestral at the right moments, and uses ambient atmospheric music equally as effectively. This adds to making new places and new texts more digestible, more evocative. Musically, the game has a backbone, something that props up everything and elevates it to what it is, as compared to what it otherwise could have been without its context: unimportant, ambiguous or pointless. It is manipulative, sure, but not without merit, not without substituting the being manipulated part with being given actual substance. Nothing is unimportant, nor pointless, albeit slightly ambiguous, but in a mysterious way that stimulates the mind to associate and grasp the abstract and drag it down to the concrete.\n\nIn a way this is an anti-game. It slows down time, it removes the ADHD-like propensity towards fast action and movement, it slows the player down as well, and it gives room to think and reflect. At the same time, however, there is an immense agency to the game, a nagging stress, much akin to the one we feel in real life before death, that begs the player to accomplish, to accomplish and accomplish, before his or her doom. Will you have time to do everything you want to do in life? If the game is the ruler: no. But within the theme of the game things remain, topological and intellectual traces exist and carry on. Here I part ways with the game philosophically, but it does not mean I do not appreciate what it attempts to confer upon the rest of us.\n\nA part of me feels that TIMEframe is open enough for people, both in the way they play and think, to create their own meaning. In minor ways, perhaps, as the general themes are glaringly obvious, but still with a great deal of satisfaction.\n\nI would wholeheartedly recommend TIMEframe. It is humbling, as you weep before your great annihilation, that you are painfully aware of, to be faced with ideas like this, in a medium like this: it makes me happy. It is a good experience, with wonderful expression of concepts and with an intriguing story to boot. Not everything is clear, but it becomes clear as you envelope yourself in this world. You will not regret trying it, buying it; at least I didn't.","July 7, 2015","true","2.3"," 58 of 70 people (83%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","83","58","70","8","1"

It is round, it hangs in empty space like a little diamond; I am eternal.”\n― Jean-Paul Sartre, The Age of Reason\n\nI've seen some screenshots a month back or so, and decided to give this one a try. I knew nothing about the game, neither about the story. Only that the game had some really beautiful graphics. It is hard to spare the spoiler from the objective gameplay for TIMEframe - as in case of interpreting commemorative art - so forgive me if I'll spill some beans for you. My experience started a bit frustrating, and progressed to become bittersweet. In the end, I am glad that I gave this one a go, but I'll advice to buy it on sale nonetheless.\n\nTIMEframe is a contemplation on life, death, memory and civilization rather than an actual game. Gameplaywise, it is a walking simulator. You start standing within a grand spire, on an ancient valley. The time has become static: it functions on a considerably slow pace. Everything moves in a gentle, lingering motion that creates the particle effect on everything. Only our movement stays outside of this static. We walk within the valley, to discover more about the civilization that resides in this state, visit ancient landmarks and artifacts to learn our fate.\n\nWe are soon to discover that we are stuck in a time loop that recreates the last 10 seconds of this valley in a 10 minute timeframe. Thus, the name of the game. After every 10 minutes of gameplay, the valley resets and we start at the spire yet again. It is our goal to visit each and every landmark to collect records of several factions before the unavoidable end comes: a meteor. Who are we to begin with? Well, I'll leave that to your interpretation.\n\nOkay, I didn't mention anything aside the game's own description, did I? Nice. Back to the review then. I should say graphics are really beautiful. Particle effects are a fitting choice to create a most impressive atmosphere, supported by the most beautiful soundtrack that I've encountered for the passing months. As the time progresses and the inevitable approaches, the music changes to indicate the unavoidable. It creates a bittersweet mood for you to be engulfed in.\n\nBesides the beautiful graphics and music, the philosophy of the game is a plus. The whole idea of a time loop in a civilization that is to be destroyed is a great idea. But the anecdotal notes and records that you gather in landscapes are not enough to portray a full picture. They present some ambiguous clues about the identity and the approach of different factions towards the disaster with hard felt emotions, but there is not much to the story. Our findings are incredibly vague, and the setting actually doesn't aim to tell a story. It is a lingering emotion of unavoidable death and the fleeting nature of life itself. You are stuck on this majestic emotion and invited to acknowledge your mortality over and over again.\n\nBasically nothing is explained in the game: not the goal, neither the issue, nor the reason of this particular state. I've come the grasp the gameplay only after reading a review or two. The records that we find refer to some past lore, but don't reveal any kind of actual information. No puzzles. No story consistency. No timeline of events to assemble. As I've stated before: this is the triumphant display of an emotion rather than a game.\n\nI liked the experience very much, yet felt a bit cheated at the end. With some more spare time, some puzzles and recorded entries added, TIMEframe could have been one great game. In its current state, it is an hour of commemorative art, and the price of the game is a bit steep for that purpose. I'll give an upvote for the idea and the display, with strong advice for you to fetch it and enjoy only when it’s on sale.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","September 15, 2015","true","2.5"," 38 of 41 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","38","41","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheIronicGamer/recommended/340270/","TheIronicGamer","TheIronicGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheIronicGamer/","1545 products in account","I have sat by and watched the games media criticize games like "gone home" and "dear esther" for not being games. This has always really bugged me. I for one loved those games and thoroughly enjoyed playing them. But I now understand what games critics say when they call something "not a game". TIMEframe is an "experience", not a game. To me what makes the prior ones games and not this one is the fact that you actually feel like you are achieving something, even if in reality you aren't.\n\nIn the likes of gone home you do similar to TIMEframe were you just walk about and collect items that give you information. The difference with gone home is that these items give you a sense of a story. So when collecting these items you are doing it for a reason and are discovering new things in the process. But in TIMEframe the locations you have to discover give you only a short note. The notes don't have much relation to each other and aren't interesting to read. I didn't feel any anticipation for what would lie at the next location.\n\nSo the steam description mentions that the world is in slow motion. How exactly does this affect my gameplay? The answer is that it doesn't. This is what I found most intriguing when looking into this game. But it has basically no input in the game aside from making it look good. Some items in the world that would usually be moving instead are moving in extremely slow motion. I have to admit they did look nice in this style but I was hoping slow motion would be a mechanic in the game that I would be able to use to my advantage.\n\nBut what is the goal of the game? There are 14 different iconic locations scattered around the map. Your goal is to go to each of the locations. When you reach each of the locations you get a short extract to read. This seems simple enough right? The problem is the game seems to try to hinder your process every 10 minutes. There is a meteor that is coming down on the world in slow motion. After 10 minutes it hits, the screen goes white and you are teleported back to the beginning to go and explore again. I personally would have preferred it if I had the option to teleport back to the start whenever I wanted instead of having it forcably put upon me all the time.\n\nA lot of flaws I would have been able to ignore if it was for one thing. Did I learn anything? I assumed that these extracts would help me learn something about the era the game was meant to be set in. They didn't. Although some of the extracts may have been telling me about the culture or such I wouldn't have had a clue if they were. The text was written in such gobblygoop that I couldn't follow it or have any idea what was going on.\n\nOk so there is one thing to praise in this experience. The graphics are incredible, to an extent. From a distance the world does look absolutely beatiful. The developers chose to create the game in a very pretty styilized way that definitely adds to the experience in a great way. The particle effects are also really nice looking and create a bit of an atmosphere. But from close up the graphics aren't as appealing. They are very unconsistent on small details. The plants and grass is something that I feel doesn't fit the rest of the graphics style and just put's me out of the experience a bit. So the graphics are great from a distance but not so nice from up close.\n\nWhat about from a technical standpoint? The game runs absolutely fine. I had pretty much a constant 60fps throughout and experienced no issues with gameplay. But there is one major problem. There is a very large amount of popin. You can clearly see small items such as grass and rocks popping in from a very short distance away as you explore. This is another thing that slightly ruins the experience for me.\n\nSo who should buy this game? Certainly not anyone with the same views as me. I personally don't see any fun in playing this game. But as you can see from other reviews there are plenty of people that aparently enjoy it. It's just not for me. If you enjoy just walking about and exploring and experiencing a beatiful atmosphere at the same time then this is definitely for you.\n\nHow reasonable is the price? I completed everything there was to see in the game within 50 minutes. This isn't a huge amount of time to find everything. I also got all of the achievements. To me the price of £5.59 sounds a little bit steep for the amount of content actually present in it. Especially since I didn't actually enjoy the experience. If you are still interested, even after everything i've said, then I would say wait for a sale of at least 50% off to buy it and try it out.\n\nTheIronicGamers rating system Don't ever buy this game.\nMaybe consider it on a sale.\nAn average game.\nA good game that should definitely be considered.\nA must play!\nDisclaimer: I was provided with a free review key for the developer to make this review.","July 8, 2015","false","2.5"," 61 of 86 people (71%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","71","61","86","8","9"

The game is a short experience, and a pretty one at that. If you like those type of walking simulators, then this will be a treat for you.\n\nThe entire game plays in one big open area. A civilization on the brink of being smashed to pieces by a giant meteor. you have 10 seconds to explore the world. Luckily those 10 seconds have been slowed down to 10 minutes. Everything in the world goes in slow motion except you the player. It's beautiful to see the water flowing slowly from a dam or fountain, flags waving very slow in the city or leaves falling from a tree.\n\nThe goal of the game is to explorer 14 locations in the world. each of these locations will give you some scripture about the history of the place you are in and what is happening. Other then your map that give some indication on where each location is, it is up to you to explorer them all. Each time the meteor hits, the screen will turn white and puts you back at the beginning. But it saves the progress of each explored location. Once you visited all locations a new location will pop up on your map for the ending.\n\nThink overall while the game is pretty short, it does capture a beautiful place and story. This is being brought together by a beautiful soundtrack that really gets you in the moment. I personally thought it was well worth the 8 bucks they asked for it, if your on the fence, i would wait for a sale, otherwise i would suggest you pick it up.","July 10, 2015","true","0.9"," 27 of 32 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","27","32","0","3"

This game most assuredly has both of those.  The developers made a very interesting and unconventional decision when they chose to give the world you inhabit (for all of ten minutes) a mosaic-like quality, but what can I say...it works.  For what it sets out to do, pretty much EVERYTHING about this game works.  Is it "challenging"?  No.  It's not meant to be.  Is it "long"?  Well, from what I can tell thus far, it may indeed have quite a bit of replayability as there's a sufficiently large landscape to explore, and quite a number of achievements to unlock, but quite how many hours of value you'll get for your whopping great eight-dollar investment I can't yet rightly say.\n\nAs long as you have some idea what you're buying, you shouldn't have much to complain about.  It's a "walking simulator"...NOT CALL OF ♥♥♥♥ING DUTY.  If you want to shoot guns and snipe enemies from afar, you've come to the wrong place.  If you're happy to wander around a surreal, serene landscape for ten minutes then witness the end of the world, you just might get a little more out of it.  It's NICE, okay?  (In a, er, semi-nihilistic, apocalyptic kinda way.)  Between this and the recent Australian film These Final Hours, I can safely say that I now feel perfectly at peace with the notion of Armageddon.\n\nYou know what this is?  It's a thing of extraordinary beauty.  Simple as that.  A work of art.  Think of it as an excellent "tech demo" with a strong aesthetic and a THEME.  Something which most of the more fully-fledged "games" out there tend to lack in, in other words.  Definitely not one for the "speed runners", but the more open-minded and open-hearted among us might even find ourselves MOVED, dare I say, even if only for ten minutes or so.\n\nVerdict: 9/10.","July 7, 2015","true","0.9"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","0"

I've walked in on the last 10 seconds before oblivion.  Walked through their fields of flowers, wandered into their abandoned city and stood in surprise of the beauty that is fated to die.  Just before a civilization disappears those moments are stretched out longer for me to seek the meanings and understand the hearts of those who are about to pass away.  TIMEframe is an epitaph of a world, yet more than that.  It shares with me the gentle strength of a brave civilization coming to terms with death on their horizon.\n\nIf you are fond of reading plaques about the history of a location, or find yourself more apt to explore a game world than play in it , this game may suit you well.  Gameplay consists of you walking, exploring, and discovering inscribed objects  that reward you with excerpts from the past of  their culture.  Some are of religions explaining the coming apocolypse.  Others are of wisdom, factual explanations,  or comforting poems.  Most all of them show a culture that knows an immenent disaster is about to end all that they have.  What comes through all these searches for the backstory is an honest account of how these people felt as they came to acknowledge and accept their fate.\n\nThere are no puzzles, no fights, no solving, no true storyline or anything. You walk, enjoy the world around you and learn about them all within a short amount of time before the "Nomad" meteor crashes and destroys them all in a white flash. Then you repeat the process until you have completed a map that guides you to those epitaphs.  There is an ending as well. Personally, I think anything else would not reflect the mood of the game.  And it strikes a chord.  Maybe it's because I've seen loved ones gather this same calmness before they pass.  Or perhaps because I myself have faced dire situations and understand what it to find that inner calmness.  The humanity of this game is quite a surprise.\n\nGraphically, it's beautiful in a very artistic polygon style without being a highly detailed landscape. Completion time took about 1 hr give or take and gameplay was a smooth 60FPS on my modest system. I also used the xbox 360 controller for the entire game with zero issues.  The music is relaxing to most, unless you are not fond of gentle music with some acoustic guitar.  For me, it was a wonderful way to unwind after playing something adrenaline pumping.   If you like exploring walking "simulator" games with beautiful scenery and enjoy reading excerpts of history through a game, this is a decent choice.  I will say it's rather short and there is no actual storyline or gameplay per se, which may not appeal to all types.\n\nThanks to Gamerquest for the game giveaway on her stream!","September 29, 2015","true","2.8"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

Now imagine that there is a comet, or perhaps it is simply a prophetic encounter that seems to have occurred, and that you will experience this event as well.\n\nIn TIMEframe, you are not going to be running around, talking to people, you are going to be take a soft music journey to uncover what was hidden about these 12 wonders, and perhaps unlock the power of an object left in this world. There is one catch, however, and that is that you shall find yourself constantly returning to the spire, which is where your story begins, but have no fear, the actions that you take in those 10 minute increments will be retained.\n\nOne of the ways that you will know that time is almost up is hidden in the music, now you might not catch it the first couple of times but it will be the harbinger of your position in the world resetting. In so regards this can be a good thing, mainly because it is possible to get lost in the world, and to restart back in a centralized point, can get you back on the correct path that you need to be on.\n\nYou will find that by pressing the Spacebar you will reveal many dots on the screen laid out in an infinity pattern. You'll also notice that if you successfully reach one of the wonders in this world that that dot will change into a symbol. If you unlock all the symbols you will be able to progress the game into the ending.\n\nI'm going to be totally honest with you, when I first heard about this game I was told it was in the same vein as Dear Ester, and in a way it is, but it also isn't. Dear Ester seemed more like a guided tour, this game at times seems like a blind journey. Now that's not saying that this game is lacking something, but it does take a little bit of time to get used to, and it also takes patience, ESPECIALLY since you might find yourself within a stone's throw of a wonder, and the special music is playing, and you know that you're not going to make it before the world resets again.\n\nThat can be frustrating, and to add to matters you are going to be walking the entire time, there is no run or speed walk button, you are going to be taking in the sights, you are going to be walking through this little window in time, and although at first I didn't know if I was going to be able to hang with this game, I've got to admit that once I accepted the reset, and the natural pace, I got hooked into wanting to see what would happen when I visited all the wonders.\n\nThis is definitely not a game for everyone, but this is a kind of meditative game that one can definitely lose time in. I do kind of wish that when you interacted with the wonders, and you got that small quote or bit of history that it was spoken in some kind of interesting accent, but at the same time I don't know if that would actually end up hurting the experience, either way this is something that in the end I enjoyed, and to be honest part of me was a little same to see the credits roll, of course there was a part of me as well that felt a great deal of accomplishment after finally seeing this game all the way through.

Your role, can be as trivial, or as important as you can imagine it to be.\n\nIt’s not often that a world so small, can feel so massive. This world, frozen into a trickle of time, flames slowly licking the air, flowers slowly spinning in the air and water falling slowly. It tells a story of The Nomad, which for sake of the story itself I won’t tell anything about. The first time I played, I didn’t know what would happen. Then there was a moment of realization. It takes you on a journey through this world, but you’re in control of how you get there.\n\nI found myself often exploring just to get another screenshot, one more picture for the library. There is a dream-like quality to the game, and it’s a great dream to have because of the beauty. It’s not about the end, but how you get to that point.\n\nThis can be  a small, short game, or it can last you days. How much time you want to put forth is your decision.  Is this a game I would recommend, yes. If only to support these artists in their work, and to have something, an experience to show your friends when they come over, because after having finished this game, that’s what it was.

I was expecting a walking simulator based around the concept of exploring a forgotten world. But there's this mechanic that gets introduced, and I don't want to spoil it, but the emotions that is conveyed when it first happen were so vivid and real- it was amazing. It's an exploration game with, and in all my years of gaming, has one of the most endearing and interesting mechanics with beauty in its simplicity. I've already said too much, please, go play it.\n\n\nSPOILER\n\nThe idea is Impermanence. It flips the whole walking simulator / exploration genre on its head. I fully expected to explore the world looking for hidden secrets. In fact, I was kind of upset at the inclusion of this abstract map because I thought it hindered exploration. But as I neared the first landmark a twang of an acoustic guitar picked up and a subtle pacing began. I explored the landmark, checked out the plants growing, and was scaling up this hill when I was admiring this unique mosaic-esque art style the game has. Then I looked up and saw IT. A giant meteor seemingly breaking through the world leaving shattered pieces of the sky trailing behind it. I stood in marvel as it came closer and closer. I felt completely helpless and isolated, but endlessly intrigued. And then the screen faded to white...only to reapear at the beginning of the game.\n\nYou see, here's the catch: you're expected to explore as much as you can of this world within a ten minute limute (or 10 seconds slowed down as the description says). That's why you have the inclusion of the map. Each "cycle" (as you later discover) has you frantically searching the different landmarks. And it creates this atmosphere of beautiful impermanence. I WANT to explore everything here, the setpieces are beautiful and evoke a sadness of a recently deceased civilization. But I can't explore everything...not with doom lingering overhead. You'll start running to land marks finding the text each one boasts piecing the story together all while looking over your shoulder at the, at first, blank sky that evolves into a dot, a circle, and a meteor crashing through.\n\nIt's wonderously exerimental and, sorry to use the term, a bit avant-garde for this new genre of walking simlutaors. It shows what can really be done with them and the themes and emotions they can convey. The ending of the first cycle is one of my favorite video game moments in recent history, and the game became even more engaging afterwards.","August 14, 2015","true","1.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

You aren't really told anything when you start and you have no clue as to what to do or where to go.\n\nOnce you start exploring the planet you soon begin to realise that the game involves walking around the landscape and investigating the various buildings, statues and points of interest. Every time you reach a new landmark you will get an achievement. There are 14 places of interest to visit and you don't have to pay admission to get into any of them. Each time a place is visited a very short story is told via text which gradually unravels the storyline.\n\nI would recommend this game but it is easily completed to 100% in 2 hours and there isn't much to do apart from walk around and look at interesting objects and buildings. What makes this game enjoyable is the atmosphere and music in my opinion. The story is a bit minimal but the whole game shrieks minimal and sometimes its nice to be entertained for a couple of hours rather than wade through a 145 hour game. If you like walking simulators and enjoy a quick, relaxed and atmospheric game then I would buy this on sale.\n\nRating:\n7.0/10\n\nPros:\nAtmospheric and relaxing with great music\nQuick but entertaining\n100 Easy Achievements\nCons:  Maybe a bit over priced\nStory is a bit minimalistic\nExperienced crashes of the game when artefacts were found\nHardware Information\nHardware Type   Monitor LG IPS LED FLATRON IPS234   Headphones Turtle Beach Earforce X12   Keyboard Corsair Raptor K40   Controller Microsoft Xbox 360   Mouse Trust GXT 25   Microphone Turtle Beach Earforce X12   Motherboard ASRock Z97 Extreme 6   CPU QuadCore Intel Core i7-4790K 4400 MHz 44 x 100   GPU Gigabyte GeForce GTX 760   RAM 16GB   OS Windows 81   HDD Crucial M550 512GB SSD\nDisclaimer:\n","May 15","true","3.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The world is very atmospheric, albeit I wish it was a bit more detailed.\n\nI've spent around an hour on one playthrough and it was well worth my time.

Also, this essay is a critique, not a review. Please note that I gave the game a positive review!\n\nGames are so far not a great narrative medium.\n\nThere are, however, great examples of narrative/poetic work in games. Dear Esther, e.g., offers insight into the depths of game symbolism, while Gone Home points at the potential for environmental storytelling — yet it’s important to recognize that these approaches are only in their infancy. We don’t understand them very well, although we’re learning. Other examples of narrative cultivation can be found in games like Her Story, Braid, and Portal — and you can see intimations of success in games like TIMEframe.\n\nTo choose just one: Her Story is perhaps best characterized as a game unto itself, an experience carved into a new region of the gamespace. It pushes the boundaries of gaming in a new direction, from its complicated fracturing of narrative, to its (almost) unfamiliar use of the “unreliable narrator” — Her Story is a deep game, made with big intentions. As an indie gamer, this is an exciting time. Successful videogames are starting to try the models of mainstream entertainment and push the medium toward something more colorful and honest. Like photography grappling with Shore’s oeuvre, the games industry is beginning to look more alive.\n\nSo how does TIMEframe figure into this narrative? Well — it doesn’t. Not really. TIMEframe feels more like an ersatz copy of Dear Esther and less like the result of deep work.\n\nDon’t get me wrong: — Aesthetically, TIMEframe is striking. Its polygonal style recalls old classics like Super Mario 64 and Final Fantasy VII (though the effect, I think, results more from texturing); its soundtrack plucks and soars at the right times, and not with undue majesty; and the environments one finds are, intermittently, fascinating (a town lies in a valley, its banners moving coldly, or there’s a statue of a man facing disaster with unerring courage). But these details unfold and merge with the same meandering that punctuates the work, and by the time the whole thing comes together, you feel — not edified — but cheated: Where is the substance? What am I supposed to take from this?\n\nOne big problem is that TIMEframe’s universe feels neither lived-in or abandoned. What might have been a sprawling, gorgeous empire presents, instead, as a desert — and a mostly hilly one at that. What buildings there are, scattered miles apart, feel isolated, inhuman, unlivable. In the game’s only town, there are no doors, no exits. Signs of shops and playgrounds of any sort have been scrubbed, and the way certain buildings merge with the earth is outright distracting. While some of these elements might be acceptable, it’s the confluence of them that lends TIMEframe its dream-like unreality. Be honest: What civilization would build itself this way?\n\n[It’s also worth noting that TIMEframe positions you, the player, as the last observer of this doomed civilization — but the substance of the narrative does not flesh out this civilization, its culture, or the people who lived there. You learn one thing from something like 14 different pieces of text: Whoever these people were, however they lived, they were obsessed with death (and the impending meteor). So you have to ask yourself: “Why should I care?” Nothing here feels believable or grounded. Instead, TIMEframe favors a mediocrely-wrought philosophical romp to real narrative and believability. And that’s unfortunate.]\n\nThe end result of TIMEframe’s frequently unthoughtful design is not miserable or in any way worse than decent. In fact, TIMEframe is pleasant in the way of summer days in the park. But that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t be critical. If constant walking, a dearth of game mechanics, and a paucity of real substance and information feels like weakness, we should say that — and I’m going to say that: TIMEframe is, quite simply, too simple. It glances toward complication and deeper meaning but falls far short of that target — and the resulting game, while pleasant, is indicative of greater, more unique and powerful experiences. TIMEframe is simply a reminder of games which did it better . . .\n\nBut that doesn’t mean it’s not important; because TIMEframe marks the beginning of a trend toward deeper work in videogames. Yes, Her Story, Braid, Portal, Dear Esther, etc. did it better, and those games are better games (Note: They took much longer to make), but they feel too individual and scattered to summarize the indie market. With TIMEframe, and conscientious games like it, we as indie gamers are finally seeing the effect of these powerful, towering works and the influence they can have on the gaming industry. TIMEframe is in no way the beacon it was intended to be, but as a rallying force for better, truer experiences, you couldn’t ask for kinder encouragement.","July 18, 2015","true","1.1"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","45","5","11","2","3"

I think it could have been much better if the meteor actually impacted, rather than the entire area fading to white when it was still a good thirty seconds away from the ground.  Terrain deformation and shrapnel would add a lot; although there are a lot of mysteriously broken things scattered around, falling in slow mo.  It could be that this is meant to represent an air burst; if so it would've been nice to see shrapnel from the meteor flying everywhere rather than the aforementioned white screen.\n\nIt also would be better if I could figure out a run button, or if the interesting sites in this place were less far apart.  And possibly more numerous.  Though I do like the texts that are scattered here and there.  Opening the main menu also does not pause the game, so there's no way to halt the meteor for a minute while you answer the phone or the door.

Then a meteor from outerspace will destroy the world you're in and you start over again and you can explore over again.\n\nIt was a very relaxing game to play, the music was very nice and for the most part the world was beautiful, everything except for the plant life, the plant life had worse textures than Minecraft, I don't care if it was "Meant to be that way", it wasn't any nice to look at.\n\nObviously as it's stated in the game description, this is a very short exploration game.\n\nWhat you do in this game is you simply walk and explore 14 different artifacts, that's about it.\nThere's also and ending to the game, nothing special.\nThe game has a very relaxing atomsphere, the artstyle is very stylized.\n\nThe soundtrack is amazing but.. not that big, length wise. I bet the developers could've put 2 or 3 more songs in there to make it a little less repetitive to listen to while you play.\n\nThis game is very short, I completed it in ~50 minutes then I spent another 10 minutes taking some extra screenshots and the rest was AFK'ing for Trading Cards.\n\nAll of this is obvious though, you're told everything before you buy this game, that it's a short casual exploration walking simulator. You either love these games or you hate them. So don't buy it if you hate this sort of game. It's very simple.\n\nThe price on this game is pretty reasonable in my opinion, but to be fair I am a walking simulator fanatic so it might not be worth it in your opinion if you're not a die hard fan of walking simulators.\nConsider it on a sale if you're not a huge fan of walking simulators.\n\n*A must buy for any achievement completionist, this game is an easy target for 100% achievements.\n\n","April 7","true","3.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

If you like the "beautiful silent experience" type of games, you should definitely consider picking it up on sale, as 8€ is a bit expensive for 1 hour of content with no replayability.\nPersonally, it was a nice spiritual break in the usual action packed games.\n\nWeaker machines beware, the game is poorly optimized (3 days after release at the moment) and you will likely have to run at lower settings.

The graphics are wonderful, and the ambiance of the world is quite appealing. I enjoyed the writing style of the different clues left around, and piecing together what they informed me about the culture was a fun intellectual exercise. I would highly recommend this game, although I imagine it's not for everyone. Some may complain it's not a "game" and I won't quibble about definitions. To me, this is a piece of art that is well worth the money and time it takes to experience. It transported me out of my own world and into another for an hour-and-a-half, and I was thoroughly entertained and engaged the entire time. The only complaint I have is that to me the ending seemed a little ambiguous, and I would have enjoyed a few more answers after completing the quest. In any case, my congratulations to the devs for their work on TIMEframe, and I am highly anticipating future releases from Random Seed Games.","July 14, 2015","true","1.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I'm not playing on a high end computer, so I lowered the graphics settings so that it would run smoother. Every time the 10 minutes reset, so did the graphics settings. All the other game options stayed, but the graphics reset to the highest settings every time.\n2. There's controller support, which is a plus, but even with the look sensitivity all the way up, looking around is slower with a controller than a mouse at half sensitivity.\n3. You have to visit 14 different locations to finish the game. Every 10 minutes the game resets the setting and your position (but not your progress). This makes sense given the setting of the world, but you move so slowly that I was never able to visit more than 4 locations in one 10-minute cycle. And the world is so big compared to your walking speed, it feels like you're spending most of the time walking in a straight line towards your next location. It's about 3 minutes of holding W (or forwards on a controller). Very boring.\n4. There is no way to pause the game and read the artifacts you find. When you find them, their text pops up, but the world keeps (slowly) going. When you open the menu (where you can read the artifacts as well as change game settings), the world keeps going. And once you beat the game, your progress is automatically reset so you can't take your time and read them then either.\n\nAll that said, it was a nice game and I would definitely recommend people play it once, if they can get it cheap. It's pretty much a one-and-done game.","January 1","true","1.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I'm not really going to do that here because honestly, I can't see myself spending more time writing about it than I did playing it. Plus I'm not that deep of a thinker.\n\nIt's a very pretty game, very stylized with a sort of triangular texture applied to everything. The soundtrack is simple but effective, becoming more elaborate with every new discovery. Basically, you're wandering through a landscape looking for various locations that will present you with a bit of text or information about the inhabitants that once lived in this area. By visiting all these areas you unlock the one last location on your map that implies where everybody went to escape the giant meteor that's getting ready to obliterate the world.\n\nYeah, that meteor. I hate that damned thing. After a few minutes you see it in the sky, getting closer every minutes until ten minutes have elapsed and the screen whites out, starting you back at the big tower in the center where you started. Thankfully your map still shows the locations you've visited so you can continue on your merry way, so it's not that huge of an obstacle. The reason I hate the meteor is because it turns a game that could be a relaxing contemplative exploration into a race against time to find the next location before you have to start over.\n\nStill, this is a damned nice game, worth the money and I can think of a hundred other worse ways to spend an hour. Admittedly I got the game for free for supporting the author's upcoming game Lacuna Passage but having played it I would have gladly paid for it.","July 25, 2015","true","1.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The Time Loop concept (read: you get zapped every 60 seconds or so and respawn and the start position) does prevent this game from being a walking simulator. Not that there is much to see, to begin with.  So you end up chasing from one land mark to the next, ticking them off with the clock runing. This is not my kind of fun.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/young_nacho/recommended/340270/","young_nacho","Young_Nacho","http://steamcommunity.com/id/young_nacho/","30 products in account","NON SPOILER\n\nThis game was very unique. But unfortunately, the main function of the game seems to be the thing that was wrong with it. The theme and atmosphere in the game was fantastic, and I really enjoyed this. I also really enjoyed uncovering a lost society and I think the artifacts and written passages were very well done. The concept of the game moving in slow motion is also a really cool game concept but it just wasnt used right here. The super slow pacing and the bothersome mechanic didnt help either and they kinda ruined it for me. I cant say I hated it though because the atmosphere and music were terrific, but I just cant give it a thumbs up. Its really dissapointing that this game wasnt better because it had a lot of potential to be very good. If you are super interested, Its still worth checking out if you want something different and don't mind the $8 price tag. Otherwise, just watch a video on it. 5.5/10\n\nSINCE THE GAME IS SHORT, EVERYTHING IS A SPOILER, SO LOTS OF SPOILERS BELOW.\n\n\nIn TIMEframe, you walk around and find ancient structures and relics from a lost world and every ten minutes, the meteor that destroyed the society comes and you restart from the first temple. While this is certainly unique, its just feels a bit unnecessary. The idea for the game is really intresting and it had a lot of promise, but it doesnt hold up in the end.\nThroughout your journey, you uncover clues about the ancient society and "The Nomad". Through the stories and clues, you can piece together that the society believes their ancient being/god is going to do something, and that their world may be coming to an end. You also can infer that "The Nomad" is a meteor coming to destroy their world. The way these clues are presented to you; through ancient artifacts and written passages by ancient scribes and scholars of the civilization, is really good. It helps you build a good sense of what this ancient world was like and how they acted towards the events of the unknown. The soundtrack was excellent and it really helped carry the mood. All in all the atmosphere was fantastic and I really did enjoy the calming, yet mysterious and slightly chilling atmosphere I felt in this game. The art style was really nice too and I enjoyed the polygon style graphics. Unfortunately, the other parts of the game REALLY took away from this.\n\nThis was a walker simulator to the point where it was too much of a walking simulator. All the things to discover were spread out way too far and it was nothing but walking through an open area in between each place. That was made even worse by the main premise of the game. The meteor crashing every 10 minutes was really just bothersome while playing. Especially when you could only discover about 3 places before you had to restart from the beginning. This grew very tiresome and made me start to lose interest. I also would have loved to explore some of the places a bit more but I didn't have time too because I only had 10 minutes to work. I also felt rushed to get through it, because I didn't want to spend forever starting from the beginning again. The meteor crashing also took away from some of the mystery of the game. Depending on what artifacts you found first, you may not have put it together that "The Nomad" was a meteor yet. But when it crashes after 10 minutes, you are pretty certain what "The Nomad" is. I feel the game should have had the meteor crash only once, at the end of the game. That way you could learn and infer things about the society throughout the game, and then see the true end of the society unfold with the meteor crashing down to end the game. This would have given you an answer, while still not blatantly telling you what happened so early on in the game. The game had promise but fell short and needed some changes in order for it to succeed.","May 22","false","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
