Yes, it can be a gruesome, unsavory, albeit cartoony, experience, and the game does push you to that end most of the time, but it can also be a open world game that allows you to explore a satirical world filled with both hilarious situations and expectations that speak volumes about paranoid, and in many ways complacent, mid-2000s America. In many ways, it shows how trivial the concerns of the time actually were in the grand scheme of things. Postal 2 needs to be given more credit for pushing the envelope for games; what was once considered taboo was torn apart and amplified in this game. Wholly recommended as an experience.","November 25, 2013","true","18.3"," 730 of 800 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","730","800","0","2"

The story takes place throughout one week. Each day you complete mundane tasks created by your nagging wife. As the days go on the town gets progressively worse with protestors, terrorists, and even the undead.\n\nGameplayGameplay consists of first-person shooting with a handful variety of armaments. The difficulty scales from Liebermode to Really ♥♥♥♥ing Hard. On harder difficulties, health items are instantly used on pick-up and civilians will attack on site. This game features secret weapons and ammo giving you an advantage on what's to come. There's a plethora of achievements each consisting of a reference like Loverboy's song Everybody's Working for the Weekend and Modern Family[en.wikipedia.org]. Even though this game was created  back in April 13, 2003, the game still gets weekly updates from glorious Running With Scissors, and still can beat today's 'next-gen' games.\n\nPros:Original Storyline\nComical murder\nStill gets updates\nMods\nAchievements\nReplay value\nCons:Combat kinda feels mundane\nSome glitches\nNo co-op campaign\nCan't kill Mike J enough\nSo, what are you waiting for?

The first game was a little too Columbine for my tastes, but when Postal 2 came out in '03, I think the series really came into its own, commercially and artistically. The whole game has a clear, crisp level of violence, and a new sheen of consumerate decadence that really gives the mindlessness a big boost. It's been compared to Manhunt, but I think Postal has a far more sarcastic, cynical sense of humor.\n\nIn '04, RWS released this, Apocalypse Weekend, their most insane content addon. I think their undisputed addition from this was the destruciton of Paradise, an ending so gratifying, most people don't pay attention to the message. But they should, because it's not just about the pleasures of destroying and moving on, and the importance of the post-Cold War era, it's also a personal statement about how Vince feels about the Middle East in general.\n\nHEY PAUL","October 1, 2014","true","35.8"," 189 of 210 people (90%) found this review helpful 46 people found this review funny","90","189","210","46","8"

I know this game for many years already and played definitely over 300 hours in it (DVD Version). And now it came to Steam. This is the best thing that could have ever happened to it. I updated this dated review a bit for higher quality standards and updated informations.\nAlso make sure to check out my little bit shorter Paradise Lost review.\n\nIts amazing how much work and heart the developers put into this game.\nIt still gets updates after 12 years of the actual release. Probably the longest supported game in history? Actually it wasnt updated for several years to be honest. It was actually quite around Postal for many years. Not even Postal 3 changed this fact, especially because it wasnt as good as the most people wanted it to be. It wasnt developed by RWS anyway. I think this game was ok but couldnt reach Postal 2 in any way.\nI personally do not recommend Postal 3 because its buggy and glitchy as hell.\nMaybe wait for some proper patches/mods one day...\n\nNow to the actual game review.\nIn Postal 2 you play as The Postal Dude. One of my favorite game characters of all time. A man living with his wife in a motorhome in the city Paradise.\nYou have to do normal things like buying stuff in the store or returning books to the mall. Or getting a christmas tree. Those sort of tasks you have to finish to progress in the game.\nBut this isnt often as easy as we would wish. The crazy city Paradise comes always into our ways. The police, protestors, priests, god*amn even Osama wants us dead. But we can defend ourself and attack back with several weapons. One of the biggest weapon collections ever seen in a game. This Steam versions has even more than the old DVD version. A lot of AWP and ED weapons has been added. Not all but many which doubles the fun. Pistols, shotgun, scissors to rocket launchers. We can also pee on everyone and everything. It was never easier to take a p*ss. Also the gore has been raised extremely. Now you have the same gore amount that was included in the addon Apocalypse Weekend, which is btw included. We can also grab our dog or cat to fight against the citizens but cats are mostly just useful to silence your guns. No, I'm not kidding. There are also other items ingame like "health pipes". Yeah, you know what I mean. In addition to that there are a lot of secrets and goodies ingame! The game is actually open world but with several levels that are only visitable to certain days. Yes the game has days. Monday to Sunday actually. The standard Postal 2 was Monday to Friday but the addon added Saturday and Sunday. You can play Monday to Friday or Saturday and Sunday or the whole week. Everything is possible when you start a new game. Oh and because we came to the start a new game part. There are so many difficulties! I cant remember such a big difficulty amount in any other game. No clue how many exactly there are but definitely over 10! Every of those difficulties offers a different game experience. From the people who hit you with shovels to people who shoot with rocket launchers at you and who are insulted already when you look at them. There is everything. I think that should be enough about the game itself.\n\nThe game also has a multiplayer but I think most here wont care for it anyway, its not much played.\nIts not horrible but kinda outdated, but no wonder. There are still sometimes a few players to find.\n\nThe game itself runs with the Unreal Engine 1.5 or 2 when im right. Some hybrid of it.\nSo it means that this game is dated. If you await nice fancy graphics, you are at the wrong address.\nBut the engine does what is should. It has also been updated with the latest patches released on Steam. Before Steam it was kinda unstable and crashed often. This problems are by now fixed.\nAlso Steamworks has been integrated. Also archievements and trading cards. Workshop exists now too. So everything that a actual game needs right?\nBut there are so many fixes and changes by now, that I cant even say them all.\nBest to check out the store page. Incredible work by the devs!\n\nWell, what else should I say.\nPostal 2 has nothing really to do with Postal 1, yes I played this also.\nIt was often criticized in the media and banned from a lot of countries due to its gore and black humor level. I really love the black humor of the game but it maybe doesnt hit everyones taste.\nI really feel the love the developers put into this game and Postal 2 is between my favorite games of all time. And this game list consists out of Crysis, Fallout etc. I often dare to think about Postal 2 being an Indie game, even if it is. I really love to see this game here on Steam. I bet it will never really die and also todays gamers will always have access to it. It is often on sale for a joke price so definitely a must have! By now there is even a new DLC which adds many hours of new gameplay. I will review this in a seperate review.\n\nPositives:\n- Big free roam map\n- Includes Apocalypse Weekend\n- Biggest amount of secrets ever\n- Unique in nearly every way\n- Great main character\n- Gary Coleman\n- Biggest arsenal of weapons ever\n- You can pee on everyone and everything\n- You can finish the game without any violence\n- GORE\n- Still support after 12 years\n- Many new features and fixes since Steam release\n- Osama is ALIVE\n- Realife Simulator!\n- Still working Multiplayer with a few players\n- New addon after 12 years, holy hell!\n- Steamworks integration, Workshop, MODS!\n- Best humor ever in a videogame\n- Eternal Damnation is going to be re-released for the game\n\nNegative:\n- Dated Graphics\n- Might not hit everyones taste\n\nReplayability: Very High\n\nMy score? 9.5/10\nMany people may dont understand this rating but thats just how it is.\nThis game really serves as a love letter to fans. I never recall any other developer to put so much work, especially after so many years, into a game.\nPostal 2 was between one of my first PC games, no crap.\nFor me this game is unique how it is and cant be compared to any other game.\nEven GTA is far away.\n\nAnd another part, I just felt like I have to add it...\nTHANK YOU Running With Scissors for making this amazing game for us.\nAnd even keeping up the support, releasing patches and even a whole new DLC!\nThis is simply so amazing. This is the reason why I think Running With Scissors is the best developer ever. No kidding. Nobody else puts so much work into a loved videogame franchise!\nIts stuff like that, that I would wish from other developers.\nThere are so many games by now that just wasted to dust and often doesnt even run properly anymore. I dont think it would be so hard to release hotfixes for them. But 90% of all devs dont do this.","October 14, 2014","true","59.4"," 173 of 208 people (83%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","83","173","208","9","2"

POSTAL 2 is a delightful sandbox FPS where the only real goal is to finish your daily To-Do Lists.\n\nNow, you CAN simply walk directly to the supermarket, pick up some milk, pay the cashier, and leave; OR you could slaughter your way there, steal the milk, kill everyone in the building, and then urinate on their corpses - it's 100% up to you. For the most part, the game's tagline is correct: "It's only as violent as you are," but there are definitely some parts of the game where you *have* to absolutely kill everything in sight to survive.\n\nOh also in the Apocalypse Weekend expansion you get to go Gallagher on some mad cows with a sledgehammer - definitely one of the best parts of the game, second only to the Tourettes Zombies.\n\nThis is a game that should be in EVERYONE'S library, because it's the perfect game for letting off some steam. ♥♥♥♥♥♥ day at the office?

And even though I should be disgusted by the potty humor and derogatory caricatures, I had a blast playing through it. Postal 2 just cries out for multiplayer, particularly when you can lay down a snaking path of gasoline for half a block and light it up; what a way to trap and kill your local or online friends! Alas, it's not there.I can take points away from the game for many things, but none of these things really detract from the fun that you can have with this game.

At the time of it's release there was no other game as politically incorrect, dark and downright disturbing as this and... I love it.\n\nAs an Australian it was even banned here until the R-18+ classification was granted for videogames so the only way to get it back then was to buy it off the Running With Scissors website, which I did and never regretted.\n\nPostal 2 is like a B grade movie that knows it's a B-grade movie, it's presentation is dodgy, the writing can use a lot of work but you just adore it anyway. It's humor is great if you like dark humor, it's a great sandbox and the game is even quite a challenge if you push yourself into the harder difficulties.\n\nThe gameplay is average.\nThe guns and gunplay are extremely poor.\nThe AI is either extremely stupid, or downright unfair.\nThe Graphics, even for it's time were weak.\nThe map design is lack-luster\nThe sound design and music is extremely average.\n\nDespite all this, Postal 2 is still one of the greatest games I've ever bloody played.\n\nAnd for the $10 steam is asking, you don't really have anything to lose.

This game was one of many others that parents all across the United States wanted banned so that their children wouldn't have their eyes spoiled by its horrific imagery. Now you can experience all of its excessive, abhorrent content on Steam.\n\nFirst of all let me say that this game is a personal favorite of mine. I had played it at a friend's place way back and loved it, but never had a chance to buy it. So when I saw that it was on Greenlight I thought 'Hey, why not?' and gave it an enthusiastic thumbs up. The day it released I bought it, pretty excited to experience it again nearly a decade later. I was not disappointed.\n\nThis game has aged considerably well, considering it was made in 2003. However, its age does show.\n\nPros:\n+The gameplay, controls, and combat are tight. Being how old this game is, there was no dime-a-dozen cover mechanics or regenerating health, so strafing, bunny-hopping, and repeatedly crouching up and down behind low cover while firing are some tactics that work. Reloading is for losers and newbies, so feel free to waste all three-hundred shots of your AR15.\n\n+The comedy of this game hasn't lost its humor. Being an over exaggerated parody of life in the United States during 2003, a lot of the jokes made still hold water to this day. Overbearing banks, corrupt priests, trigger-happy cops, stereotypical Islamic terrorists, religious cults, cannibals, ♥♥♥♥-y rednecks, people simply not giving a damn, the whole shebang viewed and commentated from the eyes of a sarcastic cynic just trying to get through a pretty hectic week.\n\n+Techincally, this game is pretty stable and has some interesting features. I haven't seen any game-breaking bugs, but I have had a crash or two. If you ever get stuck somewhere in the world (which is bound to happen considering it's a free-roaming sandbox) the game teleports you to a nearby spot free of charge. There are also some small pieces of unimportant mechanics that are superflorus but fun. Exploring around is rewarded with interesting to downright strange results. Attaching a cat to your barrel to suppress your weapon is a neat but useless feature. Placing a donut on the ground and taking a leak on it will have an interesting outcome. Speaking of which, this game still has the best urine physics I've ever seen in a game... oddly enough.\n\n+A large, open world to explore and wreak havoc in.\n\n+A multiplayer, though I don't know how active it is.\n\nCons:\n-The gameplay feels old. You've probably seen or played a game that had similar combat to this and that may be a downside to you. The gameplay isn't also 'realistic'. So no aiming down the sights or jelly on your face when you get shot.\n\n-The comedy of this game will turn off a lot of people, considering how carebear people have gotten on the internet lately. If you are easily offended by racial stereotypes, large amounts of cursing, ultraviolence, animal abuse, graphic vomitting and urination, homophobia, whatever, then this game is definitely not for you; stick to Gone Home, that will probably be more your speed.\n\n-Quite short, with a very simple story so if you are looking for a 'cinamatic adventure' you should probably look elsewhere.\n\nAll in all, I recommend this game if just for a single playthrough. You want a numbered score? 8/10.\n\nI regret nothing.","December 16, 2013","true","24.9"," 87 of 98 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","87","98","0","3"

It's a simulator of a worker who goes postal. That last statement is actually false. You can choose to go through the whole game WITHOUT going postal. So its more of a game of right or wrong.\n\nOther than that lets start the review.\n\nThis game is always being updated so don't worry about that. They usually release a update around a holiday such as halloween 2014. In the halloween 2014 update instead of terrorists there are SPOOKY SCARY SKELETONS THAT COME FROM THE GATES OF HELL (and yes I literally mean they come from the gates of hell). With the steam workshop feature there is a infinite amount of things you can do in postal 2.\n\nSo this is classified as a open world, fps, sandbox game. If you were to relate this to garry's mod than you're completly wrong. This game is nothing like garry's mod. If you were to relate it GTA you'd still be wrong and besides GTA is third person anyway :special:. Postal 2 is its own kind of game. It's one of a kind and there will truely be nothing like this for decades to come. Hell, Postal 3 couldn't even compete with Postal 2. I'd say the closest a game got to postal 2 would be goat simulator. It goes on the same principle as postal 2. You can choose to act like a normal goat or go around rampaging the city. See how the two are alike? But, still, the two games are completly different.\n\nWho said you going postal was a bad thing? You can go and destroy terrorist organizations, Protest/deal with protesters, etc. Or you can go on a rampage with cat silencers and bombs and gasoline. That works too.\n\nI would reccomend you to buy this game ASAP. It's worth every penny.","November 2, 2014","true","4.7"," 51 of 67 people (76%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","76","51","67","6","0"

Sadly the first time i owned it was maybe 3 years ago.. i found an illegal copy and i DLed it and went to town... you gotta remember, i had NO clue where to get it.. and i WOULD have paid for it...but could not find it and had no clue who made the game.\n\nFast forward to earlier this year.. and BAM i have steam and it turns out the game IS on steam.. eventually i get the money and i buy it cause.. well.. i rather support the developers, i'm not a thief..\nI have been playing it since, and wow what a ride.. the steam version is way better and way more stable than that illegal copy, plus i can play the weekend story.\n\nThis game is really ♥♥♥♥ing funny, especially in what you can do... the moment i ♥♥♥♥♥♥ in someone's mouth and they threw up and ran of screaming.. i laughed so d*mn hard and thought "wow.. perfect game, right here!".\nThe dude reminds me of me and my life.. me just trying to live day to day.. and everyone around me crazy in their heads!\n\nAll i can say is after playing through and fighting the madcow deamon... i sat back going.."okay i need more of this, there has got to be more!" and sadly Postal 3 i have heard some bad things about so have yet to buy it..\nCan not WAIT for the new DLC being worked on, and i will be so happy when it releases because it will be a day one buy for me!\n\nBy the way, i wish to say i am sorry to the developers RWS for basically stealing the game at first... i hope me buying it on steam makes up for it.","December 26, 2014","true","27.7"," 35 of 41 people (85%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","85","35","41","6","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/scares/recommended/223470/","scares","Wolf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/scares/","666 products in account","Game name: Postal 2\nGame score: 9.5/10\nReviewed by: Wolf\n\nIn Summary...Postal 2 is the successor to the contraversial series, Postal, which hit the stores on April 12, 2003. The story features The Postal Dude, or just Dude for short, and his adventures across the week doing various errands. Things more than often turn hasty, leaving a simple chore of "picking up milk" into slaying some Al-Queda members. Each day features a list of 3-4 errands to run, across all 5 days of the week (and 2 in the "Apocalypse Weekend" mode). The DLC, Paradise Lost, features almost the same layout: 5 days of errands, but no weekend. All in all, it's quite a different experience, yet not in a bad way at all, more of a substantial addition to the FPS family.\n\n\nControls:WASD - Movement\nQ - Kick\nE - Holster weapon\nR - Unzip pants (to pee)\nC - Crouch\nK - Suicide\nG - Yell something\nMouse - Look\nMousewheel - Switch weapons (scroll)\n1 - 0 - Choose different weapons if available\nLeft click - Primary fire\nRight click - Secondary fire\nSpace - Jump\nZ - Drop weapon\nE/Enter - Use item or hand it over\nX - Drop item\nM - Map\n[ or ] - Select item in inventory\n\nGameplay:Each day you're able to do various tasks in order to complete the day. There's usually 3 tasks (some days have added tasks after one is completed, so 4). The days are outlined like a normal week; Monday - Friday, and the option to play a bonus mode called Apocalypse Weekend, which is Saturday and Sunday.\n\nStarting from your lovely home, Dude usually leaves with his wife ♥♥♥♥♥ing at him, as the game says, and given a task from her to do like pick up a book or cash a check. These tasks always turn hasty, ranging from psycho video game activists to terrorists attacking you and trying to kill you. Equipped with many weapons, the Dude has plenty to keep him protected, as well as sometimes a helper (like Champ, his dog) to assist you in your quests.\n\nGraphics:Graphics are not the games strong point, if only the only thing keeping anyone from buying this. Please, do not take this in the wrong way, the game is everything as interesting as if it was made in UE4. Realize it's a game from 2003, and this should help.\n\nNow, there's mods and everything to help things pop, I found one to make the mountains less flat and still doesn't decrease performance. There's also ENB's to reshade everything to your liking to not make it so bright, and also HD textures as well. I'm not saying the graphics are a super huge deal that this is a necessity, but some prefer to have the options to do so. I played the whole game and the DLC before I realised there were these things, and I still loved it.\n\nGame Balance:There's 10+ modes to choose from in difficulty, ranging from Easy to Impossible. Changing modes does not hinder your experience, each mode has the same content. Most people just play on Liebermode (easiest of all) just to play through the end. I have played all modes, including Postal. Jesus Christ it was a trip.\n\nOtherI need more DLC for this game, or a working Share the Pain for Windows10, please RWS.\n\nFinal Rating:9.5/10\n\nIn Conclusion:This game is an excellent example of how an FPS should feel, and with its customizability and humor, I literally did not go wrong buying this game. It was super fun playing through it, and every day was a blast. I wish there was more to it or at least a few more DLC's but that honestly is less priority than the real game. Concider picking it up if you have the money, it's often on sale on Steam for $1.\n\nPlease feel free to follow my curation page for more recommendations.

Whether it's you getting some milk at a convience store, getting Gary Coleman's autograph or stealing a X-Mas tree, the variety is surely there. Along your journey, you have a decent arsenal of weapons such as a tazer and gasoline to light people ablaze.\n\nThe game is fun and strangely addictive. You never feel like the tasks are being forced apon you and you can also do them in any order you like; some errands you can do in multiple ways which gives you some freedom that is needed. Postal 2 is also very humorous and over-the-top, while it sometimes steps over the boundaries, it's a game where you must take lightly.\n\nApart from the "career" mode, there is also multiplayer and DLC. The multiplayer has not been working for me, nor is anyone playing it. The Apocolypse Weekend DLC is less of my taste. Going a linear road and more action oriented was a change of pace, it was still hilarious but it didn't enhance the game in any way.\n\nPostal 2 often has great moments and hilarity usually insues. While the game isn't polished, the gameplay is certainly there to give players one hell of a time.\n\nPROS:\n+Fun and Addicting\n+Hilarious\n+Great Moments\n+Variety\n+Cheap Price\n+Available Freedom\n+Weapons are satisfying to use\n+Modding Support\n\n(Future SteamWorkshop may be added)\n\n\nCONS:\n-Broken Multiplayer\n-DLC (Apocolypse Weekend) isn't that great\n-No "real" story\n\nOverall, Postal 2 was a great buy.

Postal 2 Complete has been greenlit by the community, which either means that its now better than ever or that we’ve all completely lost our minds.\n\nAfter playing the game again, it would seem as though the latter is true.\n\nIn Postal 2, you are given a number of errands that you must complete each day. While the errands are similar to what most of us would call “missions”, their objectives are often much more simple than the missions we’ve become accustomed to in RPGs and other titles. In a testament to this, one of the first errands you have to run is to go to the store and get some milk. The atmosphere of the store is hilarious, as the middle eastern music blasts and the shopkeeper insults all of the patrons in his shop. The brilliance of Postal 2 is the non-linear manner in which you can complete your errands. Do you just pay for the milk or do you just grab it and then fight your way out of the store, hitting everyone in your path with a shovel? The choice is yours. I should warn you though, the shop keeper is packing serious heat.","November 15, 2014","true","242.1"," 30 of 38 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","30","38","2","0"

Good.\n\nPostal 2 is, at it's heart, a game for everyone, that anyone can relate to. You play as a guy who has errands to run throughout the week. How you get those errands done is up to you, but that's only part of the game - the other is, trying to get those errands done while surrounded by dim-witted, poorly dressed psychopaths.\n\nWhat will you do when you get your milk? Pay 5 bucks for a quart, or just walk out with it? Maybe set the place on fire? Maybe set EVERYTHING on fire? Smack people with a shovel to get to the front of the line? Pee in their eye? Drop a diseased cow head, causing everyone in its vicinity to hemorrhage blood from every orifice until they die, while the screaming survivors run out the door, only to be met by a carefully laid booby trap of grenades, blowing them apart in all directions? Maybe "borrow" a police uniform beforehand, so the cops don't chase you around while you do this?\n\n...not that I've ever done that.\n\nPostal 2 is definitely showing its age now, 11 years from its launch. However, unlike a lot of games, it has aged very, very well. The humor is tasteless, the violence is gratuitous, the various goings-on around Paradise are nothing short of pants-crappingly stupid. For all these reasons (and more), it is a brilliant gem of a game. If you have ever bumped into someone in public, been cut off in line, talked down to, or generally annoyed by anyone in your own life, you will find some representation of it in Postal 2.\n\nAnd you can hit it with a shovel.\n\n-----\n\nOn a somewhat more serious note: I always thought it was brilliant what this game provided for players - an outlet to get out all of those "OMFG IMMA KEEL JOO" feelings we build up throughout our day, in a safe, harmless environment where no real people can possibly get hurt. For the time, a game like this was unheard of, and provided an outlet for rage that most people didn't have a healthy alternative for. If anything, RWS was years ahead of its time for this. That they proudly support their fans, even as their fans proudly support them, is just a sexy icing on the win-cake.\n\nTLDR: Just buy the stupid game, I've got stuff to do.","June 25, 2014","true","15.0"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","18","18","0","2"

First and foremost, it's a FPS (First Person Shooter), it can also be considered a Comedy (which is actually surprising, considering the first game was very dark in spirit, with little humor to be found), but it's also an adventure game (though, it has little story) with a major focus on exploration. Players spend 5 days (or, a week if you're playing the expansion pack, too) as the Postal Dude, a simple guy living in the small town of Paradise, Arizona, even though it's far from that. From here, you're given tasks to do throughout the day, with unpredictable, and often times quirky outcomes.\n\nThe High Points (pros)POSTAL 2 is a violent game, to an extent where the developers literally have a warning about the violence BEFORE the game starts up. However, the violence isn't gimmicky here. It's over-the-top, and somewhat works. However, if you are disturbed by Blood and Gore in games, you can beat POSTAL 2 without killing anyone, which is tough if you aren't stockpiling the health items, one of which takes some of your health away after a while. This game also has ALLOT of achievements that are more than just 'Kill X People', and actually encourage you to replay the game a bit. However, the best thing about POSTAL 2 by far is just how atmospheric it is. Sure, the graphics may not have dated all too well, but, the map on display here is MASSIVE, and only locked up by little loading segments. Another thing: this game is REALLY funny! The One-Liners spouted by our anti-hero (or, plain villain if you play it like that) are original (though, I'll get to that in a bit), and allot of other things can be considered as hilarous, too... just, don't expect gut-busting laughs all the way through. To finish this off, this game is full of odd tasks and strange situations. Of course, I won't spoil these situations, because they need to be experienced first-hand.\n\nSummary:\n-HUGE map\n-Very atmospheric\n-Multiple playstyles\n-Incredibly funny\n-Brilliant achievements that require exploration, and give the game replayability.\n-Over-the-top violence that supports the games tone in a strange way\n\nThe Low Points (cons)I really don't have much to say here.\nSure the graphics are dated, but you need to remember: this game is OLD.\nI think my largest flaw with this game are the reptitive one-liners. Are they funny? YES! But, chances are, you'll hear them multiple times throughout the game, to an absurd extent. The objectives are also kinda spread out a bit far, but, not too much to actually be a problem.\n\nSummary:\n-Repeating One-Liners\n\nIN CONCLUSION (verdict)POSTAL 2 is a quirky game, and I love it, especially after replaying it. It's atmosphere and large map add to the experience, as well as multiple playstyles allowed. It's a funny game for sure, starring an oddly memorable anti-hero, and unusual events that sorround him every day. It also encourages replayability with clever achievements, that go into the realms of exploration at times. Is the game violent and really ♥♥♥♥ing offensive? Yes, but to an extent that works. On a critical landscape, this game is far from perfect, but that doesn't mean it's not a damn fine game, which it is.\nAnd, yes, don't buy this if you're easily offended, because it's clearly not made for you.\n\nFINAL GRADE: A-","May 16","true","22.0"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","19","21","2","0"

The graphics for 2003 are spectacular, the soundtrack are enjoyable, the atmosphere varies from outside to buildings and houses in the city called Paradise, AZ (in the USA). The gameplay is an open-world type, having the ability to do whatever you want, such as walking through the town, killing civilians/gangsters/police, beating animals, urinating on anything you want, a pretty rebel gameplay. The story is about a Postal Dude which just moved to Paradise, AZ with his wife, and his dog, Champ. He will have to go through 7 days (from Monday to Sunday) where he will have to accomplish many risky takes, which mostly have unwanted consequences. The engines are well optimized, very rare crashes, and generally good engines.\n\nGraphics\nThe graphics are spectacular for the year 2003, being a huge improvement over the first POSTAL game, by bringing the three dimensions feature and brining in the First-Person and the Third-Person. This game can be run even on low performance computers, which would still be able to run this game on Medium-High. The sky is mostly blue-yellowish, nights are very rare in this game, the cars, the guns, the buildings, and the nature things are well designed. Humans are being randomly deployed, being pretty well designed too. The buildings and houses are also well designed, giving more reality to Paraside.\n\nAtmosphere\nThe atmosphere varies from being outside to the ability to walk in every single building or house of this game, being a huge advantage for explorers. We may also see desert, because it’s located in Arizona. In the south of the town we may see higher altitudes, which also contain some forests. The game mostly happens during the daytime, very rare during the night time. We may see people everywhere, even animals, cats can be attached on shotguns, which seems pretty funny. There are many places to visit, also the DLC expands the areas even more (underground areas and even a new Paradise, a terrorized one. The population is very scared due to the atomic explosion which happened years back then.\n\nAudio\nThe soundtrack of this game were composed by RWS, proving that the developer has truly put effort in making a completely original game. During fights, we may hear some dynamic soundtracks, which encourages you to fight even better. While doing missions or just exploring the city, no soundtracks will play. We may hear birds singing, people talking, and sometimes the wind. We may also hear animals, such as dogs chasing cats, etc. The sound of the bullets are pretty alright, the voice acting is also very nice, especially for the Postal Dude.\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay is about the Postal Dude who does many tasks for his wife, such as buying milk, returning an overdue library book, getting Gary Coleman’s autograph, etc. This game is Open-World too, you may walk everywhere, and you can do what you want, anytime. You can even buy pizzas, donuts, drinks, etc. Also, there are some vending machines which sell heal kits, drugs (for health), etc.  (the health vending machine) and guns, grenades, vests, etc. (the weapons vending machine).  You can also talk with people (only the ones which have connections with missions). Overall good gameplay.\n\nStory\nThe story Is about a Postal Dude which just moved in Paradise, AZ with his wife and his dog, Champ. He has to go through many adventures, among tasks given by his wife.  He needs to buy milk, steak pay his debts, return overdue books, and pretty much everything about violence/killing. After Friday, his wife will shot him in the head, causing him a tumor. In the next 2 days, he will make his way out of Paradise. In the new DLC, the Postal Dude came back In Paradise, but most of the town was already terrorized by the past atomic bomb, detonated by the Postal Dude himself. He will have to deal with many nations, such as Arabs, the Coleman family, etc.  The difficulties are way too many, nobody would need to choose from that many.\n\nEngines\nThe engines on this game are well optimized, almost no crashes or bugs. The people's movements are pretty good, starting from walking calm through the town to running due to being alerted. The sky does not move, but in the DLC we may find snowing. In the cities there are cars which stand on the edge of the road or in garages, however, none of them is ever moving. When you shoot down somebody to death, I feel like their falling is not realistic. They just simply fall, not like in reality.  Also, I did not like how the sand is behaving. Instead of flowing in the air, it simply stays on the ground. This game can be played even on low performance computers, which give it a huge advantage.\n\nStrong PointsWell designed graphics for 2003\nAlmost no bugs or crashes\nNice sounds and soundtrack\nAwesome voice acting\nWell optimized engines\nGood and coordinated AI\nBig city to explore\nGreat sense of humor\nMany weapons to choose from\nOpen-World game\nGood DLC and soundtrack\nLong storyline\nWeak PointsFrequent loading zones\nToo many difficulties to choose from\nYou get stuck too fast in random objects\nYou can’t drive any cars, the biggest disadvantage\nGeneral Ratings (because this game is getting old, I must give it some ratings for the releasing year)\nGraphics: 10/10\nAtmosphere: 10/10\nAudio: 10/10\nGameplay: 9.5/10\nStory: 10/10\nEngines: 9.5/10\n\nPersonal Rating: 9.83/10\n\nGeneral Ratings\nGraphics: 8.5/10\nAtmosphere: 9/10\nAudio: 9/10\nGameplay: 8.5/10\nStory: 10/10\nEngines: 8/10\n\nPersonal Rating: 8.83/10","March 7","true","63.5"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","86","19","22","5","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Valerie-Valens/recommended/223470/","Valerie-Valens","~★PetSquirrel★~","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Valerie-Valens/","647 products in account","There is a lot that can be said about Postal 2. It is obscene enough to be banned in Germany, New Zealand, Australia and a few other countries when it first released one decade ago. As a result, eviewer scores, fueled by moral panic, really dealt a blow to its overall score the first time around. Which is why it is a very good thing that this game got a new re-release on Steam 10 years later, because this game is a real hidden gem that deserves a lot more credit than it got.\n\nThis game, in its original form, is a sandbox shooter with a lot of offensive and crude humor. It is set in the ironically-named fictional town of Paradise, populated by jerks. Players take on the role of some down-on-his-luck everyman, living on a trailer and about to be laid off. His task is to survive the week by taking on various errands. This seems mundane and uninteresting on the surface, however, littered around the town are tools that let the player cause mayhem and destruction, as well as extremeist and special interest groups that are hell bent on killing the player dead. Not only that, but at various points, events happen that put the player in situations that they must come out of alive.\n\nThen, we have the Steam edition of the game, which adds a ton of new extra content, as well as canonizing one of the more popular mods for the game as part of the package. This mod introduces even more enemy types for you to blow up, as well a couple new toys to play with. This mod also offers a more linear mission structure, which provides an interesting contrast to the type of gameplay present in the original game.\n\nOn top of that, there is a third campaign which combines both the original game and the content of the mod into seven whole days of mayhem. There is even a hidden unlock that players can get if they beat this third combined campaign in the very hard POSTAL difficulty mode.\n\nWhat makes these single player experiences so compelling is the inclusion of choice for the player. They have the ability to choose whether they want to survive the errands peacefully, or if they would like to do so causing as much mayhem as possible. They have a vast potential arsenal of weapons and toys that they can pick up and cause mayhem with. Not only that, a lot of the crude and offensive humor is put there as a biting commentary of the then (and possibly now) fast-food culture and excesses of contemporary western culture. Gameplay-wise, I also like how the wanted system is set up so that your wanted meter only goes up when committing a crime in the proximity of law enforcement.\n\nThis game also includes a multiplayer portion (Share the Pain) for deathmatch mayhem, and all things considered, it would have been a really fun experience, if the netcode was better. Which is a shame, because that means that having a lag-free experience entails getting all your friends together for a LAN party, which isn't exactly viable if all your friends are spread across the world. There is also the minor issue of game stability and intermittent crashes, however this shouldn't be too much of a problem with the smart use of saves.\n\nIn short, I would highly recommend that you pick up this game, there is no question about it, as its normal selling price is $9.99 which is a steal for a game with this amount of potential enjoyment. And if this isn't a good enough deal for you, this game now has workshop support, which gives you the option of downloading and playing through a plethora of well-made user content.","May 16, 2014","true","67.2"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

Go postal! The whole point of the game is to cause mayhem and have fun with it, plus he makes alot of funny quips and they are even fun to hear over and over again.\n\nThe Town: You live in Paradise Arizona, how ironic the name is since the place is full of idiots, gun toting idiots, or bomb toting idiots, but that's the best part about it.\n\nCharacters: The characters you meet are just so funny and rude that it's hard to find anything bad about them, they are all hilarious.\n\nGuns: The guns in this game are so much fun to use, even though you have absolutely no reload, I don't see how a m16 can carry 400 bullets in the clip but I ain't complainin.\n\nPeeing on people: Yes, you can do this, you can urinate on somebody till they vomit or just to be a a$$ to them.\n\nDogs and cats: You can use the dogs are friends! They fight with you! And as for the cats...well...you basically put the barrell of your gun up their a$$ and guess what you have? A Kitty Silencer!\n\nGore: This game is very very gorey, blood, chopped limbs, guts everywhere, decapitation, it's fun!\n\nExploring: There are guns and ammo lying all over the place, as well as melee weapons you can find rummaging around, and each day most of the weapons change and won't be there, but new weapons will be in other places.\n\nThe Errands: Each day you have errands to do, get milk, go to bank, etc. but the fun part about this game is it doesn't feel like a boring old errand, you actually do something in it, for the bank when you go there you can wait in line or Pee on everyone to get out of the way so you can go first.\n\nQuotes and Easter Eggs: Easter Eggs are hidden throughout the game, as well as the achievements, the one I seemed to notice in a instant was the Bates Hotel with "Murder free showers"\n\nThe civilians: The civilians are just all around hilarious, some are nice, but most are just complete a$$hats, so if you walk through the town and you notice 2 civis fighting each other with guns, you're first thought will be "What the heck is wrong with this place" But later on when you start seeing it more you think "Just another day in Paradise..."\n\nBreaking the 4th wall: This is the best part, or one of the best parts, the Postal Dude knows you are controlling him, and he makes quips over it too, if you quick save 2 times in a few seconds he'll sometimes say "Didn't you just save?" Or "My grandmother could beat the game saving as much as you do."\n\nStill being updated: Yes, you read that right, Running With Scissors (RWS) is STILL updating this game even though it's 10-11 years old, they are even making a workshop with it one day too, they extracted "A week in paradise" mod and put some of the guns and weapons in the main game itself, these guys must love their fans!\n\nNow for the Cons:\n\nCONS:\n\nGuns: Some guns are highly dangerous, even on lower level difficulty, Rockets can kill you almost instantly, even with armor and full health\n\nGroups: Throughout the game there are groups that end up hating you for doing something to them, IE you go return a book to the library and these Tree Protestors burn the place down while you are in it and you have to kill them to get out and they hate you for the rest of the game, but it's fun as well, it keeps it's pace and when you run into them you can easily run away...or kill them.\n\nSaving: Do this alot in the game, cause if you started a level and it auto saves, and you did everything in that area, and died without saving, you have to go through it all over again, so be a Spasstic saver, don't be afraid.\n\nUnskippable cutscenes: It gets annoying if you die after watching a cutscene and you didn't save, and you have to do the whole thing over again, seriously? It's not hard to make a skip cutscene button you know.\n\nOverall this game is fun as hell, and if you start saving all over the place you can get through those cons with ease, this game deserves a 9-10/10, and it is well worth it, can't wait till they get the Workshop running.","February 14, 2014","true","168.2"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","0"

This is exactly the kind of game that they’re afraid of. However, if you have any common sense (and a sense of humor) it’s pretty clear that Postal 2 is simply a satire of American paranoia and ignorance. You play as the Postal Dude, aiding him as he completes a list of tasks over the course of a week. As you go about your business, you’ll notice increasingly crazy things happening all around you, such as anti-violent video game protestors who seem to love trying to kill you, trigger-happy police officers, hillbillies who apparently love the movie “Deliverance”, and more. It’s all very ridiculous and over the top, but that’s exactly the point.\n\nPostal 2 is crude, extremely violent, outrageous, and lots of fun. Avoid if you’re easily offended.

Didn't expect much from it getting it for $0.99 but this is a great game that still holds up. You're let loose upon the politically incorrect, offensive, and amusing world of POSTAL. Given objectives to complete each day (level), you can go about the game as a normal person, but who the hell wants to do that. Lines taking too long? People getting ♥♥♥♥♥♥ because you walk by them? Pull out your shotgun and blow their heads off. Combat is SO SATISFYING. It's great for blowing off some steam decapitating people with hedge clippers, dousing them in gasoline and lighting them on fire, and urinating on someone until they vomit.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/liberteer/recommended/223470/","liberteer","Fißtechead","http://steamcommunity.com/id/liberteer/","503 products in account","There was a time in gaming history when 'worried' politicians and parents were sure that games cause violence. Many of the classics were stomped by suit'n'tie men and women: Quake, Doom, GTA... but one game was known for being the most violent, depraved, senseless depiction of lunacy - POSTAL.\n\nFirst one was isometric shooter and it introduced us to the concept of senseless violence. We've needed to kill everyone and everything to pass the level. Killing was mandatory, and those enemies were no aliens or demonic creatures - they were all (mostly) innocent humans.\n\nPOSTAL 2 arrived sometimes around 2002 or 2003, can't really tell, and it brought the violence into a 3D world. The game went FPS and Postal Dude fans went nuts about it.\n\nConsidering that today we have more violent games people play and no one gets mad and there are basically no more politicians, senates, governments and parents deeply worried about what their children play, Postal 2 still stands out as a prime example of total, senseless violence. This game is still 0% politically correct, madness-driven insult toward everyone and everything. It plays nicely on cliches, prejudices and morals - it doesn't give a flying ♥♥♥♥ about religions, races, social, economic or sexual orientations - it's against everyone and everything.\n\nBut is it a good shooter? No, it is not. It is full of glitches, bugs and the reason why it stills stands the test of time is the amount of insults its dispersing every time you launch it. If you're a grouchy intellectual, you might find the whole thing tiring and repetitive, but putting people on fire, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on their corpses or in their mouths until the point they vomit, using cats as silencers, chopping off heads with a shovel is still pretty fun, if you're open-minded, clever person knowing it's all bad humor. Yes, in case you ask about my own opinion: violent games can make you go violent only if you're unstable person.\n\nShould you get it?\n\na) NO, if you're a sensitive person.\nb) NO, if you're looking for a decent FPS and you're more interested in game mechanics than idiotic moments of Postal 2.\nc) YES, if you're ready to grin, smirk and laugh your ♥♥♥ off at complete lunacy and can get past pretty glitchy shooter.\nd) YES, if you've played it back then - getting it for 2 € is like a blast-from-the-past ticket. And game has been improved since then - more voices, more weapons, more characters and Steam achievements, so it's pretty busty.

Postal Dude lives in a trailer park in the small town of Paradise, Arizona, with his nagging wife, who is identified in the credits as simply, the 'Postal Dude's ♥♥♥♥♥'. The game's levels are split into days of the week starting Monday and finishing Friday.\n\nAt the beginning of each day, Postal Dude is given several tasks to accomplish, such as 'get milk', 'confess sins', and other seemingly mundane tasks. The object of Postal 2 is to finish all of the tasks throughout the week, and the player can accomplish these tasks in any way he or she wishes, be it as peaceful and civilly as possible, or as violent and chaotically as possible. It is possible, if occasionally difficult, to complete most tasks without engaging in battle, or at least, harming or killing other characters, as evidenced by the game's tagline: "Remember, it's only as violent as you are!". The daily tasks can be accomplished in any order the player desires, and the game also includes one task that is activated only when Postal Dude urinates, in which the player is tasked with getting treatment for gonorrhea after Postal Dude discovers he has the infection.\n\nThroughout the course of the game, Postal Dude must put up with being provoked by other characters on a regular basis. He is given the finger, mugged, attacked by various groups of protesters, and is harassed by an obnoxious convenience store owner/terrorist and his patrons who cut before Postal Dude in the "money line". During the game, Postal Dude also encounters a marching band, a murderous toy mascot named Krotchy, the Paradise Police Department and its SWAT team, overzealous BATFE agents, the Arizona Army National Guard, an eccentric religious cult, cannibalistic butcher shop workers, fanatical Al-Qaeda terrorists, and former child actor Gary Coleman, among many others.\n\nBy Friday afternoon, the final day in the game, the apocalypse occurs and societal collapse soon follows, with all law and order breaking down. Cats begin to fall out of a darkly-colored sky, and almost everyone in town becomes heavily armed, with random gun battles breaking out in the streets. Despite this, Postal Dude returns home to his trailer as normal, where he then gets into an argument with his wife, who demands that Postal Dude explain why he never picked up the ice cream she asked for at the beginning of the game. Postal 2 then ends with a gunshot being heard, before being kicked to the end credits.","May 20, 2014","true","164.4"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","1"

What do i say about a game, launched more than 10 years ago, that created a lot of controversy, was banned in more than 13 countries, where you can pee on people, kill dogs and cats, and decapitate, explode or cut in pieces everything you see, using dozens and dozens of weapons, including shovels, tazers, RPGs and everything you can think of. In this game you control the Postal Dude, and you live as him in one "normal" week of his life. You have to do some work, like getting milk and easy things, getting Gary Coleman autograph. What could go wrong? The game is very funny, have a great gameplay and even a good time of campaign. It includes too the Apocalypse Weekend DLC, so, zombies and more playtime. The game graphics are outdated of course but are ok. The game contains a lot of bugs, they are funny but some are game breaking at some times, and the Apocalypse Weekend is very boring. Voice-acting is a funny thing: Postal Dude have an amazing one but the other characters suck. The game also have a soundtrack that have some cool musics sometimes but the game almost have no music. Postal 2 is very funny overall, and there is a cool multiplayer, but few people play it.\n\n\n+Funny comments of Postal Dude\n+Amazing voice-acting for Postal Dude\n+Funny and easy gameplay\n+Good length campaign\n+You can pee on people and use cats and dogs for a lot of things\n+Apocalypse Weekend DLC for free\n+A lot of guns\n+Open World\n+Unique Multiplayer\n+Still updated by Developer\n+Many items\n\n\n-Poor Soundtrack\n-Voice-acting for NPC's suck\n-Many loadings\n-Boring Apocalypse Weekend DLC\n-Poor animations and cutscenes\n-Big amount of bugs\n\n\n\nBesides it's flaws, Postal 2 is one of the funniest and controversial games ever made 8/10\nBUT, I have to say: I do not recommend this game for EVERYONE. The game is very, very offensive for...everything. So, if you hate someone offending something you like, or hate nonsense violence, etc. Do not play this game.","November 30, 2014","true","40.4"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","15","20","0","3"

It's just amazing. The developers of this game were not afraid to go out there and it's very clear that this game was thoroughly thought out, made with love, and most importantly, made for the player.\n\nYou're a random guy who tries to go about his day and finish some errands. Each errand can be completed in a number of ways, just one of the things that increase the replay value of this game. You can choose to live through the game as a good guy, doing the errands the "right" way, paying your bills, respecting civilians, etc. Or you can be a bad guy and kill anyone you see, steal anything you want, break stuff, etc.\n\nThen there is the amount of things you can do. It's almost endless; You can pee on people, you can pour gasoline on them and light them on fire, you can kick them, cut their heads off and play fetch with your dog (oh yeah, you have a dog, and you can get more dogs by giving them dog treats), taze them, sick your dog after them and so many more.\n\nThe interactivity. The AI is pretty smart. Some will hide, some will run, some won't even be afraid of you, some will attack. They all react exactly how you think they would when being chased by your dog or set on fire or ♥♥♥♥♥♥ on or shot at. They are even aware of the minor details in the world such as sound, doors, cats, dogs and eachother. If something in the world can't be destroyed, then it can be pushed around. Ragdolls also have amusing and sometimes funny results as usual.\n\nThis game has the mentality of "it's your game, play it how you want to". You don't have to do the errands in order, you don't have to do them right away and there's many things to do besides the errands, but that's for you to discover. If you are one who goes for achievements, this game will certainly provide you with achievements that will take you for a fun ride, and some are not so easy. Like I said, there is no proper way to describe the gloryness of the game, you just have to play it.\n\nI highly recommend this game. 10/10.","April 12, 2014","true","101.2"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","2"

You will play as Postal Dude (actual name) completing various day to day activities such as: getting milk, getting autographs from Gary Coleman, retrieving mail, and many other trivial activities that end up turning into an all-out gore fest. You see, this game doesn't care. Anything offensive you can think of, it'll probably be in this game. This game is a sandbox set in first-person based off of the Unreal engine. When you first start playing you will notice how open-ended and interactive the world is. Some sections are cut-off due to plot restrictions but usually, you won't get bored of one area. The combat is fairly dumb, but fun. The game's idea of difficulty is more enemies, and as you progress, you will become rivals with many factions. If I had to describe this game in two words, I would say "Murder Simulator." There are many weapons to utilize each with unique effects. Simple things such has scissors can be used as a lethal ninja star immitation. The game is very creative with how you want to kill or torture people (urinating on someone until he/she throws up). Play the game for it's killing, not the story.\n\nArt: The game manages to look decent, even by today's standards. There are a lot of copy and paste areas, but each section of the map feels unique enough to grab your attention. You will mostly be looking at blood, vomit, urine, and more blood.\n\nMusic/sound: The game does little in the music department, other than atmospheric radio. The sound design is decent, most weapons sound like you would expect them to and the screams and remarks of bystanders add to the joy of murdering for no reason.\n\nEntertainment Value: The game is short. It would not be uncommon to beat this game in one day (if you did nothing but missions) but based off of the interaction, humor, violence, mature themes, and freedom the game presents, I can see a player coming back to it again and again if they want to murder and pee on people for no reason for some time. It isn't exactly and in-depth game.\n\nScore: Based on everything, the game offers nothing but a good murder simulation. The story is lackluster, the sound and art is decent, and the overall missions just consist of go to location, kill everything, leave. For what it's worth, the workshop support does add to the gameplay by giving you new weapons and maps, but at the end of the day, it is a very well done murder sandbox with extremely controversial subjects and content. Play at your own risk.\n\n3/5\nThank you for reading.","August 18, 2014","true","25.0"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

Violence and more violence.  This title delivers in spades.  The social commentary is a little dated now, but still relevant for the most part.  You can be as wicked or as sweet as you want.  Being sweet is a challenge.  Being wicked is a blast.\n\nSo you enjoy:\n\n1.  Sticking a shotgun up a cat's butt to use it as a silencer?\n2.  Urinating on random people?\n3.  A firefight VS. Gary Coleman?\n\nThen this just may be the title for you.\n\nThis game includes the Apocalypse Weekend and the Share the Pain (MP) add-ons.  The graphics are dated, but it's still a FPS that I like to play.\n\nFinally, DO NOT GET POSTAL 3!  It is an a horrible abomination of a game.  RWS gets no cash from the sale of that piece of ****, as I understand.  I bought that game at retail...

The 100+ hours that I've spent have all been pure enjoyment (till I completed the Week on POSTAL difficulty, I hated my life at that point.)\n\nThere isn't really anything about this game that I hate. I love just about everything about this game! Keep in mind this game is NEVER to be taken serious. This is a Dark Humor game, and it shows. It pushes the limits like no other game dares to try. Hell most of the achievements have some sort of ♥♥♥♥♥ in the images, or swears. Now coming after Postal 1, which was "Kill everything," this game gives you untold amount of options. You can complete the entire game without killing anyone!\n\nThe fact they even made a true Expansion for this game 11 YEARS LATER says a lot. The brilliant minds at Running With Scissors are amazing people and LOVE their fans, and they prove that with the Paradise Lost Expansion. Yes I'm calling it an Expansion and not DLC, that is how much content is in it!\n\nEveryone can have their Call of Dudes, Battlefields, Arsarsin's Creeds (Steam censorship), and what ever cash cow big AAA companies produce *cough*  EA, Ubisoft, ♥♥♥♥ Konami  *cough*, or what ever cheap low live scam artist Indi Devs *cough* ImminentUprising *cough*, but I will stick with games that are ♥♥♥♥♥ FUN!

It really helps that the game is total Looney Tunes and doesn't take itself seriously at all. Even the devs poke fun at themselves like for example one of the first things you can do is kill their ingame avatars. The base game is a fun sandbox and the weapons are nice. A neat thing is that you can beat the game non-violently, I did.\n\nMy biggest complaint with the game is that the Apocalypse Weekend expansion sucks ♥♥♥♥. It's a really medicore corridor shooter at best and terrible one at worst and it ends with an absolutely boring boss fight that drags on way too long. It also ♥♥♥♥ed up my otherwise non-violent run. My advice is to not play those missions. The base five days are worth playing alone. Plus they're releasing a new expansion after more than a decade that's going to be more like the vanilla game so that also adds to the recommendation.","April 16, 2015","true","17.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

All you do is simple errands, and whether or not you want chunks of decapitated human heads sprayed all over the landscape is completely up to you. The game is a FPS, rather than a isometric shooter, and you can do pretty much just about anything imaginable. You can put a cat silencer on your guns, set fire to everything, ♥♥♥♥ on people, or just go on a generic rampage.\n\nBut then again, you can also act like a normal person, fulfil your common errands, and not be a general jackass psychopath to everyone around you.\n\nThe game's tag line is "It's only as violent as you are!".

It keeps me laughing through the whole game. I've only played for about an hour so far, but the game definitely has my attention. The controls are a bit confusing in the beginning, but you'll get used to them eventually. There are a few minor glitches here and there, but I'm sure the devs will get working on those asap. The weapons are a bit repetitive as so far I've only been able to use a shovel, pistol, machine gun, and a shotgun. Not sure what the rest of the game holds though. So far, it seems like I'm limitless as to what I can do! I've set someone on fire and haven't even been playing the game for 3 hours!  The achievements and trading cards for this game are pretty funny imo. Navigation is a 10/10 for me, as is the gameplay. This game sorta reminds me of GTA, so if you're a fan of GTA, I definitely recommend this game for you. The blood and gore isn't as intense as I thought it would be, which is a good thing because I don't like too much blood and gore. If you don't like it at all, there is an option to toggle it on and off. So far so good. Can't wait to see what the rest of the game holds! 9/10 Weekend deal so grab it fast!","February 14, 2014","true","1.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MunicipalRose/recommended/223470/","MunicipalRose","MunicipalRose","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MunicipalRose/","188 products in account","As an Arizona resident, it's nice to see an open-world game taking place in my home-state! There's tons of cacti, dirt, rude Indian convenience store cashiers, greedy cops, and guns are EVERYWHERE... trust me, this is very accurate!\n\nNow for my review:\nThere are several modes you can play: A Week in Paradise (AWP), Apocalypse Weekend, and POSTAL 2. Apocalypse Weekend takes place Saturday and Sunday, POSTAL 2 is Monday-Friday, and AWP is all seven days. For each day, you have tasks, such as picking up your paycheck to buy milk, returning a library book, paying a speeding ticket, etc., but there's usually a twist. For example, upon going to the library, you discover violent book protestors. After returning your book, they set the library on fire, and you must work your way to the exit while avoiding the fire. The game presents a fight or flight option: you don't have to attack the protesters, but they are armed and will attack you. Difficulties determine their weaponry: on the easiest difficulty, enemies are armed only with shovels. On higher difficulties, everybody will be armed with handguns, shotguns, and/or assault rifles.\n\nNow, let's talk weapons! You'll find many weapons throughout the game, including the standard layout of handguns, shotguns (including a sawed-off), SMG, assault rifle, sniper, grenades & Molotovs, grenade launcher, and rocket launcher), but you also get tons of other weapons such as a machete than can be thrown and return like a boomerang, a scythe that slices people right in half, a napalm launcher that sets afire everything in its path, etc. In total, there's over 20 available weapons. You also get a DIY silencer for your shotgun - a kitty cat. Yup, you put the butt of a cat on the barrel of your shotgun to silence it!\n\nFree-roaming is another strongpoint to the game. You can accomplish your daily tasks at your leisure, and run around the open-world to your hearts content. Although you can't expect a map the size of San Andreas, the map is of decent size for the time it was developed and considering it was independently developed. Every building can be explored, and often contains weapons, health, or other goodies.\n\nIf you're into modding, you should also enjoy the game. There are tons of mods for POSTAL 2, including plenty on the Steam Workshop. There are tons of weapon mods, a couple of "mission" mods, and a multiplayer mod (known as Share the Pain, or STP). One mod in particular I recommend is Eternal Damnation (aka ED), a total conversion mod. ED requires STP to work, though ED is a singleplayer only mod. ED is apparently going to be remade by RWS themselves, and will be released for free!\n\nDespite all the strong suits POSTAL 2 has to offer, I can't recommend this game to a lot of people. One particular reason is the level of violence, gore, and controversial/adult humor within this game. Although I personally enjoy all of it, some people can't handle killing Islamic terrorists, or urinating on people, or even political references and "bathroom" humor.\n\nMy rating: 11/10. Great buy! I suggest buying the game with Paradise Lost, since it's only a couple bucks more if you buy them together. The "DLC" contains just as much content as the base game itself!","February 7","true","78.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

I'm serious, though... Just hear me out on this. Running with Scissors has sprinkled life lessons to and fro in this glorious game of theirs that yes everyone, even children, will benefit from (Now, far be it from me to say that the parents who see this game and think it's nothing but trash-talk and gore, not "worthy" for their feeble-minded children to suffer through are evil, but any parent who would deprive their children of these life lessons, are well... evil). "Well," you may be wondering, "what are these life lessons that you go on about? Will you ever get to the point?" My answer to the first question would be "SHUT UP, I'M GETTING THERE!" and my answer to the second question is... "Yeah sure, whatever..."\n\nTHE LIFE LESSONS\n\n1. If you ask a celebrity to sign a book for you and they turn you down, it's okay! Just dump a load of gasoline on their heads, light them on fire, pee the fire out, steal the signature of the celebrity from someone else as they run away in terror because you just lit a guy on fire, hide from the cops in a well-concealable water fountain until they give up, and laugh as you run all the way home to sell the autograph on eBay because, as you know (maybe...), celebrities signatures are worth much more after they are deceased...\n\n2. YOU HATE MALLS, YOU ♥♥♥♥ING HATE THEM, THEY'RE CONFUSING AND SCARY AND YOU HATE THE LEVEL DESIGNER(S) OF THIS GAME, IF THERE WAS ANY WAY TO SKIP THE MISSIONS WHERE YOU HAD TO GO INTO THE MALL, YOU WOULD!\n\n3. If you feel frustration at the level designer(s) of a game, go down to the company building and take your wrath out on them with that shotgun that you found behind a dumpster! It's better than holding it all in! :D\n\n4. It's okay to kill someone you hate! Just make sure the cops are not around! :D\n\n5. If someone makes fun of you while you are wearing a gimp suit, PEE IN THEIR MOUTHS IMMEDIATELY, THEY DESERVE IT!\n\n6. Never wait in lines. If you want something but there is a line, just pee on everyone (unless if there's a cop... God, I learned that one the hard way... (-.-))! *EXCEPTION* If there is a cop in the line, pull out your gun and start firing until you or everyone else around you is choking on their own blood and vomit!\n\n7. If you are on fire, DO NOT PANIC! Tilt at a slight angle and pee on yourself! If you are a woman... lol, good luck with that...\n\n8. It's ok to show the ladies your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in public, but remember our rule about the cops, k? ;)\n\n9. If you see one of those Running With Scissors guys running around, throw scissors into their eye sockets and laugh at the irony.\n\n10. Don’t have money to pay for some stupid traffic ticket? Rob your local bank! The cops will be glad to take your stolen money. :3\n\nIn conclusion, these examples and more have all proven to be knowledge that a young man/woman will need on this journey that we call life. This is why I believe that all parents should purchase this game for their young children immediately. If not for the awesome blood and gore… buy it for the life lessons.","December 30, 2014","true","7.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

It has fantastic replay value (I found myself beating the game quite a few times). It's very funny, and whilst the humor may be no longer topical, you have to remember this was originally released in 2003. Nevertheless, it's still funny. The physics in the game are very well done too, especially the ♥♥♥♥ effect. The gore is possibly the most violent and well done in gaming history. The fact that the developers constantly update the game even to this day (the dismemberment feature was originally only in Apocalypse Weekend, and there were a lot fewer weapons in the original release) is astounding. The game does take a while to load each day, but the loading inbetween sections of the town take mere seconds.\n\nOverall, I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who's not easily offended or grossed out.

Well, let's put it in this way. If you have a annoying bully at school, and you just want to like, chop his head off, POSTAL 2 is great to practice that. Just kidding, but POSTAL 2 is a madness simulator to me, you can basically do everything. You want to fetch with your dog? Done. Are you in for kicking someone's monitor into stuck into a wall? Possible! You want to pee on your ex-wife Melissa? A-Okay!  Do you want to walk on electrical wire at 8 feet high while hoping not to be shocked? Maybe.  You want to steal your neighbour Daniel's taser and taser him to death? Why not? You want to throw a molotov-cocktail at people in a gaybar? Okay, now you've crossed the line. Seriously. So, are you ready for some crazy crap coming up in a small village in Arizona made by some developers which run all the time with scissors in their hands? The game is actually from 2003, but POSTAL 2 is still played by many across the world. Running With Scissors made even a totally new DLC for the game, called POSTAL 2: Paradise Lost, not so long ago, in 2015. I highly recommend this game, and this is one of the best games I've ever played. It's definitely worth your money, especially when it's on sale.

In fact, you'll end up raiding the whole city as you are trying to reach a certain location just because you can.\n\nEvery day you get a few errands to complete and multiple ways to do so. Unlike other games, the errands seem to be very simple, some tasks that anyone could face- buying milk, paying a ticket at the police station, get steaks- nothing could go wrong.\n\nThe game is as violent as you are, you can either go postal and kill your way out of anything, or try to peacefully make your way out of trouble without getting killed (that's the real challenge).\n\nThere are tons of secrets hidden by the map designers that contain either easter eggs and/or hidden weapons and items that will help you as you progress trough the game.\n\nAside from the fun gameplay, badass one-liners and humorous jokes, the game is not entirely flawless. One of the most stressing features is the loading zones, meaning that whenever you will go around a corner or trough a tunnel you will most likely face a loading screen. The wait time isn't that long, usually taking ~10 seconds, but for a game where traveling is a key feature it starts to get on your nerves pretty quickly. Another flaw is the not-so-great hit reg system, which will cause weapons such as the m4 and m5 to be nearly useless at times, but with an old engine like p2 is running on, the game itself can't be blamed for these.\n\nHowever, unless you're an actual fan of old games that is used to such issues games used to have, you should probably stay away from it. I just can't get enough.\n\n\nJust don't forget the Rocky Road.","January 12","true","41.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Both are intentionally highly controversial due to high levels of violence and stereotyping. Unlike its predecessor, Postal 2 is played completely in first-person based on the Unreal Engine. Scenes of the game can be seen in the music video of the Black Eyed Peas single "Where Is the Love?".\nIn 2004, New Zealand banned Postal 2 due to "gross, abhorrent content"  and Australia later banned the game due to "excessive abhorrent content". On May 1, 2007, Malaysia banned the game outright due to "very high impact violence & offensive depictions of cruelty". The game is also banned in Germany, France and temporarily banned for sale in Sweden. The games were later legally made available worldwide through GOG.com in 2009 and later on Steam in 2012.\nThe game received a mixed reception from critics upon its release in 2003, with some reviewers going so far as to give the game a score of zero, while others argued in favor of the game's concept and implementation. Regardless, the game was successful enough to receive several expansions and to be included in multiple compilations, and a film adaptation of the game and its predecessor was made in 2008.\nPlot\nIn Postal 2, the player takes on the role of the Postal Dude, a tall and thin red-headed man with a goatee, sunglasses, a black leather trench coat, and a t-shirt with a grey alien's face printed on it. Postal Dude lives in a trailer park in the small town of Paradise, Arizona, with his nagging wife, who is identified in the credits as simply, the 'Postal Dude's ♥♥♥♥♥'. The game's levels are split into days of the week starting Monday and finishing Friday.\nAt the beginning of each day, Postal Dude is given several tasks to accomplish, such as 'get milk', 'confess sins', and other seemingly mundane tasks. The object of Postal 2 is to finish all of the tasks throughout the week, and the player can accomplish these tasks in any way he or she wishes, be it as peaceful and civilly as possible, or as violent and chaotically as possible. It is possible, if occasionally difficult, to complete most tasks without engaging in battle, or at least, harming or killing other characters, as evidenced by the game's tagline: "Remember, it's only as violent as you are!". The daily tasks can be accomplished in any order the player desires, and the game also includes one task that is activated only when Postal Dude urinates, in which the player is tasked with getting treatment for gonorrhea after Postal Dude discovers he has the infection.\nThroughout the course of the game, Postal Dude must put up with being provoked by other characters on a regular basis. He is given the finger, mugged, attacked by various groups of protesters, and is harassed by an obnoxious convenience store owner/terrorist and his patrons who cut before Postal Dude in the "money line". During the game, Postal Dude also encounters a marching band, a murderous toy mascot named Krotchy, the Paradise Police Department and its SWAT team, overzealous BATFE agents, the Arizona Army National Guard, an eccentric religious cult, cannibalistic butcher shop workers, fanatical Al-Qaeda terrorists, and former child actor Gary Coleman, among many others.\nBy Friday afternoon, the final day in the game, the apocalypse occurs and societal collapse soon follows, with all law and order breaking down. Cats begin to fall out of a darkly-colored sky, and almost everyone in town becomes heavily armed, with random gun battles breaking out in the streets. Despite this, Postal Dude returns home to his trailer as normal, where he then gets into an argument with his wife, who demands that Postal Dude explain why he never picked up the ice cream she asked for at the beginning of the game. Postal 2 then ends with a gunshot being heard, before being kicked to the end credits.\nGameplay\nOne of the major concepts of Postal 2 is that it is meant to be a "living world", a simulation of a tongue-in-cheek off-kilter town. Game characters live out their lives completely separate from the actions of Dude; walking around town, buying and selling merchandise, and even engaging in random shootouts with each other and the police.\nThe town features many cars but they are all "useless exploding props", according to Dude, and cannot be driven, although they can be blown up and sent flying into the air. In addition to cats and dogs, other animals present are elephants; these animals can be shot or set on fire—or simply annoyed by the player walking into them—causing them to trumpet with rage and attack anyone within stomping distance. A bizarre feature is the ability to pick up cats as an inventory item. When used, Postal Dude shoves the barrel of the currently equipped firearm into the cat's ♥♥♥♥  as a 'silencer'. Every time a shot is fired, the cat meows in apparent agony, and the gunshot is muffled. After nine shots the cat has run out of lives and it will fly from the end of the weapon. Most dogs have the ability to befriend the Dude if he feeds them a continual supply of dog biscuits or feeds them any other food . Once a canine's loyalty has been earned, the dog will attack anyone who attacks the Dude, or alternatively, anyone whom the Dude attacks. Dogs will also chase and kill cats, and play fetch with the Dude's inventory items and also severed heads. There were also going to be cows included in the game, but they were left unprogrammed. They did appear in Apocalypse Weekend and the A Week in Paradise modification.\nThe game also features a cameo by Gary Coleman, acting as himself, who appears early on as the objective of one of the game's tasks . The player can choose to fight and kill Coleman or simply have the book signed peacefully . If the book does get signed, the Dude remarks to Coleman that he really loved him in Facts of Life . Regardless of the Dude's actions, the police storm the building in an attempt to arrest Gary Coleman and a gunfight ensues which invariably results in Coleman's apparent demise, with or without the player's help. Later on in the game he can also be seen in the Police Station, when the player escapes from his cell he also frees everyone else—including Coleman, who can be seen running alongside Krotchy. Coleman apparently survives as he can be seen in the Apocalypse Weekend expansion, bandaged up in the hospital .\nRelease\nExpansions\nShare the Pain\nThe updated edition of the game, entitled Postal 2: Share the Pain included a multiplayer mode. The Macintosh and Linux versions of Postal 2 shipped only as Postal 2: Share the Pain. Share the Pain has since far eclipsed the original production version of Postal 2 in all markets. As part of a promotional effort to advertise the Postal film, in 2008 RWS released the multiplayer part of the game as freeware, minus the unrealed based level editor PostEd.\nApocalypse Weekend\nApocalypse Weekend is an expansion pack to Postal 2 released by Running with Scissors on August 1, 2004 for Microsoft Windows, and September 28, 2005 for the Mac OS X and Linux versions. Apocalypse Weekend expands the reaches of Paradise with new maps and missions, set on Saturday and Sunday, adds new weapons and foes, and raises the gore and violence to an even greater level. It was later included in both the Postal Fudge Pack and Postal X : 10th Anniversary compilations alongside Share the Pain and several fan produced mods, including A Week in Paradise which allows content from Apocalypse Weekend to appear in the original game as well as allowing the expansions levels to be played as part of the original five day campaign.\n","December 30, 2013","true","2.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Having last been committed to a mental asylum, we find the Postal Dude strangely sane with a much more placid view on life. Also, he seems to have married a bossy wife, moved into a trailer in Paradise, AZ gotten a job at a video game design and publishing company (RWS Inc.) and even still has his dog! Way to go, P. Dude! Unfortunately, Paradise seems to be about as stable as the cauldron of chemicals where gunpowder was accidentally invented.\nPostal 2 has a free-roaming environment with goals to be accomplished in no particular order, or even in no specified way. You, the Postal Dude, are given an errand list by your wife each day and must go accomplish your goals, like confessing your sins at church, picking up milk from the store, etc. However, every time you get close to accomplishing these things, something insane happens, like video game protesters raid your job office when you go to pick up your paycheck, or rednecks try to murder you when you buy somebody's favorite Christmas tree (in July). You then get to decide whether you want to be the pacifist and flee the scene, be the hero and fight off the bad guys or be the psycho and murder everyone you see. As RWS Inc. so proudly advertised, the game is only as violent as you are.\nThe graphics in this game are much more polished then the previous game, this time giving us a 3D first person environment to roam around in and a much more accurate targeting system. The music in the game, instead of only being frightening experimental percussion music like the first one, was actually collected from local bands in Tucson, the hometown  of Running With Scissors Inc. Being the sequel, the game also has a much bigger arsenal, ranging from military weapons to a variety of firearms, to many blunt and sharp objects to scissors and so on. The only real problem I have with this game is that nobody seems to be doing the multiplayer when I jump on, but maybe that's just me. Aside from that, if you have a strong stomach and are okay with offensive jokes delivered in a gruesome yet silly way, I highly recommend this game.","July 1, 2014","true","43.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I love games that keep me laughing, show complete and utter randomness that you forget that there's even a storyline behind it.\n\nUsually in games, I like to do what I'm supposed to do and try not to kill the A.I. this game however, it was just so entertaining to run around killing people with the dumbest sh*t imaginable. I would really like a Postal 2. I don't care about the graphics. In fact, you will end up having so much fun on this game that you will completely forget how bad the graphics are. It's like going back to the original Half Life but now it's actually fun.\n\nThe voice acting is hilariously stupid but I love it! Especially the main character's voice. The females on this game make me laugh my a** because they sound like (and I'm pretty sure that they actually were) they were used on 11 year old girls. The males also sound like they were acted by a teenage boy. The main character is just... just... Chuck Testa...

I've played over 500 games before in my life... And not a single one got laughing as hard as this one.\n\nI have a section in my Steam Library called, 'The Holy Game' and Garry's Mod is in there. That's about to change. This game is the best game I have ever played in my life! I love games that keep me laughing, show complete and utter randomness that you forget that there's even a storyline behind it.\n\nUsually in games, I like to do what I'm supposed to do and try not to kill the A.I. this game however, it was just so entertaining to run around killing people with the dumbest sh*t imaginable. I would really like a Postal 2. I don't care about the graphics. In fact, you will end up having so much fun on this game that you will completely forget how bad the graphics are. It's like going back to the original Half Life but now it's actually fun.\n\nThe voice acting is hilariously stupid but I love it! Especially the main character's voice. The females on this game make me laugh my a** because they sound like (and I'm pretty sure that they actually were) they were used on 11 year old girls. The males also sound like they were acted by a teenage boy. The main character is just... just... Chuck Testa... And Chuck Norris combined.\n\nThis game is so fantastic that it also deserves a list of the pros and cons:\n\nPros\n-Can use cats as gun attatchments\n-Can again cop niorety.\n-Can be jailed and escape unlike GTA where the cops just kill you\n-Can go in nearly every single room in the game.\n-Includes drugs\n-Steam Workshop\n-Variety of Game Modes\n-Different story lines\n-Killer cats\n-Pet dogs\n-Different weapons\n-Can remove limbs from bodies\n-Your drug trip without getting high\n-Can get high on cat nip\n-Police actually give you a chance to drop your gun unlike you know what\n-Police have different guns\n-Some civilians supprise you with a gun hidden in there a** crack.\n-Can rob a bank unlike you know what\n-Can have some good physics unlike you know what\n-Can blow up cars and make them go flying\n-Can kick people in the face\n-Includes Achievements\n-Can kick open doors\n-Includes zombies\n-Can stick sledgehammers up cows a**'s\n-Can die by cats\n-Can't die from stupid hights like in minecraft\n-Can lose limbs and still be alive (unless it's your head).\n\nCons\n-Bad Graphics\n\nBare in mind that I've only played half of the first day out of seven on only one game mode...\n\nThis is my largest review so far and this game deffinately deserves it! Well done to whoever made this, this is the best game I have ever played. I would reccomend this to anyone unless you're some boring fart who just wants to play World Of Warcraft all day.\n\nOverall I would rate this game:\n\n21/10\nWould smoke cat - nip again.","January 20, 2015","true","7.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It's very likely that it will always be that way, as no other developer has the balls to create such a piece of video game putrefaction. Its entire existence is solely based on enduring some of the most politically incorrect, disgusting, and shocking scenes ever programmed. As you should expect, it's a comedy game that doesn't really give a ♥♥♥♥ about its "videogameness". Nearly 100% of the development was spent on the shocking comedy aspect, and not much on gameplay. Typically, I do not enjoy those types of games, as I prefer my comedy games to at least still be a good game. But POSTAL 2, gameplay wise, only fails in a few areas.\n\nIn terms of open world exploration, scripted events, environments, and basically everything that makes a great open world game, POSTAL 2 excels extraordinarily. However, in terms of FPS mechanics... POSTAL 2 is severely lacking. Hitboxes are jacked up, weapons are unbalanced, everything is just a mess. It isn't too bothersome, but still one of the things that wounds this game from being taken seriously.\n\nPOSTAL 2 also has a large amount of typical gameplay bugs... but it seems that RWS wants it this way. I mean, after nearly 13 years of semi-consistent updates and rereleases, you would have expected them to fix it, right? Admittedly, these bugs are sort of funny when they happen, and they do give somewhat of a replay factor, but there's no excuse for poor game design.\n\nSpeaking of replay ability, this game has loads of it. It features an absurd amount of difficulties, different ways to complete missions, large open world environments, lots and lots of secrets and easter eggs, 88 clever achievements, and much more.\n\nIf you play through the full game, there are 7 days. Unfortunately, POSTAL 2 loses steam on the 6th day. What made the first 5 days great was the hilarious jokes, open world, everything that I previously mentioned. But on the 6th and 7th days, it's like they gave up and just put in a bunch of grindy filler that isn't really that funny or rewarding, it just makes you want to finally complete the game.\n\nOverall, I had and will continue to have a lot of fun playing POSTAL 2, but as a game it isn't too great. The amount you will enjoy this game really varies on your video game preferences. I recommend it, but take causion, as it might not be for you.\n\n6/10 - Good","January 10","true","29.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

It has some problems like hit detection, lots of load screens (on the plus side, they do load fairly quickly) and a mildly annoying warning screen when you first load the game up - Every time.\n\nThat being said, this game is just stupid fun.  It seems like every day you come across new weapons, my favourites being the hand axe and the sledgehammer.  The squidgy noise when someones head explodes is insanely satisfying.  You can light people on fire, ♥♥♥♥ on them to put them out, shove the barrel of you gun up a stray cats bumhole, chop off limbs, and use the world as your toilet.\n\nYou can also shoot terrorists if you're into playing the role of world police too.  Or if you picked up this game thinking it was your typical FPS and you can't go thirty seconds without shooting someone of a different race in the face.\n\nAll in all, Postal 2 is a stupid game that's meant to be stupid and succeeds very well in being just that.","May 25, 2014","true","11.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/itswar11/recommended/223470/","itswar11","itswar11 ジ","http://steamcommunity.com/id/itswar11/","660 products in account","Postal 2 is one of those games, sick, tasteless, and certainly not afraid to offend people. Postal 2 will definatly be considered a guilty pleasure by many players who enjoy the game. Postal 2 is a PC only game first released in April of 2003 and was developed by Running with Scissors. In Postal 2 you play as the Postal dude, a guy who lives in a caravan with his wife in a city known ironically enough as "Paradise", that's really it as far as story goes, it's pratically non-existant.\n\nThe game is divided up into 7 days; monday, tuesday, wednesday, thursday, friday, saturday and Sunday. In each day your objectives are to perform menial tasks such as buying milk, paying your speeding fine, all that kind of stuff. What makes each day interesting though, is that you have the freedom to go through these objectives as you see fit, do you try go through the game not laying harm upon an NPC? Or do you go Postal and kill everyone in your way, or kill as many people as you see fit.\n\nIf you do go the POSTAL route, there is a large varity of weapons ranging from shovels and mechetes, to M16 rifles and Remington shotguns, Jerry cans and stun guns, hunting rifles and Napalm launchers, the list goes on. If you are unsatisfied of the look of the M4 Carbines and/or Remington shotguns, you can always decorate them by putting a cat silencer onto the barrel.\n\nAt the end of most menial tasks something can go horribly wrong, such as while confessing your sins at a church, the church will be attacked by terrorists, and you gotta escape avoiding all the enemies, or kill all of them. I gotta say, the hit detection of most of the weapons are sometimes pretty hit-n-miss, for example using the shotgun isn't always an instant kill upon headshot, even at the closest range possible, the same case applys to the hunting rifle, although this issue never became too big or annoying enough to make me quit the game or yell in anger.\n\nIf you get caught by the police doing things you shouldn't you'll gain a wanted level and you gotta hide to reduce it until it runs out and you're free to roam about again, unless you get arrested in which case you gotta escape from prison, the cool part is that the wanted system also applies to NPCS, so watching other NPCS going postal never gets old.\nSpeaking of a wanted system you can also find a policeman's uniform and become a cop and perform all the crimes you want that aren't against cops.\n\nOh yeah you can pee in this game, I'm not joking, at any moment you can press the R key and start ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on things as much as you please, and if you forget to zip up your pants NPCS will remark at it saying things like "No one's impressed", "I've seen bigger", and "Hey! Mr Peepshow! Put your hands in the air!".\n\nAlso, I gotta mention the impressive fire system, when you got a Jerry Can, you can pour gasoline and pour pools of the stuff and ignite it when ready, when NPCS walk in the fire, they will often run at other NPCS which will set them on fire, until they turn into a burnt corpse holding on to their life.\n\nI gotta say though, the voice acting apart from the Postal dude is just horrendous, all the NPCS sound like they have the same voice just with a different pitch and often talk like this; "Hi, That'll be. 400. Bucks.". The Postal dude, while has some bad lines, still makes up for it by having a sort of personality with many lines, such as "Somebody stole my donut! now you're all gonna pay!".\n\nThe A.I. is also pretty bad, regularly forgetting to shoot their gun at me and getting in the way a lot.\n\nThe world itself is very open and you can go anywhere as you see fit as long as the game lets you because some areas are inaccessable until a day such as friday or wednesday, if you're out of money and you don't feel like getting it the legal way, you can always head to the Paradise Bank and go inside the vault and empty it out stealing hundreds of $. You pretty much can do whatever you want at anypoint of the game. Also, 90% of buildings in Postal 2 you can enter, so if you feel like it, you can go around and literally kick open most doors in the game, or if you're too cool to go through the door you can always kick through the windows. Since the world is so open, it encourages a lot of exploration, which rewards explorers with weapons, items, and some secret areas.\n\nSoundwise, there isn't really any music in the game aside from some ambiance inside of a store, all the weapons got a nice ring to them, and the voice acting is again terrible.\n\nGraphically, the game for it's time looked "okay", by today's standards it definatly look's dated but never really subtracted the experience for me.\n\nAlso Garry Coleman is in this game, no seriously check it out.\n\nOverall, I can't say I can recommend this game to everybody, I mean I've enjoyed it a large amount and I'm glad it focuses more on fun rather than fancy graphics or voice acting, but much of the humor is usually about toilet humor, homosexuals, rednecks, Arab-Terrorists, some sterotypes, animal cruelty that kind of stuff. I mean hell this game is known as one of the most offensive games to come out for a reason which caused it to get outright banned in countries such as Australia and New Zealand. Althought if you can get by the of childish humor, I'm sure you might have a blast with the game, I know I did.\n\nDid I mention Uwe Boll made a movie about this game?\n\nPostal 2 sure defines the term "Guilty Pleasure"\n\n7/10","January 17, 2014","true","36.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Postal 2 actually supersedes a lot of current releases when it comes to it's fluid physics for water, gasoline and even ♥♥♥♥.\n\nThe Steam version of Postal 2 includes the core game of Postal 2, Postal 2: Share The Pain (The Multiplayer Component), Postal 2: Apocalypse Weekend (an expansion pack for the original Postal 2 released back in 2005 which adds Sunday and Saturday), and finally Postal 2: A Week in Paradise (A mod developed by Resurrection Studios which adds the ability to play through both the core game of Postal 2 and Apocalypse Weekend in one sitting, with additional weapons such as the Chainsaw).\n\nIf you want the Eternal Damnation mod you will either have to pick up The Fudge Pack (which also includes Postal 1, and other additional content like game trailers released prior E3), or download it for free and install it as an addon for your Postal 2 Steam Version of the game. This also doesn't include Akella's officially unofficial Штопор Жжот addon released back in 2005.\n\nShare The Pain could USE some (a lot actually) updates, it doesn't seem it has been updated ever since it's release as freeware in 2008; resulting in terrible connection problems, frequent disconnects, and barren list of servers. But Postal 2 is all about the Singleplayer experience, however, a mod or an expension implementing Co-Op would be a long-awaited and a welcome feature, allowing you to play the entire week with your friends would be a blast and add a lot of hours to anyone's playthroughs with additional replayabilty value to it's Singleplayer "campaign".\n\nOverall, this is a great game and still gives me a massive nostalgia boost.","April 12, 2015","true","1.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Violent. But seriously - this is the best game ever made. Maybe I see something more in it than just senseless killing. I see satirical parody of our society, politicians, activists and so on. Postal 2 despises our authorities and religion. It's making fun from everything and everyone, especially from various activists against violent video games or something equally ridiculous. Activists fighting against books have "Save a Tree! Burn a Book!" motto and there are even activists with anti-RWS texts. Another awesome thing is AI of people, who react to situations differently. And freedom of movement around the city, so you will get into unique situations even without doing anything. Also Postal Dude has a legendary quotes. Simply the best game of our age, although only few people will understand.

Plus it just didn't look that interesting.\n\nWell, finally tried it and I gotta say that it does offend just to offend. To be fair, much of what you see in this game, you find as easter eggs in major titles nowerdays (like GTA, which borrows a lot from Postal).  And of course the whole open world, shot who you want type of thing is GTA's bread and butter.\n\nSo, does it work? The game is entertaining and if you can get past the old graphics, its definately worth playing. On all max settings its ok. Gameplay is old-school, but fun.  Has crashed to desktop a bunch of times, which sucks.\n\nFinal word, play it to see what the fuss was all about and see if you still think its that offensive.

His week isn't spent behind enemy lines as a guerilla soldier, or fighting off an alien invasion. Postal Dude is spending this week around his own neighborhood, doing mundane errands like cashing his paycheck, buying milk, grabbing some meat for a BBQ, and so on. As it turns out, everyone in Paradise, Arizona is either a jerk, a maniac, a terrorist, or Gary Coleman. On top of that, you're one sandwich short of a six-pack.\n\nTo give you an idea of how the average play-through will go. I'll describe one of my misadventures.\n\n-On the way to getting Gary Coleman's autograph, I murdered several people and batted their heads around with a shovel. The police showed up and threw me in prison. They didn't see the murders, but I couldn't suppress the urge to urinate on them.\n-Escaping from prison was surprisingly easy. On the way out I scored a police uniform, raided their armory, and...urinated on everyone. I don't have issues, honest!\n-I doused a club in gasoline and set everyone on fire. There were a couple survivors, thanks to my quick thinking. After urinating on them to put out the fires, I revived them with the stun gun. They have 4th degree burns though so...hmm.\n-Finally I arrived at the mall. There was a long line for Gary's autograph. Instead of waiting I killed someone that just got their book signed. No urinating was involved this time.\n\nThis is an open-ended game, and there are always non-violent solutions for every task. In fact you can even complete the game without killing anyone. Taking the easy way out tends to be more fun though. At the very least you'll have to break into a few houses and swipe everyone's kevlar vests, fast food, and crack to keep yourself alive.\n\nSaturday and Sunday make up the expansion portion of the game. This...well..this really isn't good. Every other day is open-ended, there's a sense of exploration, and fun to be had in goofing around. The weekend consists of more traditional FPS levels. They're really linear, and you have to deal with almost constant gun-fights. This gets old very quickly.\n\nPostal 2 is very much a product of its time as well. The jokes are tasteless (says the guy that urinates on burn victims!) and not at all timely. This version adds a bunch of achievements, with most of them being named after memes. Essentially this game was dated when it came out, and dated even more with its re-release. It's still entertaining and hilarious, just be careful who you talk to when you describe the game.","January 6, 2015","true","11.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Many people aren't aware of this game that has been banned in country after country, and thats both good and bad. Postal 2 is worth your time, but it also isn't. If you think using a cat as a silencer on your gun is funny, you may enjoy this. My only real complaint with this vulgar game is the constant loading screens as you transition from area to area. Luckily it is small, so a transfer to an SSD takes care of this effect qutie nicely. If you aren't easily offended, and in fact enjoy vulgarity, pick this up and enjoy.

I was like.. This must be a joke no way they're making a "DLC" for this game!.. But they did.. And with it, they revived the game, and revived me aswell.. Running with Scissors did an awesome job on bringing something that was made 12 years ago back. They're also so good at being massive douches to the other game devs and such.. But oh well.. The Paradise Lost DLC brought also a great thing, the power of this band named Stand With Fists, and metalhead myself, I had nothing but to like it.

You play the roll of a man we only know as the Postal Dude (we'll just call him Dude, for short.) following his day to day tasks everyday for a week. These can range from picking up milk to going to go pick up a parcel, but they always wind up going wrong in the worst way possible. Being a large change, and in a way, a step up from the original isometric shooter before this. Taking a first person perspective this go round, we follow the Dude through Paradise, Arizona as he runs into (and subsequently becomes hated by) many groups. Such as, anti game protesters, rednecks, and anti book protesters to name a few. The weapons are far more out there since the first game, adding a infected cow head and napalm launcher, along with a few other goodies. All in all, if you're not easily offended by over the top humor or violence, then this game should already be in your library.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drdraino/recommended/223470/","drdraino","Blood_Wraith","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drdraino/","681 products in account","Postal 2 is an openworld-esque game in roughly the same sense that Deus Ex is: Fairly large maps with a loading screen every now and then. It's an errand objective based game spanning across 7 days in where you do a different set of errands in (mostly) any order each day. Errands, which go incredibly wrong most of the time, and involve very much violence.\n\nThe game has an inventory system of sorts with pretty much no limit except for ammocounts, items include things such as: Healing items ranging from a simple doughnut, to an overpowered health capping drug, as well as catnip which can be used as a bullet time drug, and cats which can literally be used as shotgun silencers. There's also healthkits you can pickup and use immediately, but not carry around in your inventory. The Postal Dude would rather carry an armada of cats and enough fastfood to kill America, but not something sensible like healthkits. Absolutely no complaints here.\n\nThis has something in common with Shadow Warrior and the Jedi Knight Star Wars games, in that they both have firearms and a really awesome melee weapon(s) you use all the time because it's more effective and more fun, and tons more of decapitations.\n\nThere's tons of melee weapons, guns, and things to set on fire. If you catch on fire, you can ♥♥♥♥ in the air to put yourself out. You can also pour gasoline everywhere in funny shapes and set it on fire to display something stupid, and then set everyone on fire. And then ♥♥♥♥ it all out.\n\nAt one point I got some soldiers I rescued from a secret terrorist base to sign a petition to make whiny old congressmen play violent video games. I couldn't be any happier when this happened.\n\nThe game's feel and engine is somewhere between Half-Life and Deus Ex and something else. Old crunchy feel to the levels (but not quite that old), and the silly movement bob when you move. Except Postal Dude can take seemingly even more damage than Gordon Freeman himself. All those years of drug abuse must have weaved some sort of kevlar equivalent into his skin or something.\n\nAlso, at one point, the developers amazingly decided to release an expansion for this game 10+ years after it came out, kind of like how Age of Empires II got new DLC itself. Still can't believe either of those happened.\n\nGame kind of runs like trash at times, especially when too many NPCs are thinking, like fighting things and just generally freaking out. I've had 2 crashes in the main game in my roughly 12 hours of playing, so the game is stable enough.\n\nSo yeah, it's a violent classic. Go buy it and cause chaos, or be a pacifist and just do errands, or something.","June 3","true","23.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

It's a very rough, outdated and primitive game. This doesn't mean it's not worth your time or money. Postal 2 is simply phenominal. The story is almost non-existent, you play as a middle aged american badass doing chores for his fat wife. You can do this peacefully like a goody two shoes or you can show some balls and shoot the ♥♥♥♥ out of everyone with plenty of unique and awesome weapons. You can ♥♥♥♥ on people, you can meet and/or brutally murder child star Gary Coleman, you can do just about anything you want.

I recently obtained a newer PC & after finally getting this game again I can happily say, it has aged gloriously! Postal 2 completely blows it's nose with the first game and it's story and starts something hilarious. While Postal was about the dude going on a city wide killing spree featuring dark psychotic tones, the sequel is the dude just trying to live out a week in his city while dealing with a completely exaggerated but hilarious enviroment. The levels are broken up into days of the week and it's semi free roam, meaning you can go where you want but certain areas don't open up until a later day. The game, at first on the easier difficulties, really is as violent as you are until your forced to deal with one of the many hate groups you encounter over the week. Postal 2 has alot of replay value too, when you beat it you can play through again in Enhanced mode which just makes the game pure gold.\n\nThe Steam Support for this game is incredible. 68+a few hidden Achievements,Multiplayer,Workshop Support, and Steam Cards. Also comes with a Level Editor!\n\nPerformance wise the game looks great for being over 10 years old!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gorblats/recommended/223470/","Gorblats","▼ Gorblats","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gorblats/","119 products in account","Postal 2 is one of my favorite games of all time.\n\nThere are quite a few misconceptions regarding Postal 2. I've talked to people that have never played the game and they thought all you did in the game was kill people. That is incorrect. Yes, there is pretty much no story, only mundane tasks like cashing in your check from work, and picking up your laundry. A lot of the time, something crazy happens, like while you're cashing in your paycheck, the bank get's robbed and the cops and robbers get into a shootout, or video game conservatives raid the game developer's HQ that you just got fired from.\n\nYes, there are tons of weapons. Yes, the game is VERY gorey. But in a way, Postal 2 is less violent than Grand Theft Auto. Grand Theft Auto has missions that literally tell you to go to X, kill Y. Postal 2 doesn't. It gives you a very large arsonal of weapons, but that's it. They never tell you to USE those weapons.\n\n"The game is only as violent as you are."\n\nNow, onto why this is one of my favorite games of all time...\n\nIt's bloody fun, no pun intended.\n\nThere have been days where I have just felt awful. I had a bad day, and just wanted to release some stress. So I'd hop on Postal 2, and go on a murderous rampage. About 30 minutes - an hour later, i'd feel refreshed and in a better mood. This game is the greatest stress ball ever created.\n\nThe combat is fun, the AI isn't very good, but still serviceable. The enemies range from angry protestors, rednecks, and of course, police.\n\nI really like the police in this game. They act like actual police, unlike Grand Theft Auto, where it's more of a parody of police. Also, you have the option to surrendor and get arrested. You are then placed in a cell, with all of your weapons stripped away. You can break out and steal your weapons back.\n\nI also really like the map. It's not very big, but certainly not small. Especially considering you only walk in this game, there are no vehicles. You can find some pretty messed up things through out the map. I once found a backyard that had an entire family with their bodies burned to a bloody crisp, with a rotting cow head placed on; what looked like a religous artifact.\n\nThis game is very bloody and gorey, but you can disable it if it's too intense for you.\n\nRunning With Scissors earned my respect from this game. They didn't give a damn about political correctness, or what people thought of them and the game. They simply made the game they wanted.\n\nWhile I absolutely love this game, and know a few people that do as well... I also know a few people that despise this game. I really can't recommend this game to everybody. I can see why people would be offended by this game, but just remember... It's a computer game.\n\n8.5/10.\n\n\n\n\n\nBoy, why did I write such a long review? No one EVER reads my reviews :\","July 7, 2014","true","34.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

I bought Postal 2 11+ years ago in a gamestop store for $50 when it was only a singleplayer game and I was just freshly addicted to pc gaming. Was hooked on the game from the 1st 5 minutes in as it was the most outragous game I'd ever played at that point. Hacking heads off with a shovel and kicking them around like soccer balls, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in people's faces until they puked, pouring gas all over a bunch of "alternative lifestyle" people dancing in a gay bar and setting them on fire, training stray dogs to attack anyone who attacked me.....and that's just during day 1.\nBasically you live 5 days in the life of "The Postal Dude" and although you have a few chores to do each day that allow you to progress to the next day, the game is totally non-linear and open world. You play how you want to play and at what pace and spend as much time as you want exploring and discovering (and there's lot's to discover) as you want.\nThen they finally released "Share the Pain", the version of Postal 2 that included multiplayer. Even though the network code wasn't the greatest and it was always a little buggy it quickly became my most played game for the next couple years. I started a clan, started running game servers for the 1st time, and eventually learned the unreal editor and made probably around 30 custom mp maps for the game.\nAnyway to make a long story medium, even though the multiplayer community is scarce and pretty much nothing but super modded servers, the single player part of the game is well worth $10 any day of the week. The game is still being updated and patched often more then 11 years later and RWS is about to release a new expansion to the story/game which is looking even better then the original.\nIf you aren't easily offended, love to laugh your ♥♥♥ off, and want to ♥♥♥♥ in a cops face then buy this game now!","April 3, 2015","true","16.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

How many cats will you penetrate? Will you really need that chainsaw? Where did you get that severed head? When did you become addicted to crack? These are just some of the questions you'll have to answer in Postal 2.\n\nIf you've ever wanted to cut someones head off and then urinate on it, guess what? You're NOT alone! In Postal 2 you can meet like minded people, share tips on how best to humilate, abuse, mutilate and cause general suffering to.... Anyone!\n\nPersonally, I enjoy urinating in someones face untill they start vomiting violently, then I give them a full charge from a tazer and watch them lose control of thier bladder while convulsing on the floor in a puddle of thier own vomit and urine. Then I take a lovely little break, smoke a crack pipe, eat a slice of 'za, maybe even have a doughnut and then it's back to work. I'll take the hedge trimmers I borrowed from a neighbor (after I cut his head off with a machete) and remove thier hands and feet one by one, if they survive that I'll take off thier arms and legs and sometimes, they even survive that, so I'll cut them in half.\n\nOnce a cop survived! No arms, no legs and cut in half, as his guts slowly started to seep out and he was crying, I thought I better not miss an oppertunity, so I dropped my trousers and bust one out up the wall, when I was done, shame ejected, I covered him in petrol, throw a match on him, and left. I had made it to the shop and bought some milk, now I just needed to get home......\n\nBut that's another story........\n\nPostal 2! It's ****ing bat**** crazy! You'd be crazy to not play it!

Finally decided to buy it and try for myself. I wasn't expecting much in terms of gameplay but am I in for a surprise. 10 years on and I have to say I haven't played a game this fun for a long while. Yes, it's very crude and sets out to offend, and production values are pretty low, but that's actually the point, and in fact where the wacky fun comes in. I don't play video games to be polictically correct!\n\nThe very wide variety of weapons and items in an open world with plenty of NPC in-fighting allows for creative play which IMHO is unmatched by any game in recent history. The fact that you can wee on yourself to put out a flesh fire is unprecedented (and dare I say, unlikely to be replicated) in gaming history and reason enough to experience this game.\n\nThey simply don't make games like this anymore.

Everything about this game just screams quality: the vast array of weapons, the irreverent humor, and especially the choices you can make. Like murdering anything that gets in your way? Please do. Maybe you're a peaceful person? Everything can be done without shedding a drop of innocent blood. What Running With Scissors has done here is create more than just a game. Having played this game, I can say that this is more than just a fun-filled, gory romp through a brilliantly satirical American city; it's a philosophical statement. A modern day transcendentalist piece, if it pleases you. Still, a great number of close-minded people do not see this masterpiece for what it truly is.\n\nMany simply take the game at face value and see nothing but another violent video game for another crazy loner to take inspiration from. You might be one of these people, but if you aren't, then it's likely that you can also see the brilliant charicature of our society that Running With Scissors has implanted into this glorious bundle of code. For what it's worth, I have to say that this game is quite possibly the greatest I have ever played. Anything else pales in comparison to this magnificently crafted, engaging shooter. Maybe you still aren't convinced? I'd say take a look at the immense value here: buying this game gives you hours and hours of fun action, with Steam workshop support to keep the fun going, not to mention that Running With Scissors still updates the game after 11 years, and the game is constantly on sale for a very, very reasonable price. Like fun, value, and perhaps a deeper, philosophical statement on our society and humanity at large?

How many cats will you penetrate? Will you really need that chainsaw? Where did you get that severed head? When did you become addicted to crack? These are just some of the questions you'll have to answer in Postal 2.\n\nIf you've ever wanted to cut someones head off and then urinate on it, guess what? You're NOT alone! In Postal 2 you can meet like minded people, share tips on how best to humilate, abuse, mutilate and cause general suffering to.... Anyone!\n\nPersonally, I enjoy urinating in someones face untill they start vomiting violently, then I give them a full charge from a tazer and watch them lose control of thier bladder while convulsing on the floor in a puddle of thier own vomit and urine. Then I take a lovely little break, smoke a crack pipe, eat a slice of 'za, maybe even have a doughnut and then it's back to work. I'll take the hedge trimmers I borrowed from a neighbor (after I cut his head off with a machete) and remove thier hands and feet one by one, if they survive that I'll take off thier arms and legs and sometimes, they even survive that, so I'll cut them in half.\n\nOnce a cop survived! No arms, no legs and cut in half, as his guts slowly started to seep out and he was crying, I thought I better not miss an oppertunity, so I dropped my trousers and bust one out up the wall, when I was done, shame ejected, I covered him in petrol, throw a match on him, and left. I had made it to the shop and bought some milk, now I just needed to get home......\n\nBut that's another story........\n\nPostal 2! It's ****ing bat**** crazy! You'd be crazy to not play it!

Or fighting a quiki-mart manager for calling you a "infedel". Then finding out he has 21 virgin terrorist babes with guns upstairs. And even burning a whole marching band, watching them burn alive, then stand there as they all try to crawl away charred and mangled. This game is hours of stupid fun.

A classic game full of violence and opportunity to get very politically incorrect. This game can be quite offensive, but that's actually part of the whole thing. Nothing is sacred here, and you're virtually free to do whatever you want, as violently as you want it! This game follows the Postal Dude as he goes through various errands for his highly demanding wife through the week, and the apocalypse weekend. Plenty of politically incorrect humor abounds here, and the devs even make fun of themselves from the get go. You can tell these guys have a wild sense of humor, and the game gets pretty hilariously violent. I consider it a nice cult classic you should definetly try if you're up for an FPS that's rude, insensitive, and makes fun of everything.\n\nYou know a game is good when you can pick it up 10 years after it's initial release, and still find it incredibly fun and engaging. The best part is, it just recieved a bunch of huge updates recently! Tons of new features, new weapons, and ongoing bug fixes! This definetly makes this game even more worthwhile then it allready was.","November 26, 2013","true","99.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

For example, one of your first errands buying milk can be completed in 3 ways:\n\n1) Walk inside the shop, get milk, wait in a line, pay 5$ for it.\n2) Walk inside the shop, get milk, don't bother waiting in the line and just steal the milk.\n3) Walk inside the shop, get milk, kill everyone in the shop, get into the back room and steal everything you can.\n\nAfter completing the game, you can replay it. On higher difficulties or with a different play style.\n\nThere are fun achievements, that actually make you play the game in a different way.\n\nThere is multilayer and there is a strong modding community that makes awesome maps and mods.\n\nAnd finally. you help making Postal 4 a reality. A true sequel that the fans deserve. Something that RWS will develop in the house and make it even more awesome than Postal 2 (if such a thing is even possible).\n\nDo I need to say more?\n\nTL;DR Version: Buy it! Or I will follow you home and kill your dog. I'm not kidding. :P","April 7, 2013","true","123.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

If you have one of those jobs, especially in the customer service field, where you have to deal with imbeciles on a daily basis to the point where you've felt ready to snap, then Postal 2 is definitely for you. You don't even need to follow the storyline to enjoy the game. You can play at your leisure and just have fun blowing fools away or tearing them a new one. There is a wide array of weapons to choose from. Everything from a shovel to napalm, M-16s and SMGs to a boomerang-machete and even the sickle of the Grim Reaper himself. Though I will warn of animal cruelty and violence prevalent in the game series. The game series is amazing. I love it, though it isn't for the faint of heart.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Deadmano/recommended/223470/","Deadmano","[AAO] Deadmano","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Deadmano/","525 products in account","Postal 2 takes everything you love in video games (like peeing on enemy corpses that you've slaughtered and playing fetch using a severed head with your best friend to name but a few) and integrates it seamlessly in an open-world anarchist humour-fest.\n\nDo I pay for things and conform to society? Or do I smash their heads in and get things done however I see fit? Do I set them on fire then proceed to pee on them to extinguish the fire only to stab them repeatedly with a pair of scissors? Do I run and hope for the best or do I shove a shotgun barrel up a kittens sacred region as a make-shift silencer and take everyone out? These are but a few of the vast choices you will be making, and at the end of the day who said anyone had to die? It's all about completing the tasks, whichever way you see fit.\n\nWhile the regular Postal 2 gameplay is quite mellow, if you're looking for serious action (Resident Evil meets Silent Hill) from start till finish that will keep you on the edge of your seat and which resembles more of a quick-paced Half-Life run I'd thoroughly recommend the Apocalypse Weekend mode (after you've completed the main Monday-Friday run of course, to get into the swing of things as Postal 2 isn't your normal shooter and takes a bit of getting used to).\n\nAll in all, for a game that was released in 2003 (over 10 years ago!) the constant updates (up until this very year, over 10 years later) have only improved the content tenfold, from better graphical support (widescreen now available!) to bug fixes and gameplay improvement you're guaranteed a smooth transition into what is certainly one of the best first person shooters around. Do yourself a favour and give Postal 2 a try, you can't go wrong.","February 19, 2014","true","17.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

A classic game full of violence and opportunity to get very politically incorrect. This game can be quite offensive, but that's actually part of the whole thing. Nothing is sacred here, and you're virtually free to do whatever you want, as violently as you want it! This game follows the Postal Dude as he goes through various errands for his highly demanding wife through the week, and the apocalypse weekend. Plenty of politically incorrect humor abounds here, and the devs even make fun of themselves from the get go. You can tell these guys have a wild sense of humor, and the game gets pretty hilariously violent. I consider it a nice cult classic you should definetly try if you're up for an FPS that's rude, insensitive, and makes fun of everything.\n\nYou know a game is good when you can pick it up 10 years after it's initial release, and still find it incredibly fun and engaging. The best part is, it just recieved a bunch of huge updates recently! Tons of new features, new weapons, and ongoing bug fixes! This definetly makes this game even more worthwhile then it allready was.","November 26, 2013","true","99.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

How many cats will you penetrate? Will you really need that chainsaw? Where did you get that severed head? When did you become addicted to crack? These are just some of the questions you'll have to answer in Postal 2.\n\nIf you've ever wanted to cut someones head off and then urinate on it, guess what? You're NOT alone! In Postal 2 you can meet like minded people, share tips on how best to humilate, abuse, mutilate and cause general suffering to.... Anyone!\n\nPersonally, I enjoy urinating in someones face untill they start vomiting violently, then I give them a full charge from a tazer and watch them lose control of thier bladder while convulsing on the floor in a puddle of thier own vomit and urine. Then I take a lovely little break, smoke a crack pipe, eat a slice of 'za, maybe even have a doughnut and then it's back to work. I'll take the hedge trimmers I borrowed from a neighbor (after I cut his head off with a machete) and remove thier hands and feet one by one, if they survive that I'll take off thier arms and legs and sometimes, they even survive that, so I'll cut them in half.\n\nOnce a cop survived! No arms, no legs and cut in half, as his guts slowly started to seep out and he was crying, I thought I better not miss an oppertunity, so I dropped my trousers and bust one out up the wall, when I was done, shame ejected, I covered him in petrol, throw a match on him, and left. I had made it to the shop and bought some milk, now I just needed to get home......\n\nBut that's another story........\n\nPostal 2! It's ****ing bat**** crazy! You'd be crazy to not play it!

The design of the main game is great, wandering around the town feels great, theres plenty to explore in the sandbox world, plenty to see and find and loads of hidden easter eggs. At no point does the gamespace feel samey or confusing. The actual structure of the main game works brilliantly too.\n\nEach day you are given seemingly 'Mundane' tasks to complete such as 'Get Milk', 'Get Paycheck' and the like. However it openly gives you the option on what YOU want to do to complete the missions. Do you want to be a pacifist and try and run through the game without killing? You can do that! Do you want to just go 'Postal' and shoot up the place? Yep! Do you want to cash yoyr 'Paycheck' by robbing the bank? Its all there.\n\nWhere the bad comes in however is some of the gameplay, the actual engine isnt smooth, there isnt really any music of any note at all and the graphics have aged quite badly over the years. Bugs are aplenty as well, both annoying bugs and gamebreaking bugs are present with plenty of clipping, invisible walls, AI bugging out and wanted levels that refuse to vanish no matter what you do (or dont do). The other big 'Bad' comes with the weekend addon that destroys the open ended gameplay of the original week and forces you down a specific path.\n\nOh and lets not forget the 'Offensive' nature of the game which may put some people off totally. Here we have blood, sex, drugs, using cats as silencers, camp stereotypes, arab stereotypes, urine, feces and the (now made even more potentially offensive given he is dead) appearance of Gary Coleman (And yes, you can murder him ingame too). Essentially avoid if you are offended easily or even moderately.\n\nAnd that about wraps it up. Once again. Thumbs up, Thumbs down and hard to just say right out if its bad or good.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brotmeister/recommended/223470/","Brotmeister","Hans Brotmeister","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brotmeister/","352 products in account","Postal 2 is an open world first person shooter. Calling it a first person shooter is at least the most fitting term for the game since although it features a lot of melee weapons and can even be finished without shooting at all - at least on lower difficulty settings. It is very different from the first Postal game which was a rather dark top down shooter that was broken  up into various levels where the sole objective was to take out all opponents.\n\nPostal 2 takes place in a small town called "Paradise". You play as Postal Dude (that is his actual name, I swear) who lives in a trailer with his wife and his dog. He is rather unsatisfied with his current life. He is completely broke, he is the only person in the neighborhood who lives in a trailer, his wife constantly yells at him, his car barely works anymore. He just started at a new job in games development (guess which company) though. Will that help him to get his life back in order?\n\nThe gameplay of Postal 2 is split up into five days, starting on Monday. Every day Postal Dude gets a number of tasks that must be completed to proceed to the next day. Many tasks are given by his wife but some are his own decision. A majority of the task are rather mundane, for example cashing in your paycheck, buying milk, getting a christmas tree or buying meat for a barbeque or going to your uncle Dave's birthday party. While none of this sound like a pretty exciting  activity the town of Paradise is full of people who would go ballistic over the most trivial things. So even the most mundane task may end up with Postal Dude either running for his life or being forced to kill everybody in the vicinity. At the beginning of the game you just have to be aware of random people starting fights but every day after completing certain quests Postal Dude gets an additional group of enemies who hate his guts so much that they would attack him on sight without thinking twice. Luckily the law enforcement is just as violent as the other citizens and might be a great ally in cases like that. If you start funny business yourself however they will not hesitate shooting you either. You can tackle all tasks at your own pace and explore the town. Exploration is really rewarding since you might find weapons and items that would not be available yet otherwise and might give you a real edge over your enemies. Also, there are small eastereggs jokes and references hidden all over the place.\n\nWhile the first Postal game featured rather dark themes Postal 2 is full of silly over the top humour. Also it might be the most offensive game ever created. The game depicts various groups of society as exaggerated stereotypical caricatures: Censorship advocates, Christians, Muslims, gays, bankers, animal rights activists, policemen, New Age religions - nobody leaves unscathed. (I will tell you a little secret: You can lure policemen by dropping a donut on the ground.) If I needed to compare the humour of Postal 2 to anything I would probably say South Park.\n\nOn his quest to survive the week Postal Dude can rely on a huge arsenal of tools and weapons. Melee weapons like tasers, shovels, scythe, machetes or sledgehammers as well as ranged weapons like scissors, pistols, shotguns, napalm launchers, rocket launchers, grenades, infectious cow heads (which spread an unpleasant disease) and molotov cocktails. On top of that you can just kick people. There's another "weapon" in Postal Dude's arsenal that should not be left unmentioned: Pee. He can open his pants and just let go. It does not deal any damage but it can stun people briefly if you hit them right in the face. Also, it causes people to either scream at you, flee, attack you or just puke. While this sounds like nothing than an easteregg peeing can be vital to your survival. Fire based weapons are extremely dangerous and when you ever find yourself being on fire you better pee straight up in the air so you can extinguish the flames. It can also be used to clear flames blocking your path or to extinguish burning people other than yourself.\n\nAs mentioned before there are various tools and items to utilize. Dog biscuits can be used to befriend dogs and make them follow you around. Catnip can NOT be used to befriend cats. Instead you can consume it yourself to slow down the world around you. Cats however can be picked up and either be used as erratic tornadoes of fur and claws (keep your distance) or as silencers to put on your shotgun or assault rifle. A fishing radar comes in handy to show you the position of nearby enemies. Also there are various items that restore health like donuts, pizza or "Health Pipes" - be warned though, they are addictive.\n\nThere is one gripe I have with the game. Some weapons feel really underwhelming. There is basically no point to some of the melee weapons (for example the shovel) as soon as you found a higher tier one. Also the standard shotgun and assault rifle feel to weak.\n\nThe town of Paradise feels incredibly alive. Bystanders will walk around the place, talk to each other and either go their merry way or start a fight. If they see corpses they will run away or start vomiting. If they see you in an embarassing situation they will laugh at you. Also, it is entirely possible that huge fights break out without the player having done anything to cause them. Considering when the game came out this is impressively done and really conveys what kind of town we are talking about here. The title Postal does not need to refer solely to the main character but can also be seen as representative of Paradise and its citizens. Postal Dude would have all reason to give up and despair but he rather reacts with snarky sarcasm which makes him kind of likeable. I he goes postal eventually depends on the player but believe me, this town will put your patience to a test.\n\nThis re-released version of Postal 2 comes with the add-on Apocalypse Weekend that covers Saturday and Sunday. The playstyle is a little different though. Apokalypse Weekend still has the humour of the base game as well as some really neat new ideas and mechanics. Sadly it drops the open world exploration aspect completely and often comes down to tunnel shooter levels and arena fights. It is also a problem that the two most "standard shooter like" levels are among the longest of the expansion. Do not get me wrong though. It is well worth playing, I just feel that it cannot hold a candle to the base game.\n\nFor the re-release of Postal 2 the developers added several weapons, mechanics and cosmetic tweaks. Some of those had been featured before in community made mods. The developers really went and asked the modders if they were okay with the mods being included in the main game. That's what I call being in touch with the fans.\n\nAlso, after the re-release being financially quite successful the developers decided that they could afford to work on a second expansion pack for Postal 2 which is by now released and available as DLC. As far as I know releasing an official expansion ten years after the base game came out is completely unheard of. If this doesn't proof incredible dedication to the fanbase I do not what does.\n\nWhat's more, the expansion called Paradise Lost is much closer to the base game than Apocalypse Weekend was. It also features additional content and improvements some of which have been retroactively added to the base game.\n\nLong story short if you have not played Postal 2 yet you should give this classic a try. If the humour is not for you or you are easily offended you might not like it. Otherwise it is well worth your time. If you have played Postal 2 before and liked it you should also pick this version up since it is a step up from the original version in every area.\n\nMore reviews here","April 22, 2015","true","60.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

People who never played GTA before (like me) would totally get a kick out of this game.\n\nDespite its many difficulty options, POSTAL 2 is a very easy game in my opinion. Only some bystanders have weapons, and the police officers just try to arrest you for no reason! But hey, you play as the Postal Dude, an ordinary guy who just wants to finish his errands and go home, But in the eyes of Paradise's citizens,  they see the Dude as a no good smartass Hitler type tyrant. Well, thats kind of true, if you played the original POSTAL game from 1997 and witnessed how he noticed HE was a bleedin' killer himself, andhe didn't care!\n\nWhat I really like about this game is that it's very GTA like and realistic. You can explore the open world of Paradise, and if you have any maps installed, you can explore those too. You can get suited up with guns and ♥♥♥♥, terrorizing the citizens and fighting the cops and trying to gey the hilarious toy character Krotchy down. And once you finish the game (the original game, not counting Apocalypse Weekend), you unlock cheats, and you can turn bystanders into Gary Colemans or Osamas, or load yoursef up with guns and an unlimited supply of ammo, and even get bonus health stuff whenever you want!\n\nAnd I wanna say the funniest thing about POSTAL 2 is that you can ♥♥♥♥ on people, and during the petition mission I asked a bystander to sign it and they said no nd I coaxed them three times, still said np and tats when as punishment, I made their day. I peed on them :D\n\n100000000/10 Would ♥♥♥♥ on Gary Coleman again","January 19, 2015","true","77.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

A classic game full of violence and opportunity to get very politically incorrect. This game can be quite offensive, but that's actually part of the whole thing. Nothing is sacred here, and you're virtually free to do whatever you want, as violently as you want it! This game follows the Postal Dude as he goes through various errands for his highly demanding wife through the week, and the apocalypse weekend. Plenty of politically incorrect humor abounds here, and the devs even make fun of themselves from the get go. You can tell these guys have a wild sense of humor, and the game gets pretty hilariously violent. I consider it a nice cult classic you should definetly try if you're up for an FPS that's rude, insensitive, and makes fun of everything.\n\nYou know a game is good when you can pick it up 10 years after it's initial release, and still find it incredibly fun and engaging.

How many cats will you penetrate? Will you really need that chainsaw? Where did you get that severed head? When did you become addicted to crack? These are just some of the questions you'll have to answer in Postal 2.\n\nIf you've ever wanted to cut someones head off and then urinate on it, guess what? You're NOT alone! In Postal 2 you can meet like minded people, share tips on how best to humilate, abuse, mutilate and cause general suffering to.... Anyone!\n\nPersonally, I enjoy urinating in someones face untill they start vomiting violently, then I give them a full charge from a tazer and watch them lose control of thier bladder while convulsing on the floor in a puddle of thier own vomit and urine. Then I take a lovely little break, smoke a crack pipe, eat a slice of 'za, maybe even have a doughnut and then it's back to work. I'll take the hedge trimmers I borrowed from a neighbor (after I cut his head off with a machete) and remove thier hands and feet one by one, if they survive that I'll take off thier arms and legs and sometimes, they even survive that, so I'll cut them in half.\n\nOnce a cop survived! No arms, no legs and cut in half, as his guts slowly started to seep out and he was crying, I thought I better not miss an oppertunity, so I dropped my trousers and bust one out up the wall, when I was done, shame ejected, I covered him in petrol, throw a match on him, and left. I had made it to the shop and bought some milk, now I just needed to get home......\n\nBut that's another story........\n\nPostal 2! It's ****ing bat**** crazy! You'd be crazy to not play it!

But hey, you play as the Postal Dude, an ordinary guy who just wants to finish his errands and go home, But in the eyes of Paradise's citizens,  they see the Dude as a no good smartass Hitler type tyrant. Well, thats kind of true, if you played the original POSTAL game from 1997 and witnessed how he noticed HE was a bleedin' killer himself, andhe didn't care!\n\nWhat I really like about this game is that it's very GTA like and realistic. You can explore the open world of Paradise, and if you have any maps installed, you can explore those too. You can get suited up with guns and ♥♥♥♥, terrorizing the citizens and fighting the cops and trying to gey the hilarious toy character Krotchy down. And once you finish the game (the original game, not counting Apocalypse Weekend), you unlock cheats, and you can turn bystanders into Gary Colemans or Osamas, or load yoursef up with guns and an unlimited supply of ammo, and even get bonus health stuff whenever you want!\n\nAnd I wanna say the funniest thing about POSTAL 2 is that you can ♥♥♥♥ on people, and during the petition mission I asked a bystander to sign it and they said no nd I coaxed them three times, still said np and tats when as punishment, I made their day. I peed on them :D\n\n100000000/10 Would ♥♥♥♥ on Gary Coleman again","January 19, 2015","true","77.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mblimbaum/recommended/223470/","mblimbaum","emblim","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mblimbaum/","293 products in account","IN BRIEF: Postal 2 is a great game and a great commentary of what games are supposed to be. After nearly 160 hours of playtime, I'm still not done. The game's extremely short length is balanced by the excellent use of steam achievements, frequent updates since its 2012 re-release, and its bizarre DLC.\n\n----\n\nSTORY: As silly as it is for me to write this, the story in Postal 2 is fairly subtle. Whether or not that is intentionally so is another issue altogether. You play as the Postal Dude getting his weekly chores done as the world around him gets more and more hostile and strange. It plays well into the themes of player choice and the motto: "It's only as violent as you are". The story however, is less about the Postal Dude himself and more about the developers' views on video games and political correctness (PC): Modern life is suddenly interrupted by suicide bombings in the post-9/11 world in which the game was released; videogame protestors are mocked as violent patrons of Joe Lieberman; The 1990’s intersection of appropriateness and coarse media are symbolized as crude children’s cartoons. Postal 2 is a recreation of Middle America caught between the 1990’s and the 21st century. The game’s commentary may be dated like its engine but timeless as history repeats itself and PC culture inevitably returns.\n\nTHEMES: Postal 2 mocks PC culture, videogames, and itself. Protestors, and the average person, are displayed as idiotic zealots and perverted buffoons. Videogames are slighted and misunderstood and at the same time misogynistic and hostile. The game enjoys pointing when good intentions largely serve to carry out bad results. Even developers Vince Desi and Mike J are depicted as, well, hostile idiotic misogynistic perverted buffoons. Postal 2 takes nothing seriously, including its own prequel: In Postal, Dude is out to destroy the world but in Postal 2, the world is out to destroy him. The Naked Gun-style contrast of serious people in a ridiculous world gives the game its sense of levity and fun, even when it’s so gruesome.\n\nGAMEPLAY: It’s easy to label Postal 2 as a crude Grand Theft Auto clone. It’s easy to assume the violent gameplay will get old within a few minutes. That all depends on what you’re looking for in a game. Yes, you can kill a few minutes doing some very violent things, get bored and forget about the game for a few months. You can also appreciate the world the game creates by finding unique weapons, wreaking havoc, evading police, and finding Tora Bora and a hidden sewer system. It’s the little jokes and easter eggs where Postal 2 shines. While you do have to go looking for these things - and it’s not a point in the game’s favor for the player to put effort into fun - you’ll enjoy the game a lot more. Did you know you can rob the police station?\n\nAs much as I recommend the game, and believe me, I do, the game does suffer a bit on Wednesday and Thursday. It seems the developers didn’t know how to raise the stakes, so they instead went ahead with basking in caricatures and obscene stereotypes. That said, the game picks back up to a satisfying finish on Friday. There is also no purpose for money in the game if the player takes the violent route. Apocalypse Weekend puts the player in a funnier, more ridiculous continuation of the world but suffers from the lack of open-world gameplay. The harder difficulties can be extremely frustrating, even for the experienced player, but the result is a more satisfying game and more consistently-raised stakes for the player (FYI, get the sawed-off shotgun on Thursday).\n\nSTEAM ACHIEVEMENTS: Postal 2 should be the gold standard for what achievements should be. They highlight the easter eggs and features of the game (correcting some of the gameplay issues mentioned earlier), and give the gameplay massive replay value for playing on the harder difficulty settings. It’s a great way to get players invested and immerse into the game.\n\nDLC: Apocalypse Weekend (AW) comes standard with Postal 2. While AW is more experimental and funnier than Postal 2, its linear gameplay and difficulty may turn off some players. Paradise Lost (PL) is a separate purchase DLC that is pretty much a new game. While I plan to write a full review for Paradise Lost as well, PL has Postal 2's themes and open-world with AW's characters and more ridiculous post-apocalypse setting. Paradise Lost is the strongest of the three games.\n\nDEVELOPERS: Running With Scissors have put a lot of work into updating this game for Steam, and it’s comforting to know there are still developers out there that care about their customers and their product. Postal 2 has received several updates and bugfixes since its launch on Steam. Controller support was even added. However, the game still has bugs at times, especially crashes when using the Sawed-off shotgun too much. I hope they can address this and other lingering issues.\n\nSTRONGLY RECOMMENDED\n\nReview may be editted for future updates","February 16","true","173.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

If you don't get offended easily, there could not be a better game in recent memory for making you laugh so hard that tears come out of your eyes. And that's saying a lot coming from me.

I played many violence games before, but postal 2 is kinda different (i think).\n\nYou playing as Postal Dude, an "ordinary guy" (with an extraordinary sense of dark humour) with "ordinary" things to do (to-do list or mission or whatever you call it). You can free roam around town with most of the building can be entered legally or illegally. Some building has a nasty stuff and nasty secret inside.\n\nin some cases, there is more than 1 way to complete the task (i recommend to save the game before you decide to to something big). For example when the postal dude has to buy milk at the grocery store (Lucky Ganesh).\n\nOption 1; (ordinary dude way)\ntake the milk, get in line and pay 5 buck for the milk.\nOption 2; (shoplifter dude way)\ntake the milk, and run like hell.\nOption 3; (postal dude way)\ntake the milk, flush everyone with gasoline, light the matches and watch them burned.\n\nPros;\n+ Kinda free roam.\n+The Postal Dude is funny (in dark humour way).\n+ Plenty things to do (good or bad? up to you).\n+ you can pee anywhere, anytime or even get choked by your own pee. Salty.\n+ Lots of weapons and items. (just seach for it and you will find it).\n+ Lots of people and animals that you can interact (you know what I mean?).\n+ You can buy stuff with money (optional)\n\nCons;\n- The game could become boring fast after long time of playing.\n- The game graphics is not as good as Hatred. (Postal 2 (2003) / Hatred (Q2 2015))\n\nConclusion;\n=JUST BUY THE GAME! (especially when it's 90% off on Steam).\n\nNote;\n$ Will also review Postal and Postal III (if it's 90% off on Steam).","December 31, 2014","true","2.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

This idea is otherworldy and unique, and yet incredibly fun, challenging and satisfying. The only way to make the nice playstyle even more saint, would be to give player tedious ways to get money legally (in game you're always unemployed, but have to pay in order to complete it). The freedom available in that section is already incredible. I bought the steam edition to have a great clean record and see if it's still fun.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=540238963\n\nIt's a bit uneven, and getting cash without hurting others is pretty much robbing. But my gameplay of not hitting, shooting, blowing up, tazing etc. people on Hard difficulty was a hell lot better than when I played it long ago, it was tense, rewarding and interesting. And because P2PL offers the pacifist playstyle again, and maintains the same obscene humour, I can't wait to play it sometime soon.\n\nIn conclusion: it's a fun, brilliantly designed, a bit amateurly executed game that's available in multiple playstyles (kind of like dishonored), and IMO it's even better when you try to limit your possibilities through challenge runs.\nAnd it's dirt cheap, runs great and is moddable to death.

BUT you can do it whatever you want be a pacifist way (waiting in line) or gandhi way (shoot the hell of everyone). lots of weapons and enemy variety.\n\nEngine and "technical thing":\nIt preety much a 2000's era graphic but the dev try bringin improvement a bit. however that said improvement make performance drop. i had a gaming pc with gtx 970 and hd 4000 laptop and somehow my laptop can run it while the gaming pc got 24fps. other than that there is no fatal bug (rare weapon stuck happens). it has good configuration and setting.\n\nWhy Should i buy this game?:\n-Do you like violence in video game without any lawsuit and ethic?\n-Do you like supporting good dev?\n-Do you like super cheap but ten times worth it game?\n-Do you like "gta" like game?\n-Are you bored and want something senseless fun?\n\nBlow arab guy with rocket launcher then chooping everyone hands of. 9/10","August 10, 2015","true","13.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Played 4 straight hours. Although the game is old, There's just something about breaking into someones home, tazing them until they p*ss themselves, killing them, dismembering them, burning their corpse, p*ssing on it, and then leaving. Long story short, best 99 cents I've ever spent.","July 14, 2015","true","8.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

It's also cheap and will run on probably any computer so go for it.","August 17, 2015","true","39.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
