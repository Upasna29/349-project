Do you want more? Buy the DLCs.\n4 pistols. Do you want more? Buy the DLCs.\n4 secondary weapons. Do you want more? Buy the DLCs.\n2 horde maps. Do you want more? Buy the DLCs.\n9 missions. Do you want more? Buy the DLCs.\n\nAnd so on, i guess you get it, right? Buy at your own risk. It lacks A LOT of content. In fact for 40 bucks it has a very low value.\n\nJust feel free to join our discussion on the comments section. There you can see different points of view from various people.\n\nEdit 2.0 aka "short story long" :)\n\nSE3 cuts both ways, it is pretty much SE V2 with bigger maps (don't expect more than 2 multiple paths per map though), they got rid off cheap mechanics like health regeneration but broken stealth mechanics, a few missions, not even more than 2 horde maps to expand the duration of the game (or any kind of content, it has 0 replayability), irregular AI, mediocre/unnecessary MP and details like historical inaccuracy make this game the worse of the series by far imo.\n\nI'm not saying that SE1 or 2 are more replayable or have better AI, but at least from SE1 to SE2 we saw a change, and felt like a new game for good or bad. In other words, it was a step in a different direction in some features and in others a step forward or backwards but a step nonetheless. Here it's  a lazy move. This is the best they could come up with after 2 years? Pathetic.\n\nNot just that but it doesn't offer enough content to justify full price, and overall feels more like an expansion/dlc for SE V2. And of course this "game" already has 12 DLCs which add what Rebellion cut off the final game to be sold separately for extra cash. The perfect money grab.\n\nThe game is a shell of its former self. If you still interested i would recommend you to wait till sales and get the complete package cheap as chips. After all, is your choice.","June 29, 2014","false","19.4"," 2,474 of 2,984 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","474","2","0","98"

For the longest time I thought I was just getting low fps and that the game just wasn't running well. It finally dawned on me to check the refresh rate and voila my problem was fixed and the game ran great.\n\nSniper Elite 3 is a fun game and an improvement on its predecessor in almost every way. Levels are a lot bigger and more open, campaign is longer, graphics are better, stealth is improved and feels more viable, rifle customization has been added, and everything you do gives you xp so that you gain ranks regardless of if you touch multiplayer or not.\n\nIf you're looking for an amazing story with great writing and voice acting you will want to look elsewhere. Enemy AI can be questionable as well. I never had a problem with bugs and glitches, but people have reported them so that may be something to keep in mind. There is a lack of weapons in this one compared to the previous entry, but especially with the addition of weapon customization that isn't something that bothered me much. These games have never really been about weapon variety anyway.\n\nRanking up gives you unlocks and basically just adds a sense of progression beyond that of completing a mission. This is not some earth-shattering addition, but it is welcomed.\n\nThe new difficulty, Authentic, is highly punishing. Not only is it very hard, but if you die, you restart the level from the beginning. And these levels are not short. If you crave a challenge, you will not be disappointed.\nOn the other end of the spectrum you have Cadet difficulty which is almost too easy. Bullet drop and wind is removed and enemy AI is considerably dumbed down. If you feel like Call of Duty-ing your way through the game then this is the difficulty for you.\n\nThe game is optimized well and the controls are pretty much unchanged from Elite V2, which is not a bad thing. This is definitely not some lame console port.\n\nThe abundant dlc is something to be aware of as well. The game felt fine enough to me without any of it, but it is there.\n\nI don't know that the game is worth paying full price for, but if you can get it on sale for a good price I doubt you will regret it.","February 6, 2015","true","22.6"," 196 of 209 people (94%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","94","196","209","9","12"

Once you get to know your rifle you will be able to shoot accurately. Unlike most games, you do not run endlessly. You character gets tired at 80bpm and your shots become less accurate. Move slowly, crouch, and stay prone to keep your heart rate low.\n\nIn single player mode you can be a silent assassin with your knife. Hit multiple targets from the snipers nests throughout the map. Opportunities to hit targets at long distances. Setup mines for vehicles and enemies. Or blow up explosives to tear them to pieces.\n\nIn multiplayer mode you get lots of free maps. Many different modes are possible (co-op, team games, and deathmatches). Stay hidden as much as you can, in the shadows and away from trigger happy team mates.\n\nOverall, it is an impressive game.

Actually the game is very much like the 2nd part has been. There is no sand-box-like environment, though in theory the levels are huge and feature long distances, one cannot make use of it. The level design restricts the player's movement in mutliple ways. Not being able to step over he smalles stone in your path means that one need to stick to the few predetermined paths. The enemies are popping up in a certain distance. For example one can observe a tower on the other side of a lake, seeing no enemies at it - when moving closer the enemies are created there out fo nothingness. The average distance of a firefight is about 30-80 meters, to get a long shot you need to crawl to the target to make it appear, then crawl all the way back to give it a shot. Even worse, at long ranges the collision is not working correctly. Though the target is presented in clear view the tactical assistance shows the target as 'obscured' effectively the shot is blocked by something invisible. Longest shot i did take in the normal game was at 130 meters. Same goes for corners, windows and doors. Often your shots will hit the frame, though your crosshair is dead on target. If you like the sniper series stick to the 2nd part, this one is just a bit more flashy. Oh and the customizing is utterly useless.\n\nFrom their ads:\n-Expansive new environments – Stalk huge multi-route levels with multiple primary and secondary objectives than can be tackled in any order. Never play the same way twice. -> Though there is no order given, the level design claerly dictates a certain order, 2nd part is true, one surly will not play a level a second time as it's just to boring.\n-Real tactical choice – Adapt to any situation. Use stealth, distraction, traps and sound masking . If things go hot, use the new Relocate mechanic to slip into the shadows and start the hunt again on your own terms. --> means that one can get away with the most stupid moves, as long as one is fast enuff with relocating, this takes the edge off totally.\n-Revamped human X-Ray Kill cam – The acclaimed X-Ray kill-cam is back and bolder than ever, including a detailed muscle layers, 3D mesh particles and the complete human circulatory system. -->probably the only thing that works, bloody, gruesome and detailed. Not much different from the old bulet cam though\n-New X-Ray vehicle takedowns – See vehicles disintegrate in intricate detail with X-Ray vehicle takedowns. Multi-stage destruction allows you to take out armoured cars, trucks and Tiger tanks piece-by-piece.--> exaggerated, basically a bullet cam for vehicles, nothing we haven't seen here before\nI recommend to get the 2nd part of the series for little money, Sniper Elite 3 is not worth the amount of money as it's not delivering on the developers promises. If you like CoD-style shooters with some sneaking and sniping this here might be for you. If you like tactical choices and a sandbox-level design with you deciding the course of action and real tactical posibilities  stay away from this one.\n\nAddendum:\nNow i have been playing some more hours, I admit there are some levels that are better then others - so one get'S a glimpse of what the game could be! Those rare levels are really nice, maybe they will deliver some better DLC. I'd change my recommendation in sofar, that I would give it a try when it's been out some time, has received maybe some DLCs and is available for a reduced price.","June 29, 2014","false","26.7"," 729 of 940 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","729","940","0","10"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/238090/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","Sniper Elite 3 is a third person tactical shooter developed by Rebellion Developments and published by 505 Games. This game was released on PC, PS3, PS4, 360 and Xbox One in June 2014. It is a prequel to Sniper Elite V2 and the third game in the sniper series.\n\nThe gameplay in Sniper 3 is based heavily on being slow and steady with your approach to completing objectives, with an also strong focus on sniper gun play much like the previous games. What I really liked about Sniper 3 is that the stealthy approach is pretty much the only viable way to go on most missions otherwise you'll just be pinned down in a firefight and outnumbered. The stealth aspect of the game is done extremely well, you probably will be detected by the enemies whilst taking down the guards, but it is all about cleaning up after yourself by dragging bodies to the long grass, or how you escape and hide away until the enemies give up searching for you. You can use various methods to distract enemies such as throwing rocks and laying traps. Before each level you get to choose your load out, you get the choice of a sniper rifle, a secondary weapon, side arm, and various other items such as grenades, medi-packs and traps. As you level up between stages you also unlock further rewards and items.\n\nOf course, a Sniper game wouldn't be complete without the stunning slow motion graphics of your bullet soaring through the air and them piercing through your foes scrotum, this my friends is the pinnacle of slow motion gaming. Granted after a while you'll be skipping them because they will grow tiresome as they play after every kill with your sniper, but still, this gives you a chance to get some brilliant cinematic screenshots to show off your sniping skills.\n\nGraphically, Sniper Elite 3 is gorgeous, I wasn't able to push out full graphic settings on 4k resolution, but even on the lower resolutions (1080p), it still looks stunning. There is a wide array of setting to choose from which is always good to see. The visuals are amazing though, the night time levels really show of the games truly stunning lighting effects as well. I was a little disappointed to see the lens flare effect being used a bit too much, but everything else is truly stellar.\n\nThe game is fully voice acted, with the enemy soldiers speaking in German too, so subtitles are recommended for that. The sound effects really add an extra level of immersion to the gameplay. A nice feature which is added is that you can disguise your bullet shots underneath the sound of loud sounds in game too, which really helps you in your efforts to complete levels as stealthy as possible.\n\nI have to admit, this game is quite difficult, even on the easiest settings; you really do need to take each level with a sense of slow and steady. There is really no point in running in all guns blazing because you will just get gunned down within seconds of being spotted. You will need to backtrack plenty of times in order to escape being detected, you'll be needing to hide in rooms, crawl under buildings, anything which you can imagine you doing in the situation you are in, you can do. The latter levels of the game also ramp up the difficulty significantly as well, as each level slowly introduces more and more enemies for you to deal with.\n\nEach level in Sniper Elite 3 is massive. Each level will have its own main objective, but as you progress and reach new areas of the zone, you'll also unlock optional objectives, which can be things such as destroying some trucks, cutting off communication or something searching for secret plans. These optional objectives reward you with additional experience at the end of the level and also add an extra element of immersion to the game as well.  The size of each level really means that you can get stuck in, and explore to your hearts content. There are countless amounts of collectable items for you to find if that is your thing too. Each of the games objectives, whether it be main or optional, will have more than one way of you being able to complete them, which will really add some replay ability to the game on your second run through.\n\nI was a little let down by the fact that I finished the game's single player in about five hours, granted I was playing on the easiest difficulty, but for a big  release like this, I was expecting something more to be honest. I can see there being an essence of replay ability due to the nature of the levels being able to be completed in more ways than one, but I would say that there is no real need for playing through the game more than twice at least. There is a multiplayer side to the game, which I tried out, but it seems to be a little on the low side of players, and struggled to actually get into any proper gameplay, because given that it is a sniper based game, most people are camping in well-hidden places just picking people off when they try and complete objectives, for me I didn't really enjoy the multiplayer.\n\nTechnically, I had a one major problem with Sniper Elite 3, and that was that the game kept crashing on launching the title, it would reach the title screen, but then just crash to desktop. This actually turned out to be an issue with Malwarebytes closing it, so it would be highly recommended that you add the Sniper Elite 3 folder into the exception settings for Malwarebytes if you run that AV. Granted that it wasn't actually Sniper Elite causing the crash, you would still expect the game to have been tested with various popular AVs like this to see if they caused any compatibility problems.\n\nMy conclusion of Sniper Elite 3 would be that I would only recommend the game as a single player title; because the multiplayer just didn't do it for me. Given that the single player side of the game can be completed in almost five hours, the full price tag of £39, 99 is absolutely absurd, and is actually fairly offensive that they can charge that amount of money for such little content. I would only say this game is worth picking up when it is below the £10 mark, yes the gameplay is top class, and the graphics are stunning, but you can pick up any of the other Sniper games for the same experience in both of those departments for cheaper. Actually saying that, it looks like all of the games in this series are expensive. Definitely wait for sale season to start before adding Sniper Elite 3 to your library.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thedudered/recommended/238090/","thedudered","RED Floyd /(Weber)\","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thedudered/","414 products in account","This game fell far from what made Sniper Elite V2 fun, while at the same time fixing a lot on Sniper Elite V2's problems.\nHow does that work? Well in my normal, befuddled, complicated review style I'll do my best to explain.\n\nThe whole Sniper Elite series revolves around popping a bullet from your rifle of choice into the head of filthy degenerate Nazis (sometimes Russians), hey that's fun right? Yea it is!\n\nExcept in Sniper Elite 3 you're more likely to be using the Welrod than you are sniping, also likewise using new silent close combat kills which actually do have some pretty wicked kill animations, and while nothings wrong with using CQC executions and the welrod to get into position for sniping, the problem is you're gonna be mostly using the Welrod and CQC to get through the level, there's rarely a place to get into position for sniping effectively making that sniper rifle of your choice on your back more of an optional weapon of choice in a game where the name happens to be SNIPER Elite.\n\nNormally in Sniper Elite V2 and Sniper Elite you got from point A to point B, point B being the place where you pull off a sniper shot and take out the target, throughout the game you can find areas where the noise blocks out your shots and you can pick off any soldier with a bit of patience.\nNow that returns in Sniper Elite 3, but my one big problem is that it feels...placed. Whereas in V2 something like mortars hitting the ground were a boon for pulling off a shot, the fact you use what feels like conveniently placed generators or noise making sources to mask your shot just feels off. It feels less like a perfect chance and more like a part of the game where you just sit, wait for the generator to make noise and pick off the enemy until everything is swiss cheese.\n\nNow that's not the ENTIRE case, of course sound masking sources like planes flying overhead return, as do artillery shots of course, but these are strung out so that it feels like you either use the generator or you don't, and if you don't and pull  a sick headshot off in total silence then instead of everyone in a 5 mile radius combing the entire place for you you just gotta relocate.\n\nRelocting! Making the consequences of pulling off an unmasked shot null and void. Honestly its not that bad (in the context of Sniper Elite 3), in a game where you can't snipe anything and you gotta get around with the Welrod or the pay2win silenced semi auto; there has to be some kind of leeway that lets you wipe the dust off your rifle and tell someone they can ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in Hell.\n\nSo why does it feel so bad to me at least? Simple: Shoot someone, relocate, rinse and repeat.\n\nAnd speaking of getting from Point A to Point B, lets talk about the maps! Now, these maps are more open world, meaning you can persue any objective in total silence or loud as ♥♥♥♥, nothing wrong with that, I like open maps! Except for the bit where at the end of each level in V2, Point B was the place you gunned down your target, in Sniper Elite 3 you can go through most of the level or the entire level without firing a shot from your rifle. Hell you can take down most of your targets through means that don't involve sniping, that makes the game feel less like Sniper Elite 3, and more of a Stealth Elite 3.\n\nBut I think the thing that bites me the most is that rifles that were originally part of the base game in V2 are being sold as DLC, I mean yea it's odd to find a Mosin Nagant in Africa, but getting a KAR 98 wouldn't be difficult, instead you get that from DLC as well. It feels like Sniper Elite 3 has fallen to one of the biggest pitfalls the gaming industry is doing nowadays cutting out parts of the game, reselling as DLC.\n\nIn the end Sniper Elite 3 feels weird, off, it's not what I expected, despite some of the highpoints, honestly I had fun for the first few hours, then the whole DLC bits happened and I noticed this game wasn't as good as I thought it to be, in fact I'd go as far to say that Sniper Elite V2 is the better game, the fact you can actually stealth for once is really nice but the fact that it takes away from sniping hurts on more deeper level, if you really want Sniper Elite 3 I'd recommend waiting for a sale or a price drop.","July 24, 2015","false","17.7"," 806 of 1,099 people (73%) found this review helpful 68 people found this review funny","73","806","1","68","39"

If the developers wanted me to sit there and "snipe" they'd have given me something that wasn't semi-automatic and held 8 rounds. They also wouldn't have given me an SMG or grenades. You can hear the character mention that I should lay traps, the player is CLEARLY meant to proceed that way. Sorry that I don't like going to the "Sniper Nests" the game marks on my map and attempt to play the game in a sandbox style, like the store page highlights.\n\nFurthermore, regardless of how I play the game, the bullet damage still remains the same. In the video you can see me empty rounds into enemies at close range and nothing happens.\n\nPerhaps you were distracted by some of the related videos, I'll provide you with a still frame of where I shoot the enemy.\nhttp://i.imgur.com/SzW7U4j.png\n\nIt doesn't take a rocket scientist to know that getting a rifle round through the chest is going to kill you, especially if it's lined up at your spine.\n\nI'm curious if you've even played the game. At that part in the level, I am required to go and "search" the bodies of the officers I kill. What is the point of me climbing up to some pre-made "nest" to kill the officers if I only have to go down there and rub my fingers on their uniforms? It's pointless and a waste of time.

Now, I did go a bit too far at times, reloading over and over when something didn't play out exactly like I wanted it to, like that time I wanted to kill 4 circling soldiers back to back with the silenced gun without getting found out or the corpses spotted, but I found that part of the game satisfying as well, since it helped teaching things about the enemies' behavior and the game's behavior.\n\nI spent the whole game either sniping, or using the silenced gun/backstab kills so I don't really know how the gunblazing approach works, but I never felt the need to go in gun blazing as crouching down, sniping some and moving out to relocate somewhere else in case a corpse was found/my gunshot was heard was the most enjoyable part of the game.\n\nAnother nice aspect about Sniper Elite 3 is in the looks department. I found the game to look really well and perform just as well, even on my old 570 and on my 970 now it looks even better.\nI played it with the Italian VA and I thought it was pretty good, both in the acting part as well as the sound of the voice.\n\nAll in all, a great sniping game that feels enjoyable where it counts and looks/performs well.","September 27, 2014","true","48.6"," 69 of 80 people (86%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","86","69","80","7","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Syntax-Error/recommended/238090/","Syntax-Error","Syntax Error","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Syntax-Error/","1198 products in account","A solid entry into the Sniper Elite franchise, Sniper Elite 3 takes the mechanics from Sniper Elite V2 and uses them in better ways.  You play the role of a sniper working with the British military in North Africa during the Second World War.  Really, you're equal parts sniper and spy as your missions have you single-handedly infiltrating enemy camps and bases as you try to find an infamous German general and piece together a plot involving Nazi superweapons.\n\nUnlike Sniper Elite V2, the maps in SE3 are much more open and this benefits the game immensely.  Where, in V2, I often felt as though I spent half the game playing run 'n gun with my submachine gun, in SE3 I probably used my SMG less than five times.  Your silenced pistol will still get a firm workout as you move into positions unseen where you can begin to death upon your foes with your rifle.  This isn't a modern era setting shooter though with super-scopes and giant silencers to turn your shots into whispers.  If you want to avoid a straight up firefight, you'll need to time your shots against background noise from low-flying aircraft or sabotaged generators to prevent the enemy from knowing where you're at.  The game manages a good balance by forcing you to be patient as you line up your shots without making the whole ordeal tedious.  There are some stealth mechanics as well including sight indicators, the ability to hide in shadows, guards locating you via sound, etc.  Much of the game is spent creeping around and avoiding conflict until you're ready to bring swift vengeance from your perch. The famous Sniper Elite X-Ray Kill Cam makes its return, now updated to show your bullet tearing into muscle and severing arteries as well as bone and organs.  Curiously, for all the effort into showing me in graphic detail the damage I'm inflicting, every hit in SE3 is a fatal blow.  Shooting someone in the foot was as fatal as expertly putting a round through an enemy sniper's scope and into his brain [Edit: Higher levels introduce much more frequent "incapacitating" or wounding shots versus clean kills].  For those feeling squeamish or just bored watching bullet cams, this feature can be easily adjusted or turned off.\n\nI only played through the campaign on the default difficulty [Edit: I've since played through on more difficult settings] which used light ballistics modeling but my understanding is that ballistics on the higher levels remain well done, requiring players to account for bullet drop and wind direction and making rifle characteristics such as scope sway and bullet velocity more important.  It is unfortunate that there are only four weapons in each class (pistol, rifle, SMG) included in the base game.  A wealth of others are available via DLC which, while something of a cash grab, the game redeems itself slightly by including a firing range where you can test fire all the available guns and see which you like before purchasing a weapons pack.\n\nThe story is nothing special and you won't feel invested in the plot or making sure that you succeed.  The end in particular felt very weak.  However, from a mechanics point of view the game shines and the story is just a contrivance to line up 200m shots and put a bullet through someone's temple as artillery fires in the distance, hiding your presence.  If you enjoyed V2 (or disliked it mainly for its enclosed maps) or if you find yourself playing the sniper in shooters, you'll probably enjoy your run through this title.","July 11, 2015","true","70.5"," 91 of 114 people (80%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","80","91","114","8","0"

V2 and the following zombie games, but this SE3 is just crud. Get it at 10 bucks, not worth more.\n-1 why is moving so changed, I mean in V2, where you're mouse moved is where you were pointed, so you could walk sideways and all that, this one, the camera is locked to the mouse while you are not, so Good Luck getting into place to snipe through holes and windows.\n-2 Where the hell did 'Q-get into cover' go? Now I have to fight with getting too close to objects and suddenly poping out into plain view when I draw my gun?? I can't even shallow snipe over boxes without standing right up, might as well yell "GO JOE" while I'm at it.\n-3 You even ruined stealth kills, I'm all sneak sneak sneak, get into range, press E and I Punch the AI, PUNCH THE AI. where the hell did that come from? and Punching won't even kill them, I'm stuck there in a punch battle, trying to kill him quietly cause I'm out of silencer ammo and he's just yelling away, alerting all the AI and while I await my impending doom to restart a long long save ago, I'm just gonna keep punching the AI and imagining its Rebellion.\n-4 we're gonna make it more authentic by removing subtitles but we're gonna put GIANT Yellow and Red Circles over the AI's, What happened to 'flying by the seat of your pants' and wondering if that AI spotted you and is now looking for you or is on his normal random path, Oh wait, they don't have random paths eithers, they just walk back and forth doing Exactly the same thing over and over, Even in V2, they would do unexpected things, get called over by others after so long, Change. I shouldn't beable to leave my player in an area, come back an hour later and it still be the same stuff happening.\n-5 I played on Sniper Elite, first thing, so why all the hints and tips and OH theres a grenade right here, hissing just two meters from your foot, be a good lad and Run Away, Come on? seriously? if someones lucky enough to get a grenade in your sniper nest, why are the creators of this game ruining that little bit of fun letting the player notice it coming into the window or not seeing it and dieing.\n-6 This was going to be a short list but I'm just too annoyed at buying this crud at even just 30 bucks with the 20% discount, but oh wait, theres' DLC's out right now, and Oh look, better weapons in Multiplayer! Lets throw more money at Rebellion for another BUY TO WIN game. I want to throw up, what happened to Earning your upgrades? unlocking and finding secrets?\n-7 Not only is the menu and loadout setup nothing like SE V2, or SE:NZA or SE:NZA2, its utterely confusing, you now have slots and carry limits, Oh I can only have two of these, but they are each one in each slot, so I'll change this to that and now I can only have one of these from loadout? Oh you can have more if you pick it up, but if you don't have it in a slot, then you don't get to have it at all.\n-8 Hold your breath is supposed to Stop gun wobbling, NOPE, not here, its worse wobbling than that song.\n-9 I could play V2 for days, no end, it was pure fun, can't really think of any complaints other than odd AI's, WHY on gods green earth would you 'improve' Everything, If it ain't broke, DON"T FIX IT. This game I could only stand a few hours before I was too ticked off and plant leaves deflecting my bullets and bullets hitting on the right side of my scope when E-hold your breath was putting the little red dot on the left side of my scope, Oh and don't scope snipe while too close to a box, even though you're standing up in plain view, you're gonna shoot the box thats only two feet high.\n-10 I don't know if I can stand this game long enough to finish it, going by reviews, thats just a few hours if that, worth of 8 maps, I'm pretty sure they are adding in all the 'chapters' too, Like in V2, you'd get to have like four 'chapters' per map, where places you just cleared would get new inforcements placed back so you'd have to fight your way back through alerted AI cause we all know, even though you cleared all the dead, a whole platoon can't just disappear and not get noticed.\n-11 If someone asks me if I want to play SE3 or SEV2, I'm gonna play SE:V2 Everytime, sequels in games are supposed to be better than the ones before, unlike movies, though with all the money put into the films, Oh wait, they just used blurred drawings for that, guess they broke the budget on making A&P science class worthy bones and guts, Oh wait, those look worse than they do in V2.\n-12 Random AI-"Hmm, that generator sounds like gun shots now, and this car just blew up beside me, Oh well, I guess that sun is pretty hot, it must be 2789 bazillion degrees or -15q, I think my code will break If I try to think about that too much, maybe I'll rank up, imagine me *code broken, game crashed, you saved over an hour ago without running into any autosave events even though you killed an entire platoon, 20 trucks and 2 generators*\n-13 it was much better when you marked someone in V2 where they'd just get a white or red V overhead, now you get glowing white shadows showing you Exactly what someone is doing behind a wall, why not just let someone shoot them in the eye through a flag, drapes, and while they are standing infront of another guy you can't see and alert the whole town, Oh wait, that happened too, Tanks mister gen for masking my sound, even though the guy saw his friends head explode, he knows Exactly where I am cause he was out of range of the sound of the gen, but somehow heard my gun go off and pin pointed my location??\n-14 If I bought this for a gamestation of any type, I'd be at the store returning this right now. I really dont' know if I can stand to put another hour of fighting to stay behind a box and wondering how they saw me when theres a low brick missing from the middle of the wall and they saw my foots shadow and come running, even though I can throw a grenade infront of them under a truck, blow everything to heck and they won't even go on the alert. Whose got two thumbs and isn't buying anything early from Rebellion again? This Guy!\n-15 If I want to walk sideways while keeping my eye on this guy, then I want to Walk Sideways and not have my player turn his back to the guy so that when I draw my gun I have to find the Guy in question Again, by which time he's already alerted the town cause he saw my shadow in the shadow I was in.\n-16 When you pick up a body and run to hide it, thats right, You Run, slowly, but Loudly, so you alert EVERYONE, Unless you hold down the Walk button, L alt for me, but theres no hint or guide for that, You just have to figure out you're running slowing and wondering why everyone can hear you Walk Hard.\n-17 When you find two AI's in each others body, no not that way. Don't shoot them in the head, my bullet headshoted one, but completely missed the other, even though their heads took up the Exact same space! no two for one here, Like shooting fish in a barrel but noone said the barrel was a bottomless well.\n-18 I really dislike this game, I'm only writing all this out Because of how Great SE:V2 is and will always be, Reb didn't even try to stick to what worked in V2, I can only guess that some new guys were at the water hole and were all "Dude, lets change EVERYTHING so peps know this game is fresh and hip and made by different peps that know the public are just sheep that'll buy anything with a following", I seriously hope this was a different team than SE:V2, I'll be seriously disappoint if its the same team.\n-19 Daylight Happens, its a new challenge to work with, but why not have spent a little and made options for day and/or night maps, Have trucks running in and out during the day and heavy patrols at night? why was 'fixing' V2 or 'starting anew' even considered? Halo and Soul Reaver went 3+ games and each better than the last, because they listened to the public, found and fixed bugs, and made more and more story with each one while keeping to the lore they started.","June 29, 2014","false","4.2"," 135 of 183 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","135","183","0","8"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheRealShotyyy/recommended/238090/","TheRealShotyyy","Shotyyy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheRealShotyyy/","374 products in account","Sniper Elite III is one of the most controversial games I've played in a past few years. With some people glorifying it's sniping mechanics and the others saying that the game is totally boring. To be honest, I don't know to which side I belong.\nSo let's begin!\n\nThe story (Spoiler-free)\nThe game is a prequel to Rebellion's 2012 game Sniper Elite V2, and is the third installment in the Sniper Elite series. Sniper Elite III is set several years prior to the events of V2, following the exploits of Office of Strategic Services officer Karl Fairburne as he participates in the North African conflict during World War II, in which he learns of a secret wonder weapon programmed by the Nazi forces. Our main objective is to destory the Nazi super-weapon known as the Ratte and kill the General Franz Vahlen. This surely doesn't sound too interesting, does it? If your answer is yes then you'll be majorly disappointed with storyline of this game as the game's ending leaves no feel of satisfaction or that you've achieved something. The plot is simply not interesting to follow and it's just there to set different locations that you'll travel to.\nAlso the game is only 6 hours long if you try to sneak and play smart (as I did) but if you're going for a fast playthrough than you're risking to spend money on a 4 hour shooting range, rather than a sniper game.\n\nThe gameplay\nThe game retains and builds on the mechanics of Sniper Elite V2. Players go through large battlefield maps based on the North African conflict.\nThe sniper rifle is the player's primary weapon, though additional side arms including submachine guns and pistols, silenced or not depending on the situation, are available. In addition to hand grenades, the player can deploy tripwire booby traps, land mines and dynamite. Binoculars can be used to tag enemies in view, displaying their position and movements. The player-character must hold their breath to properly line up the shot. A red icon appears in the scope, marking the projected point of impact (Not always though, it just depends on your difficulty). There are weapon parts spread out all over the game, found when looting dead enemies, allowing players to customize their weapons in the predeployment menu; the menu also allows equipment loadouts.\nStealth mechanics have been reworked. An eye icon squints or opens to denote the player's level of detection by the enemy. Enemy soldiers will also have a circle meter over their heads to indicate alert status. Players are also forced to relocate periodically to prevent detection with a white ghost image to mark their last known position and the enemy will search a wider area. As in the previous game, loud sounds may be used to mask sniper shots. Though devs claimed that this new stealth is a much more acceptable to stealthy players - it really is not. It still feels clumsy and rushed, just to be there. You'll find yourself shooting your way through most of the game rather than sneaking.\nA points system is instituted for actions such as stealth close-combat or sniper kills, with the points accumulating towards promotion to higher ranks. Players can go around the map to collect special reward items such as collectors' cards and unlock sniper nests. Journal pages also provide further backstory into the events of the game.\nV2‍ '​s X-Ray kill cam system is retained as well. Where the previous game only shows the body's internal structure at point of impact, the new game expands to visualize the rest of the cardiovascular, skeletal, and muscular systems. The player can still target vehicles, but now has a chance to shoot the engines and disable the vehicle.\n\nOptimization\nAn important point to all of us PC gamers. I'm happy to report - this game is optimized very well and runs extremely smoothly. I had only two major FPS drops through the game which is a great result. The textures look great and the sound quality is really good, I can give only a big thumbs up to Rebellion for their work on the PC version.\n\nThe verdict Though a lot of negative things have been said - I really liked this game and enjoyed every bit of it, the gameplay and it's variety of approaches to a single objetive and the ability of playing together with a friend only rises the score for me. This game has one of the best sniping mechanics in combination with one of the most boring storylines in the video game industry. Is this 4-6 hours of pure sniping worth it? It's only up to you and your taste if all you care is gameplay - yes, it's gonna be loads of fun (also, you can play with a friend !) . But if you're here for a dramatical and epic World War II story full of historical events, then you're better off with other WW2 games, as I've mentioned - the writing is really boring and not interesting.\n\nI rate this game 6/10 - a worthy 10$ pick up, but nothing more.\nPS: A big shout out to Chef José, a friend of mine for pointing out a big flaw of this review!","September 19, 2015","true","10.2"," 82 of 109 people (75%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","75","82","109","13","9"

I enjoyed Sniper Elite 2 but this game almost felt like a step backwards. For one the game tries to push you towards a stealthy approach a lot of the time and sniping takes a backseat. Given sniping is the main draw of this game its an odd development. Another feature is relocating after taking a shot which involves moving a certain distance from where you took your last shot. But its a very exploitable mechanic because you can just shoot an enemy, move away till the rest stop searching and then return to that spot to shoot again. The AI is also really dumb as you can shoot one of them and as long as they dont find you for a couple of minutes will go back to patrolling normally again as if nothing happened. All these negatives add up to a pretty disappointing game.\n\nGood Points:\n- when you are sniping its the most enjoyable part of the game with slow-mo killcams that show the damage your bullet does on an x-ray view of the enemy. It's the most satisfying killcam of any game out there.\n- Levels are more open now giving you more options in how you approach the level\n\nBad points:\n- being almost pushed towards stealth instead of going all out with your sniper rifle especially when non-sniping combat in this game is terrible\n- terrible AI with enemies who'll resuming walking around normally even though there mate was shot through the head before their eyes just a few minutes before\n- dull story and predictable levels.\n-relocation mechanic is a nice idea but can be exploited too easily\n\nOverall i can't really recommend this game. Play the better Sniper Elite 2 instead if you want a sniping fix and which will be cheaper as well.","July 26, 2015","false","17.9"," 74 of 100 people (74%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","74","74","100","4","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dragonfiremalus/recommended/238090/","dragonfiremalus","dragonfiremalus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dragonfiremalus/","197 products in account","I suppose gameplay is interesting enough, with fun stealth and FPS done reasonably well. But in summary the reason I can't stand this game is that they heavily advertise the "realistic ballistics" in the sniping, when, in fact, this game has the worst ballistics I have ever seen. It not only ruins the gameplay, but also puts them squarely under the category of blatantly lying. So if you don't care about reallistic ballistics, then you might have fun. But this was certainly a game ruiner for me.\n\nNow for the details.\n\nIt's time for a quick physics lesson. The bullet from an M1 Garand travels at about 850m/s. Over a shot distance of 70m, that results in a time of flight of 0.082 seconds. In that time, the bullet should drop a grand total of 3.2cm. So if I aim for the back of his head, I should hit a 3.2cm lower spot on the back of his head. In this game, I aim for the back of the guy's head 70m away, and I hit his kidney. After some rough estimates, I find that this requires a time of flight right around .35 seconds, giving a muzzle velocity a bit over 200m/s. Realistic ballistics?\n\nIt gets better, cause I then went to long range and did some time of flight estimates. I ended up with a bullet velocity of ~750m/s. So their muzzle velocity isn't off, it's their gravity. A quick calculation later shows that their gravity strength is roughly 13*g, well above the point at which everyone would black out. Also, I would weight 2,500lbs.\n\nSo in short, when they say "realistic ballistics," they are simply lying.\n\nAdd to that, 100m shots are not sniper shots. Their entire maps aren't big enough from one end to the other for decent sniper shots. So they've compressed the distances and increased bullet drop to the point where even close range shots are practically impossible without using their cheating help reticle.\n\nAnd if your entire game is stealth based, don't make it easier for me just to run through the whole map shooting up the place. Punish the player for not being sneaky.","September 19, 2014","false","2.0"," 420 of 662 people (63%) found this review helpful 201 people found this review funny","63","420","662","201","55"

Should be called "Pistol Elite III", because you are going to spend most of your time with that beautifully modelled sniper rifle slung on your back, while you sneak around with a silenced pistol shooting drone AI in the back of the head from 20 feet. Alternately, you can have even less fun with the "takedown" mechanic, aka sneak up on the guy and stab him. How sneaking around head-shotting people with a pistol and stabbing guys in the back came to be the dominant mechanics in a "sniper" game is rather beyond my ability to comprehend, but there it is, for what it's worth, which is approximately nothing.\nI've only played on authentic level so I don't know about all the aids, but I will say that the developers have made a decent attempt at recreating real-world ballistic physics. It is not perfect, by any means, and seems to incorporate some random elements that are difficult to explain and rather puzzling. I can see that weapon ranges, bullet drop etc have had to be scaled to fit the rather puny maps, because consoles could never handle the size of maps that would be necessary in order to accomodate realistic weapon ranges.\nYes, it's very DLC heavy. I bought it on some super sale and got the whole works relatively cheaply, and still feel ripped off. Either way, you shouldnt be paying extra to get a few decent rifles in what is trying to pass itself off as a sniper game. Smells like a money grab when content that should have shipped with the game comes out as day one DLC.\nThere are other oddities that make this game much less than it appears to be. I've often shot guys square in the chest with a high-powered sniper rifle, seen the blood fly, and a few seconds later, they shake it off like a wet dog and they are good to go. I'm not sure what that's all about, but you'd think getting shot in the chest would actually hurt at least a little bit, or at least knock the wind out of a guy. Also questionable are such things as knocking out a Tiger tank by shooting it in the muffler with a rifle, but whatever.\nThe developer appears to have abandoned this game already, probably out of embarrassment, so don't count on any tech support or answers to your emails. ( see forum post Random Crashing)\n\nIn summary, it's a great looking game, the weapons are beautifully modelled, the story and main character are bland, generic, uninspired and totally cheesy, the "open-world" consists of two-or-three rails instead of just one, the maps are tiny and constricted, I could go on. The bottom line is that this game fails absolutely in delivering the goods as far as being a sniper game.

Yes, definitely. So, what's changed in Sniper Elite 3? Here's a random list of improvements:\n\n- Maps are now more open, with multiple paths and multiple sniping positions.\n- Stealth works as it should, you can stealth though most of the game if you so desire. And every mission can be completed without raising any alarms.\n- You can hide dead bodies.\n- You can use foliage to hide yourself.\n- Relocation mechanics - move often to confuse the enemy.\n- Health regen is gone. That's right, medkits and bandages are back.\n- The highest difficulty setting is pretty much free of any handholding. No minimap, no more color-coded vehicle weak spots.

At least for me, it seemed to be Sneaker Elite Welrod Edition rather than Sniper Elite because of the relocate indicator and I didn't feel like running trough half of the map in order to make another shot undetected.  And when you actually had a chance to make silent shots, you didn't really want to use them because they felt so scripted. For instance, in V2 you shot during mortars to hide your shots but in Sniper Elite 3 you masked them by breaking a conviently placed generator. It felt rather strange that they made it be a stealthier game without adding more effective ways of doing it that way.\n\nAnd this gets me to the second point which is that the atmosphere was flat. Nothing really seemed to matter and surroundings didn't feel like they belonged in a Sniper Elite game. Also the story was extremely vague and the ending was anticlimatic. You were just given some orders and then you went on to complete them. It actually seemed more like a group of separate missions than a game with a story. Then there were a lot of issues while playing the campaign with a friend. It kept on disconnecting from the game even though both had no connection issues whatsoever. And what's worse, it made you go through the same mission from the start everytime it did this.\n\nAlso the price of 45,99 € is waaaay too much for this game, I wouldn't buy it for more than 10 € especially since it takes you about 7-8 hours to finish the game.

In some games the american stereo type works, such as star craft 2, tf2, uncharted, etc.\n\nMy final thoughts on the game is that it is definetly not worth the 39.99 price they have put on it, I bought it for 26.76 in a steam sale and I still feel robbed, with the lack of content and bug fixes, I do not consider this a game worth buying.\n\n3/10 :(","September 30, 2014","false","6.6"," 152 of 238 people (64%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","64","152","238","18","2"

Go read about it. Their monsters, basically known as trademark hawking\n\nhttp://www.pcgamer.com/sins-of-a-solar-empire-studio-speaks-out-against-new-rebellion-legal-action/\n\n*Edit* I've been getting some comments about them just trying to protect their trademark. Let me clarify: This is not what their doing. Their trying to trademark the english WORD rebellion, and then going out of their way to sue any other company using the word rebellion in their game title. So with sins of a solar empire:rebellion, Rebellion studios ordered the studio who created(SINS) to retract all sold copies and rectify them/change the lore, based on the fact that the smaller studio was trying to trick customers into buying their product by welching off the name of a bigger company (short and sweet). Rebellion studios and the two brothers who own it knew full well (as became apparent in the ensuing court case) that this was simply not true, and Ironclad tried to civilly sort things out at first, but Rebellion went ahead and immediately sued, with the goal of sinking Ironclad into bankruptcy. Ironclad managed to win the case (And Rebellion had to recompense Ironclad for the legal costs of a clearly ridiculous case) and in a good spirit did not publicly ostracize Rebellion for it. But now Rebellion are launching new cases against Ironclad the world over, despite there being no threat on their trademark, and making their intentions clear...*deep breath* All I can say is, do some research into trademark hawking, what it is, clear cut cases of it, and what it's doing to the games industry (Particularly indy developers)...otherwise:\n\nHaters gonna hate.\n\nAs for this game, well, let me put it this way...\n\nYou won't be doing a whole lotta sniping. The best part of the game is the multiplayer, but here goes:\n\nThe sniping (and ballistics): Roughly 3/4 of the game you will spend in close quarter combat (within 30m), and most of your kills will be with your smg. You can take the initiative to locate a good sniping spot, but to get there usually requires eliminating most of the guards (or spending a good half hour 'sneaking around', which sounds fun and tactiful, but becomes incredibly monotonous and repetitive. As for the actual shooting, it's almost laughable. Even firing at a target 50m away can be difficult, as a moderate wind can displace the bullet by up to half a metre (Note I said moderate wind, not even strong. But apparently they think moderate winds are so powerful they'd blow you off a CLIFF, which is how strong they'd have to be to affect a bullet like they do in this game), leading to some incredibly frustrating moments when you miss a perfectly easy shot (To anyone whose fired a gun before, you know just how stupid the shooting mechanic is). Long story short, I was hoping for an excellent sniping shooter with the as-advertised highly advanced, realistic bullet mechanics.\n\nThis is not what Sniper Elite is.\n\nInstead, you have a mediocre shooter which has a majority of close quarter combat and some ranged, incredibly exaggerated bullet balistics. Upping the difficulty doesn't make the a.i. more intelligent, or change the scenarios or patrols. Rebellion were lazy and rather than making more difficult scenarios simply changed the 'wind' factor to ridiculous levels...\n\nOnce you fire, most enemies within several hundred metres instantly know where you are and swarm to your location, nullifying all your hard work anyway.\n\nAt which point, the game stagnates into a run-and-gun, duck and cover shooter, like for example, Gears of War. It's at this point most players figure out the best thing to do is ditch your sniper and just start shooting everything that moves with your smg. And it's a much more consistent shooter (Also, turns out a full auto smg hits stuff better than the rifles at 50m, who knew, eh?)\n\nStealth is an option, it's just not fun to play (Even with the traps), or tactfully sound. It's just plain frustrating because of the BAD game mechanics.","August 21, 2015","false","33.6"," 100 of 157 people (64%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","64","100","157","5","1"

More than just an unexpected success, Sniper Elite V2 was a game that promised to really blossom and overcome its kinks the second time around.\n\nInstead what I'm left with is a game that apparently got so drunk on victory champagne it ended up vomiting all over the lessons it should've learned about itself and its audience after that initial success.\n\nFrom the start of the game you have charts popping up left and right, telling you absolutely nothing the interface hasn't already spelled out for you with caps lock clarity, and that is not a compliment. The interface, once subtle and functional, is now glaring and overreaching, robbing you of any immersion in a game world so many decades from producing its first tamagochi, let alone its first hamfisted digital overlay.\n\nDeserts are quite possibly the worst place to set your game if you're building a corridor shooter, and Rebellion does it with all the psychopathic unease of a neatly composed Ikea sales display. It won't take René Magritte to tell you that you aren't looking at a desert, though I'm amazed the game didn't have a chart spelling that out for you.\n\nOf course the self-inflicted wounds don't stop there.\n\nThe killcam has devolved from a rewarding, finely tuned mechanic to a creepy disruptive anatomy class, and removing the previous games awkward cover function would be a great decision if only the game allowed you to shoot over low walls while crouched. A much needed save function inexplicably extends into Sniper Elite difficulty offering unlimited saves, eliminating any real tension lest you sabotage yourself, which won't ever be a realistic expectation on a player.\n\nBut that is Sniper Elite III in a nutshell. A game that caters to everyone, equally poorly.\n\nMore than an evolution, it's a flashy overproduced lobotomy of the original. It's an empty ghillie suit that has had its brain as well as its heart gouged from it in slow motion with a .308 caliber spoon, leaving the rest of the world to wonder why something that was rough but in no way broken had to be so violently and carelessly "fixed".","July 1, 2014","false","8.4"," 43 of 67 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","43","67","0","3"

Which also attempts to look like action-stealth game. Which it kept failing at. But the third time is the charm and it seems that they finally delivered this promise in this one. Came out in 2014, made by Rebellion.\nIt also came out on PS3, PS4, X360 and Xbox One. I don't think that they have anything over PC version, so stick with this one.\n\nMultiplayer community is small but living.\nFor 2-player cooperative modes I would get a partner after around 10 minutes of waiting.\nFor competetive part there is always at least 4 full servers of players, which say that it will not die for a while. They play gamemodes that are Team Deathmatch, No Cross and occasional Deathmatch. Sorry, no CTF, Distance King.\nJust take a note, people seem to play on servers with rules which promote campign sniping hiding style: Any rifle shot instakills, bullets don't drop off (like in easiest setting in single-player) and they often don't allow secondary weapons. I couldn't find any server with players which have full vanilla rules. What a shame, at least I could find some in SEv2.\nAnd everybody wears Ghillie Suit, yep.\n\nTechnically, I had no trouble with game running, though it sometimes would sometimes would stop recognising my mouse at all after alt-tab'ing around.\nHowever it does have a few bugs. It seems like AI sometimes is able to see you through the walls or floor. Like, sometimes in level 7, airfield, after I made some mess on the ground and then successfully hid in underground tunnels, I would sometimes hear explosion and then suddenly my location would be found out. Perhaps some glitchy tank still shooting at me, I don't know.\nPlus, collision of level assets. It's unrefined. Different from the way that object look. Sometimes I was able to pass through an end part of a ruined wall, through bricks. Other times you wonder why your bullets don't pass through above some rock.\nCheckpoints also sometimes glitch out. Sometimes, after loading, I would see two soldiers inside each other. Yep.\nAnd overwatch is wacky, when you reload. Sometimes the sniper player will be back to original spawn and sometimes it will have objective in map that you have already done.\n\nAlso, yes, this game has some nice customization for difficulty. Don't forget to check game options. You can disable the aim reticle which predict where your shot will land and zoom on empty lung. That, and you can reduce the frequency of X-Ray kill scenes, which happen way too much by default.\nIt's also nice of them that they kept updating game for a while. Gave us one overwatch map, six multiplayer maps and even shooting range where you can also check out DLC weapons!\n\nThe plot of this game follows our Desert Ghost sniper in his adventures in the desert, being a prequel. Which means all the lush landscape of Africa, warm orange at day and cold blue at night. It sure looks nice, even though it may get old by the end of it. But hey, it's not often used setting.\nBut the plot itself is nothing exciting this time around. It's much less cinematic than SEv2, which will put people off. This game kinda takes itself as just a game. It doesn't try to do much exciting. For most part it's "ok, here is a map, bai" and then you move on through it. Ok, maybe there is occasional situation, a tank boss even. But still, most people got dissapointed. Even music doesn't feel as epic. Or at least the awesome music is barely used.\n\nAnd yes, at least this time around developers decided to make it a proper action-stealth. The levels in which you play are sandboxy. The progression thrugh it is still linear, but it's "wide", if you get what I mean. So you can do it at your own pace, for most times. Another thing is that whole stealth gameplay was improved and AI changed around to fit into stealth ideas, so not whole map wants to kill you as soon as you make a single shot into air.\n\nNow, while you still have various engines spread all over the map which you can kick and then shoot everybody during the loud noise, you got a relocation system. When you make the first noticed shot most enemies will freak, will hide behind cover and start to peek out, not sure where it came from. If you make another shot, then they will figure out your location and launch a group attack. It's not exactly threatening on middle difficulty, but on high it looks pretty coordinated, one group in front of you hiding away while flanking group of soldiers will start to advance to your position from behind. All while throwing grenades sometimes.\nThe thing that you are supposed to do after the first shot is to relocate. That means that you are supposed to move out of your sweet spot outside of the big circle where enemy belives where you are and then you are safe and the whole thing resets. You can still see enemy searching your original destination. The problem is, you can just return to the same original position once you get out of relocation radius. Maybe it could be more interesting if they wouldn't forget previous location, so it wouldn't feel like you exploit the system. Maybe even be interesting how you get less and less space to work at. But oh well.\n\nAt least with you don't feel restricted when you want to snipe and stay fairly stealthly. Stealthly as in having tactical advantage of enemy not knowing where exactly you are or isn't close enough to do damage before you move away. And yea, nothing stops you form just having fun sniping everything you see, so it's strange that people complain about this. Still free to go full action. Or rather, full sniping with no care.\nThough you still want to keep Welrod pistol around in single-player while using Luger and revolver in multiplayer, like in SEv2.\n\nAnd dont' forget about multiplayer. First, the whole campaign can be beaten in cooperative mode with a single friend. Enemies are more likely to notice you, but you are more likely to overcome them all. And it's fun and doesn't cut cutscenes out. So awesome.\n\nIt also still has survival mode, both solo and coop, which is similar to Tally Kill in SEv2. Though there are only two maps, aw. But your objective is to overcome 15 waves of enemies. The fun stuff is that unlike SEv2 this one has action-stealth gameplay working on SE3 standard, which means that relocations still work. I actually think that it showcases the system the best, along with awesome music. Enemies don't even immeditly know where you are, they just randomly and aggresively patrol and storm random buildings before finding you, so you can first tag them up with binocular and then choose the best moment to attack.\n\nAnd it kept the nice overwatch coop, where one person doesn't have sniper rifle, only having pistol, secondary and binoculaur and is the one doing objectives, while player with sniper rifle is providing cover. At least it's the way it does in SEv2 in small maps where the spotter is being ambushed all time. Sadly, it's a gamemode where SE3 system doesn't work well. Maps are sandboxy, you don't get pressured much and sniper is sometimes allowed to move freely, only sometimes being locked. As a result Sniper is easily the main hero, who does the action at effective range, while Spotter can just hide somewhere and only come out once it's all clear to do whatever objective asked, then repeat.\nYep, too much freedom there. Also, only three maps too.\n\nAnd then there is competetive multiplayer. It actually feels more like what sniper players want. Well, okay, it's not different from SEv2, and it's mostly because players play on servers with rules that only let you have sniper rifle that kills on shot to any body part, with no bullet gravity drops or such. That, and then again, most maps seems to be designed better. I can't say much, but I enjoyed being careful, under constant paranoia of that somebody noticed my movement.\n\nOverall, not strong, but it's good.","April 16","true","34.7"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","11","11","2","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/weisskaiser/recommended/238090/","weisskaiser","Weisskaiser","http://steamcommunity.com/id/weisskaiser/","301 products in account","First of all- Though I don't recommend this game, I'm not saying that it's BAD. It's just that it's inferior to the game that came before it (Sniper Elite V2). Only get this game if you've already cleared all of V2 and enjoyed it a lot. Otherwise just get V2.\n\nSniper Elite 3 takes the fantastic formula of V2 and adds in a whole load of new features that, frankly, and very unfortunately, ruin it. A whole host of arbitrary features, most of all the thing in which you're given a metre to show how suspicious enemy soldiers are of you, detract from the realism and turn it into a more video game-like experience, and yet at the same time somehow manage to make the game LESS FUN TO PLAY. The stages being larger and more sprawling starts off sounding like a good idea since this is a sniper game and all, but despite this being in The Middle of Nowhere, Africa, they consist mostly of what boils down to a bunch of intersecting corridors with the occasional large hall, and the only thing this manages to accomplish is turning stages into a boring, dull drag, due to how they lack any focus on a proper ultimate objective (case in point: The first real stage has you run around doing the exact same thing- Killing officers and checking their bodies- FOUR TIMES IN A ROW, while springing two surprise objectives that are each done in about a minute or two midway through. But none of the assassinations you have to carry out are at all interesting except for the very last surprise objective which isn't even feasible via sniping. The stage doesn't feel like one stage where you go through a checklist of objectives working towards an ultimate goal, but like a series of disjointed objectives sprung on you seemingly at random, as if it were some badly-made open world game). Letting you save wherever you want is nice and all but I would've like checkpoints in addition to that. Also I'm mostly clueless when it comes to hardware stuff so I can't figure out the fine details here, but I ran V2 totally fine with relatively high settings, while this game as a whole performs much less well than V2 (frame skipping and such) even on the lower settings. Also the kill cams don't seem to be as good as V2's, especially in the headshots, where the bone fragments seem to freeze in place connected to enemies' bodies so that they all move frozen together when the enemies twist around in slow motion. Oh, and do note that when it comes to weapons and such they actually cut down on the amount of content compared to V2, and turned it all into paid DLC.\n\nI reiterate, as I cannot stress this enough; Only get this game if you've cleared V2 and were still left craving for more, and don't mind if that "more" isn't ANYWHERE as good as what you just had. Otherwise just get V2, which is actually a good game.","June 18, 2015","false","3.0"," 21 of 30 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","21","30","0","0"

But, I have had a chance to complete the campaign mode and give multiplayer a shot, both just as enjoying as the other, with a different set of skills requires for each.\n\nFirst off, I would like to go over the campaign mode. When I first loaded the game I imediately noticed a great improvement from Sniper Elite v2 - the graphics were clearer with amazingly detailed shadows and characters. After a few minutes of playing it was very apparent that this was a completely different game to Sniper Elite v2, the world is extremely open with different ways to complete every task; this is in contrast to Sniper Elite v2's linear story line with very limited options complete a task. I think the implementation of optional objectives and collectables greatly enhanced the overall experience.\n\nMoving on to multiplayer, once again, a whole new take on the v2 multiplayer mode. You can actually talk to people and the maps are much more expansive allowing for more sniping and less traps and MP 40's. also, the introduction of more multiplayer objectives has really caused the game to be more playable, in an effort to discover and play them all.\n\nOn to the negatives, of which there are very few, my first would be some of the co-op mechanics. When playing co-op destroying a tiger tank is a matter of standing on either side as it spins around in circles undecided on who to shoot at. And then only having one of the two-four players in cutscenes.\n\nOverall, I would definitely recommended this game to friends, and have actually done so already! The positives of this game greatly outweigh my list of negatives with a vast improvement from Sniper Elite v2 which I imensely enjoyed.\n\nCampaign Rating: 9/10\nCo-Op Rating: 8/10\nMultiplayer Rating 9.5/10\n\nOverall Rating: 9/10","September 12, 2014","true","18.1"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","14","18","0","0"

I was super hyped for the game, waited a long while for it to go on sale to buy.  It plays in the style of a one-man-army, you're an elite sniper who infiltrates enemy lines and completes various tasks.\n\nMy first issue is with the Sniping mechanics. They're sort of only halfway there.  For example, when sniping, you need to take into account bullet drop. Fine.  But you don't need to lead your bullet whatsoever, if someone is sprinting a mile away and you are able to click on them then it is a guarenteed kill. All weapons in the game are hit-scan, meaning the bullets hit their target the instant you click.\n\nMy second issue are the in-game hints.  There are vaious things in the game that can mask your gunfire.  One of which is  some sort of little generator that is sprinkled throughout the game.   But literally every time I see one, even super late game, my character says "I bet I can mask my shots if I wait for that thing to make noise", even if I walk away from it and come back 30 seconds later.\n\nThe final nail in the coffin is Stability.  I have modern hardware, everything up to date, supported OS ect. But within the first 3 hours of gameplay, I crashed 3 times, losing progress each time.  I've had save files corrupt, Objectives get stuck so that I can't continue with the story. Just seems to have too many problems to be at it's normal pricepoint of $40","January 1","false","4.8"," 24 of 37 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","24","37","0","1"

They are 8 missions, for me that was OK because I got bored of the repetitive gameplay after the 2nd mission but when I played the game again after a couple of weeks, I got into the game and smashed through it (I thought the difficulty got easier towards the end of the game). There is little choice of weapons, 4 snipers virtually all the same, I used the silenced pistol all the to the end because it's stealthy and no other gun has a suppressor and I unlocked the thompson near enough straight away. Now, the sniper upgrades are useful but in a way pointless because unless you have the patience to loot every single body you kill you will not find all the upgrades, I found 4 binoculars upgrades and around 4-6 sniper rifle upgrades 2 on the third sniper and a few on the first sniper (cant remember how many exactly).\n\nOverall, I would not buy this game again if I had the option to and would not recommend it to anyone I know.","September 9, 2014","false","17.2"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","11","13","0","0"

I mean, I wasn't expecting much from a game with little to no plot. I rather felt like this game could use more weapons, but it's not so much about the DLC nor the lack of said weapons, it's more of the story that does it in for me. I couldn't feel connected to... I don't even remeber the guy's name- adding to my point and or lack of memory- but I couldn't feel like I could like him persay. Perhaps I'm needing to read his lore myself on some article or something, but I feel as though if this game had cutscenes that intertwined the protagonist more and perhaps even adding more side characters that we could feel connected to, then perhaps this game would be able to compete with major titles. The cutscenes wouldn't even have to be cinematic per se, they're fine how they are. In fact, the art work reminds me of Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker a bit... Maybe that's a bit too generous, but overall it's fine. The gameplay is alright, like I said, what's to expect from a game that comprises itself on the sole purpose of being a multiplayer?\nMaybe that's my beef with this game, its focus is on multiplayer, which is fine, but aren't their enough out there already? Why pay fifty dollars for a buggy game?\nWell's that's my opinion over all.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/238090/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","The Sniper Elite franchise has had a rocky start but, with the adventure of the pretty decent Sniper Elite V2 and the campy yet fun Nazi Zombie Army spinoffs, the series made by Rebellion is looking to establish itself as an important niche first-person shooter catering to those who like to plan their firefights instead of going in guns-blazing.\n\nSniper Elite 3 takes the action to the African front, while retaining the World War 2 setting. Players take control once again of Karl Fairburne, showing off a new portion of his adventures set between 1 and 2. Players must navigate the harsh environments and try to sabotage the plans of the Axis armies in the northern part of Africa. Expect to shoot quite a lot of Nazis, not to mention a few Italians, along the way.\n\nPlayers once again follow the adventures of Karl Fairburne, an American sniper who, after a pretty great performance in the tutorial mission, is tasked by the Allied forces with going deep behind enemy lines in order to disrupt the Axis plans in Northern Africa. What follows is a not so engaging story largely due to the simplicity of the missions that make players infiltrate different enemy camps, steal information, plant bombs, or cause other types of disruptions, and then escape.\n\nThe protagonist isn't fleshed out at all and, due to the lone wolf nature of snipers, he barely gets to interact with other characters. Lots of historical events and locations are name-checked but the game doesn't offer any other details or background info about them.As such, don't expect to be blown away by the plot of Sniper Elite 3, as it's mostly on par with those from previous installments.\n\nWhile the missions in Sniper Elite 3 may not be filled with story elements, they represent a great improvement over previous entries in the series. Instead of linear environments and corridors through bombed out cities, you're now tasked with completing missions in wide open areas in Africa. What's more, the way in which you reach your goals is completely up to the player. You can steal information by sniping Axis generals from hundreds of meters away or you can go in with your silenced pistol and attempt cover takedowns.\n\nThe level design is much more open, encouraging players to explore the level and take note of enemy behavior, patrol patterns, and other such things. The presence of collectibles and hidden treasures should prove great incentives to keep rummaging about.Each of the main eight missions contains different bonus objectives, such as blowing trucks, and adds to your XP score. However, they're not mandatory and you can focus just on completing the main objectives as fast as possible.\n\nIn terms of actual shooting, Sniper Elite 3 doesn't mess all that much with the formula that made its predecessors so powerful. The main emphasis is, of course, on using the sniper rifle, and this time around holding your breath also produces a small red rectangle showing where the bullet will hit the target, after taking into consideration wind, distance, and other such things. Of course, purists can once again turn off all assists so that they feel like they're real snipers. However, the lack of a training area or shooting gallery, so that you come to grips with your sniper rifles, is going to mean lots of trial and error.\n\nThe trademark killcam system is once again present, showing off kills in all their gory glory, particularly when your bullets hit the heads or vital organs of your enemies. However, if you play for extended periods of time, you might want to turn them off as they get a bit tedious, even if their violence is still enjoyable.\n\nThere are a few new mechanics at play with Sniper Elite 3, such as special noise distractions caused by generators, large engines, mortar fire, or even passing planes. These can mask your sniper shots and make disposing of foes undetected much easier.The stealth system in Sniper Elite 3 has been somewhat refined, as now it has a big focus on relocation in case you get spotted. Enemy soldiers will converge on your last known location and, if you manage to sneak away to a certain distance, they'll just go back to their regular patrol routes.\n\nAI in general isn't that sharp and player detection is erratic, to say the least. Often soldiers would spot me while I was behind cover and at quite a distance, while other times they'd ignore me even if I was sprinting near their location.Another rather annoying problem is that enemy chatter can be heard from quite far away. This means that you might think an enemy is right near you but they're actually much further away.\n\nSniper Elite 3 allows players to save anywhere and at any point in time, in addition to the checkpoints, so don't worry about messing up, as you can easily go back to load a save and once again try your luck or a different strategy.\n\nSniper Elite 3's multiplayer includes both a cooperative mode, as you can work alongside a friend to complete the story experience, but also a competitive one.The co-op is pretty fun and serves to disperse some of the boredom that you might feel when going through the main missions, but the lack of a matchmaking system means you need to manually find and add people to play with.The competitive experience features some rather standard shooter game types but there are a few interesting ones like the No Cross one, which erects a barrier between the two teams, meaning you must snipe enemies from afar instead of trying to go in for brawls in close quarters.\n\nSniper Elite 3 takes place in the harsh environment of Northern Africa and this means a pretty novel color palette dominated not just by brown but also by yellow, green, or sometimes blue when reaching different oasis areas. The animations on some enemies are a bit stiff and, while the textures look relatively good, there is a fair bit of pop-in when zooming into new areas with your sniper or binoculars.The soundtrack is relatively good but doesn't stand out all that much. Voice acting is certainly varied, with enemies talking in German or Italian, but protagonist Karl Fairburne retains his somewhat boring, rough voice.\n\nSniper Elite 3 is a relatively fun niche shooter experience that improves some of the faults seen in its predecessors, particularly in regards to mission design and the open nature of levels. It's still weighed down by bugs, erratic AI, and a shoddy story, but it will certainly entertain fans of the franchise and those looking for a thinking man's shooter experience.","October 2, 2014","true","238.4"," 34 of 56 people (61%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","61","34","56","3","1"

This is purely an opinion from a person who has played this game. If you feel differently, then that's fine.\n\n--\n\nReading a lot of the reviews, people say Sinper Elite V2 was better than Sniper Elite 3, Personally, I've never played Sniper Elite V2, and nor do I wanna get a game that is that old, as the multiplayer might be taken off soon (not worth the money spent server side) or other reasons. That's why I went for the more recent game in the franchise, Sniper Elite 3.\n\nSince I've gotten it, I love it. I don't see any issues with it, and since I don't know how "great" Sniper Elite V2 was, I'm really not missing out on anything, if there's anything to even miss.\n\nAnother concern people have expressed is that this game is less... sniping? Looking at some gameplay videos from both games, then actually playing Sniper Elite 3, I don't see why this is a concern. Sure you sometimes have to rely on your secondary, or performing stealth kills, but you sure as heck can go around and snipe. What's stopping you from doing that? Personally, I love the mix of stealth kills, sniping kills, and sometimes having to switch to a secondary or pistol when in a rough situation. Isn't that a step in the right direction? I more realistic approach on combat? I see no problems with what the company did, and I support the new approach.\n\nPeople also have said that Sniper Elite 3 is just Sinper Elite V2 but with bug fixes. If that's the case, then that is a good point. They could have just fixed the old game BUT you have to take into account this is a company, and they need to make money. However they do that isn't your decision to say. They felt it would be better to spend their efforts into a new game as opposed to fixing an old game, which is fair. Sure they could've saved their customers some money by upgrading the old game, but in turn they would lose money. Doesn't make sense in their eyes.\n\n--\n\nOverall, I think this game is a great game if you want to snipe, play stealth and take your time to think out the best plan of attack. If you want to just jump in guns blazing, you might want to reconsider which game franchise you want to play. This game is one of the best, and most realistic, sniper/stealth games out there, and I don't think you'll find much better.\n\nIf you find this game on sale, then it's a steal. I can see people justifying a $55 price point, so anything lower is a great deal.\n\n--\n\nAgain, this is just MY opinion on the game, and I hope it helps some people out when/if they are deciding to get this game.\n\nHave a great day!","January 10","true","44.0"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","13","18","0","13"

Its identical to Sniper Elite V2, except that it now is in Africa and you get to blow a lot of vehicles on the process\n\n* The campaign is boring as hell, same American-hero stereotype that is the same boring badass... uninteresting storyline, blah blah, find him, kill him, take his notes, oh a tank is going to kill you, blow them, escape. rinse & repeat, rinse & repeat, rinse & repeat.\n\n* Unrealistic ballistics, those who think it's realistic, must be ♥♥♥♥ed in the head. Also most of the shots happen from 40-150meters, should atleast be more like +700meters. ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥, with that little distance I could urinate my enemies to death.\n\n* Very few weapons to choose from, unless you want to spend extra money for the DLC's. Like they're not stealing money from you by just buying this game.\n\n* AI is probably the dullest I've seen in a long time: Enemies don't give a ♥♥♥♥ if their comrades who lay dead beside them (even at hardest difficulty). One minute they hunt you, and suddenly all the enemies gets memory loss, goes back and patrolling as usual, even if you shot them. Friendly AI is a disaster aswell: In a level, he will wait for ~5 minutes without doing a damn thing. And ofcourse you must wait for the ♥♥♥♥er.\nThis game has so many bugs...\n\nAs I said, this game is like V2, though worse. Kill-Cams look exactly the same, even the same sound and music.

Graphics are improved and better than in SEv2, though there are still several bugs and glitches that need to be fixed.\nSome controls in the game have been changed and are quite annoying. Now your character can't move back in the normal way anymore, but turns around instead which is often very annoying. Climbing a ladder is also very annoying because you really need to be on the right spot to be able to climb otherwise your character starts turning around. Annoying as hell!!!\nYou need to play alot to "earn" all the special things to customize your rifle which is pretty much the same as in most other massive online games.\nThe maps are bigger than in SEv2 but not really as open as you think (or hoped) they would be.\nThere are not as many Multiplayer and Co-op modes as in SEv2 and Co-op players might feel themselves a bit left out in the cold because in this game there is even less to do in Co-op than in SEv2.\nInviting a friend to join the game has been made a bit easier, but unlike in SEv2 random players can't join a Co-op game anymore. So looking for a game is gone... This is a big downer for the Co-op players.\nThe tagging in Multiplay is also a bit different, but at least you can't be shot through a wall or door or whatever anymore like in SEv2, when you're tagged.\nExplosives don't have the same blast radius anymore as in SEv2; now they have the blast radius of a fire cracker.\nThe trenchgun is pretty much useless in Multi; can't hit a thing unless your opponent is 1-2 yards away from you.\nIf the enemy is shooting, especially from close range, you can't shoot until he stops firing. This should really be fixed very quickly.\nSo in all, for Multiplay the game is fun (but not really) with several new features; for Co-op it's a big bummer and for Singleplay it's pretty much the same as in any other game.\nAlthough the game looks like a beta version, because of the bugs and glitches that still need some fixing, I still like the game but I must say that I was more enthousiastic with SEv2 than with this one. Personally I find SEv2 better in alot of ways especially concerning controls.\nI think I don't like this game as much as the previous version because it's starting to look like other similar shooter games. Maybe I would like the game more when they've fixed all the bugs and glitches and change some controls and put back "the missing weapons" from SEv2.\nIn short, the game really needs to be fixed in alot of ways or people will loose their interest in this game which is a pitty because it could have been a very good game.","July 12, 2014","false","305.2"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","5"

I loved it. Its relocation mechanic makes for a very different kind of stealth, which really comes into its own with the wide open levels that are full of alternative paths, places to hide, and elevated sniper positions. The controls are responsive and the weapons are satisfying.\n\nUnfortunately the net code is atrocious. I have been unable to finish most of the levels in co-op because it randomly kicks me or my partner. Not even necessarily when something interesting happens, we'll be in the middle of doing something and the game kicks us both back to the main menu. In very long missions this can be a tremendous waste of time, as we can sometimes play for half an hour before we get kicked, and it won't let us wait for our partner to rejoin or even just load a savegame. "Maybe it's your connection", I hear you say. Nope, we were on Skype the whole time and the call never dropped.\n\nThere are other issues in multiplayer. Sometimes when I start a game in co-op, I have no scope reticle (making sniping somewhat difficult). On one occasion, I was playing the Survival mode and we'd made it to the last round - my friend went down, and when I revived him, he got stuck in spectator mode. His character was just lying there uselessly looking around.\n\nIf you want to play this game in singleplayer, buy it. It's a fairly long game - 9 missions including the tutorial, but each is easily an hour long, probably more. Worth the asking price for sure. If you're buying it for co-op, give it a miss. You probably won't be able to.","August 24, 2014","true","36.5"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lorddarthvik/recommended/238090/","lorddarthvik","lorddarthvik","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lorddarthvik/","182 products in account","TLDR: don't buy yet, only if it's around 5bucks. bugged, still a console game with small closed totally linear maps, huge open maps and new tactical gameplay is a blatant lie, shooting feel got worse, missions are sometimes annoying, relocation mechanics ruin the immersion and are very annoying, AI is worse then V2, the sound masking finally makes some sense and works, game looks better and real pretty, pre-scripted chain reaction explosions are fun to trigger and watch.\n\nJust like others said before me, this is in almost no way better then v2 was.\nThe most basic problem with the previous game was, that it was a console game, which made it play more like an on-rails shooter than an open world game. Small enviroments, a maximum of 2-3 paths to take on each map. It is still the case.\n\nThe pros:\n- it looks better\n- more stealth options, like hiding in bushes, and now most things that go bang loud enough will hide your shots, like broken generators or explosions\n- chain explosions: you don't have to place bombs to take out every hard target you come across. This is the one and only freedom of choice you get during the missions. Place explosives/throw grenades, or find the right "explosive tank of gas/ammo" and shoot it, thus starting a chain explosion that takes out the target.\n\nThe cons:\n- you are forced to move after every third shot you take, it doesn't matter that the nearest enemy is over 300 meters away, or 20. They will always instantly pinpoint your exact location, and start attacking you. So you must use the "innovative, awesome, super new Relocation system". It's a cheap and blatantly stupid way to save time and money on coding a proper AI, which in this case is worse than it was in the 90's. This means you cannot use any sniper hidout in the game for more than two shots, regardless of concealment, distance, and so on.\n- again this relocation system means, that if you run far enough without being spotted, which is like 30 meters, they stop searching for you. At least the game sais that it's all clear after about 30 seconds pass. This is a fail in itself. There is no pressure, you just need to have a rock a couple of meters back the way to hide behind.\n- But, when the game tells you it's all clear, sometimes it doesn't tell the AI this. A random soldier out of the dozens that was after you, stays in pursuit and keeps running towards your now supposedly unknown location, will find you no matter what, and will try to gun you down. So its a total fail.\n- There are a bunch of unlocks and upgrades in the game, they are all 100% useless and doesn't worth your time. They may change the scope wobble a bit, but lose the zoom on the scope, and such trade-offs make every choice a bad choice. Get another rifle, although all 4 works about the same, some are just more annoying to aim with than the others.\n- "Sniper's Nests" are thrown around the maps, basically telling you where to go and shoot from. You are encuraged by the game every time to visit and use these. The problem is, that these spots are totally useless, as you cannot shoot more than twice from them, because relocation...\n- first day DLC (I own it I think, because I was stupid enough to pre-purchase. I would not do it again though)\n- AI is as bad as it was, magic aim with machine pistols from a 100 meters, more accurate than your sniper rifle. It's really just a way to force you to "use more stealth". To put it bluntly, all the "features" in this game are there to make you play the game in the exact way the creators want you to.  So that you wouldn't notice the abyssmal AI, the total lack of open world and freedom of choice they promised. See, that's the deffiniton of an "on-rails shooter". The exact opposite of open world/multiple choice.\n-  the missions are a mess. For example, the very first mission after the tutorials. SPOILER ALERT: You are supposed to kill 4 officers, loot them, then a fifth a one pops up out of nowhere on a halftrack and you must blow it up. You are in the worst possible place, but the mission text and your character tells you that no worries, you have time to prepare. That is, actually, about 15 seconds, before the halftrack turns the corner and spots you. Once you are spotted, it's mission failed. If you hide, the truck simply leaves through the gates which takes about another 15 mintues. It's a quicktime event, which you can only solve if you have prepared for it, before you knew it existed. Clever, ehh? So after you figure it out, that the game autosaved before! you looted the last officer and started the event, you make the "open world" decision to use the mines and dynamite you found right before the autosave, to blow the hell out of the truck. It's no challange at all once you know that you need to place a single, otherwise useless, mine on the one and only road. See, that's the complex tactical and strategic "decision" you are allowed to make.\n\nThe LIES:\n- Large open maps: The maps may be a little bit bigger, but this is still a last-gen console game. Everything is cramped into small valleys or obscured by hills and fog so you may not see farther than your avarage console shooter. And they are most certainly far from open. Every map is made out of "zones" like the city squares in v2. You have these small, little bit "open spaces", connected by valleys formed by walls of sand, rock, buildings...\n- Tactical gameplay: See mission example above. Where there is some more open space, the enemys won't load up, until you get close enough. This makes it impossible to properly plan an attack, because they will pop up in places where you wouldn't expect them. It's like we are back in 2000. At least in V2 it wasn't as annoying, because the narrow streets kept the pop-in hidden, and by the time you turned the corner onto the next street, most of them were in position, ready to receive their headshots. This time around, even when they load in, their hitboxes are bugged. Sometimes, although you should most definetly hit them according to the built-in "aim bot diamond", it still won't register as a hit on the target, because it's too far away for the game to handle. The hitboxes of enemies are generally bugged. You can only perform heart shots by aiming at the middle of their backs. A seemingly perfect hearth shot from the front will never kill.\n\nThe Simply Disappointing:\n\n- New X-ray stuff: Now this is almost true. The fact is that you get almost the same effects as in V2, but now they painted in some muscles and veins. These do not interract with the bullet in any way, its just a second layer of "skin".\n- vehicles go boom and xray and such: It is vey very stupid. Not as much as previously, but almost. Unlike in V2 where you had to shoot the "gas cap" on a Tiger Tanks rear (those are air filters irl, nothing that contains fuel), in this game, to blow up a smaller Pz.III. you need 3-5 good shots. Two through the rear grills (there is no such thing on the real one in those places), and one through the window slit of the driver (you coudln't so it irl, its a "periscope" with mirrors, not a direct hole) It is True, that now you get kill cams of vehicles as well, but they are destroyed in the most stupid ways possible. Nothing historical, accurate, or fun. If you want to go a little more easy on tanks, use a Panershreck, there's always one around when you need it.\n- small number of maps, although because it's bugged, it takes a long time to finish.\n- shooting doesn't feel as satisfying\n\nThe game is riddled with bugs. From dead enemys with blue tongues, through tanks that spin in a circle when they get hit by a rock, to the odd guard who can't be killed with bullets, only with meleé, your well planned stealthy approach can turn into a mess in seconds.

Almost all missions have different ways of making the objectives, you can use stealth or fire in everything that moves, I prefer the second option because I have more fun, but it's a little bit more difficult but this is only my personal preference.\nAnother positive point is the variety of missions, each mission is different. The X-Ray cam is one of the best things in the game, and it's very detailed.\nBut there isn't a game without problems in the campaign: there are very few missions and you can make all of them really fast. If you want more missions you have to buy the DLCs. Another problem is the weapons available, just 3 rifles, 3 submachines, the panzershreck and 3 pistols, if you want more, you need to buy the DLCs.\n\nMULTIPLAYER:\n\nThe multiplayer mode is good for sometime, but after some hours of gameplay the multiplayer becames sickening. The problem in particular for me is that most of the servers don't allow you to play with the secundary weapons, with this you have to play onlt with rifles and pistols, which led to the match became boring, because you have to wait someone to move or make a wrong decision, but there are one or two servers that allow you to use secundary weapons (even though it doesn't make the game with more movement), allows you to have a little more fun, like ignore everything and just go firing the panzerchreck until the ammo get over, this is funny, but I think is probably because of the risk of someone make this, that most of the servers don't allow you to use secundary weapons.\n\nV2X3:\n\nIf you are wandering what of the two sniper elites you should buy (I am ignoring the first, because that one is terrible!) you have to consider this: even though the 3 have less missions it have more time of gameplay, and is more difficult, but I recommend you to wait a good sale and buy both of them.\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nI recommend you to buy this game, but only if it's on sale, because if don't, you are going to waste your money, not because the game isn't good, but because it's just a few hours of gameplay.","January 11","true","13.8"," 16 of 25 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","16","25","0","0"

It wasn't a bad game and in fact in coop it was rather enjoyable.\nSo much so I got a copy of SN3 and even purchased a copy for a friend so we could happily coop play our way through it.\nThis version is much more open and that near open world (or at least as close as they were going to come) allowed all kinds of tactical options.\nIt really did change up the way the game was played and I mean that in a good way.\nIf you want to play sniper/spotter killing from long range and repositioning then the game has it. If you wish for a sniper to cover the high ground while you stealth kill your way in close then it has it as well.\nIf you are just in it for some laughs and go rocket launcher, shotgun and all things loud and destructive then it can be that as well.\nI've played the game, the dlc and I have no regrets about my copy or the one I purchased for a friend.\n\nMy only complaint?

I am just not enjoying this game. It takes a lot of patience and still does not run well on my PC, even after many patches. It still feels buggy as it was at launch. The controls are still unresponsive and seem far too random. Half of the time when I pull the trigger, nothing happens. Yet I have plenty of ammo. It just doesn't fire. Sniper shots are best taken from scripted locations, sucking most fun out of planning good shots.

I've done missions where I've never alerted a guard, stayed completely hidden, slowly taking out enemies without arousing suspicion only to not be rewarded in a manner that fits the time spent playing the game that way. I feel like this would have added tremendously to the game had they rewarded players more for stealth play.\n\nThe killcams can be amusing but they can also be a bit much sometimes. Around the 3rd mission I found myself skipping a lot of them unless there was a real good kill that was worth watching.\n\nThe game does a good job at letting you plot ways to take out enemies. I honestly really enjoyed that a lot about this game. For instance, I could set a trap on the road for a truck to drive over, thus exploding the truck. The enemies nearby will be alerted and go to investigate and slowly walk into a tripmine, blowing up 2 enemies. Another enemy notices (in a particular area I don't have a clear shot in) and will approach the explosion in an area where I have a clear shot.\n\nOverall, the game isn't bad but it's not worth more than maybe $10 with the bugs currently in the game.","December 3, 2015","false","23.6"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

The price is WAY too high for a game that has maybe 12 hours of gameplay.\n\nWith 12 hours of gameplay i mean it is intense, fun and you really fit your role as a sniper. Taking down enemy snipers, preparing ambushes, you have dozen ways to get the job done. I played the game with no rush, basically sneaking all the time, making sure i was on a low profile the entire playthrough.\n\nThe complete game is made around you: the ways of completing your objective are already planned, that there would be no surprise to you, which means this game is REALLY easy. It can be a bad or a good thing.\n\nI finished the game on the second most hardest difficulty, and i still don't know why it is called 'Sniper Elite'. It's all as easy as the lowest difficulty, if you are playing sneaky.\n\nThe stealth system works like a clock; you kill, hide, sneak, kill. And adding the 'melee takedown' to your arsenal of skills, means that you don't have to carry a suppresed sidearm with you, unlikely to Sniper Elite V2. This means you can FINALLY use different pistols.\n\nBuying the Season Pass with this game is highly recomended. Giving you new snipers, and even camouflages, it also adds in new singleplayer maps.\n\nI recommend this game if you want to check out the singleplayer. Play this game thoroughly, there are many places where you might not come if you don't explore.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with this game, really a basic fun game where even i was hooked to the stroyline.","April 13","true","18.5"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","1"

I personally expected this game to be a bit more realistic when I bought it... reading about 'bullet drop' and 'bullet travel time'. However, the game is very arcade like (like MoH).\n\nOverall this is a (fairly) solid game that offers fun (casual) gameplay with decent enough graphics, controls and UI. There are however a lot of small (and some obvious) things that are lacking (or plain dumb) in the game and a large part of that is due to the AI and general game design.\n\n\n\nThe bad:\nOne game mechanic in the game is that you have to 'reposition' every time you fire your sniper rifle and the AI have heard your shot. The game always tells you to move 30 meters way from your previous location. 90% of the time it is totally not needed to reposition as the AI does nothing then go into a crouch position at the same spot they already were (you at your current position is not in danger).\n\nThere is a tagging feature that you can use with your binocular. In itslef it is a nice feature, but it takes away any possible challenge or surprise out of the game as you can even watch the enemies behind rocks and walls (it belongs in Deus Ex, not in a WW2 sniper game). Even if you do not use that feature the AI will still get a tag above their heads when they are alerted (at least in normal difficulty).\n\nThere is clipping with some objects. Stairs railings have no collision and I had some logs/covers and rocks that I could walk through.\n\nAI is pretty much blind. You can stand 30 meters away on a road in front of a heavy machinegunner and he is totally oblivious to your pressence, making thus the stealth aspect pretty minimal. Lots of places where you can just run or even sprint without alerting enemies. I even sprinted into enemies that I overlooked and still could do close quarter melee kills without alerting surrounding AI.  There is also sometimes an issue with multiple AI standing at the same place where it looks like just one AI standing there, but there are several of them inside each other.\n\nThe environment sounds are lacking, it's Afrika, but I don't hear any nature at all (not even crickets) while walking through the environment. [EDIT] the later levels (airport) do have decent environment sounds, I wonder why they left it so empty in the early levels.[]\n\n\n\nThe neutral:\nGraphics. With maxed out settings it looks good thanks to the AA and stuff, but the 3D modeling of the environment is not much better then a 'Far Cry 2' from 5+ years ago, though the texturing is nice and of decent quality.\n\nThe game is advertized as having 'huge' levels/maps, but it's nothing like that. The maps are for a large part corridor roads with overwatch positions and some open squares with houses/ruins. Don't expect an open world like environment it is still basically 'on rails' and linear, but with areas that allows different approaches.\n\n[edit] Playing through the game a second time now and noticed that there quite some objects and rocks that have to big hitboxes. Meaning that you can freely look at a target in your crosshair, but when you shoot the bullet gets stopped by an invisible box around the object/rock.[]\n\n\n\nThe good:\nEven with all the bad and cheesy aspects the overall gameplay is an enjoyable experience. The maps still give you enough freedom to do different aproaches and different tactics and playstyles and the game feels immersive enough to keep you interested.\n\nThe bullet camera is not a new feature of the game, but it is still nice to watch how your preciely aimed shot landed right in between the eyes of the enemy AI dude.\n\nI recommend to play it on the setting 'sniper elite', because lower difficulty ruins the potential fun this game has to offer. Even the 2nd harderst difficulty is a walk in the park, but the AI seems to behave a bit better on harder difficulty specially after they are allerted.","June 24, 2015","true","85.8"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","13","20","0","0"

It plays great and feels great, but I also believe it's a little less demanding than the previous instalment...even though it looks better.\n\nIt's nothing ground breaking, the gun sounds and headshots definitely feel powerful and intense, but the game is easier to play. Even playing on second hardest difficulty when you go into slow motion shot it actually high lights where your bullet will go so you can take a perfect shot. This is perfect for gamers like me that don't have time to master the game, but a little less perfect for those that would like a real challenge.\n\nThat being said I haven't tried the hardest difficulty because you can't save and frankly I just don't have the time for that.\n\nSo a quick summary in + and -s :\n\n+ Great graphics\n+ Rewarding gameplay and kill shots (enhanced kill cam)\n+ Easy controls (but quickly seen to be catered to console players with the weapon wheel)\n+ Satisfying X-ray kills\n+ Story Coop\n+ A little "free roam" to it, I mean it feels like it but the game just gives you a little more option as how to complete a level it's not as linear. So I would say it's the illusion of free roam, but it's just a big map with several waypoints\n\n- Really more of the same thing\n- Graphics are great but no visual leap forward\n- Controls take a slight step back in terms of cover, at least I have yet to find the cover button (edit, cover is simply being up against a wall and he chooses when to cover...a little tedious)\n- Game breaking bugs in some cases (Target glitches and you can't kill him). (edit seems to have patched a lot in latest release)\n\nWill update this as I complete the game, but it's def an 8/10 for me. It's nothing ground breaking but you will definitely enjoy it no matter what.\n\nThat being said I would compare this game to any series, it's ok to have the same game play for a couple of releases but eventually they will need to try something new.\n\nI don't want the same game for Sniper 4.","June 28, 2014","true","1.9"," 16 of 26 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","16","26","0","0"

It is not worth the current asking price.  Wait for it to go on sale.  I agree with all of the other negative reviews given here.  All of their complaints are valid.  I saw the same things and feel the same way, cheated.  I will skip over complaining about the same things others have documented here and add even more.\n\nI honestly don't see much difference between V3 and V2.  The small amount of content and lack of real enhancements to the environment don't merit the cost.  If it was $19.99 it would be worth it.  In fact, even if it included all the currently available DLC it wouldn't be worth $49.99.\n\nDon't let the words " ...huge, open levels and the exotic terrain... " fool you.  They are larger maps but you can't go wherever you want like you can in say BF4 or Borderlands 2.  You can not jump.  You can only climb where and when they allow you to.  So you really are restricted in where you can go.  The X-ray vision of shooting people and vehicles only goes so far and becomes meh after the 10th or 15th time of seeing it.  The AI quite often will see you and shoot you through walls and other obsticles.  In game the voice over recommends you move dead bodies to avoid suspicion, but as soon as you pickup the dead body the enemy sees you and comes running.  Even if they don't have line of sight, if they are within a certain range they will come running.  After about the 10th time of trying to hide bodies I gave up.  I could be inside a building picking up a body and AI outside would come running in to catch me carrying the body.  I guess they heard me grunting and groaning while picking up the dead weight?  The bullet drop-off due to gravity is not consistent and the reticles on the scopes do not appear to be calibrated at all.  So you are almost always guessing when it comes to aiming.  The windage meter does not seem to be coordinated with the reticle either.  When it shows a 2 tick wind left to right and you adjust your aim with the reticle by 2 ticks you are completely off.  Sometimes that two ticks is only a-half on the reticle other times it 1 or 1.5 but it is never the same.  Guess work again.  All of the zoom levels of all the rifles, and all the scopes appear to be exactly the same despite the in game GUI telling you there are differences.  For example: according to the comparison feature of the GUI the Gewehr zoom level should be at least twice that of the Garand but it appears to be exactly the same when you are using it.  As a result of the lack of zoom, and poor windage and elevation implementations, long distance shots are extremely hard to make on the fourth or fifth shot, let along the first.  In a game where stealth and aim are key more work should have been done in this area.  None of my Long Shots were ever registered in my stats.  I got points for the the shot (they are detailed with each kill) but didn't get credit for completing a long shot at the end of the map. Several other stats are not accurately kept and credit for goals reached is not given at the end of the map.\n\nI can not help but feel the game was rushed to market.  It can not possibly be complete.  Like I said, even if they included all of the current DLC it wouldn't be worth $49.99.  Wait for it to go on sale to avoid the feeling of having been cheated.  Use the $49.99 to buy 4 or 5 other games that are now on sale for $9.99.  I guarantee that by the time you finish them you'll be able to get this game and all the DLC at half the price.\n\nPops","July 18, 2014","false","40.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The bad parts; the base part of the game is short in my opinion not worth the £40 price tag. There is a very limited range of base rifles, the new upgrades to them make an interesting feature however no modifications massively alter the rifles, one is decent enough, but there is a clear focus on making you pay for any other gear.\n\nThere are some bugs, I encountered several crashes, an issue with collectables resetting the count, skipping bullet time causing lost shots, and afair few more minor bugs that were more of a nusance than majorr issue. I found myself more often than not "going loud" and sniping or using my rifles in a less than elite sniper manner due to bordum or frustration.\n\nOver all it is a good game if you could pick it up and all the DLC's for around £20 the lot.\n\nOh and one of my major irritations was for all the attempted realism, being able to wipe out half a base, have people search for you and then give up ignoring the dead bodies littered around simply to go back on sentry duty, sometimes even patroling over an area of corpses, just seemed so basically wrong.","July 20, 2014","false","34.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","1"

That is not the case. Bullet drop matters for you but still not the computer. Just FYI .. A panzerfaust will bullseye you from over 200 meters. which is pretty amazing as it is outside of the range of the actual weapon. You spend most of the game unable to use your rifle and they flat out tell you your SMG is not a primary weapon ... true. You are left sneaking about with a silenced pistol most of the game or trying to sneak up behind for a stealth kill. (funnier still he basically poses for stealth kills)  You can only climb up and over designated places and items.

There are of course some pros and cons, and I'll start with the pros:\n- Real stealth this time. Previous game had ''stealth'' but could never draw away from the enemy attention.\n- Customization. Can have different loadouts (Alpha - Delta). You can also change your rifle with different scopes, stocks, actions etc. These have different advantages and disadvantages.\n- Better graphics. Graphics are not really ''next-gen'', but are definitely better than the previous game.\n- More open maps. More variety in maps so you can choose different approaches.\n- Improved killcam. More layers when in x-ray killcam such as muscle layers etc.\n\nCons:\n- AI. Yes, the Ai has been improved, but are still a bit stupid even when on hardest difficulty.\n- Variety of weapons. MUCH less weapons than previous game.\n- Ranking system. I personally think this system is a bit useless in SP, because you get xp for EVERTHING.\n- Experience gain. I also think this is wrong, because you get more XP for killing with your silenced pistol than for a stealth takedown with your hands.\n\nDespite all these things, I still think is a very good game, even for the not so Sniper Elite Vets.

The new game mechanics, like forcing you to relocate, become repetitive really fast since you just have to run back 30 meters and then go back in order to the same damn place in order to keep shooting the same enemies. I get it, relocation is important as a sniper, but I can really keep shooting from the same place by doing a little field workout? That's just plain stupid.\n\nThe same goes for sound sources. It's predictable and repetitive. You can stand next to a broken generator and keep shooting enemies like clay pidgeons.  Also, the story evens, such as appearing reinforcements are sooooo predictable. Lay down a couple of mines and watch your enemies explode and the mission finish itself. I have to say, Sniper Elite 1 did WAY better in that regard.\n\nAs if that wasn't enough, you routinely encounter enemy snipers who have WAY better rifles than you, which again, doesn't make any sense, neither from a gameplay perspective, nor from a historic one.\n\nAs a summary, I get it that the developers wanted the game to be more appealing to the masses, but it's been dumbed down too far for my taste.","July 3, 2014","false","12.8"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","1"

I was also only playing for short periods so sometimes it took me a while to finish a map. Its not the sort of game that you can't leave I was more than happy when killed just to switch it off.  Its not a bad game overall if you are looking for an arcade game. The graphics are OK but early COD looking. The sniper simulation seems poor to me. The difficulty level I played on was a step down from the top level and the bullet physics should have on been "real" but it seemed very poor & quirky. The maps are quite small so there are few opportunities for very long distance shots where maybe weather would have an efffect. There are no weather effects to indicate wind direction for example. The environmental effects are static.  A few bug fixes have come out and I'm not sure my game was patched unlike other steam games where its automatic.I bought the discounted game with an included DLC which I can't find and quite honestly I don't want to waste any more time playing it.

I am like half way through already and never played anymore of the singleplayer.  It is not open world but the maps are big enough for you to enjoy and have a little.. little wonder around with a multiple route towards a mission which is good.\n\nThe multiplayer has some really nice parts of the game.  If you enjoyed Sniper Elite V2, then you will enjoy this too.  The maps are bigger in portion and offer some nice visuals on the side and up close with many many ways around over, through and under something.  Really good fun.\n\nThen you notice the game itself is the same as Sniper Elite V2 and becomes very boring. Once you been there and done that you play this and you realise the game is like a big addon.  It's like what Call of Duty do with their games, they copy paste everything and just release new campaign for a £39.99 price tag, this is kinda the same but the story is a lot shorter and the graphics are improved.\n\nThe new bullet cam is improved, with added detail to when your bullet hits your mark, you get more detail ontop of crushing bone, exploding limbs etc  Really good step up but still the same game.\n\nIf you enjoy the entire franchise then you will most likely enjoy this game too, really it has some good stuff added to the game but it is more or less the same and for the £39.99 price tag, it kinda steers you away.\n\nPersonally the game is worth the time to play and enjoy.  Once you done the campaign you might get enjoyment from another repeat but I would not, luckily the game has multiplayer and you will benefit from this sniper each other and setting traps with good unlocks to help play the game.\n\nWait for the price to drop below £29.99 and maybe £26.99 and the game will be worth the time and money then.\n\nWould I recommend it? Yes because it is a good game but not the price wanted.","July 1, 2014","true","1.0"," 24 of 42 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","24","42","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DivRoK/recommended/238090/","DivRoK","DivRoK","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DivRoK/","433 products in account","Sniper Elite 3 is a third person tactical shooter developed by Rebellion Developments and published by 505 Games. This game was released on PC, PS3, PS4, 360 and Xbox One in June 2014. It is a prequel to Sniper Elite V2 and the third game in the sniper series.\n\nThe gameplay in Sniper 3 is based heavily on being slow and steady with your approach to completing objectives, with an also strong focus on sniper gun play much like the previous games. What I really liked about Sniper 3 is that the stealthy approach is pretty much the only viable way to go on most missions otherwise you'll just be pinned down in a firefight and outnumbered. The stealth aspect of the game is done extremely well, you probably will be detected by the enemies whilst taking down the guards, but it is all about cleaning up after yourself by dragging bodies to the long grass, or how you escape and hide away until the enemies give up searching for you. You can use various methods to distract enemies such as throwing rocks and laying traps. Before each level you get to choose your load out, you get the choice of a sniper rifle, a secondary weapon, side arm, and various other items such as grenades, medi-packs and traps. As you level up between stages you also unlock further rewards and items.\n\nOf course, a Sniper game wouldn't be complete without the stunning slow motion graphics of your bullet soaring through the air and them piercing through your foes scrotum, this my friends is the pinnacle of slow motion gaming. Granted after a while you'll be skipping them because they will grow tiresome as they play after every kill with your sniper, but still, this gives you a chance to get some brilliant cinematic screenshots to show off your sniping skills.\n\nGraphically, Sniper Elite 3 is gorgeous, I wasn't able to push out full graphic settings on 4k resolution, but even on the lower resolutions (1080p), it still looks stunning. There is a wide array of setting to choose from which is always good to see. The visuals are amazing though, the night time levels really show of the games truly stunning lighting effects as well. I was a little disappointed to see the lens flare effect being used a bit too much, but everything else is truly stellar.\n\nThe game is fully voice acted, with the enemy soldiers speaking in German too, so subtitles are recommended for that. The sound effects really add an extra level of immersion to the gameplay. A nice feature which is added is that you can disguise your bullet shots underneath the sound of loud sounds in game too, which really helps you in your efforts to complete levels as stealthy as possible.\n\nI have to admit, this game is quite difficult, even on the easiest settings; you really do need to take each level with a sense of slow and steady. There is really no point in running in all guns blazing because you will just get gunned down within seconds of being spotted. You will need to backtrack plenty of times in order to escape being detected, you'll be needing to hide in rooms, crawl under buildings, anything which you can imagine you doing in the situation you are in, you can do. The latter levels of the game also ramp up the difficulty significantly as well, as each level slowly introduces more and more enemies for you to deal with.\n\nEach level in Sniper Elite 3 is massive. Each level will have its own main objective, but as you progress and reach new areas of the zone, you'll also unlock optional objectives, which can be things such as destroying some trucks, cutting off communication or something searching for secret plans. These optional objectives reward you with additional experience at the end of the level and also add an extra element of immersion to the game as well. The size of each level really means that you can get stuck in, and explore to your hearts content. There are countless amounts of collectable items for you to find if that is your thing too. Each of the games objectives, whether it be main or optional, will have more than one way of you being able to complete them, which will really add some replay ability to the game on your second run through.\n\nI was a little let down by the fact that I finished the game's single player in about five hours, granted I was playing on the easiest difficulty, but for a big release like this, I was expecting something more to be honest. I can see there being an essence of replay ability due to the nature of the levels being able to be completed in more ways than one, but I would say that there is no real need for playing through the game more than twice at least. There is a multiplayer side to the game, which I tried out, but it seems to be a little on the low side of players, and struggled to actually get into any proper gameplay, because given that it is a sniper based game, most people are camping in well-hidden places just picking people off when they try and complete objectives, for me I didn't really enjoy the multiplayer.\n\nTechnically, I had a one major problem with Sniper Elite 3, and that was that the game kept crashing on launching the title, it would reach the title screen, but then just crash to desktop. This actually turned out to be an issue with Malwarebytes closing it, so it would be highly recommended that you add the Sniper Elite 3 folder into the exception settings for Malwarebytes if you run that AV. Granted that it wasn't actually Sniper Elite causing the crash, you would still expect the game to have been tested with various popular AVs like this to see if they caused any compatibility problems.\n\nMy conclusion of Sniper Elite 3 would be that I would only recommend the game as a single player title; because the multiplayer just didn't do it for me. Given that the single player side of the game can be completed in almost five hours, the full price tag of £39, 99 is absolutely absurd, and is actually fairly offensive that they can charge that amount of money for such little content. I would only say this game is worth picking up when it is below the £10 mark, yes the gameplay is top class, and the graphics are stunning, but you can pick up any of the other Sniper games for the same experience in both of those departments for cheaper. Actually saying that, it looks like all of the games in this series are expensive. Definitely wait for sale season to start before adding Sniper Elite 3 to your library.","March 9","true","3.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","6","8","2","0"

And they all use updated version  introduced in october 1943). Best part was when we (in coop campaign) saw position with flak 36 guarded  by only 2 men, and you guessed it, they both had Panzerschrecks. And they won´t hesitate, and will use HEAT round against single man. Bullet drop is awful (but Panzerschreck flies completely straight), and you cant hit anything with submachinegun,if it is more than 10 m away. And you have problem to hit person 5 m away with longer burst. Even MG 42 on tripod has bigger reticle than Opel blitz (truck) 20 m away, no joke, i tested it.

Its designed more like the older Hitman games.  Open levels, kill everyone, or kill the target only, go undetected, or go guns blazing.  My only gripe is the "realistic" bullet physics are less realistic, and more just to make the game harder.  A .306 round is not going to drop a entire yard at a hundred yards out.

Unlike many franchises, Sniper Elite continues to get better with each sequel while expanding on its original recipe for success. Naturally the graphics are much improved, but overall gameplay and concepts core to the game have also received major upgrades.\n\nThe much-loved "Kill Cam" is back and better than ever, giving gamers a rush of adrenaline and satisfaction after a successful target elimination in true sniper fashion. The stealth component of the game is also better than either of its predecessors and can play a vital role in a mission's success depending on the gamer's style of play. Replay value is extremely high for this game with the inclusion of steam achievements, co-op play and several options for multiplayer.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed this game personally and while I do recommend this game to those who enjoy action/adventure games,  I feel it is important to inform you that the game is not without its flaws and let-downs. as well. The awesome graphics come at a price. Those who are running older systems may experience lag or crashes due to the high CPU and RAM usage. I would strongly suggest passing on this game if your system does not meet the minimum system requirements listed by the publisher. Also, expect a few minor bugs, typically associated with troop ai and steam achievements. And most disappointing of all, while claiming to be a "sniper" game and containing some aspects that suggest that it is, most often you will find yourself armed with a silenced pistol or sneaking up behind enemies for hand-to-hand kills if you choose to play missions in a stealthy manner.\n\nOverall, this is a very fun game and will give you many hours of enjoyment, especially if you pick up the extra DLC missions as well. However, I would only recommend picking this game up when it is on sale due to the reasons listed above and knowing that the base game only comes with eight missions for the single player campaign. In my opinion it is way over-priced ($49.99 USD) for a game that is over 8 months old on Steam and is also available on XBox 360, PS3, and PS4 which means finding a used copy for a console at a much cheaper price can easily be done.\n\nThe Good:\n========+  Quality base campaign with an interesting storyline\n+  Smooth controls and mechanics/Controller compatible\n+  Multiplayer and Co-op missions\n+  Detailed maps and graphics\n+  Blood and gore\n+  Versatile gameplay\n+  Quality DLC content\n+  Steam achievements\n+  High replay value\n\nThe Bad:\n=======-  Bugs and glitches (minor & not game-breaking)\n-  Too expensive at full price\n-   Single player campaign is short\n-  While much-improved, some elements still need work (ie. stealth, sniper, camoflauge, etc)\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n===========The Sniper Elite series continues to improve and its success and popularity are growing. This is definitely one to keep an eye on and I hope to see a Sniper Elite 4 in the near future> For an action/stealth war game it is still only average in my opinion. It is dressed up nicely and a lot of fun but let's face it, there is still a lot that can be done to enrich the quality of this game. Camoflauge serves absolutely no purpose, enemies all have eagle eyes and can instantly spot you from several hundred yards away when even slightly out of cover, and for a game who's own namesake emphasizes the "sniper" concept, this game falls way short in actually delivering upon that in much of the mission objectives. It plays out as more of a commando or special forces type of game than an actual sniper game. All of that being said, I still recommend this game to all those who enjoy third-person shooters. Its that good!\n\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","February 20, 2015","true","241.8"," 18 of 32 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","18","32","2","1"

I also have to say that I have only played "campaign" on intermediate difficulty level up to mission 6 so far:\n\nPros:\n- good graphics, good physical effects (wind, noise etc)\n- good choice of contemporary weapons with even more choice from DLCs\n\nCon:\n- it's not an open world. You can't climb rocks or get on top of some ridges/roofs if it's not "planned" by the producers.\n- the enemies are very predictable e.g. the guards follow their routine tracks, only leave them when alert. There is no backup of enemies - if you kill all in an area, you can walk openly across the squares and guards from another area will stay in their designated places (as long they don't see you). And if you are used to other games like BF3 and use your weapons well (booby traps aso) - it's not too hard do kill! NOTE: that goes at least for intermediate difficulty!\n- the game in this difficulty is very predictable in general: if you find e.g. an anti tank weapon - you can be sure you will need it quite soon!\n\nConclusion: if you like sniper games AND the WW2 flair - you will appreciate the graphics.

It seemed like more of the same, and that's certainly a good thing...right?\n\nIn this case some of the same elements were present: the bullet cam, the weapons, the physics, not to mention the awful, forgettable story. But the changes they made resulted in a much worse experience overall.\n\nForemost was the level design. In 2 the levels were admittedly linear, but they had long sight lines to encourage gratiutous sniping, which is the name of the game after all. And they also included a wide variety of objectives. Here in 3 every level follows the same arena-style circular motif with short lines and lots of cramped spaces - presumably to make them easier to re-use as multiplayer maps. The problem is that this pushes the player to use stealth and close range combat as the primary means to engage the enemy. In a game that's supposed to be about sniping this is incredibly annoying.\n\nBeyond that, the flow of each level is exactly the same: infiltrate, explore, then take out the vehicles at the end. The fact that every single "boss" in the game comes in the form of nearly identical armored vehicles is pretty unforgivable. It's so repetitive that I got bored less than halfway through the campaign. I knew what was coming around every corner my first time through. It reeks of laziness.\n\nThe campaign also feels more serious, which is not the direction the writers should have gone with this series. And while I appreciate the change of setting to Africa, that combined with the story make the stakes feel like they're not high at all, lacking comic relief to boot. The new setting also forces set pieces that could exist in any time period - there's almost nothing tying the environments to World War II.\n\nThe one area where the game actually did better was the add-ons. The bonus missions feel much closer to what I want from a Sniper Elite game. And the multiplayer is surprisingly fun and balanced once you get over the learning curve.\n\nWhen the mechanics are identical and the story doesn't matter then the level design becomes paramount, and that's the biggest area they failed in the campaign. Sniper Elite 3 kept enough of the parts from the previous games to feel familiar, but not enough to feel fun.","February 4","false","37.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The rifles where much better and if you are shooting without any assist on, good rifles with good reticles are a must. In SE3, because of the customization things and all that, the rifles don't synergize with the reticles that much well. It also seems that the rifles zoom much less. In V2, the springfield is supposed to have 4x zoom, the mosin 6x and the gewehr 8x, but in SE3, the values seem to be halved and everything looks tiny. The scope wobble is super exaggerated and this makes shooting a pain in the ♥♥♥, as well as having to use the empty lung feature that messes up the aim due to it's zoom in feature. good thing is that some of the new maps are pretty cool.

Aside a few graphical bug and glitches I found, the graphic for this game is superb.\nThe Sound/Music/Ambience, the music on this game also act as a cue whether you're being seen, found out, and engaged in a combat. Any sound generated from any object in the game are well made. And the ambience on every level, like when in night mission, you can hear the cricket and the dullness of night, is just adding more to how immersive the game is offering.\nThe Gameplay, 3 major things on this one. The Relocate strategy, The Map, and The AI. The Relocate strategy works to make the sniper-play work more believable (like, when you do something that gives yourself out, you must leave the location a few distance, cause enemy will come to investigate that location), and also it works in tandem with how big the map is.\nIt's 3x bigger than SEV2 map, and designed also with multiple entry and approaches in mind. You can do an objective in many ways, silently taking the enemy out, or herd them to 1 place, and blow a planted explosive at their feet. The AI also is getting more smarter on this game. The AXON AI, the new AI logic on SE3, will not giving your location to the enemy when you're found out (like in SEV2), instead, when an enemy hear/see something strange on a location, they will go to that place to check it out. If things got more heated, they will also not just swarming you out from your cover. If there is a high-ranking officer in the area, he will direct the lower rank soldier and told them to move in group, stay in cover, and taking turn firing at you or stay hidden in cover until you're going into their firing range, giving yourself more hard time to deal with the now-directed enemies.\nThat way, every game you play could have different result based on how you want it to play out, instead with the linear map play the SEV2 offer.\n\nNow what's the Hate? The pricing of the game\nI find the price of this game is quite exaggerated, considering much of its content of the game are now in DLC.\nThings like more weapon, more challenge mission, more multiplayer maps are being placed on priced DLC.\nThe fact that this game is priced on $50, and to get all the game's content to extend this game playtime, you must buy another DLC, is just not right with me (and maybe most gamer out there).\nMaybe if this game are on the $30 range, the DLC is quite the right move for the developer (they need money, making game is awfully expensive).\n\nThat said, I say it's a good choice for getting Sniper Elite 3, it's the best semi-realistic sniper-simulation game out there (outclasssing it's own predecessor). But if you have something that made you hesitate to buy this game (like the one explained on the Hate section), wait for a discount, then grab the game and also all the DLC if you can.\n","July 27, 2014","true","59.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

A sniper purpose is to be unseen and kill unspsecting enemies of there presense. Putting 8 sniper vs 8 snipers isn't a great idea specially in a relatively small map for 16 snipers.\nGameplay is campy and unrewarding.Also it feels like Sniper Elite developers tried to make it feel like a COD game they kind of succeeded and also failed. It's feels like one but it ain't because of the odd gameplay style of the game.\n\noverall won't be worthing your money I would say if you want to be a sniper try battlefield bad company 2 it has a rewarding system with snipers.\nsniper elite rating 4/10\n\n\n\n","September 29, 2015","false","9.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bahderb/recommended/238090/","bahderb","Bah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bahderb/","2492 products in account","It's safe to say that this game will be one of my top candidates for game of the year.\n\nLet me first say that I am a fan of this series. Sniper Elite V2 despite it's flaws is one of my favorite games of the last "generation". I love the idea of being a sniper and going behind enemy lines to kill Nazis. The moment Sniper Elite 3 was announced I was immediately excited and I pre-ordered it the first day it was made available on Steam.\n\nWith that caveat out of the way, Sniper Elite 3 is essentially a beefed up V2 in a brand new setting. Like V2, you're not playing this game because of the story. This game is all about fun, sneaking around, and killing Nazis as effortlessly as possible. What makes Sniper Elite 3 superior to its predecessor is how it takes the mechanics I was first introduced to in V2 and ramps it up and improves the gameplay in almost every respect.\n\nLet's start with the basic improvements. For me, there are two absolute standouts. The first that comes to mind is AI. While it's not perfect, it's much more fine tuned. It's now possible to kill in a variety of ways, from up close an personal melee kills, sneaking around with a silenced pistol, and of course the core of the game, sniping. In V2, once you took a shot the enemy was aware of your presence, where you were, and they don't let up until they're dead or you're dead. Now, relocating is imperative and allow to "reset" should you be discovered to go back to playing stealthily. I do think the AI could be further improved on even more, but I find that I have that gripe in a lot of games.  In SE3, it's now possible to use sound to your advantage which presents itself in a variety of ways including a howitzer being fired, a faulty generator, and even the weather + there are others. A prompt at the top of the screen comes up when the sound is masking your shot. This allows the player to stealth large portions of, if not the entire level. The second massive improvement comes with the way you approach each mission. One of the biggest knocks on V2 is that it was very linear, and you were forced to play a certain way. Not anymore. The maps in SE3 are humongous and allow the player to approach a mission anyway they choose. Earlier today, I was on the 3rd mission and by the time I completed it, I realized I had spent well over 90 minutes exploring, trying to find the collectibles (still missed some) and killing Nazis on this one map alone. This improvement alone increases the re-playability of the game.\n\nThe improved and more detailed Kill Cam is also a welcome inclusion as nothing beats an enemies head exploding after a perfectly placed head shot.\n\nTechnically, I think the game is very tight. The Africa setting is rendered extremely well and the graphics are very strong. I also find that the sound design is good and it's nice to hear the German army actually speak German. I've encountered very minimal bugs which undoubtedly will be patched before long.\n\nThere are a variety of different game modes right out of the box including the return of Survival (a horde mode) which can be played solo or with a friend only for now (hope they allow randoms again like in V2), and the return of co-op modes like Overwatch, which allow one player to be the spotter and one player to be the sniper. There's also the addition of multiplayer modes including the requisite team deathmatch. I have yet to explore most of the other modes at the time of this review, and will return once I have gotten a feel for them. I did however spend an hour trying Solo Survival, and I know that will add to the replay value the further along that I go.\n\nI feel that this game is exactly what a sequel should be. Change locations, improve the technical details of the game, and add some new, and very welcome elements that truly make it unique. I would love to see V2 patched with a lot of the SE3 additions, which is obviously a pipe dream, but the changes are so well done that it would be awesome to see.\n\nAll in all this is an excellent game that I'm excited to play even more. I know that I will still be playing Sniper Elite 3 for the foreseeable future and eagerly am anticipating what else is coming down the pipe that will add to the game even further.\n\n8/10","June 28, 2014","true","33.9"," 27 of 50 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","27","50","0","0"

I have requested a Refund but i have played it to many Hours. Its rly hilarious. Other People do Review this as an good Game thats why i bought it. It has good Graphic's and a movment what is not to Bad. But those Script's are so Bad and i think the following Mission's will be the same.\n\nMultiplayer Deathmatch is the most broing Multiplayer i ever Played (Team-Deathmatch). There is a Fence across the whole map wich means you cant get behind enemy Lines wich makes the Gameplay so boring. You just hang out behind Cover till you see an enemy in 3rd Person then you get out of Cover shoot and its done. Some People seem to play this with a Dot on theyre screen so they can "pre-aim" pop up shoot and get in Cover again.\n\nI liked to Play Sniper Elite V2 i rly enjoyed it but thisone.

On the highest difficulties it was a demanding experience that rewarded patience, good planning, and accuracy. 2 was a step down from 1 in the level design department,  having far too many close quarter battles in claustrophobic small levels. It's still a great 7/10 game, but it has issues. 3 is where they really hit the sweet spot, combining technical improvements over the last two games and fantastic level design. Although the amount of levels may seem sparse, each level is it's own massive sniper sandbox, allowing many numerous different approaches to each objective. The campaign took me 9 hours to beat on Sniper Elite difficulty and I only really did 50%ish of the secondary objectives, not to mention all the little collectibles scattered about each mission. In short, I highly recommend you check out Sniper Elite 3.","September 24, 2014","true","10.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Sneak up on enemy bases, study their movements and either eliminate or avoid - your call. Knife or silenced pistol for up close, a variety of scoped rifles for far away, a few other guns for everything in-between, and even some anti-tank stuff.\nIt's military-esque, but don't expect a military simulator - the 3rd person perspective should tip you off to that right away. But it's a fun shooter with lots of achievements and gameplay that you can do however you want. Not too much hand-holding, but was designed primarily for slow and sneaky.\nMaps/chapters are big, varied, and well-done, but there aren't as many as I thought there would be - in other words, the game feels a bit short and inconclusive. Expect to complete it in 8-10 hours or so. Has some replay value - owing to the huge maps and open gameplay choice. The DLC was obviously left out of the main game at launch so they could squeeze more money out of you for it. Some physics bugs (clipping, invisible walls, etc.) in spots can be annoying, but not game-breaking. Plays very well with keyboard and mouse.","August 25, 2014","true","34.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/majormassivekill/recommended/238090/","majormassivekill","Major Massivekill","http://steamcommunity.com/id/majormassivekill/","138 products in account","Sniper Elite 3 gives the player control over a military sniper situated in Africa during WWII. Its a third-person shooter with open world stages, allowing the player freedom to approach his objectives in any way he chooses how. The AI in this game can be really difficult and unforgiving. Therefore, the player must be really careful and observant to reach his objectives or eliminating his targets with careful planning and strategy. Unlike most shooter games, this isn't the kind of shooter game where you can rush through your targets and win the mission easily. The character set in this game is very vulnerable to damage and you cant really depend too much on your sidearms to overcome dangerous scenarios if you alert the enemy. The stealth maneuvers isnt as efficient as you would expect which is why being very, VERY careful is the best strategy to adapt while playing this game. Time is also another factor to be aware of for Sniper Elite 3. Even though there are only 8 missions to complete this game, the time you have to spend on each level will probably take up at least half of your afternoon (if you wish to be entirely discreet getting your tasks done) which is how the game is meant to be played. Basically, players will have to adapt the strong patience of a real sniper, adding anticipation and thrill before firing each shot to your enemies with your sniper rifle.\n\nThe graphics and visuals in Sniper Elite III is excellent and satisfying. Compared to its predecessors, the developers of this game has improved the game's 'signature' sniper killcam, abling the player to view their bullet trajectory coursing through their victim's internal body with amazing detail. It is very stunning!\n\nApart from the best elements Sniper Elite III has to offer, there are a few things that hinder this game from perfection. Firstly, the AI behaviour isnt very dynamic as expected like in most games in today's generation of video games. There are often times when hiding the bodies doesnt have to be a necessity and even if the player alerted the area, the AI can be very static and predictable. Give it another minute and they will pretend nothing happened and return to their patrol routes. Second, the lacking of stealth maneuvers/tactics can make this game's experience unreasonably frustrating and annoying but maybe thats just my own personal opinion since I've been exposed to many stealth assassination games before this. Basically, stick to the old-school stealth mechanics when you play this game. I wouldnt want to consider mentioning the lack of story and background for this game because it doesnt really matter at all since the Sniper Elite franchise is meant to be a WWII sniper-simulator so lets just throw that out the window.\n\nAs much realism Sniper Elite III has to offer, these issues above unfortunately pushes this game back a few steps but that doesnt mean its entirely bad! This game will keep the players hot in their seat. It is a very fun game to play with and the visual effects will never bore you.

A major improvement from the 1st and 2nd iterations of the series. This truly defines what a stealth sniping game is all about.\n\nGraphics: 10/10\nOutstanding by any means. The level of detail is something to behold, I have not seen this much level in detail in a game for so long. This one looks absolutely gorgeous even at low-medium settings. There are also a lot of graphics options to choose from to suit your needs and to maximise your experience.\n\nStoryline: 7/10\nYou have to stop Germany from building a Super Tank that could potentially be used to change the tide of war. Other than that, that is the only ‘story’ you will get from this game as it isn’t really a story heavy game and it wasn’t made to be one. You’re buying this for the sniping experience, not much for the story.\n\nSound: 9/10\nThey nailed it. The sound of the rifle, the enemies around you and even your own footsteps can be heard in great detail. Nothing more can be said of how this game sounds. You hear what you’re supposed to hear, nothing else.\n\nGameplay: 9/10\nThis goes without saying but, you can snipe your enemies with skill and precision from a distance or get up close and personal and perform melee takedowns. Setting up traps and distractions can also be very fun if carefully planned and laid out. Oh, and I almost forgot...there are “sounds” in the game which can mask rifle shots which makes for quiet long distance shots; pretty impressive if you ask me. The overall game performed nice and smooth with no significant frame drops to report.\n\nPrice: 5/10\nPriced at £39.99 for the base game, it is a little too much for the amount of gameplay hours you’re probably going to have. So, I suggest waiting until it goes on sale to pick it up.\n","May 31","true","12.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I had really high expectations regarding this game and they broke every single one of them, whatever went wrong in Sniper Elite v2 like the AI for example has been fixed in SE3. I also like how Stealth is even more important here as it was on SEV2, if you decided to go Rambo, don't. Seriously, don't. You're gonna get ganked and if you're not fast enough, you're dead. I like the Close Quarters takedowns you can pull off and the revamped kill cam is just hilarious to see sometimes, I did notice some bugs where for example the bullet came out of my barrel in reverse, directed at me, but ended up showing where I hit my target, doesn't happen too often but I think this is something Rebellion should look into. The best thing about this game are the realistic mechanics a real life sniper would come in contact with, you can't just point your crosshair at someone's head and expect a instant headshot on him, you really have to take the distance of the shot and the wind in consideration and adjust your aim accordingly.

The only thing I actually enjoy in this game is the "killcam" which can be extremely satisfying and rewarding.\nThat said, I don't find much else to praise in this 3rd part of the series.\nIt's as if they solely concentrated on making the killcam more detailed, gory and with slightly ridiculous sounds of bones breaking etc.\nThe models look rushed, the textures are mediocre at best and the shading and lighting is appalling (with some infuriatingly unavoidable big sunglare.\nThen comes the gameplay.. Which feels as clunky and sad as a rushed B game for the PS2. Annoying "cover" mechanics, some very solid shrubbery (not all the vegetation is solid though), insultingly few maps and customization and a clunky and buggy "aim assist".\n\n\nSo to sum up:\nFor the price of 45.99euros I had expected at least a finished and polished product fit for the PCs of 2014. Not a game I feel could've been made for the PS2 or at the release of the PS3. I honestly feel a bit robbed having paid so much money for a game that Clearly isn't finished.\nOh and don't think I intentionally tried to find faults and errors in this release. I actually So wanted it to be good (and I still think it has tremendous potential), and for 2 days I've kept trying to come up with excuses for the glaring faults, be they aesthetic or gameplay, but I find it insulting to the gaming community when they charge 45.99euros for this. Had it been 15eu or something down that line I could've shrugged it off more easily.\nBut no, this is robbery and I do not recommend people to buy this game yet. Maybe in a month or 2 when they hopefully have fixed the bugs and maybe made some extra maps.","July 2, 2014","false","28.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

You really can choose your postition now and try to come up with a plan on how best to deal with each area.\n\nThe weapon choice is somewhat limited but really their isn't much they can do with different sniper rifles to make them very distinct.\n\nAll together it's a very good sequel to the best facist-testicle-sniping game of 2012.","July 4, 2014","true","12.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Turret was forward, so no way he can see me. Well all went great till I planted dynamite, then the turret swung around and followed me as I ran around the tank, so close that I could have keyed it. So then I was stuck, move away from the hull and get blasted.\n\n6) the Ai is crap / brilliant / accurate and lousy all at the same time.\nThey give up too easily. They don't notice the guy in front just got his head blown off. They hang around in the open searching, etc.\n\n7) there is autosave AND a load last save option as well as a Load game option. I have yet to figure out how to access the load game feature as I presumed it was for loading an earlier autosave. nope.\n\n8) The controls are a mess, fell off a cliff trying to back my character up, he turned in a circle and fell.\nyou can sprint in straight lines but forget about turning as the sensitivity on the mouse drops way off.\nEasiest way is sprint, stop,turn sprint.\nThe mouse contols vary between the in game map, the main screen and the character movement and the aiming. Some feel a bit floaty, others sharp. mouse smoothing was off and mouse acceleration was off.\nThe option to reduce mouse lag had no effect at all.\n\n9) The campaign missions all follow the same patern.\nGet to a location, shoot/find something, etc.. and when you think you've finished, enter the boss match, some overwhelming force you must deal with or something to protect.\n\n10) The view distances with the scopes is nothing compared to Sniper Elite.\nIf you want to kill at 500m+ range, then good luck.\n\nThis game thrilled me for 1 hour then just bored / annoyed me for the rest.\n\nIf you played S.E v2 this is not much of an improvement..\n\nIf you just want to snipe, then by all means get this.","July 1, 2014","true","35.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

Cover, as we all know from other games, is great when you're trying to stealth passed enemies or for soaking up those bullets from them once you finally get seen, but Sniper Elite 3 takes things further then that. The cover even blocks your bullets, despite the fact that when you look through the scope it looks like you have a perfect shot, BUT WAIT there's more. When in cover, say a watch tower designed to be sniped from, the cover will help you decide to go down a more peacful path by not letting you shoot at all. I MEAN HOW GREAT IS THAT?!?!

The guns are stupid unrealistic, you still can't dial in distances on scopes, the wind blows your bullet a meter off target on a 100m shot (in a canyon, with a gentle breeze), way too much short range (<100m) fighting and way too little real sniping. Read the Wikipedia article, sniping is about shooting from so far away enemies can't return fire or even hear your gunshot. I have a feeling the maps are so small to accomodate consoles. The COD-esque ranks and loadouts suck as well (and Alpha Bravo Charlie Delta in WWII? Have the devs never seen a WWII movie? It should be Able Baker Charlie Dog.) The entire reason sniping games exist is difficult, satisfying kills, not mowing down hundreds of guys.

This game is clearly unfinished & filled with problems. At first I was disappointed that you don't get your shooting percentage but after seeing that at times it can take 3 to 9 shots to kill a guy I understood why.  If you don't press "E" when using your scope the shots can bounce off like he's covered from head to toe in metal. One very frustrating problem is when you try to shoot over or in between rails & your shots just hit the rail even if your barrel is past the rail. There are also graphic problems & the only way to resolve them is to exit out of the game then come back in. Trust me that you don't want to pay full price for this game, I think the game is worth about $20.00 so wait until it comes on sale. I expected so much more out of SE3 after playing SE2. It would be nice if you had your shot percentage (after they fix the shooting) & also the amount of head shot kills. I haven't tried the MP but seeing they never did make it work in SE2 I don't expect MP will work very well in SE3 as well.","July 5, 2014","false","123.0"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IWearLeatherShoes/recommended/238090/","IWearLeatherShoes","Tundra Scorpion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IWearLeatherShoes/","185 products in account","Unambitious and far too safe, Sniper Elite 3 is in general a reskin of Sniper Elite V2.\nCarrying over the same mechanics and realistic ballistics that defined the previous game, Sniper Elite 3 does little to differentiate itself and keeps itself within a safe little boundary that prevents it from being a full-fledged sequel and instead feels like the developers were too frightened to tip-toe out of that proverbial boundary and kept everying generally the same.\nPrimarily the differences between the two games are as follows: A new and exotic setting in North Africa, new weapons and tools to utilize, the ability to customize enemy AI and ballistics to suit your preferred playstyle and a new story. To expand on why these features don't contribute a lot to the game and make it stand out: The setting, while personally I enjoy, is not something to base too much emphasis on, you dedicate DLCs around new locations, not a whole new game, so while the desert setting is pleasant it also fails to accomplish the ultimate goal of making Sniper Elite 3 stand out as it's own title, and it's actually the most notable difference. The new weapons and loadout options I don't care for, because almost every unlockable weapon and/or part are all underwhelming, offering a minor benefit at the cost of what I feel are major costs in damage or stability. So I generally use the same loadout in every mission since the Garand is by far the best option for the game and serves to every need I require, making the loadout customization completely untouched. Difficulty adjustment is actually the factor that has drawn me into the game despite my disappointment at the previous titles, both previous games had some of the most rudimentary and challenge-destroying AI possible and ruined a large portion of both games, I'm glad to say that the AI in Sniper Elite 3 is at least challenging and rewarding to play against. Another new factor in the AI department is a feature called "Relocate" in which enemies will discern your location and begin to attack if you continue to fire from the same area, but Relocate gives you the option to move out of the area and begin the hunt anew. While sounding good in theory Relocate can be easily exploited wherein the player fires once or twice from one location before moving out to another, then repeating the process. Finally, the story. Once again you play as Karl Fairburne, the same tired and uninteresting protagonist from the previous games. Karl is the same as before, he's boring, 2-dimensional and leaves no impact on the player, offering nothing to the experience other than to be the guy you play as but immediately forget after beating the game. Which is a huge reason why I'm disappointed with the game, we've got this exotic and beautiful new setting, why do we still have this blank sheet of paper to play as? Tell me it wouldn't be great if we could play as someone new, like a British soldier since a good part of the game's plot involves working for British Intelligence, it would make more sense to have a soldier of British background and provide an opportunity to make Sniper Elite 3 stand out more. But no, the developers I think are trying to make Karl a staple and recognizeable video game protagonist akin to Gordon Freeman or Lara Croft, which with his blank-slate personality is just impossible. The overall story as well is underwhelming and paper-thin, leaves no impact and is entirely forgettable.\nNow it may sound like I'm saying that Sniper Elite 3 is a bad game, but this is not entirely true. On the contrary actually, I like the game and I do have fun when I'm playing it. If it was released as a stand-alone title or as the first in it's series I'd be praising it without remorse, however as a sequel it falls short and doesn't do much to differentiate itself from the last game. Sniper Elite V2 wasn't a bad game, but it did have a lot of flaws that kept it from gaining alot of recognition, Rebellion had the opportunity to take these issues into account when designing the new game but instead worked on a clone with a different coat of paint. I know it sounds like I'm beating a dead horse when I say that it's practically the same as V2 but I feel that this is a valid and legitimate issue that is holding the series back from its full potential.\nSo to give this review a more positive outlook; Sniper Elite 3's setting is as previously mentioned absolutely gorgeous, unique and alot of fun to explore and observe. This may be a biased viewpoint since I've personally always had a fondness for desert landscapes but it is true, the levels are beautifully rendered and at the same time well optimized, giving me an average of 60 FPS on high settings. Combat interfaces are rewarding and fun to experiment with, rewarding patience and execution with unerring proficiency. Setting up traps to fortify a sniper nest or roaming the battlefield collecting intelligence on enemy patrol routes and locations is a highly rewarding experience with a combat system that gives the player positive feedback. The infamous X-Ray kill cams make a return and add a lot to the satisfying payoff of lining up the perfect shot, but just like the last game the novelty of them gets tiring pretty quickly and I've found myself to lowering them to almost non-existent after a while.\nSniper Elite 3 is also host to a large series of experience-breaking bugs. The killcams often don't work as they're supposed to, sometimes cutting out early and others just giving the player a view of a blurry area while the sound effects play. The AI also has it's garbage moments, for example: Vehicles have incredible perception and can pin-point your exact location with little effort, which makes no sense seeing how the operators field of vision is limited by the vehicles armor. And yet when shot it will immediately know exactly where you are in an instant where human enemies take a moment to determine where you are even if they've been physically shot. It's like the vehicles in the game all have a synthetic nervous system that is hardwired to the driver, so he can find you miliseconds after you try and take it out.\n\nNow that you've read this far into the review, be advised that the following portion WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS. READ AHEAD AT YOUR OWN RISK.\nIf you have the attention span to actually notice the weak storyline, you'll learn that the game revolves around uncovering intelligence on the construction of a German super tank, the Ratte being built under the ambitious supervision of a high-ranking general named Vahlen. What I feel Rebellion should have done with the story is give more spotlight time on Vahlen throughout the game, establish him more as the biggest threat to the player all the while never giving them the chance to strike at him until the final level. What happened instead was Vahlen being mentioned vaguely throughout the campaign in letters and enemy dialogue, and being thrown in at the last minute of the final level. What's worse is that the player doesn't even get the satisfaction of killing him yourself. He's injured in one cutscene and then shot point-blank in the head in another cutscene, which ultimately leads up to a very disappointing ending where Karl walks off into the horizon giving a bland monologue about killing people. With a terrible and easy-to-forget protagonist, an antagonist that you aren't even given the chance to hate and a forgettable and weak storyline, Sniper Elite 3 leaves so very much to be admired.\n\nAll things considered: I'm afraid that I'd have to give Sniper Elite 3 a thumbs down, it had potential but failed to live up and expand its horizon beyond the limiting confines of its mediocre predecessors. The gameplay, while fun does gets tiring after a while, the story is quick to be forgotten, the mechanics are unambitious and added nothing new to the series and in all it literally is just a clone of Sniper Elite V2.","June 30, 2014","false","14.5"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

Granted, there are definitely some flaws, but there are also a lot upsides to this game.\n\nI keep seeing negative comments about how this game only has 4 rifles. I personally don't see why this is an issue. Yes, if you want more, you need to buy DLC, but I have never felt the need to. The 4 rifles cover all your bases. A long range, slow firing rifle, a short range, faster firing rifle, a medium range rifle with a better scope and so forth. There is also a good amount of pistols, including the default silenced pistol. I have never felt that this is limiting me in anyway. Maybe if you're used to CoD, or FarCry, you might think there aren't that many guns, but for this game, mainly being a sniping based game, I feel like it works.\n\nThe other negative comment I see a lot is that there are several DLCs already out for it. I can see why that might be a little bit annoying, but I wouldn't let it turn you away from this game. As stated prior, I have never felt the need to buy any other guns, so that already opts out the gun DLCs. As far as other DLCs, I havn't played them. I have not needed to. The campaign has kept me quite sated, and the other modes, as well as competetive online, also keep you busy.\n\nEverything in the game works well as well. I have not encountered anything game breaking or that unappealing. If the game is too easy, there is a mode that makes all bullet ballistics and physics 100% realistic, which believe me, makes the game MUCH harder. The AI wasn't anything spectacular, but nothing horrible either; it got the job done. I feel like there was a good mix of sniping and stealth, combined with "going loud" action. Voice acting was a little cheesy, but it fits the theme and time of the game.\n\nI have had a blast playing through this campaign with friends co-op, and doing the spotter/sniper missions co-op. Decent replay value with all the modes and online, plus it's fun to try and play at higher difficulties.\n\nOverall I'd give this game a 7/10. Worth the money, and I still come back to it often enough.","January 3, 2015","true","18.9"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

Oh, wait, it still is the most fun in the series.\n\nTo put it bluntly, Sniper Elite III does nothing to enhance the experience of the player, and falls way too short in what it tried to accomplish. Like, "WOW". I did not see it coming. The many reviews I've read that pointed out that it was  flawed, I didn't think it would be. But, uhh... no. The game sucks.\n\nIt fails to entertain one with the storyline, the multiplayer, the overall gameplay ... Heck, let's call it Sniper Elite V2.5. I don't see anything new to it, except for the Afrika scenery, and the slightly improved graphics. Which is a tremendous shame.\n\nAgain, I do like how they have improved the looks of it. The X-Ray shots are now more eye-opening, and the mechanics are more satisfying. But, that's about it. The game was all about the looks. And it only did okay over there. I feel it's an uncomfortable game to go through. It's just ... boring. And I'm NOT so easily bored with 1P-oriented games.\n\nSo, in conclusion to this tiny review, no, I do not recommend this game.

I am a big fan of this series, and I even enjoyed the somewhat repetitive Zombie Army titles. I was hoping for an enjoyable romp through a slightly larger world with improvements to the stealth and sniping mechanics. Rebellion certainly doesn't disappoint.\nYou play as Karl Fairburne, a US Sniper dropped into Africa during World War II to combat the Afrika Korps stationed there. You'll navigate through gorgeous rendered canyons, valleys and deserts to complete your objectives, and Rebellion has done an excellent job in the graphics department. I was never once disappointed by the visuals in this game, and was wowed at every opportunity.\nThe levels are also quite large, and there are also optional objectives to complete during a main mission. These include tasks such as assassinating a visiting colonel, sabotaging a German fuel depot and eliminating enemy tanks. While not particularly original, these objectives are fun to complete and provide a nice XP boost.\nGameplay has a number of mechanics designed to create a good sniper game. You have items such as stones and flint that you can use to distract enemy soldiers, as well as a silenced pistol to kill enemies discreetly. You can loot these corpses for items before moving their corpse to another location, which is a relatively unseen feature in modern shooters. Another stealth mechanic is the ability to create noise with other items so you can fire your rifle without being detected.\nOn the subject of sniper mechanics, this game excels. The gory x-ray kills are back, and you can witness your bullet shattering bones and puncturing organs in fantastic HD glory. Bullet drop and wind speeds are an added factor to sniping, which makes each kill that more satisfying.\nDespite being a solid game overrall, Sniper Elite 3 has a number of flaws. Enemy AI is fairly inconsistent, and will go from spotting you easily to being blind to your movements and visible corpses. The amount of bugs in this game is quite baffling, but most have been fixed due to frequent patches. Not a game breaker, but definitely frustrating if you're not a fan of bugs and glitches.\nOverall, Sniper Elite 3 is a solid entry in a solid series. It improves over its predecessor, but still has the dull story and characters retained in the series. Despite this, I'd recommend this game for the huge levels and enjoyable mechanics. 8 / 10","July 30, 2014","true","15.0"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","2"

However I have only minor concerns here’s what I like and what I concern (keep in mind I have only played the game on sniper elite difficulty and easier difficulties tampers with AI intelligence and bullet physics also I haven’t finished the game yet I’m about maybe halfway through)\n•	Realistic bullet physics very well done also all snipers are completely different in stats and it can be very fun experimenting which one suits your play style and sniping skill (sniper elite / authentic difficulties)\n•	Extremely smart AI (sniper elite / authentic difficulties)\n•	Huge maps exploring is a must and just feels right very fruitful as well\n•	Many different ways to handle objectives (however on sniper elite difficulty  going in guns blazing partially suicidal its possible but very hard, authentic difficulty you might as well just shoot yourself)\n•	wide-ranging  modifications and upgrades for each rifle\n•	well-designed all maps are unique from one another and a pass or bridge could have another hidden 5 different ways to cross for either a stealthy approach or a ambush point to gain an upper hand in a firefight\n•	gunplay is great if any then minor unnoticed problems\n•	bullet time allows you to see were your bullet hit and the damage it is doing its gruesomely attractive and extremely satisfying to watch for example your bullet ripping through the eye and peeling off the top of the skull of a Nazi officer or castrating a Nazi, yes there are testicle shots ashamed their no achievement for getting one\nConcerns\no	not many weapons only 4 snipers 4 submachine guns 3 pistols and the first pistol “welrod” is the best pistol the other 2 are trash\no	the story and some voice acting is skeletal (:my opinion: but who f*ck cares gameplay is great and it give you an excuse to shoot Nazis)\no	if you want more maps and guns you have to buy the dlc’s\nOverall\n9.5/10\n","July 12, 2014","true","25.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The interface makes it a bit more easy - not as hard as previous versions on hardest level. Added a nice knifing stealth kill. What I really miss is the possibility to shoot grenades off the belt of German soldiers -- making them explode. Certainly I did expect more maps included; the extra DLC maps are few and relatively expensive. AND of course, as it is situated in Africa, I would have LOVED if they would have thrown in some lions, snakes, crockodiles and such attacking you unexpectedly as you were sneaking up to your enemies. Or some herds of wildebeasts to startle and stampede over your targets (or at least creating a diversion). I would like a bit better AI: when you find a dead comrade in your camp, you dont just look out for enemies for 30 secs but would comb out the area I'd think. But nice graphics and very playable interface and controls.

The sounds effects, the X-Ray Kills, even the intro music is the same. The DLC's...meh... there is no difference between a normal weapon and a DLC weapon, but it's ok. The AI is a little silly and "confused". If the enemys not find you, it returns to the initial form with no worries. This was the "bad" part, now let's talk about the good part. The graphics are incredible and very well optimised on both CPU's (Intel and AMD). You have ALOT of missions / sub-missions and HUGE maps to explore and new mods. The multiplayer mod is one of the most interesting parts of the game, much harder and more complex than V2.

Sniper Elite 3 is one of those rare games that not only improves over it predecessor visually - but adds so much more to the proven central mechanics of the previous game.\n\nThe beauty at the core of SE3 (and to a lesser extent, in SE2) - is the way the game allows players to approach the mission in the best way they see fit. In the current climate of COD and BF games - going Rambo is commonplace - and that same mentality can be applied to SE3. However, it is vastly more rewarding to use your brain first, followed by your trigger finger (button!) second.\n\nI despise stealth games as the norm. The tip-toeing around from map to map and making sure that the first two pixels of your characters' shoe are not seen in the daylight without bringing on instant-death. But play SE3 on its default difficulty of Marksman - and the game balance appears just right. You get a challenge if you alert the guards and quickly have to scurry to a fall-back location. But you also don't suffer from one-shot kills against you. It's this semi-realistic approach that makes you push-on under tension of being spotted, but without the constant fear of being killed from an unknown sniper from several hundred metres away.\n\nHowever, if this isn't hardcore enough for you - ramp up the difficulty to suicidal levels with the Custom Difficulty option - including the function that disables any saved games.\n\nThat latter part is a statement in itself. Play SE3 as its meant to be played and you can easily spend 2 to 3 hours on a single mission. The planning, the thought processes, the noise cover, the creeping forward - all mix wonderfully into an absorbing and immersive experience. Your character genuinely comes across as being all alone behind enemy lines. Forget the off-map support. Forget having a squad for backup. This is you against a yet-unknown enemy force - with a sprinkling of optional objectives thrown in. That said, the game, as per SE2, can be played in co-op mode, should you so wish.\n\nI generally don't like reviewing games until I have completed them - but SE3 is a prominent exception. Rebellion has enhanced a winning formula even more - and this game is one to simply savour and enjoy. The fact that I'm now going to cut this review short, so that I can jump back into my saved progress of SE3 must count for something!\n\nRebellion - I don't know what you can pull off for SE4 - but you've set yourself a VERY high benchmark to surpass. Well done.\n\n9.5/10","February 14, 2015","true","17.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Maybe worth full price if you really like sniper rifles and sniping in general. That does NOT include Call of Duty type sniping; that shouldn't even be called sniping.\n\nI don't know about bullet balistics and how realistic or unrealistic they are. But what I do know is that they add to the experience I had with this game. Getting my first moving headshot without help from the magic red diamond shape indicator, that shows you where the bullet will hit, was the best thing I did in this game and I felt like a boss doing it.\n\nStealth has been enhanced compared to the second game (also very good) with game mechanics like relocation (if you fire two shots and if you move away from the area enemies lose sight of you) and sound masking which was a thing in the second game but it has been improved in this game (you'll find engines that you can break and they'll work badly for a while providing you sound cover for your shots). In my opinion you shouldn't consider stealth in this game, although possible. I didn't enjoy being a sniper sneaking around everywhere with the silenced pistol shooting enemies in the head and stabbing them in the back of the head with a knife.\n\nSniper nests are a very good addition to the game and something I always use because it makes me feel more like a real sniper. Collectibles if you like collecting them like cards and war diaries (I don't see any point in this so I only have what I've stumbled across) but I do miss the bottles from the seccond game.\n\nSo in conclution: for full price I recomend only if you like sniping a lot and can spare the money and if you have a chance to buy it on sales I deffinitelly recommend if you like 3rd person shooters (although there are no assault rifles).\n\nAnd for heaven's sake play on hard or custom difficulty with realistic bullet ballistics where gravity and wind affect the bullet's trajectory and don't quickscope you noob, this isn't CoD","February 13, 2015","true","31.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The sounds effects, the X-Ray Kills, even the intro music is the same. The DLC's...meh... there is no difference between a normal weapon and a DLC weapon, but it's ok. The AI is a little silly and "confused". If the enemys not find you, it returns to the initial form with no worries. This was the "bad" part, now let's talk about the good part. The graphics are incredible and very well optimised on both CPU's (Intel and AMD). You have ALOT of missions / sub-missions and HUGE maps to explore and new mods. The multiplayer mod is one of the most interesting parts of the game, much harder and more complex than V2.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sentinel-12/recommended/238090/","Sentinel-12","Carmelo Anthony","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sentinel-12/","14 products in account","*SPOILER ALERT*\nSo first of all let's get this out of the way, I think it's way better than the more linear SE V2, but I think It's not as fun as the first. Let's start:\n\n-Graphics: They are alot better than V2, textures are better and more crisp and what I like the most is that the color pallete is much richer than the grays and blacks of V2. There are yellows, blues, reds, greens and etc. To sum it up much better than V2\n-Enviroment: SE3 is set in Africa, where the grass is green and the Jerries are pretty. No but seriously as I said in the graphics section, Rebellion made the game alot better looking. I really liked the fifth mission's beggining stage where you crawl through a field/oasis and then you approach a big desert town. I found that a very good contrast.\n-Map design: This is where the last game flopped, V2 was very linear and only one path to go through, this game has alot more open levels with several paths to go through but the general path is the same. To sum it up better than V2 but could be more open.\n-Gameplay: Preety much the same as V2 but now stealth is possible. You can go through an entire level and not alert anyone. Sniping is as great as it was in the last game, it feels superb.\n-Sound: I can't comment on this because I dont pay much attention to the background sound, but the guns sound excelent.\n-Campaign: A lacking plot in which you - Karl Fairburne seem to dismantle the entire Afrika Korps and the Royal Italian Army stationed in Africa in search of a Nazi prototype tank wonder-weapon called the Ratte P1000. The voice acting is honestly comedic and bad, so in summary ignore the plot. The one in V2 was better. Which brings me to the missions. They are long but there are only 8 of them. The campaign will take you about 16 hours, and also not very replayable unless you are going for the collectibles.\n-Multiplayer: After the campaign you can play the much improved multiplayer. Unlike V2 where it was very campy and it was essencially a free-for-all, here spotting is more encouraged and when you are on a killstreak you are encouraged to relocate to get extra points per kill. The ranking system is cumulative through campaign and multiplayer so you can rank up faster in multiplayer after you finish the campaign. However I miss "Bombing Run" :(\n-Co-op: You can play through the campaign with a buddy, and also you can play the great Overwatch mode in which one guy is a operative on the ground and another one is the sniper. It is incredibly engrosing and extremely fun.\n\nSo that sums up Sniper Elite 3, much improved over Sniper Elite V2 but the plot could be alot better. Overall not worth 40 euros, so buy it on a sale and after that enjoy. I rate it 8.5 out of 10","January 4, 2015","true","60.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Caliber, barrel length, action type, and other variables have no consideration in the weapon stats of the game. This is the thing that really bugs me the most (I can forgive the other two Cons, maybe).\n-Weapon sounds are horrible, but then again all games are like that.\n\n\nOverall, I would not buy it for $50.00.

And here they added some new cool mechanics (Ghost,  Relocate...)\nBut, i would have gladly waiting few more month of development to fix some crucial gameplay aspects:\n\n1. Praise the holy rock - like before enemies react to rocks and are going to check out that suspisious sound - but imagine a full room of soldiers, leaving one by one for the same suspisious sound and never returning and no one is alerted.\n2.I did not understand that before and i cant understand now - why hand to hand close quarters stealth kill earns less exp than a shot with a pistol?!\n3. Even officers or elite enemies - once get a glimpse of you - instead of shouting for alarm or taking few guys to check it out - will check the place themselves.\n\nThere are more bugs as firing into cover etc... which  Im sure people already spoke of but the 3 above turn even hard difficulty to childs play.\n(Oh another wierd thing - the rifles are customizeble but the machine guns and handguns are not... just wierd)\n","July 2, 2014","true","27.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Another great feature of this game is the new X-ray shots as they now incorporate muscles, circulatory system and new BALL PHYSICS! and the graphics on the x-ray shots are just sooooo much better. In a way there is more to choose from when you shoot someone. They also have added X-ray shots on vehicles so thats really awesome exploding vehicles. There is now new weapon customization and new weapons like the Italian Carcano rifle and the German panzershreck. And new enemies not Germans and Russians but now again Germans and Italians, in a way i liek that as the Italians aren't really recognised much in WWII.

A 7 hour campaign. Enemy AI made in 1985, one shot and the entire map knows exactly where you are. Mandatory rpg-unlock system that is just not worth the unlocks. Only 4 rifles in-game, the rest behind a DLC pay-wall. Stealth/relocation mechanic that sucks the fun out of sniping. A story that makes Twilight look like a great love drama. Unlikable main characters. No memorable supporting cast. Anti-climactic ending if there ever was one. It is all kinds of bad rolled into one, and it takes itself way too serious. Playing co-op makes the game even worse for some reason (how is that even possible?)\n\nI absolutely love the Zombie Army games, I really like Sniper V2, but this? Even at 70% off I feel cheated.\n\nMaybe get it for the multiplayer if that is your cup of tea.

Third person action, great stealth mechanics, even with total control over movement, and FINALLY, a game which has mastered the art of sniping. However, the story is, IN MY OPIONION (my review) average. Alot of people will argue with me, and say it is awsome, with espionage and such, but it is rather straight forward and predicatble. Still, this game is so fun that the story dosent matter much. I have not tried multiplayer, but guessing from my experience with Elite V2, (the predeccesor), I'm Guessing it requires a lot of patience, skill, and has alot of camping (duh). Overall, a large improvement in every aspect over V2, even in story, (I dont like either, but at least this one is slightly realistic. Russians stealling the plans to some rocket in V2 is just dumb.) so I give this game a 8.75/10","January 14, 2015","true","3.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Lets go back a step and ask a more important question; Is this a game?\n\nWell, a game is something you have fun interacting with. It challenges you and provides entertainment. Sniper Elite 3 is definitely challenging and it can be fun, so lets pencil in a "yes" for the question of is this a game. Now, is it worth the price?\n\nNo. Definitely not (Unless you want to go purely multiplayer - see below). I'll admit I have not played the previous 2 iterations of Sniper Elite, but they cannot have been worse than this. The graphics are pretty and the xray cam can be amusing and fun, but this is counteracted by the clunky mechanics, often horrible animations, weak AI and general lack of polish on the entire thing. Still, the xray cam shots are amusing.\n\nLevel design feels like limited paths with varying chances of getting pounced on by several enemies and shot into paste. The AI is perculiar to say the least. Enemies finding a dead body will become "suspicious" for a short time... then forget there is a problem. The noise-masking you can do by using noisy environmental objects to hide your rifle noises is a good idea, but was not executed as well as it could have been.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nAfter a bit more time with the game, I found that the multiplayer co-op aspect of it greatly increases the level of fun you can have with the game. Co-ordinating your shots with someone else or covering each other while sneaking around giving surprise stabs to the neck is fun and makes things worth your time. Single player might not be fantastic, but multiplayer makes up for it.","June 29, 2014","true","15.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I love the franchise.  Everything is awesome and I am so glad you can now pick up something you put down by accident like a land-mine or dynamite.  The maps are amazing and since I only play co-op when the other people can play and we only play together so no one know what is going on and where things are, makes it even better.. Hours of fun, love trying to get all the challenges accomplished.  Love the new loadouts and customizations for the weapons.  Only wish the type 99 was in the game to start as I really love that gun.  You did a great job this time and I only see it getting better.  As others have stated.

And the graphic has change alot since Sniper Elite and Sniper Elite V2. I like the graphics and new X-ray cams, they look alot better and the bones breaks alot more realistic than ever.\n\nGameplay- 10/10\nGameplay what can i tell i got the best experience ever in this game. This game has definitely the best mulitiplayer i ever seen and the story mode uhh ohh. play CO-OP with friends in Mission even Survival that has up to 15 Rounds 5 Waves in each round all from Soldiers to Tanks or even more. And mulitiplayer thats still is one of the best. Even on battlefield i had alot of experience i was fighting along friends and even strangers and i got new friends, this game gets you alot of teammates in the battlefield\n\nSounds- 6.5/10\nThe sounds are amazing and the sound of the bullet flying right through the head is overpowered good. The totally make the Sniper Elite V2 sounds look girly and bad, but still not good enough to get ~10/10~.\n\nI can't wait for more Sniper Elite in the future. ( But wait for the price goes a little bit down[/b])\n\nComments are allowed on this one. Having a questing that burns inside why don't ya ask me ;D i'll answer as fast i can....\n\n(Review May Change)","July 15, 2014","true","48.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Fall through walls, opponents getting stuck (either where they walk or in other opponents), strange things and actions in the game can happen when loading a savegame...\n- Kind of a stupid AI. Your opponents will oftentimes behave strangely and unrealistic. For example, when someone sees a guy shot to death, he gets suspicious and looks around. Then, when he's not seeing you, he will just keep walking about thinking this is nothing to worry about. Can't say that's very realistic.\n- The soundmasking of shots is not very consistent. A broken generator with its noise can act as soundmasking but other things which in real life could mask gun shots will not act as the same in the game.\n- The shooting/aiming had some problems too.\n- Some "obstacles" which you in real life just could climb over, walk over, or crawl under, is in the game unclimbable/unwalkable/uncrawlable. Instead you need to walk around etc.\n\nIn short I would say that this is a game with a lot of potential and great fun, but the fact that it is NOT ready yet spoils it. Really hate it when I buy a game and discover that the developer didn't care of making the game ready before releasing it.\n\nIf you would like to play a better sniper game I would recommend Sniper Ghost Warrior 2.","January 20","false","32.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's about stealth-ing and spying. Even objectives are not indicated for a sniper. To destroy tanks or to steal intelligence. Secondly, the maps are not make for sniping and it's very costly to snipe. For every bullet you will be penalized with a lot of troops on your zone. All the guns are a waste of time you need to fire on some zone of the head.

Fall through walls, opponents getting stuck (either where they walk or in other opponents), strange things and actions in the game can happen when loading a savegame...\n- Kind of a stupid AI. Your opponents will oftentimes behave strangely and unrealistic. For example, when someone sees a guy shot to death, he gets suspicious and looks around. Then, when he's not seeing you, he will just keep walking about thinking this is nothing to worry about. Can't say that's very realistic.\n- The soundmasking of shots is not very consistent. A broken generator with its noise can act as soundmasking but other things which in real life could mask gun shots will not act as the same in the game.\n- The shooting/aiming had some problems too.\n- Some "obstacles" which you in real life just could climb over, walk over, or crawl under, is in the game unclimbable/unwalkable/uncrawlable. Instead you need to walk around etc.\n\nIn short I would say that this is a game with a lot of potential and great fun, but the fact that it is NOT ready yet spoils it. Really hate it when I buy a game and discover that the developer didn't care of making the game ready before releasing it.\n\nIf you would like to play a better sniper game I would recommend Sniper Ghost Warrior 2.","January 20","false","32.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It introduces some new mechanics but executes poor which makes this game inferior to Sniper Elite 2. Firstly, this game is not about sniper is about knife and silencer pistol. It's about stealth-ing and spying. Even objectives are not indicated for a sniper. To destroy tanks or to steal intelligence. Secondly, the maps are not make for sniping and it's very costly to snipe. For every bullet you will be penalized with a lot of troops on your zone. All the guns are a waste of time you need to fire on some zone of the head. The graphics in this game is almost same like SE2 but with more illuminated effects.\n\n","October 17, 2015","false","9.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

The asymmetric modes sounded fun and being able to play through the whole campaign with a buddy really sold me on it.\n\nUnfortunately, the best feature of the game is basically not present in co-op -- the x-ray cam. I totally understand that some people would get annoyed if the game was slowing down all the time for shots. But isn't that why there's the ability to adjust the frequency in single player? Removing the option entirely from multiplayer is extremely disappointing. I want to be able to compete with my buddy to see who can make the craziest shots.\n\nMaybe it's just my disappointment but the game feels like a pretty big letdown without this feature.

It has nice visuals and the infamous bullet cam but that's pretty much it. Desert is a nice touch but it has near to no change than the previous game so yeah, I'd say spend your money elsewhere. It's very repetitive and you do the same thing in every mission. It has many historical inaccuracies but I guess that's why it's a game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/robocobra/recommended/238090/","robocobra","His Majesty, Lord RoboCobra IV","http://steamcommunity.com/id/robocobra/","222 products in account","This is a vast improvement over V2. There were a few strange missteps, but overall it is a super entertaining experience. Also, testicle shots.\n\nImprovements:\n- The stealth system is completely expanded and makes more sense. You have a stealth indicator, visibility indicator, and a minimap with nearby enemies (all of which you can turn off if you're 2 hardcore 2 furious) and the game rewards you on relocating before your enemies close in on your position. Stealth and CQC knife kills work well and look awesome.\n- There are less levels than V2, but each one is massive and can be played in so many different ways. Generally, they went with quality over quantity. The levels are each small sandboxes in nature, so you can plot out different paths and approaches with your binoculars and it works great.\n- In each level there are 1-3 optional objectives you can accomplish if you want, and they are usually very rewarding and can coincide with your main objectives. They can involve sabotage, assassinating officers, collecting stuff, etc.\n- You now have a universal XP bar that increases whether you're in single player, co-op, challenge mode, or multiplayer. Everything you do gets you XP and all of the ways you get bonuses based on your shots make your progression feel real.\n- Weapon customization, although mild, still adds to the choice in your loadouts. Which, by the way, you can make 4 unique loadouts to switch between for single and multiplayer.\n- There is more variety in the collectibles, as opposed to the extremely hard-to-see gold bars and wine bottles of V2. Still, it is very difficult to find all of them.\n\nStrange missteps:\n- There is a surprisingly smaller arsenal of guns to pick from. You might feel discouraged at the start by only having 1 of each type, but you will unlock them quickly as you level up. However, despite this, unlocking all 4 (I think) of each type, there still just doesn't seem enough, but OF COURSE there's day 1 DLC of weapon packs that really should have been in the game to begin with, as all of the DLC guns were in some way featured in V2 before. Strange to charge extra for something carried over from V2...\n- For whatever reason, there doesn't seem to be any way of playing co-op campaign or challenge mode with strangers via matchmaking, which you totally could do in V2. You are only able to play co-op with people on your friends list, which makes it hard to play these modes by yourself if you don't have any friends with this game.\n\nThings that were awesome in V2 and are still awesome in 3:\n- Mother♥♥♥♥ing X-RAY KILLCAMS!! They are still great no matter how many times you watch them, and include vehicle destruction now as well. Instead of just Vital Hits, Headshots, and Kills, you can get (insert organ here)shots.\n- Multiplayer offers a slower-paced, patient experience, which is different from most shooters out there. The matches are all totally customizable in terms of bullet physics, available guns, whether or not teams can cross sides of the map (ensuring sniping-only matches), sprinting, and so forth.\n\nHope you enjoyed this over-extensive review.","June 30, 2014","true","21.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

No time limits means you can behave like a real sniper and lie in wait for ages until the time to shoot the kill arrives for you with no constraints telling you to hurry up like a ticking clock but this is present in a very minor part of the game for specific mission(s).\n\nWhat i don't like is although they have improved the X-ray kill cams with better muscle and bone fragmentations they have taken out one or two kill hit zones that were in the previous Sniper Elite V2 game - for example in Sniper V2 if you were accurate enough you could shoot and dismember the fingers of an enemy soldier whilst he was unaware of your prescence and smoking a ciggy, yawning or drinking from something....even coughing - as long as his hands were raised to that zone pretty much there was a chance of this happening which was a very satisfying thing to achieve in my opinion.......BRING IT BACK (in an update hopefully) AND I'LL GIVE A FULL STAR RATING TO THIS GAME.","November 16, 2014","true","91.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

This is an amazingly fun game that would suit a wide variety of play styles and almost encourages multiple playthroughs. Each mission could take you 20 minutes if you rush through guns blazing, or if you play this game like a smart and calculating individual, you can make missions go on for over an hour to be a ghost sniper dug into a hide. The multiplayer is incredibly fun, and encourages teamwork. My favorite game mode, No Cross, forces you to move from location to location after each shot and carefully pick your hide and be patient. I have not tried the Co-Op so I have no experience with that. But you can play a horde mode solo or with a friend, as well as a sniper/spotter Co-Op mode. I can play this game for hours and not get bored with the variety of game modes, and the sadistic fun of watching heads, lungs, livers, kidneys and balls explode in super detailed, slow motion bullet cams. If you are a fan of the other Sniper Elite games, I highly recommend this game.","July 16, 2014","true","43.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Oh you wanna light one wil your flint and steel? go ahead! Wanna shoot it with any gun? Go ahead!! wanna throw a gernade at it and have double the explosion? ♥♥♥♥ YOU LOGIC!!! This usually ends up either crashing your game or doesnt work.\n\nOne last thing: If you buy this game, Dont set the difficulty past marksman. This will glitch most of the enemies and make them near impossible to kill.

This is an amazingly fun game that would suit a wide variety of play styles and almost encourages multiple playthroughs. Each mission could take you 20 minutes if you rush through guns blazing, or if you play this game like a smart and calculating individual, you can make missions go on for over an hour to be a ghost sniper dug into a hide. The multiplayer is incredibly fun, and encourages teamwork. My favorite game mode, No Cross, forces you to move from location to location after each shot and carefully pick your hide and be patient. I have not tried the Co-Op so I have no experience with that. But you can play a horde mode solo or with a friend, as well as a sniper/spotter Co-Op mode. I can play this game for hours and not get bored with the variety of game modes, and the sadistic fun of watching heads, lungs, livers, kidneys and balls explode in super detailed, slow motion bullet cams. If you are a fan of the other Sniper Elite games, I highly recommend this game.","July 16, 2014","true","43.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Getting to blow up a tank was the most relieving moment after 11 hours of gaming and sniping down nazis one by one until the way is clear. Especially I missed some kind of tutorial, which teaches you how to aim under the influence of wind and long-range shots. Also there are few weapons which you can really use (Only one silenced pistol?!? Sam Fisher wouldn't be proud!) and the modifications and gadgets are kind of useless (Why use flint and stone or a rock to lure enemies only to crash around after this while shooting, when you can blow them up with a "coincidentally standing around" can of explosives or fuel?!).\n\nThe lesson is clear: 45,99 € is waaaay too much for this game...Wait for a sale (got it for 9,19 €) and keep your expectations low!\nPS: Sadly there is no "Meh-button"!!\n\nUpdate I: There really are no changes in gameplay: Shoot, run, shoot, hide, oh a tank: Shoot, boom, hide, ...\nAlso the gore isn't as mind blowing and controversial as the trailer promised,...\nThe kill cam is quite funny and a bit disturbing (Shoot the nazis in the nuts, yeah!), but there are no exit wounds and it's kind of dumb that there is a x-ray kill cam, but when you blow up someone there isn't any dismemberment.\n\nUpdate II: I finished the game…after 16 hours…and I did play on "Elite"...\nGood, that I didn’t pay the full price!\nThe end was quite disappointing, too. Very loveless and sudden. Killing Vahlen wasn’t really satisfying, because he was not really presented as evil and a danger to yourself (actually, what is the name of the character??! Either he has no name or I don’t remember it! Last one is the most likely possibility!!). So all in all.\nAll in all my conclusion is definite: An empty shell of a game!! Much Ado About Nothing!

Then you won't enjoy this one.\n\nPro:\nMultiplayer Coop Missions make the game fairly fun because you can rant with a friend about the bugs and horrible logic.\nContra:\nVery very basic AI logic. Like a Splinter Cell game from 2005. Also some enemy sees you behind wall bugs.\nRe-location is also very basic logic. Make hell of noise, kill 17 people, then go 30m aways from that, wait 10 seconds, and enemies forget anything happened.\nNo multiple ways to achieve goals. Only larger corridors how to get there.\nAudio design is a horribly disfigured ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ baby of good audio design. (I can hear an enemy 300m away loud and clear, so I always have to sneak because I assume he's in 20m range.\nMasked shots are realistic for a 4 year old child. If a small generator makes noise in a 10m radius near me, I can kill enemies 300m away without any AI hearing the shot. Is even more noticable in MP because if other player sits amongst the enemies, the shot can be clearly heard like in real life. A sniper rifle is way louder than a generator 300m away. What the hell?\nMap border killzones with no warning, just getting damage until dead. Very very poor.\nI could list some more, instead I just give you the conclusion:\n\nThis game looks and feels as if it was made by an Indie developer that bought some high quality assets(models, image effects, etc.) and threw some scripts in there.

Had it on my wishlist for +/- 6 months or so, but waited and got it now in the summer sale !\n\nGeneralI'm not even halfway the game and I like it more than Sniper Elite 2. Sniper Elite 3 is located in Afrika and it has more features; the levels are way more bigger and you really need to plan and execute it carefully. Observing, planning and executing is they key in every. single. level. These 3 things doesn't matter in which difficulty you're playing. You need these 3 things in every difficulty level. The revamped and (new) features are also great !\n\nFeaturesThe details are absolutely stunning, and as I said the new features are also. You can customize your rifle, and choose/edit loadouts before playing a level. The returning x-ray kill camera is what I love the most; the new thing about this is the x-ray camera for vehicles - watch the bullet crashing into the engine and see how it explodes - You can also edit how you wanna use the x-ray camera in the settings (or if you don't like the x-ray you even can disable it). There's also a new radial menu where you see your equipement and select it if you need it.\nFurthermore, and i like this feature too, is when you get spotted you should prelocate to a new position to continue the execute part - and that's what the game says when you get spot, which is ... nice and realistic. And next to all this you can level up your rank to unlock more weapons/equipment. There are way more features, but that's up to you if you wanna see them or not ;)\n\nThe only negative note I have to add is ... If the game is located in afrika, then why are there all germans in the game. I mean it's okay but eh ?\n\nConclusionIf you like using a sniper, play games with a great story, apply your tactic skill or if you just wanna blow people's head off with a bullet camera then get this game.\n\nIt's simple amazing ...\n\nI do not have any DLC and I didn't played co-op/multiplayer (yet)","June 17, 2015","true","17.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Serious_Zombie/recommended/238090/","Serious_Zombie","Serious Pony","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Serious_Zombie/","327 products in account","Actually, Sniper Elite 3 is a very satisfying sniper game with big open levels and adequate stealth system, All sniper rifles (with DLCs there are 10 or more of them) have different characteristics to suit any type of player + they can be customized in terms of scope (including the scope pattern), grip, muzzle, etc.  There is no more stupid "strawberry jam" regeneration, there are medkits now. There are many optional objectives to complete (e.g. locate a visiting general and assassinate him) while completing the main misison. All of this makes the game highly replayable.\n\n\nIn other words, it's a big leap from the V2 in terms of gameplay and the game can boast good optimisation. I highly recommend playing it on higher difficulty levels (Sniper Elite and higher) with most of the HUD turned off to have your skills challenged.\n\nThe only problem is that Season Pass is really required to get the biggest kick from the game. It covers all the released DLCs, though - 4 mission packs (Hunt the Grey Wolf + 3 Save Churchill missions), 5 weapon packs (tons of all kinds of weapons that make choosing your pre-mission loadout really interesting).\n\nMP is good too, but I'm more of the single-player guy, so I can't adequately review it.\n\nI could have given SE 3 the score of 9/10, but for the greediness of devs who sold cut content, I can rate it only 7.5/10.\n\nIn terms of gameplay it is absolutely great, so try to get the game and the season pass when there will be a good discount (e.g. Steam Summer Sale). It will be definitely worth your money.\n\nP.S. At the moment of posting the review I've completed 3 levels in 8 hours. I really took my time and enjoyed the hell out of them. There are many more to beat and I'm going to utilize the same approach for the rest of the game.\nP.P.S.

The one big thing that turned me off, however, is the lack of content included in the vanilla game. I've never seen a shooting game with so few guns.  It turns me off, big time when I see all of this DLC for sale so shortly after release day.  The campaign is short, and only 2 horde style maps, and they both look and play the same.  There are positives, for sure: the game looks pretty good, and the x-ray cam can really give some good screen shots.\nOne other negative, that has gotten better due to a patch or two is/was the unpredictable aiming when you are close to a window or ledge.  Bullets woulld not hit the target even though the crosshair is spot on.\nOverall, I can not recommend this game at it's current price; once it drops below $20 I could honestly say that I would change my  recommendation","August 7, 2014","false","19.7"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

It's simply faster and better this way. And that is a shame, since game about sniping is better played without using a sniper rifle too often.\n\nMaps themselves, while granted - bigger and more open that V2 maps are tailored more towards up-close stealth gameplay with silenced pistol than actual sniper rifle action (with the exception being 3rd "save the churchil" DLC map).\n\nIn general, the game is more of a stealth "simulator" now, than a casual, relaxing duck-hunt that SE V2 used to be, which is something people should be aware of, especially if they consider buying SE 3 basing their choice on their experience with SE V2.\n\nTL;DR\nThere's a fair chance that you'll see and think that this game plays better in stealth & close quarters than actual sniping.\nIf you're okay with it, then i'd say go ahead and get it.","September 21, 2014","true","99.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I thought it was a little expensive but after playing it I decided it was worth every penny. I own all the sniper games and like to play them all, but this one is special. The sound and graphics are very good as I would insist on at this price. The maps are huge. I highly recommend this game along with the 'season pass' that comes to $70.00 while the season pass is on sale. A lot of work went into this one and I bet it will be supported by the developer for a long time to come. Enjoy!!\n\nAfter playing this game more, I am  going to have to add this:\nI really like the graphics and audio, but actual game play feels a little strange. I think this game was designed with the console in mind. The keyboard and mouse just don't feel right when steering this character around. You feel like an unseen entity watching your character move with your mouse and keyboard. You are 'not in the character' as in other sniper or shooter games.\nIt is fun, but it does feel repetitive after a while. Anyway, it is a good game but I do feel a little bit let down.","November 17, 2014","true","8.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

This doesn't appear to be the case, as the game is really rough around the edges, and FEELS hastily thrown together.

Pretty disappointed in this title, after looking forward to it for so long.\n\nMy biggest gripes with SE3:\nBodies and weapons that float a foot or so off the ground.\nFiring your rifle at a target and nothing happens.

How do you collect THAT?\nNo matter HOW deeply you're in cover, tanks know where you are IMMEDIATELY after one shot, and strafe the ♥♥♥♥ out of you.\nLoading screen hints go by so quickly you can't read the damned things.\nI saved a game, and the next time I opened it, my saved game wasn't there - instead, I found myself getting blown up immediately.

The controls all feel very familiar,  that is to say there's nothing too different about the layout of what-does-what and it's responsive on top of it, even though I still find it a little annoying that you have to take cover behind a crotch-high wall before you can vault over it instead of.. well, -just- vaulting over it. Or perhaps I'm just doing it wrong.\n\nYou can definitely see that a lot of the effort has gone into the the gory, slow-mo shots where you can see, in close and loving detail, a bullet drill right the way through a poor sod's head, splattering brains, blood and bone everywhere. The only nit-pick I have with it though [honestly, I don't mean to sound like a grim and creepy fellow with this] is that after watching my bullet bore it's way through a man's face and exit with what appears like it should have left a wound the size of a grapefruit, there appears to be little damage to the individual. I've clearly surgically removed several unfortunate blokes' faces with a conservative amount of bullets but when I trot on over to the corpse, those eyes I've taken great care to get rid of are still there. No halves of skull missing or gaping craters where you would assume there'd be a considerable exit wound; kind of makes the gorey, attention to detail of the anatomy side of things feel a little bit half-arsed. But I'll overlook that as it probably is a rather large amount of work to do.\n\nDespite this, the game is great fun. Skulking around in the shadows, being able to plan a method of attack from any and all directions instead of the usual, linear path a game can normally give you. Shadows even affect how concealed you are and there are even some lanterns that can be shot to cast a bit more shadow at that; a feature I though V2 desperately needed. The whole relocation mechanic is great as well; forcing you to stay on your toes and not get too comfy in one spot. It adds a bit more of a pace to the game and add a tad more realism to the experience in that a sniper can only take so many shots from the same location, even though realistically a sniper can wait in one spot for days defacating in their pants for even just one good shot.\n\nBut in all; I do have a couple of huge gripes with this game:\nWe'll start with the length of the game; eight levels stardard just isn't enough for a full price, hyped up title like this. If you know what you're doing you can fly through those levels in less than a day and it's never a good sign when your players get the the end and sigh saying "Is that all?". Also, not including DLC [which I'll get to], four rifles, maching guns and pistols. Really? This game is called -Sniper Elite- and there's only four rifles? What annoys me even more is that the protagonist clearly has a Kar98 on his back in the box art and not only is it not in the game; it's not even DLC. So to even have a nice veriety of guns and even have just more than one thing to do in the survival mode and multiplayer modes you -have- to buy the DLC that came out on day one with the game [and others, now that there's another out I believe]. Why not just include it in the full game? That seems a bit money-grubby to me and like Rebellion has done the fans a bit of a disservice there just make a bit of extra pocket money.\n\nHowever despite the length of the game and the seemingly greedy intentions of having a very limited arsenal included, it's a very solid and very fun game. Definitely worth a go. But to be fair; I wish I didn't spend as much as I did on it for the amount of game I actually got on purchase.\nA 3.5/5 from me\n\n- Matt","July 27, 2014","true","63.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Sniper Elite 3 is far more open-ended, and offers a much wider variety of playstyles than what V2 did. It’s only too bad then that the end product just doesn’t feel competent enough to satisfy its own ambition. It has all the features required to make the ultimate sniping game. But not enough time and effort was given to iron out and polish up each of these features to the levels that would make the game shine. Let’s hope Rebellion take everything they’ve learned so far, and turns the next sequel into what this game was so close to becoming, had it only been in development for a little longer; the benchmark that all future sniping games will be measured against. For its retail price, I can really only recommend it to those with a serious fetish for sniping. At a good discount or with some heavy patches ironing out all the issues, I would have less of a problem recommending it to anyone out for a good time shooting Nazis. Because although it’s not saying much, Sniper Elite 3 is currently the best game entirely devoted to sniping that we’ve gotten so far.\n\n3.5/5\n\nFull Review:\nhttp://www.pixeljudge.com/en/reviews/sniper-elite-3/","July 28, 2014","true","14.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This is something I made sure of especially as I originally had purchased a copy from a vender that was not steam, and therefore was deemed "stolen" by Rebellion and revoked. But I won't turn this review into a rant about that, I paid my £40 and have played Sniper Elite 3 now for about 40 odd hours.\n\nI've completed the game on Sniper Elite mode. I've completed it on Authentic mode. I've collected all the collectables. Completed all the bonus objectives. I've completed the DLC and obtained all the achievements from that.\n\nI've got (at the time of writing) 54/61 achievements for SE3 and I'm almost at the point of a perfect game. Once there I think I won't bother with this game again.\n\nYou see, I was a massive, MASSIVE sniper elite and sniper elite v2 fan. I also loved the v2 zombie nazi DLC/standalone's too (although truth be told I haven't yet finished both). I was really looking forward to SE3. I had been following its progression for a while and tried not to get too excited because I didn't want to spoil the joy of release day.\n\nWhen its release day finally came around (and all the BS of getting an actual copy aside) the initial 10 minutes of the game were brilliant!\n\nIt looked great, colours were vibrant and lush. The sound was crisp and map design was classic. I went through the tutorial really enjoying what I was doing, sniping through bino's, melee kills, finding collectables etc.\n\nThen when I moved onto the next mission I started noticing issues almost immediately. Invisible barriers blocking shots, AI shooting through walls at me, AI spotting from waaaay over the other side of the map, BULLETPROOF grass and bushes, AI that suddenly spawned in areas you had previously cleared, extremely slow trigger response on SMG's and sniper rifles, falling through the map when proning near walls, standard stuff that should have been found and fixed during development by Rebellions QA.\n\nThese issues continued to plague my experience throughout the game. I should have stopped then and there and got a refund due to a grossly unfinished product, but I continued on because I really wanted to enjoy it being a massive fan of the franchise. I eventually committed too much time that stopping would have annoyed me just as much as all the issues and bugs I was experiencing, so I just decided to grin and bear it and try to 100% the game and then "put i on the shelf" and never think about it again.\n\nI don't really know if Rebellion will ever really fix all the problems this game currently has because there are so many.

The camera & controls are nowhere near as good as SEv2.  The camera & controls are bad. Tried to adjust with settings & mouse & still not got it very good. The "use cover" is gone. It is almost as if it is automatic.  When you get close to a box  or wall when crouched it seems to automatically put you in cover but it feels like you are bouncing off each object. Annoying. The character movements are not smooth like SEv2. It feels like your character is darting around. There are some glitches like  A.I. dissapearing into steps , etc. There is a delay in shooting. When I press the trigger the gun does not fire rite away.  There are bugs that I hope are fixed with a patch, soon!  The terrible character & camera controls are making gameplay frustrating.

Textures are off in some places but that's not a huge deal.\n-It can get very brutal in a high difficulty.\n-They learned after SE:v2 and improved a lot of things.\n-Weapons and how you can have a tailored to you variety. (mostly)\n-I wouldn't say it's a long game, but it's not really short either. Nice middle ground.\n-A lot of the time, movements are predictable - but there has been the odd time where I have been caught out and seen.\n-I have came across only 1 bug - ONE - which was easily resolved by restarting the level. This can be a con, but to me it's not.\n-Cinematics are short and sweet, but can be skipped anyway.\n\nCON:\n-Sound and sound masking seem to still be quite off and unrealistic.\n-Night missions; enemies can see like it's day, but for someone like me that uses low contrast for ambiance can't see them.\n-Although I said weapons can be tailored, it's still a choice between this, that or the other. You can't be a run and gun person effeciently.\n-I feel the scope and the aim helper are off sometimes. The helper said I had a hit, I shoot, and the bullet flies above or past them. (Note: I had this very few times. This could be just a mechanic to not make it a faceroll? No idea)\n-Killed a guard, someone found the body. That someone just looks around, shrugs their shoulders and carries on patrol. No alarms or searching the area or at least gave the corpse a cup of tea. Nope, like nothing happened.\n-You get seen or heard from a shot and get chased to where you were last. Relocate, get an all clear and everyone just goes back to normal... again like nothing happened. This universe plays devilish tricks, I tell ye.\n\nThat's all I can think of for now. Do I think the price tag is worth the game? drop the price to £29.99 and then yes, it would be VERY worth the money I would think.\n\nTL;DR: IMO, a very good game, but has it's offsets by AI and sound masking.","July 12, 2014","true","12.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

This is something I made sure of especially as I originally had purchased a copy from a vender that was not steam, and therefore was deemed "stolen" by Rebellion and revoked. But I won't turn this review into a rant about that, I paid my £40 and have played Sniper Elite 3 now for about 40 odd hours.\n\nI've completed the game on Sniper Elite mode. I've completed it on Authentic mode. I've collected all the collectables. Completed all the bonus objectives. I've completed the DLC and obtained all the achievements from that.\n\nI've got (at the time of writing) 54/61 achievements for SE3 and I'm almost at the point of a perfect game. Once there I think I won't bother with this game again.\n\nYou see, I was a massive, MASSIVE sniper elite and sniper elite v2 fan. I also loved the v2 zombie nazi DLC/standalone's too (although truth be told I haven't yet finished both). I was really looking forward to SE3. I had been following its progression for a while and tried not to get too excited because I didn't want to spoil the joy of release day.\n\nWhen its release day finally came around (and all the BS of getting an actual copy aside) the initial 10 minutes of the game were brilliant!\n\nIt looked great, colours were vibrant and lush. The sound was crisp and map design was classic. I went through the tutorial really enjoying what I was doing, sniping through bino's, melee kills, finding collectables etc.\n\nThen when I moved onto the next mission I started noticing issues almost immediately. Invisible barriers blocking shots, AI shooting through walls at me, AI spotting from waaaay over the other side of the map, BULLETPROOF grass and bushes, AI that suddenly spawned in areas you had previously cleared, extremely slow trigger response on SMG's and sniper rifles, falling through the map when proning near walls, standard stuff that should have been found and fixed during development by Rebellions QA.\n\nThese issues continued to plague my experience throughout the game. I should have stopped then and there and got a refund due to a grossly unfinished product, but I continued on because I really wanted to enjoy it being a massive fan of the franchise. I eventually committed too much time that stopping would have annoyed me just as much as all the issues and bugs I was experiencing, so I just decided to grin and bear it and try to 100% the game and then "put i on the shelf" and never think about it again.\n\nI don't really know if Rebellion will ever really fix all the problems this game currently has because there are so many. I work for a major games publisher and know that when we've released a title in the past, and it's had a bunch of issues with it, we've had to decide what we can and can't address because there's always time and budget attached to it.

I'd gone through the campaign several times, mostly at Marksman level (my personal favourite - I enjoy lining the diamond up for a shot), but also at Sniper Elite, mostly for the achievement. Sniper Elite 2, after hundreds of hours playing time is still a game I like to 'dip back into'; play a particular level in a different way, setting myself a particular challenge or go for an obscure achievement, or just play for the extra points and pure pleasure of the graphics and settings. This cannot be said for all campaign WWII shooters, some can get very predictable and can only be played in a certain way which you will realise after only a couple of plays through, so I'm really pleased to be in the Sniper Elite camp. Sniper Elite 3 proved to be even more superior in all aspects than SE2. Once again, hundreds of hours into the game and I am still looking forward to playing each mission over and over again. Still finding areas of the maps I havent explored, and after maybe 5 times through I can honestly say each time has been a completely different experience. The only thing that will hold you back as you sneak through the North African settings will be your own imaginative methods and skills. The cam-kills never get dull for me, and being able to retain stealth while I systematically silence and destroy airfields/factory's/gun emplacements etc is truly satisfying. One (constructive) criticism is the subdued enemy response to my attacks. While it really is real fun to creep through missions sniping with sound cover or silently downing enemies as I tag and find them, sometimes it seems the realism is lost as after a short period of 'alertness', comrades of the dead just seem to resign themselves to the fact that the garrison (or whatever it is) they are stationed at is slowly but surely being annihilated. There is no heightened sense of alarm. It is possible to hide bodies, which is an amazing feature, but what with the enemy not seeming to care too much, after a minute or so, that another of their comrades has been found dead, there wasn't a great deal of incentive to use it for me. I won't comment on the MP as I haven't played it enough to appreciate it, but definitely from what I have played its all thumbs up from me. Atmospheric, tense and immersive, and definitely a game you will go back to over and over again.

HUge improvements. This game is definetly 1 of my favorite stealth games.\n\nThe challenge scales brilliantly now. I played it on hard and found it just so much better. You can focus on going 100% stealth now, without those "must fight" situations..\n\nYou have bonus objectives that in conjunction with the improved stealth mechanics and difficulty scaling, makes the game not only more interesting but bigger, fuller. In all seriousness this game might not have "dishonored" story or characters, but it definetly has better stealth and reason to map explore.\n\n1 of my favorite points of this game in comparison with other stealth games, are the kills and how enjoyable they are. Reminds of "Tenchu". It will make you want to scour the map just for extra kills. The stealth and gadget system is vastly improved and you will have to use everysingle 1 of them eventually.\n\nThey also added more rpg elements and extra things like shooting range to the game. Havent tried multiplayer, but what i can tell you, is that, as a single player experience this is possibly 1 of the best stealth games out there.\n\nI recommend it, not only to stealth fans, but to shooting game fans and eventhough its not a classic fps, it offers what most do with extra uniqueness.\n\nWaiting for the game!\n","April 29, 2015","true","18.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Sure, some things are kind of funky, it is a third person controlled game afterall. But I'll get more into that.\n\nStarted at 11:30pm. Joined a multiplayer match, not even having touched the gameplay before. Bro came into my room at 12:30pm and said "dude its 12:30, go to bed". It felt like 10 minutes. There wasn't even any voice chat going. Just the intensity and your heart racing in real life and in game as you line up a shot.\n\nYou spawn. You creep your way to a window that is in a shadow, and you peer out carefully, pulling up your binoculars and scanning the landscape, focusing in on distant points as closer things become blurry because your eyes aren't focusing on it. Everything seems clear, so you climb out the window swiftly and go into a sprint to get to the next shadow. As you hit the side of the building, you are panting heavily, and your heart is racing at 93bmp, making it hard to hear your surroundings. As you catch your breath, you pull out your binoculars again and scan the landscape again. Out the corner of the circlular binoculars, you see a blimpse of movement. You quickly switch back to your scoped M1 Garand and focus in on the air. In the real world your heart is beating faster, and you're focusing more and more on that spot, waiting for your unsuspecting prey to poke their head out. Then you hear a gunshot and a split second later you are falling over, dead.\n\nIn this time frame about 2 minutes have passed, and it was the most intense, realistically worrying experience you've felt ever playing a video game.\n\nSingleplayer is just a ton of fun, using broken generators and artillary barages and planes flying overhead in order to mask your sniper rifle's firing so that the German Afrika Corps soldiers don't realize you're there. Having to figure out the puzzle of who to shoot first and at what point on their patrol so that their buddies don't see the body but also masking the sound of your shot and firing from a position where you aren't visible to enemies. Setting up an ambush with Dynamite and blowing it up to cause mass confusion and win the section of that mission.\nOh, I almost forgot, I spent 3 of these hours on the first mission ALONE. Let alone the countless others to come.\n\nA game has never made my heart race this hard, or keep me entralled in heart startling multiplayer.\nI give it a total of 9.5/10, because third person moving is a painnnnnn in the ♥♥♥.

Sniper Elite 3 has improved upon the previous games in terms of visuals and gameplay.  The ability to shoot without sound cover and rellocate has fundamentally enhanced the game.  At times the visuals can be very cinematic.  As with every game, this one is not without its faults.  Gameplay can become alittle mechanical in feel (shoot, relocate, shoot, relocate) as well as the repetitive kill cam which is intriquing  at first but became overplayed.  If I could change one thing about this game it would be the addition of more story. Missions are not very plot driven.  It feels less like a WW2 sniper adventure and more like being dropped into a map with a checklist.  All defaults aside this is still a great game worthy of a playthrough.  The Afrika Korp backdrop is well executed.  I feel that Sniper Elite 3 is a fair improvement from its predecessors and a great foundation to continue to expand the genre.","January 1","true","30.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

This SUX when you've finished everything but the last objective after a 3 hr mission level.\n- It is not Assassin's creed, it is not a close quarters stealth game BUT appears to be. The game actually deviates from previous Sniper Elite games in this regard as more often than not, you'll actually be taking enemies down with your silenced pistol close up.\n- Close quarters is clunky, use silenced pistol instead as NOT ALL situations lend to taking silent take-downs, this is by design and incredibly silly as it's not intuitive.\n- One shot from the sniper gun and the ENTIRE base is almost on you.\n- Far too much emphasis on Sniper gun only, everything and the kitchen sink is thrown into it, other guns' accuracy and damage is purposely kept lower.\n- Far too much emphasis on Headshots to take down, seriously! Come on. Give extra XP for it, Don't make a player shoot twice just cause he hit at the torso.\n- Every mission becomes tediously long of about 3 hrs if you play it slow and hidden in the game.","January 19","true","35.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

And boy, it's a great one.\n\nStory: The story might not feel very deep, but it works.\n\nGraphics: The graphics are absolutely fantastic. Look at the beautiful enviroments of North Africa. Definatively Scenery Porn (look it up on Tv tropes). The character models also look very good. Even on low settings it's impressive.\n\nGameplay: The gameplay is in my opinion, improved a bit from V2. While regenerating health still exists, now it will only fill up to a certain point of your lifebar, anymore injuries than that will require bandages or medpacks to heal. The shooting still works very nice. One flaw though is that they removed the cover system from V2 (press Q), but so far it hasn't been affecting me that much. The A.I shows some improvement from V2, they will now react more to suspicious stuff, like gunfire and dead bodies. If you kill a soldier, they will start searching for you, and will find you eventually unless you relocate. You can also occasionally find weapon parts or upgrades for your weapons which can be used to modify your weapons.\n\nMusic: The music is, like V2, epic and well made. You can even occasionally hear songs from V2 on the radios in some missions.\n\nOverall, Sniper Elite 3 is worth the money. If you liked V2, you will enjoy 3 as well.\n\nAlso for the last, it has trading cards, and the X-Ray killcams are just absolutely AWESOME (shooting an enemy in some parts of the head will even DESTROY parts of the cranium).\n\n9/10.","September 26, 2014","true","19.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","1"

I'm giving it a thumbs up because by itself its an alright game.  However that said, I'd like to point out that in my opinion this game is a step back from Sniper Elite v2.  Here's how the two compare in my opinion:\n\nImprovements:\n\n- less linear maps\n- improved graphics\n- more customizable weapons\n\nCons:\n\n- Empty lung ability now shows where to aim to adjust for gravity and wind (even on the hardest difficulty).  Sniper Elite v2 is incredibly fun when you get dialed in to a rifle and pull of numerous long range consecutive headshots.  You'll do that in SE3 as well, but it'll be so easy you won't even notice.\n- The new detection mechanics are broken. While SEv2's were admittedly pretty simple SE3's is just to wonky to ignore.  Get caught in your sniping nest?  No worries, walk 50 meters away, then walk back and the Nazis will forget all about where you've been picking them off from for the past 10 minutes.\n- Poor clipping on cover.  It's always annoying when you shoot the barrier in front of you when your scope shows a clear shot, but this is especially bad in SE3 where the detection mechanism penalizes you for every shot.\n- Poor checkpoint system.  Sometimes it saves after objectives, sometimes it saves when you're sitting in a bush, and sometimes it doesn't save at all.\n\n","March 12","true","15.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The sniper gameplay is much like Sniper Elite V2 with a fresh coat of paint... and wow is it a lovely coat of paint. The graphics are phenomenal and the game runs so damn good too! They really brought the Afrika Korps to life in this game. You'll see beautifully rendered Panzer III and IV tanks, including the British Matilda... there's also the Tiger I Tank that looks badass.\n\nThe sound effects are the next improvement... wow I love the sounds of the guns in this game. The MP 40 especially. The way it sounds when it fires or reloads is fantastic! I also love that creepy sound the game makes when enemy snipers are trying to get a bead on you or when enemies go into combat mode... kinda reminds me of 70's horror movie sound effects when the killer is sneaking up on you... freaks me right out heh.\n\nI guess I can talk about the sniper gunplay next since it's the main part of the game heh... well? It's handled quite nicely and the x-ray mode is improved over the second game in the series... but it's odd, sometimes the bullet cam gets confused and flies at full speed instead of slowing down or fails to recognize a double kill (can happen if enemies are too close together) but the rest of it works great. The controls are just about perfect... I say just about as I wish it had a button to toggle what shoulder you're looking over. it's annoying when trying to come around some corners if you're not hugging said corner to try and force the camera to pan shoulders...\n\nThe campaign is actually quite the nice length as it took me 16.2 hours to beat so I feel it's actually a really nice length to it. The environments are varied and they don't feel the same which is nice since of course the gameplay options are a bit limited.. snipe, run away and return and snipe seems to work the best. It does feel like a bit of a gameplay flaw that enemies can't figure out where you are if you quickly run away and return to the same spot while they're in caution mode (yellow compass warning)... because if I ran away and came back in real life? They'd still figure out I'm in the same spot kind-of thing.\n\nWhich leads me into AI... they're decent in this game but they give up WAYYY too easily. I mean... I just sniped two of your comrades! They're dead near you!!! What do you mean you're already returning to normal patrol? Aren't you worried that you're probably next? Hahaha.... So sometimes when I feel like a challenge? I'd place anti-personel mines at the bottom of stairs or ladders leading to me and set up... and then they never charge me. Instead they just keep tossing grenades at me... so that sucked. I'd recommend to other players doing the singleplayer to just set up traps in front and below where you want to snipe in positions you figure where the enemies will try and toss grenades from. I've also had AI run off bridges to their deaths and also run into fire from a left over explosion and get themselves killed haha... so yeah, AI isn't the best in this game and if I did a future playthrough I'd definitely do the hardest difficulty.\n\nSo? 16.2 hours for the singleplayer campaign and I got it on a weekend sale. I'd definitely recommend it on those sales for the singleplayer. Tbh I don't really see myself doing multiplayer as I'm not the best at sniping haha so I'll keep my multiplayer gameplay to the likes of World of Tanks. So?

It's a stealth game where you are expected to make lots and lots of noise.\n\nThe Good\n\nCustomizable Difficuty/Realism: I played this on "Custom" difficulty with Realistic bullet physics, No Tactical assistance (Tagging, Alert meters, ect) and it was a tense, but fun experience!\n\nHowever for those who just want to Quckscope Nazis in the crotch, you are more than welcome to turn the bullet physics to simple and have at it! Or if you like the idea but are not confident in your aim/infiltration abilities, turn on tactical assistance and it will help you out with things like a red diamond that shows where your bullet will land, radar (which also marks your last known location), tagging, and a whole slew of assistive UI elements.\n\nSniping: The game actually encourages a rather realistic approach to sniping. It's not about how long of a kill you can make (though long kills are an achievement of itself, with the realistic physics at least), but rather how can you make the best of a position? It encourages you to constantly relocate as rifles are loud and the bad guys will know where you are shooting from, or take advantage and dig in with traps (LOTS OF TRAPS!). However despite the only suppressed weapon you have, quite honestly sucks (except at it's designated role, but we'll get there), you still can muffle your shots with ambient sounds like planes flying overhead, loudspeakers, broken/loud machenery, ect. So you still can, theoretically pull off a "no detection run" it's just very difficult as it's often safe to assume you'll get into a firefight.\n\nTraps: Speaking of, you actually have quite a few of these! Ranging from trip mines that are great for covering narrow passages, S-mines for dealing with infantry clusters, landmines for Tanks, and even dynamite! However, the most effective one I've found was flint and steel, it's a good distraction AND after about twenty seconds, it detonates any explosives in a short radius around it!\n\nX-Ray Cam: Basically Mortal Kombat 9's X-Ray attack, onlly it happens when you make a good shot (At least on minimal, I find it triggers too much on the normal setting). Also cool is that it works on vehicles!\n\nYour Equipment: Interestingly enough your equipment (Aside from your rifle and it's customizations) are NOT there to help make "mile long shots". Instead it's there to cover your bases, with the aformentioned traps, or your sidearms (SMG's that help you in a pinch, your trusty Welrod that sucks as a combat pistol but is AMAZING at preventing the bad guys from raising the alarm since it is suppressed, or combat pistols which help you fight them off), to things like rocks (distraction), AP Ammo (allows your bullets to easily sail through the armored grills of vehicles), and medkits.\n\nEnvironments/ Level design: Not only did Rebellion make North Africa very pretty, they also made the levels reasonably open, allowing you to get into positions and make some incredible shots. It also takes the "Goldeneye" philosophy of level design where you have a clear primary objective, but also several secondary objectives you can complete if you wish.\n\nA few other minor, but cool details:\n\n-You can get clues on making the mission easier/future objectives if you observe and listen into enemy converstaions\n-The Rifle range I found was a very nice tool for breaking in rifles, it even lets you try the DLC weapons (Though you don't really need them)\n-The guys at Rebellion REALLY did their homework here! I want to meet their research team and swap notes.\n\nSome Caveats:\n\nTHIS IS NOT A GAME FOR PACIFIST RUNS! In fact there are no non-lethal means of disposing of the Nazis/Itallians. Most levels I find I kill around 90% of all the bad guys\n\nThere's no button to swap shoulders in this THIRD PERSON SHOOTER\n\nYes the AI can be stupid: Granted on the highest difficulty they were competent when fighting, but they suffer from "Loss of sight" amnesia when you vacate the area without them seeing you, and they resume their patrols, despite the piles of dead bodies you just created.\n\nSome checkpoints suck: In my experience, only two of them were really bad.\n\nHowever you can get around it by saving afterwards and the game will pick up from there (unless  you are playing in "sniper elite" mode, which is all the difficulties up/real ballistics/ no tactical assistance AND NO SAVING/CHECKPOINTS!)\n\nThe story is nothing too special: despite them doing pretty solid research into the Wonder Weapon*\n\n*Yes it did exist and it is rumored that only one part was finished and used as a part in Hitler's "Atlantic Wall", or for those who don't know, the northern costal defenses in Europe that the Nazis built to prevent an invasion from Great Britain, we all know the story how that turned out.","January 11","true","15.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dpxmsk/recommended/238090/","dpxmsk","DeadPoolX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dpxmsk/","1182 products in account","Sniper Elite 3 (SE3) takes place in Northern Africa, which is a theatre often neglected in WWII games. Usually games focus on the European Theatre (western and/or eastern fronts) and slightly less often, the Pacific Theatre. That's a nice change and presents a locale that hasn't been overused.\n\nSomething I also like about North Africa is that despite it being mostly a rocky desert, there is still plenty of environmental plant life to make the scenary appear not quite as depressing. I remember in Sniper Elite v2 (SEv2) thinking that the constant use of broken and blasted buildings became quite tiring, despite it being accurate for the location.\n\nSE3 brings in slight RPG aspects, in that your equipment has various stats. The rifles in particular are interesting because you can greatly modify them using parts you find as you play. That said, many of the "better" rifles and pistols are only available in DLC packages, but it's entirely possible to play through the whole game and do exceptionally well without ever spending a dime on any DLC.\n\nThe overall game mechanics are similar to SEv2. On easier difficutly levels you don't have to account for gravity (bullet drop) or wind, and pressing the focus button (the default is "E") enhances your zoom and slows down time. You have a limited amount of focus and if you expend it before firing, you'll zoom out and time will resume as normal. Fortunately, focus replenishes by itself.\n\nHead shots are preferable to body shots, although I've managed to kill enemies after hitting them in the leg. You can perforate major blood vessels and organs (seen through an x-ray view when hitting the enemy), which the game acknowledges, but I don't know if that really makes a difference as far as killing them goes. I believe the game really just takes into account general location damage, so a high velocity shot to the abdomen might result in a kill, regardless of it tearing apart the intestines or kidneys.\n\nRemaining undetected is a major part of SE3. You can do this by using your sidearm (assuming you've taken either the Welrod or the HDM, both of which have suppressors attached to them), stabbing an unsuspecting enemy in the back, or using noise to hide your sniper shots. Noise cover can range from artillery fire to PA announcements to sabotaging a generator.\n\nAlthough you have a secondary weapon (which can be anything from a Thompson submachine gun to a Panzerschrek, which is essentially a rocket launcher), using it will undoubtedly cause a ton of noise, thereby attracting scores of enemy soldiers who will overwhelm you on anything except the lowest difficultly level. Even then, it's still fairly easy to die, so it's best to avoid that scenario entirely if at all possible.\n\nUnlike SEv2, enemies DO NOT suddenly pop up out of nowhere. Reinforcements can be called in (usually through scripted events), but you won't have to deal with inching forward after clearing an area only to come upon a soldier who materialized out of thin air.\n\nThe campaign takes place over eight long missions. In contrast to SEv2, which relied entirely on checkpoints, SE3 allows you to save whenever and wherever you wish using manual saves and quicksaves. Some players might find this "cheap" or refer to it as "save scumming," but to me it's simply a matter of convenience, which lets me play for as long or as little as I choose.\n\nMultiplayer takes the form of PvP and PvE Co-op. In PvP multiplayer, you play on a team and fight other players, whereas in PvE Co-op, its you and your teammate against the AI.\n\nIn co-op, you have three choices:\n1. Play through the entire campaign in co-op mode.\n2. Play specific downloaded missions.\n3. Play unique asymetric assignments, where one player has a sniper rifle and a pistol, and the other player has a pistol, secondary weapon (such as an MP-40), and binoculars.\n\nA shooting range has also been added as an extra single player mode, which lets you practice with all the weapons, including explosives.\n\nNo matter how good SE3 is, there are some problems.\n\nWhen playing co-op, the campaign missions only use temporary checkpoint saves (as opposed to the "save anywhere" method in single player), which can make for some exceptionally long game times. These checkpoints only last for the duration of the session, so if you quit, you'll have to start over the beginning of the mission.\n\nThis has been a problem for my wife and me, as although we enjoy SE3, we don't always feel like spending four hours or so on one mission. It would be nice if the game at least saved the progress of the mission on the host's machine and allowed the players to continue where they left off.\n\nThe asymetric missions almost always include a "horde mode" component, where you have to defend against waves upon waves of enemies. In a game like SE3, where stealth and not being noticed is generally considered important, this seems very out-of-place and if you're not ready for it, quite jarring as well.\n\nSomething else that's of general annoyance is the way a weapon's stats are presented. Using a combination of white, yellow, and red bars to denote standard, improved, and reduced stats (when comparing other weapons to your currently armed weapon), understanding the bars can be unclear, at least at first. I would've preferred numbers instead of nondescript bars, but it's not a big deal overall.\n\nIn the end, would I recommend Sniper Elite 3? Absolutely. If you're the least bit interested in playing a sniper and World War II, there's no reason for me to not recommend this game.","February 6","true","77.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

This SUX when you've finished everything but the last objective after a 3 hr mission level.\n- It is not Assassin's creed, it is not a close quarters stealth game BUT appears to be. The game actually deviates from previous Sniper Elite games in this regard as more often than not, you'll actually be taking enemies down with your silenced pistol close up.\n- Close quarters is clunky, use silenced pistol instead as NOT ALL situations lend to taking silent take-downs, this is by design and incredibly silly as it's not intuitive.\n- One shot from the sniper gun and the ENTIRE base is almost on you.\n- Far too much emphasis on Sniper gun only, everything and the kitchen sink is thrown into it, other guns' accuracy and damage is purposely kept lower.\n- Far too much emphasis on Headshots to take down, seriously! Come on. Give extra XP for it, Don't make a player shoot twice just cause he hit at the torso.\n- Every mission becomes tediously long of about 3 hrs if you play it slow and hidden in the game.","January 19","true","35.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Sniper Elite 3 has improved upon the previous games in terms of visuals and gameplay.  The ability to shoot without sound cover and rellocate has fundamentally enhanced the game.  At times the visuals can be very cinematic.  As with every game, this one is not without its faults.  Gameplay can become alittle mechanical in feel (shoot, relocate, shoot, relocate) as well as the repetitive kill cam which is intriquing  at first but became overplayed.  If I could change one thing about this game it would be the addition of more story. Missions are not very plot driven.  It feels less like a WW2 sniper adventure and more like being dropped into a map with a checklist.  All defaults aside this is still a great game worthy of a playthrough.  The Afrika Korp backdrop is well executed.

Sure, some things are kind of funky, it is a third person controlled game afterall. But I'll get more into that.\n\nStarted at 11:30pm. Joined a multiplayer match, not even having touched the gameplay before. Bro came into my room at 12:30pm and said "dude its 12:30, go to bed". It felt like 10 minutes. There wasn't even any voice chat going. Just the intensity and your heart racing in real life and in game as you line up a shot.\n\nYou spawn. You creep your way to a window that is in a shadow, and you peer out carefully, pulling up your binoculars and scanning the landscape, focusing in on distant points as closer things become blurry because your eyes aren't focusing on it. Everything seems clear, so you climb out the window swiftly and go into a sprint to get to the next shadow. As you hit the side of the building, you are panting heavily, and your heart is racing at 93bmp, making it hard to hear your surroundings. As you catch your breath, you pull out your binoculars again and scan the landscape again. Out the corner of the circlular binoculars, you see a blimpse of movement. You quickly switch back to your scoped M1 Garand and focus in on the air. In the real world your heart is beating faster, and you're focusing more and more on that spot, waiting for your unsuspecting prey to poke their head out. Then you hear a gunshot and a split second later you are falling over, dead.\n\nIn this time frame about 2 minutes have passed, and it was the most intense, realistically worrying experience you've felt ever playing a video game.\n\nSingleplayer is just a ton of fun, using broken generators and artillary barages and planes flying overhead in order to mask your sniper rifle's firing so that the German Afrika Corps soldiers don't realize you're there. Having to figure out the puzzle of who to shoot first and at what point on their patrol so that their buddies don't see the body but also masking the sound of your shot and firing from a position where you aren't visible to enemies. Setting up an ambush with Dynamite and blowing it up to cause mass confusion and win the section of that mission.\nOh, I almost forgot, I spent 3 of these hours on the first mission ALONE. Let alone the countless others to come.\n\nA game has never made my heart race this hard, or keep me entralled in heart startling multiplayer.\nI give it a total of 9.5/10, because third person moving is a painnnnnn in the ♥♥♥. I often find myself using my iron sights to walk through some spots because its like using first person controls","December 29, 2015","true","34.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

This SUX when you've finished everything but the last objective after a 3 hr mission level.\n- It is not Assassin's creed, it is not a close quarters stealth game BUT appears to be. The game actually deviates from previous Sniper Elite games in this regard as more often than not, you'll actually be taking enemies down with your silenced pistol close up.\n- Close quarters is clunky, use silenced pistol instead as NOT ALL situations lend to taking silent take-downs, this is by design and incredibly silly as it's not intuitive.\n- One shot from the sniper gun and the ENTIRE base is almost on you.\n- Far too much emphasis on Sniper gun only, everything and the kitchen sink is thrown into it, other guns' accuracy and damage is purposely kept lower.\n- Far too much emphasis on Headshots to take down, seriously! Come on. Give extra XP for it, Don't make a player shoot twice just cause he hit at the torso.\n- Every mission becomes tediously long of about 3 hrs if you play it slow and hidden in the game.","January 19","true","35.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dpxmsk/recommended/238090/","dpxmsk","DeadPoolX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dpxmsk/","1182 products in account","Sniper Elite 3 (SE3) takes place in Northern Africa, which is a theatre often neglected in WWII games. Usually games focus on the European Theatre (western and/or eastern fronts) and slightly less often, the Pacific Theatre. That's a nice change and presents a locale that hasn't been overused.\n\nSomething I also like about North Africa is that despite it being mostly a rocky desert, there is still plenty of environmental plant life to make the scenary appear not quite as depressing. I remember in Sniper Elite v2 (SEv2) thinking that the constant use of broken and blasted buildings became quite tiring, despite it being accurate for the location.\n\nSE3 brings in slight RPG aspects, in that your equipment has various stats. The rifles in particular are interesting because you can greatly modify them using parts you find as you play. That said, many of the "better" rifles and pistols are only available in DLC packages, but it's entirely possible to play through the whole game and do exceptionally well without ever spending a dime on any DLC.\n\nThe overall game mechanics are similar to SEv2. On easier difficutly levels you don't have to account for gravity (bullet drop) or wind, and pressing the focus button (the default is "E") enhances your zoom and slows down time. You have a limited amount of focus and if you expend it before firing, you'll zoom out and time will resume as normal. Fortunately, focus replenishes by itself.\n\nHead shots are preferable to body shots, although I've managed to kill enemies after hitting them in the leg. You can perforate major blood vessels and organs (seen through an x-ray view when hitting the enemy), which the game acknowledges, but I don't know if that really makes a difference as far as killing them goes. I believe the game really just takes into account general location damage, so a high velocity shot to the abdomen might result in a kill, regardless of it tearing apart the intestines or kidneys.\n\nRemaining undetected is a major part of SE3. You can do this by using your sidearm (assuming you've taken either the Welrod or the HDM, both of which have suppressors attached to them), stabbing an unsuspecting enemy in the back, or using noise to hide your sniper shots. Noise cover can range from artillery fire to PA announcements to sabotaging a generator.\n\nAlthough you have a secondary weapon (which can be anything from a Thompson submachine gun to a Panzerschrek, which is essentially a rocket launcher), using it will undoubtedly cause a ton of noise, thereby attracting scores of enemy soldiers who will overwhelm you on anything except the lowest difficultly level. Even then, it's still fairly easy to die, so it's best to avoid that scenario entirely if at all possible.\n\nUnlike SEv2, enemies DO NOT suddenly pop up out of nowhere. Reinforcements can be called in (usually through scripted events), but you won't have to deal with inching forward after clearing an area only to come upon a soldier who materialized out of thin air.\n\nThe campaign takes place over eight long missions. In contrast to SEv2, which relied entirely on checkpoints, SE3 allows you to save whenever and wherever you wish using manual saves and quicksaves. Some players might find this "cheap" or refer to it as "save scumming," but to me it's simply a matter of convenience, which lets me play for as long or as little as I choose.\n\nMultiplayer takes the form of PvP and PvE Co-op. In PvP multiplayer, you play on a team and fight other players, whereas in PvE Co-op, its you and your teammate against the AI.\n\nIn co-op, you have three choices:\n1. Play through the entire campaign in co-op mode.\n2. Play specific downloaded missions.\n3. Play unique asymetric assignments, where one player has a sniper rifle and a pistol, and the other player has a pistol, secondary weapon (such as an MP-40), and binoculars.\n\nA shooting range has also been added as an extra single player mode, which lets you practice with all the weapons, including explosives.\n\nNo matter how good SE3 is, there are some problems.\n\nWhen playing co-op, the campaign missions only use temporary checkpoint saves (as opposed to the "save anywhere" method in single player), which can make for some exceptionally long game times. These checkpoints only last for the duration of the session, so if you quit, you'll have to start over the beginning of the mission.\n\nThis has been a problem for my wife and me, as although we enjoy SE3, we don't always feel like spending four hours or so on one mission. It would be nice if the game at least saved the progress of the mission on the host's machine and allowed the players to continue where they left off.\n\nThe asymetric missions almost always include a "horde mode" component, where you have to defend against waves upon waves of enemies. In a game like SE3, where stealth and not being noticed is generally considered important, this seems very out-of-place and if you're not ready for it, quite jarring as well.\n\nSomething else that's of general annoyance is the way a weapon's stats are presented. Using a combination of white, yellow, and red bars to denote standard, improved, and reduced stats (when comparing other weapons to your currently armed weapon), understanding the bars can be unclear, at least at first. I would've preferred numbers instead of nondescript bars, but it's not a big deal overall.\n\nIn the end, would I recommend Sniper Elite 3? Absolutely. If you're the least bit interested in playing a sniper and World War II, there's no reason for me to not recommend this game.","February 6","true","77.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

First word, sniper, is very incorrect as you constantly get penalised for using the sniper rifles. Most levels only have two or three areas where noise covers the rifles sound (some levels only have one though, like the kill hitler mission) an these locations are only good for one of two kills before you have to move on. Also to me sniper kind of implies long range kills, like shooting someone several hundred meters away. However my longest kill is around 200 meters which isnt really very far at all. Second word, elite, once again suggests that were in control of a highly skilled soldier. However i seemed to have to play as a soldier who cant run for more than a few meters, seems to have some illness that makes his arms shake/body twitch, and has difficulty shooting a hostile soldier at 10m. How this guy got sniper training is beond me, I guess he found a sniper rifle early in the war and no-one thought to question him having it. The mass inaccuracy of the sidearms is just mind boggling, and i cant believe anyone would be that inept at shooting, military or not.\n\nGameplay wise the game plays like a crap version of metal gear solid. You sneak around a few african locations shooting people at close range with the silenced pistol, the only gun thats sort of usable for the most part of the game. The hostiles dont seem that bothered about you being there and dont seem that bothered about catching you. I dont speak german but im guessing most the germans go 'Oh look, that british sniper shot hans, but i cant see any snipers so i guess things are fine and we should go back to standing around.' The game doesnt even replace fallen guards or raise the alarm on discovery so hiding the bodes is a complete waste of time. When the german soldiers do actually find you, maybe you used your sniper rilfe, bad player your sniper rifle is just too look at, they either telepathically tell everyone where you are leading to the whole base looking for you for a few minutes before deciding you've probably gone home and go back to slacking off. Or they just stare at you for several seconds before raising the alarm, which brings a few soldiers over to have a quick look for you.\n\nTheres a few other things that really bring this game down and the bullet balistics and the kill cam mechanic doesnt really salvage this game. After the first level the game is basically sneak here, then sneak there, then sneak away. With really boring (assassinate the guy in a truck which can basically only be done with mines) or pointless side objectives (disable the spotlights, that you can only disable after sneaking past them) was the final nail in the coffin for me for me.\n\nGame has so many good ideas, but they're just awfully done.","February 13","false","12.6"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","6","12","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dpxmsk/recommended/238090/","dpxmsk","DeadPoolX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dpxmsk/","1182 products in account","Sniper Elite 3 (SE3) takes place in Northern Africa, which is a theatre often neglected in WWII games. Usually games focus on the European Theatre (western and/or eastern fronts) and slightly less often, the Pacific Theatre. That's a nice change and presents a locale that hasn't been overused.\n\nSomething I also like about North Africa is that despite it being mostly a rocky desert, there is still plenty of environmental plant life to make the scenary appear not quite as depressing. I remember in Sniper Elite v2 (SEv2) thinking that the constant use of broken and blasted buildings became quite tiring, despite it being accurate for the location.\n\nSE3 brings in slight RPG aspects, in that your equipment has various stats. The rifles in particular are interesting because you can greatly modify them using parts you find as you play. That said, many of the "better" rifles and pistols are only available in DLC packages, but it's entirely possible to play through the whole game and do exceptionally well without ever spending a dime on any DLC.\n\nThe overall game mechanics are similar to SEv2. On easier difficutly levels you don't have to account for gravity (bullet drop) or wind, and pressing the focus button (the default is "E") enhances your zoom and slows down time. You have a limited amount of focus and if you expend it before firing, you'll zoom out and time will resume as normal. Fortunately, focus replenishes by itself.\n\nHead shots are preferable to body shots, although I've managed to kill enemies after hitting them in the leg. You can perforate major blood vessels and organs (seen through an x-ray view when hitting the enemy), which the game acknowledges, but I don't know if that really makes a difference as far as killing them goes. I believe the game really just takes into account general location damage, so a high velocity shot to the abdomen might result in a kill, regardless of it tearing apart the intestines or kidneys.\n\nRemaining undetected is a major part of SE3. You can do this by using your sidearm (assuming you've taken either the Welrod or the HDM, both of which have suppressors attached to them), stabbing an unsuspecting enemy in the back, or using noise to hide your sniper shots. Noise cover can range from artillery fire to PA announcements to sabotaging a generator.\n\nAlthough you have a secondary weapon (which can be anything from a Thompson submachine gun to a Panzerschrek, which is essentially a rocket launcher), using it will undoubtedly cause a ton of noise, thereby attracting scores of enemy soldiers who will overwhelm you on anything except the lowest difficultly level. Even then, it's still fairly easy to die, so it's best to avoid that scenario entirely if at all possible.\n\nUnlike SEv2, enemies DO NOT suddenly pop up out of nowhere. Reinforcements can be called in (usually through scripted events), but you won't have to deal with inching forward after clearing an area only to come upon a soldier who materialized out of thin air.\n\nThe campaign takes place over eight long missions. In contrast to SEv2, which relied entirely on checkpoints, SE3 allows you to save whenever and wherever you wish using manual saves and quicksaves. Some players might find this "cheap" or refer to it as "save scumming," but to me it's simply a matter of convenience, which lets me play for as long or as little as I choose.\n\nMultiplayer takes the form of PvP and PvE Co-op. In PvP multiplayer, you play on a team and fight other players, whereas in PvE Co-op, its you and your teammate against the AI.\n\nIn co-op, you have three choices:\n1. Play through the entire campaign in co-op mode.\n2. Play specific downloaded missions.\n3. Play unique asymetric assignments, where one player has a sniper rifle and a pistol, and the other player has a pistol, secondary weapon (such as an MP-40), and binoculars.\n\nA shooting range has also been added as an extra single player mode, which lets you practice with all the weapons, including explosives.\n\nNo matter how good SE3 is, there are some problems.\n\nWhen playing co-op, the campaign missions only use temporary checkpoint saves (as opposed to the "save anywhere" method in single player), which can make for some exceptionally long game times. These checkpoints only last for the duration of the session, so if you quit, you'll have to start over the beginning of the mission.\n\nThis has been a problem for my wife and me, as although we enjoy SE3, we don't always feel like spending four hours or so on one mission. It would be nice if the game at least saved the progress of the mission on the host's machine and allowed the players to continue where they left off.\n\nThe asymetric missions almost always include a "horde mode" component, where you have to defend against waves upon waves of enemies. In a game like SE3, where stealth and not being noticed is generally considered important, this seems very out-of-place and if you're not ready for it, quite jarring as well.\n\nSomething else that's of general annoyance is the way a weapon's stats are presented. Using a combination of white, yellow, and red bars to denote standard, improved, and reduced stats (when comparing other weapons to your currently armed weapon), understanding the bars can be unclear, at least at first. I would've preferred numbers instead of nondescript bars, but it's not a big deal overall.\n\nIn the end, would I recommend Sniper Elite 3? Absolutely.

That was an excelent game, 10/10. However, this installment in the series is just garbage.\n\nFirstly, the amount of glitches and bugs present is ridiculous. For a polished game, especially after the non-glitched Sniper Elite v2, there are too many bugs (and very serious ones too) and don't seem like they are ever going to be fixed by the devs. Ex: I was mid-bullet cam (a quarter of the way through my first mission) and my game crashed, I had to quit it and restart the game. Another serious bug is when I beat the first mission only to proceed to the main menu and it saying that I haven't beat the first mission and I must restart it.\n\nAside from the bugs and glitches, it is basically like Sniper Elite v2 but in a different environment, oh and I should mention that the environment is WAY TOO BRIGHT. Even if you turn down the gamma, the reflection of the world and brightness of the terrain is blinding, that is not realistic and extremely annoying after a while.\n\nThere are, essentially, the same amount of guns, slightly more equipment; and the sound effects of weapons, germans, and the environment, are exactly the same. You can "customize" your rifle...but changing the reticle and material of the scope is not full customization.\n\nAlso, long range sniping (like the second game) is barely present. The game is mostly close-quarters so you don't have much breathing room to stop and make a shot at a far distanced enemy. Snipers are meant to fire from long distances, not 5 feet away from the enemy.\n\nOn the pleasent side, the multiplayer experience is fun, and the survival mode is alright. The bullet cam hasn't changed too much but it is still exciting to watch a bullet rip through a German soldier's nutsack. There is bountiful amount of enemies in a mission so you can just keep picking off those damn Nazi soldiers until you have had your killing fix. I can't think of any more good qualities of the game.\n\nSo with everything (or what I can think of) said, I unfortunatelly cannot recommend Sniper Elite 3. I paid $21 on sale (for the game+season pass) which I regret. I'm trying to save you from spending your money on this let-down failure of a game. You can watch videos and read other reviews and I gaurentee you that most of them are negative towards this game.\n\nRating? 5/10\n\nNote: My edits (or updates) were just grammar corrections.","October 4, 2015","false","5.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

Can't wait for one person to comment "well it is a sniper game, what do you expect?" answer to that: fun gameplay that does not consist of waiting around for seeing a scope glint or seeing something move in the distance after looking out for 3 minutes, which is sometimes very painful to do... thanks to the weird graphical bugs going on with this title, i.e. shadows popping over and under foliage/trees, objects disappearing and fading back in, objects flickering in the distance etc...\n\nWhat else is there to say... ah, yes: If this game did not have cooperative campaign mode it would not be in my possession in the first place, that is literally the only saving grace for this title.\nhowever after this title I am convinced that I won't touch any game anymore that has Rebellion listed as a developer, unless they release like an absolute masterpiece which would actually have responsive and snappy controls.\nCampaign boils down to: shoot twice, move out of the area "which they elegantly call RELOCATING" and move back to the same spot when, for some reason, all the soldiers calmed down again. Rinse & repeat.\n\nReally dull game, no fun mechanics, shooting feels awkward and not satisfying either, thanks to the mouse control problems going on. Pretty funny paradox actually, you create a game where your aim, reaction time and positional prediction/knowing how fast your bullet travels is your skill, YET you fail to make the controls feel snappy and responsive, rather the opposite of that, which almost totally eliminates aim and reaction time... so yeah, not a good game. barely decent, and not even worth half the asking price imvho.\n\np.s.: weapon sounds and secondary/tertiary weapon spread behaviour are copied & pasted from Sniper Elite V2, you might just as well go play that.\n\n\n\nTL;DR: No. The biggest fun you can have in this game is shooting some guy's balls off.","July 5, 2014","false","23.4"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","11","23","0","1"

I expected twice as much or more.  Weapons customization is a neat feature but nothing spectacular to be honest, maps are VERY open which is a plus multiple ways to get round enemies hell you can go through missions without being seen or killing unless instructed too.  The "bullet time" effect is still there and worth watching when you put out a long range shot into someone's testicles.\n\nAI is just as garbage as it was in previous versions wasn't improved on at all.  The stealth takedowns are pretty poor, a neck snap and a few knife stabs to throat.  It's not a improvement on v2 that's for sure, v2.5 if that.

Although the content is basically only aesthetic (in my opinion, the DLC weapons provide little change in gameplay) it still makes me furious. This is content that could have been included into standalone game!\n\n\nTL;DR - Sniper Elite 3 is an excellent sequel to Sniper Elite V2 and provides several new features that make the game more enjoyable than the last, HOWEVER I CAN NOT AND WILL NOT RECOMMEND IT simply to reflect my disappointment that the game was realeased with $25 worth of downloadable content.

Objects such as ammo caches being present but not visible (still usable though). Grey aiming indicator suggesting that there is an obstruction between me and my target when there clearly is not. Invisible walls. Clunky movement in 3rd person. Graphics dont load as quickly as they should when you change from looking at something far away to something much closer (see wolfenstein the new order). A dreadfully small selection of weapons and maps (roughly 4 snipers, 4 side arms and about 6 MP maps). Dont even get me started on the fact that you have to buy DLC to add more weapons. The campaign is a bit short in my opinion. They have completely overdone the xray bullet cams. Almost every single kill you make with a sniper activates it, it is difficult to build up any momentum in the SP when literally every time you shoot somebody you have to endure 3 - 5 second slow mo animation of your kill.\n\nOn the bright side though, you can shoot peoples testicles off.","July 8, 2014","false","24.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

No free movement.\n- 99% of the fights take place in almost cqb (50m). That is not sniping!\n- DCLs (= Did not finish game / want more money).

The whole X-ray cam on snipe hit is awesome, but it gets old fast.  The rest of the game is like an advanced version of whack a mole. Enemy pops up, shoot, move to next position, repeat untill next objective, do that for the next couple hours and the game is over.\n\nEnemies patrol faster then you can really set up a viable trap, if you try to trigger them to go through it by alarming them they rarely go very far from their patrol pattern so your lucky if you can get a kill that way. If you play on hardest difficulty, you will find it isn't a challenge, but more of a guessing game where your bullets will go, as the game gives no clue where the drift will be, a guess to how far the enemy is, and finding where a missed bullet even went can be tricky.\n\nOn top of all this, the game is designed focusing on stealth and tactics, but you will find there is not only no motivation in a lot of parts to be stealthy, it is actually easier just to run in guns blazing, and there is no reprecussions to that as the game has absolutely no reward for being stealthy, other then to add hours onto game play of watching your guy crawl through areas of the map.","April 15, 2015","false","3.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I played V2 through 3 times on the PS3, bought the zombies army 2 game for PC and played through solo and with a buddy, all of which was fun fun fun.\n\nSadly, this new incarnation is a real let down for me.  It just feels so lazily thrown together, it's lacking any atmosphere, there's no tension at all and it's SO SO SO very easy.  Even on the hardest settings it's a piece of ♥♥♥♥, and offers little to no satisfaction for any effort you put in.\n\nA highly uninspiring game that feels like Rebellion just copped out and cashed in on the popularity of previous titles.  Such a shame.  As a fan of the franchise I'm frankly gutted.\n\nThe so many DLC guns which add nothing of any importance, make no differnce to gameplay, and apears to be shameless profiteering.  I'm baffled as to how so many people are recommending this, it's really below par.\n\nJust a quick edit to clarify something to those who think a 200m shot is some kind of achievment with a sniper rifle...  Standard military engagement training with a standard rifle is 300m, but can achieve acuracy up to 800m with marksman sights.  M16A2 and an M1 Garand can both be fired accurately up to 500m.  Engagement distances of rifles haven't changed much at all since WW1... Though modern 'sniping' is done mostly at closer ranges due to visibility (or lack thereof), for a game going by the name 'sniper elite' I really wanted to see the opportunity for shots at over 800m.  The all new amazing awesome open maps, however... fail to present such options.\n\n3.5/10","February 6, 2015","false","13.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I played V2 through 3 times on the PS3, bought the zombies army 2 game for PC and played through solo and with a buddy, all of which was fun fun fun.\n\nSadly, this new incarnation is a real let down for me.  It just feels so lazily thrown together, it's lacking any atmosphere, there's no tension at all and it's SO SO SO very easy.  Even on the hardest settings it's a piece of ♥♥♥♥, and offers little to no satisfaction for any effort you put in.\n\nA highly uninspiring game that feels like Rebellion just copped out and cashed in on the popularity of previous titles.  Such a shame.  As a fan of the franchise I'm frankly gutted.\n\nThe so many DLC guns which add nothing of any importance, make no differnce to gameplay, and apears to be shameless profiteering.  I'm baffled as to how so many people are recommending this, it's really below par.\n\nJust a quick edit to clarify something to those who think a 200m shot is some kind of achievment with a sniper rifle...  Standard military engagement training with a standard rifle is 300m, but can achieve acuracy up to 800m with marksman sights.  M16A2 and an M1 Garand can both be fired accurately up to 500m.  Engagement distances of rifles haven't changed much at all since WW1... Though modern 'sniping' is done mostly at closer ranges due to visibility (or lack thereof), for a game going by the name 'sniper elite' I really wanted to see the opportunity for shots at over 800m.  The all new amazing awesome open maps, however... fail to present such options.\n\n3.5/10","February 6, 2015","false","13.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The Levals are quite long so it keeps you going for a while. Its more about sniping than gun fights with automatic rifles and is more challenging than V2. Also you chose what way you go, theres no certain path like in V2.\n\nAlthough, there are a few things that Rebellion need to work on for their next game and that would be:\n1. please put more levels in.\n2.put more wepons in the game for the price we payed for the game.\n3. allow costum change in campaign\n4. customisation of all guns\n\nbut in all i think that this game was overall a pretty good game but needs further development","September 5, 2014","true","71.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Sniper Elite 2 was much better, but in all honesty that isn't saying much. The following reasons are why this game is terrible and should not be purchased, or redeemed for free as I have.\n\n1. Broken movement mechanics: There is horrible mouse acceleration which cannot be adjusted and makes movement very difficutl.\n2. Broken Shooting mechanics. I play on Sniper Elite mode as well as realist mode. Aiming over a targets head and compensating for bullet drop was not consistant. Slightly shooting over their head then compensating by a little made me shoot the target in the lower chest or pevlis on many occasions. Bullet mechanic are broken.\n3. Beyond repetative. Increadable linear battlefield. Terrible AI. Increase in difficult turns up the speed of the AI aimbot.\n\nThe Positive: Xray vision on shooting people is a cool and enjoyable aspect. For about 30 minutes. And Since Sniper Elite 2 has the exact same Xray, set in the European Theater, with much less buddy mechanics. That is the game you should choose if you want to just destroy people with xray bullet cams.\n\nI will try to suffer through a few hours of gameplay just to make this review more respectable.","December 3, 2014","false","2.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

With every iteration of the game they seem to make improvements.  However, the game can be a bit short if you play it on easier difficulty settings.  Ramp up the difficulty settings and attempt to play through the missions completely stealth and you'll see a much longer play through.\n\nI LOVE LOVE LOVE that they added the full on co-op, play this with a friend and you won't be disappointed in the fun you'll have.  Using Steam to connect with friends and play co-op is a breeze! I had no disconnect issues, no lag, and no fuss with playing co-op unlike many titles where you can spend hours forwarding ports, etc.\n\nIf you are looking for some competitive play I really wouldn't recommend this title though. The regular VS multiplayer was uninspired and boring and I don't recommend it for that.  It quickly devolves into hiding behind cover and firing wildly at people when you see them; basically a big camping game.  It would have been nice for them to add some objectives to complete or some incentive to move about the map.\n\nThe graphics seem to be improved from the previous games.  The game runs extremely smoothly on my computer and loads lightening quick.  I haven't had any issues with game crashing or major bugs.  One issue is sometimes "invisible" cover will block your shot if you try to fire too closely to it resulting in a shot that should have hit, but doesn't.  It isn't perfect, but I still highly recommend this game if you enjoy sniping games and co-op!","July 1, 2014","true","15.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Stinks of console porting. E.g. 3rd person view only, and it's very sloppy. The most annoying thing is one cannot move just a little (1 pixel? :) anywhere, as character starts turning and moving on any key action. Looking around is the same, no jumping, "action button" instead for climbing ladders and jump over obstacles, etc, etc - the whole game smells like controller monkeys, really... which is weird from a game expecting one to move and fire precisely...\n(To say it funny, this is kind of an insult to anyone from the PC Master Race).\n\n2. Pay DLCs. As of review, 13(!) already, with a 68 EUR full price. I hate ripoff. DLCs are disgusting and it's a huge disappointment towards anyone using this weapon against players who actually like their game... It's OK-ish for extra content, like new maps&missions&whatever, but for rifles and camo packs?! C'mon ladies...\n\n3. Not that critical but annoying bugs. The worst one is, when one turns off "mouse acceleration". That kills the idea of looking around with the mouse and makes targeting with the rifle a nightmare (keeping on: you try turning around too quickly, and lose tracking motion, so you don't know where you are looking at, as it goes too fast for the eye to process; see point #1 for most probable reason), the other annoying one is pixel-hunting fails: the "hold breath action" reports one will hit (red, and not grayed target point) but still not hitting, bullet bumps into something.\n\n4. Scope cannot be set. No knobs to set the zero of the cross hair, so scope decides where the zero is, as rifle decides how scaling goes. This is very stupid for a sniper game... One has to learn both the rifle AND the scope.\nE.g. in case of Garand (with default scope) half below where zero point should be == point blank to 50meters; 2/3 below zero == 100m; 1 bar == 150m; 2.5 bars == 200m. Instead of setting my zero with knobs on the scope, then learn the rifle, and the rifle only...\n\n5. Not enough ammo for the submachine gun. OK, this is just for fun stuff, but if I happen to get bored with sneaking, sniping and knifing around, it would be fun to gun down the mobs FPS style. Well, good luck with 3 magazines. One runs dry in no time and mobs for some weird reason have just about 2-5 bullets (and not magazines) on them...","March 7, 2015","true","6.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

I found it highly enjoyable and well worth the price, a big improvement over the first and second titles.\n\nThe good:\n\nThe game looks great.  Polished visuals throughout.\nA wide range of difficulty options and optional objectives lets you make the game as hard as you like.\nMore than long enough, especially with the DLC.\nOpen-ish gameplay with optional objectives, collectibles, and a little bit of upgrading and customization.\nHistorically accurate (mostly) settings and hardware.\nA gruesome bullet cam which can be turned up, down, or off in frequency and grotesque-ness.\n\n\nThe bad:\n\nBarely any story, and not much in the way of good storytelling.\nA stealth system which is tempting to exploit, running away from the place from which you last shot to get "stealthed," then going right back to shoot again.\nDespite a wide range of weapons, there is a clear winner in each category (primary, secondary, sidearm), regardless of playstyle.  For example, there's no reason to use any of the non-suppressed sidearms.","March 6, 2015","true","32.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I'm not the kind of patient player, i'm head out first in the action but i really enjoyed this game and it is my favourite for PC.\nThe only bad experience with this game is the fact that i've encountered a few cheating players on multiplayer servers, wallhaking to be more specific.

The realism is mainly present in the shooting physics - it doesn't really simulate how snipers actually operate because that probably wouldn't be as fun as what this game provides.\n\nThe best feature, in my opinion, is the consistently fun and non-frustrating gameplay, which persists despite difficult-to-master mechanics. This comes from the nice save system and forgiving stealth mechanics. Being able to quick-save really changes the fun of this game, in my opinion. Instead of what happens in other stealth games where you make a mistake, everyone gets alerted, then you have to open up a menu, sit through a long loading screen, and start at the beginning of the level, you get an quick-save button which saves while you continue playing, so you can always save before you try something risky and just focus on the fun sniping mechanics and visuals. Also, one of the other problems that can happen in a lot of stealth games is that it's hard to keep track of your surroundings, so somebody might see you but you won't realize it until it's too late. This game provides subtle audio-cues and less subtle visual cues to let you know when you are about to be spotted.\n\nYou might think that the aforementioned features make the game too easy or too simple, but I think it just lets you focus on what this game does best - being stealthy and sniping people.\n\nIf you really like sniping in other FPS games (the feel of precision and power), you'll definitely like this game because it focuses on that one aspect of FPS. If you're concerned about having to spend more time sneaking around than shooting, you're in luck because even though you might alert everyone and have them go aggressive, you can still clear levels just by running and gunning and shooting everyone in sight.\n\nSo, overall, I think this game is pretty fun.","March 1, 2015","true","10.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"
