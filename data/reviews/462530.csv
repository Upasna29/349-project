Anytime I look at a character (especially in boxing), my PC goes into constant reprojection (45 fps).  It even sometimes can't keep up with reprojection and drops frames even then.\n\nAnything you can do to lower the poly count of the captures models?  I understand you're using ray-traced data, but my card simply can't keep up.\n\nFix the performance issues, add some additional characters and content, and I'll definitely reconsider!","May 3","false","0.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","2"

It's not bad, but it's also not really that great, and the characters tend to have minor graphical glitches and white borders that make the scenes look more like you're living in one of those old FMV-based point-and-click adventures instead of a real world. It's free, so if you're curious you may as well try it, but it's a pretty big download so it's hard to say if it's worth the time to download it, depending on how interested you are in the technology and seeing a glimpse of something that might be more worthwhile in the future. I'm only rating it positive because there's no neutral option and I'd feel bad if I gave it a thumbs down.","April 28","true","0.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

Must have taken a lot of time to make all those videogrammetry scenes. I'm guessing the bad reviews are from Oculus owners as this works great on the HTC vive.\nI only noticed some stuttering in the boxing demo, all the rest worked fine.\nedit: also downloaded the player from the 8i website, with other videogrammetry models.\nWonder why they didn't include those in the steam version, or add a download option.

And this is free\n\nSome bad points..\n\nThe models up close are very low res and are some of the textures especially on the mountain and the greenscreen for the actors was a little bad and very bad for the mountain scene as times part of the guy was going crazy..\nNow if this was a first time this had been tried id be alot more forgiven but ive seen stuff like this done before like for the film Insidious and that was amazing...\n\nIn a nutshell its not bad and its free so its worth a try especially if you having experienced something like this in vr before but if you have you will be dissapointed with this.. Finally this maybe a new company/developer trying something new and for that i give them credit and hope they continue becouse this stuff has potential so with all that said i would recommend this","April 26","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cheeeezy/recommended/462530/","cheeeezy","Fogwalker","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cheeeezy/","213 products in account","It is a interesting demo, but in its current state using point clouds to make the 3d objects the disk usage is absolutely massive. There must be a way to average out the point cloud data to really cut down on the space used.\n\nAs well it is always good to put in the ability to control a demo with things that you know all users will have like a keyboard and mouse in worst case scenario. Just my opinion but people will get frustrated if they cannot use the menu because of your hardware support choices.\n\nAs it stands it is a interesting tech demo although in its current state I am not sure what it would be used for. I cannot really imagine using it in lot of games and a solid model would work just as well and be easier to work with. And the file size would cripple it for larger videos. I imagine if they can get the data size required on the users computer down this could be interesting.\n\nDownload this just for curiousity there is not a lot here.","May 2","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And when you get it, it's mostly some *very* cheesy actors with some interesting scanning that looks like multiple Kinect devices were used, but the overall effect isn't that good.  At all.\n\nIt's also worth noting that this is pretty CPU heavy.  I have an i5-4670k and a 980Ti and it stutters like a champ in places.\n\nIt's an interesting point-of-concept, but honestly I think you get a better understanding of what a good narrative could be by watching The Rose and I or The Diveregent Series (although the actors are equally cheesy!)","April 29","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm pretty disappointed this is getting low reviews as I think people are failing to appreciate what sets this apart from most other media in VR right now. 3D captured live performances in an impressive feat that will absolutely blow 360 videos away in the future. This may be a little blurry and rough around the edges now but it is a clear path to the awesome things we can expect in the future of VR.

This is just a tech demo, but if you're interested in computer graphics it's worth checking out. There's no gameplay - just a few minutes of character animation and dialogue.\n\nMost other reviews mention the performance. It's worth noting that the performance is fine in the first 2 out of 4 demos - only the last 2 demos have issues.
