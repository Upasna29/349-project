The game’s best attribute is definitely its innovative feel (even though it borrows heavily from Guitar Hero and the like);  and I also thought the soundtrack was pretty enjoyable.   Unfortunately, many of the other areas of the game are somewhat lacking.\n\nThere is a story and there are cutscenes; some of it is OK and mildly amusing, some of it is cringe-worthy.  I wonder if perhaps the game would have been better off without any of that.  However, the game is already incredibly short, so I suppose the story helps to add a little fluff.  There are only 9 songs in the campaign, and even on the hardest difficulty available it shouldn’t take that long to learn them and to beat them.  Then there are also a small handful of bonus songs to unlock in the “arena” mode, but it remains a rather short game.  There is, however, a score system, so there is some incentive to replay levels to try to better your score.\n\nThe heart and soul of the game is in the gameplay and the music.  The central mechanic of the gameplay is quite novel and I found it to be quite refreshing to play something a little bit different.  The main way to play is to use your keyboard to strike keys as the notes move across the screen, in a very similar fashion to Guitar Hero.  I found this to be challenging and wildly fun.  If you find yourself getting your fingers mixed up too much, you can also use the mouse to simply click the notes.  This will make the game marginally easier, but (in my opinion) also a little less fun.\n\nAs for the music: I enjoyed the soundtrack very much.  I even caught myself humming some of the songs in the shower and the car.  When you own the game on Steam, you get a complimentary OST in the “music” tab of your library, so you can listen to the songs through Steam even without the game running.\n\nFrederic: Resurrection of Music could use work in some other areas, certainly, but I felt the fresh gameplay and nice soundscape were more than enough to create an enjoyable experience— albeit a short one.  I highly recommend this game for anyone who is thirsting to play something that is a little different and innovative.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","July 2, 2015","true","6.9"," 47 of 51 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","47","51","3","0"

He's been referenced and even starred in multiple video games in the past, and Resurrection of Music is the latest in that trend. It's probably the best fit, being a rhythm game full of imagination and heart. This is an easy recommendation to anyone who enjoys music.\n\nIn Frederic: RoM you play as Chopin himself, recently raised from the dead, and musically battle other musicians across the globe. Armed with nothing but a magical piano, it is up to you to show that you are still relevant in an age of Auto Tuners, Synthesizers, and Pro Tools.\n\nThe soul of this game is in the music, which is fantastic. A selection of Chopin's own works are remixed to fit the theme of several countries as you fight for global domination. Forever Entertainment has shown great care and creativity in the construction of these songs. Frederic's compositions ring through beautifully, which is a testament to their ability, considering how easily they could have ruined these amazing pieces. Rhythm games are only as good as the music they include, and with so many of them asking the player to provide their own songs these days, it's nice to see a developer actually take the time to hand-craft original tracks. Each song is not only fun to play, but catchy, enjoyable, and memorable as well. The soundtrack comes with the game when you purchase it through Steam, making the price tag all the more worth it.\n\nThe gameplay is easy to pick up if you've ever played a rhythm game before. Hit the keys when the notes pass over them. The closer to accurate the timing, the more points you receive. Once you get a combo going, you can pick up bonus points for hitting random keys on the keyboard, and even utilize a musical attack to mess with your opponents. While it's not very deep, it's a blast to play, and you'll feel like a true pianist as you do. Who doesn't want to feel like Chopin?\n\nWhile you duke it out with these other musicians, colorful and silly animations play out in front of you, themed to the country, just like the music. They can be very distracting, adding to the difficulty of the duels, but are entertaining in their own right. Sometimes the caricatures and parodies can border on offensive, but they are all in good fun, and people are too easily offended these days anyway.\n\nThere is a story here that plays out in animated scenes in-between battles, but it is told horrendously with some of the worst voice acting you'll ever experience in this lifetime. That being said, this is a rhythm game, and who plays rhythm games for the story? You can easily skip these sequences and you won't miss anything important.\n\nWhat else is there to say? Frederic: RoM is a fantastic experience that should not be missed. There is a sequel called Frederic: Evil Strikes Back, so be sure to check out my review on that game as well. If you enjoy this game, and want to learn more about Chopin, be sure to check out a game called Eternal Sonata, or Trusty Bell depending on your region. You won't be disappointed.","November 18, 2014","true","10.4"," 37 of 41 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","37","41","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/charkie/recommended/301190/","charkie","Charkie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/charkie/","1425 products in account","BEFORE YOU POINT OUT MY TIME PLAYED: I've played much more of this game on a tablet. My review for the PC version will be based on the difference in playability between the two. I've played enough to come to a conclusion about that.\n\nFrederic: Resurrection of Music is a rhythm game where you catch falling notes onto piano keys at the bottom of the screen. Think of Beatmania without the turn table, and you've basically got it. The timing for a perfect hit takes a little getting used to, because it's relative to the center of the actual key on the piano itself. Since a black key is much shorter than a white key, a perfect hit on a black note will be higher up on the board than a white note. Otherwise it's fairly simple, with normal notes, hold notes, and swipe notes where you move across as you hit a key (more on that later). The note patterns are fairly good, and fit the pace of the songs. The music is all Chopin compositions redone in various contemporary music styles. The songs are...alright. The western themed one is pretty terrible, but they're all still recognizable as Chopin. It's also worth saying that the story is absolutely insane. Nothing makes sense and it's pretty great.\n\nFirst and foremost, this is a game meant for tablets. There have been tablet games that have made the jump to steam with varying amounts of success, but Frederic is absolutely designed for a multitouch screen. Before you even boot the game up, it asks if you want to launch the touchscreen version instead. To get around most people not being able to touch their monitors to make things happen, you're given two other control styles that you can mix and match as you want; keyboard and mouse. Keyboard sounds like it would make sense, since you're emulating touching keys on a piano, but it never actually feels right. You can reconfigure the keys to anything you want (except for the space bar, which is reserved for using a special move), but it's still just not a very natural feel. You could probably get somewhat used to it with enough times, but remember, the timing on a perfect black note is different than a perfect white note. So, every other finger has to hit a note slightly earlier than the others.\n\nRemember how I mentioned slide notes? They're meant for you to touch the key and then swipe your finger across the piano. You can't do this with a keyboard, naturally, so those are some points you're just not going to be able to get. Now, you can use a mouse instead and just click the keys, which will allow you to hit slide notes. But then you have some hold notes that continue as other notes are coming down, since it was made with multitouch in mind, which makes the mouse not ideal for that situation. Then there are bonus golden notes that fly up from the piano for extra points. On the tablet, you just tap the note to get them. On the PC, you could click on it with the mouse, but if you're using the mouse to play then you're probably too busy hitting other notes or holding a hold note to go click it. You can also collect those notes by pressing a key on the keyboard, but that key is random each time. So have fun with that.\n\nIf you have a tablet or a good phone, I would definitely recommend getting Frederic there if you're a rhythm game fan. It's definitely the way the game is meant to be played and works just fine there. There are two bonus levels in that version that are locked behind DLC (as opposed to this Steam version which has them for free as unlockables), but the bonus levels only cost a dollar total and the base game itself is $2. It's the way the game was meant to be played, and you're just going to get a subpar and sometimes frustrating experience on the PC.\n\nNow, there are two reasons why you might actually want to get the Steam version. If you DO have a touchscreen of some sort for your computer (or if you're using a Surface or something), then you can play the game the way it's supposed to be played and it will work just fine. You would be paying $3 more compared to an app store version, but you do get the soundtrack as an extra if you really want that. The other reason may be if you have a Beatmania controller you can plug into your computer. The keys on the controller match up to the keys in game, so that might actually be kinda cool. Unfortunately, you still won't be able to do slide notes, and unless you play it one handed you're definitely not going to get any bonus gold notes. It's enough of a novelty though that it might be worth playing with.\n\nIf neither of these conditions apply to you, then don't bother getting Frederic on Steam. It's just not the way this game is supposed to be played.","July 14, 2014","false","2.5"," 77 of 106 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","77","106","0","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jadarma/recommended/301190/","Jadarma","Jadarma","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jadarma/","267 products in account","OverviewFrederic: Resurrection of Music is a rhythm game in the tone of Guitar Hero, but you play a piano instead. You are the reanimated corpse of the famous composer Frederic Chopin and you travel around the world having musical duels with stereotyped characters and did I mention remixed music?\n\nThe Pros:Fun Story and Cutscenes - The game features a bit over an hour of cutscenes as you progress through the story and encounter all sorts of musicians. The animations are choppy and the voice acting amateurish, but the end result is fun, enjoyable and very stereotypical. Don't expect this game to be serious, 'cause it's not - and that's great!\n\nGreat Music! - The most important aspect of a rhythm game is the music, and Frederic doesn't disappoint! There are a total of 12 tracks you can play - 9 story related and 3 bonus. All of them are reinterpretations of the original Chopin's plays, but in contemporaneous styles: electro, reggae, country, R&B, you name it. The sound quality is also superb and the music is very catchy.\n\nComplimentary and DRM-Free OST - The game gives you the tracks in the game for free as high bit-rate MP3 files, so you can listen to them anytime, anywhere. A good gesture from the developers! Kudos!\n\nGameplay Choices - The game lets you choose whether to play this game using the keyboard or the touchscreen! That's right! Native touchscreen support for the tablet users who want to be the next virtuoso! For the majority of us who will use the keyboard anyways, it's still very enjoyable, and as a pro-tip from me, change the controls from AWSEDRF to ZSXDCFV. The new spacing of the keys resembles much better with piano keys, so you accidentally press the wrong button much less often.\nThe Cons:Moderate learning curve. - The songs are relatively very easy, and the songs are repeated segments that you will most likely have in muscle memory by your second playthrough. At first, however, it seems really hard, especially with the default controls, but after you play it for a while it will come to you.\n\nLevel Rating System - I have no idea what the game wants from you when it gives you the stars at the end of the level. I found myself ending up with one star despite having a 98% accuracy.\n\nAlmost no difference between difficulties - There are four difficulty steps: Too Easy, Normal, Hard, Chopin. The last two have a negligibly small amount of extra notes compared to the others, and the only real difference between them is the number of points you get for hitting the notes and the amount of notes you are allowed to miss, as the harder the difficulty, the more notes it takes to fill the progress bar and the more it will decrease when failing to press a note. On Chopin, you are expected to have a 90-95% hit rate to pass, which is not hard after you get used to it.\nConclusion:This game is a good rhythm game, albeit short, but features original, awesome music and an interesting concept. Recommended for those who like remixes and comedy indie games.\n\nIf you enjoyed this review and want to see more of my work, consider joining my group and follow my curator page!

I found myself drawing many parellels between this game and Elite Beat Agents, and as you can tell from my user name, that is a definite plus. The cut scenes are wonderfully drawn in comic book style and have an offbeat, often satirical sense of humor, and the story is just as fun as the gameplay (I used a mouse to play, personally, as I found it easier than keyboard controls, no matter how many times I changed the default layout. That said, I can see where this game would fare much better on a touchscreen or tablet, and it does, in fact, have touchscreen capabilities). Even during the gameplay, which has a sort of Dance Dance Revolution feel to it in terms of layout but are hilariously set up like "battles", if you dare take your eyes off the notes for a moment, you'll notice many crazy and entertaining things going on in the background.\n\nBest of all, and perhaps the most important part of any music game, is the music itself. As the title and description implies, the hero is the composer Frederic Chopin, revived in the modern world for reasons unknown to him and finding himself confronting many people with different musical styles. For each confrontation, the music is a piece by Chopin, masterfully remixed into the style of both the region and the type of musician you're facing in the level. From mellow reggae to exciting wild western; from Celtic dance to my personal favorite, a hip-hop inspired track that manages to be haunting at the same time, you've never heard Chopin like this, and you likely never will again. And fortunately, the soundtrack is included with the game itself, no strings attached. So do yourself a favor and give this one a try. Even if you find yourself disliking the actual game, the price is well worth it for the soundtrack alone.","June 22, 2014","true","4.7"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

Both "Frederic" games' control scheme, both on PC and on touchscreen, is just too cluttered to be understandable. It's to easy to get the order of the notes mixed up. Not to mention that it's extremely uncomfortable to have your hand in this position. The fact that I'm someone who's familiar with keyboard instruments may have something to do with the controls bothering me, making them unnatural and confusing. Also, like all rhythm games, during a song will come a moment where what is heard and what is played has nothing to do with reality, which will also irritate and confuse musicians. Beyond that, the soundtrack is not at all anythign spectacular. Most remixes tend to simplify the originals in attempts to modernise them. As a fan of rhythm games and a musician, I can't recommend this. It's confusing in design and sometimes wrong in sound. However, this is absolutely subjective, so I would recommend trying "Frederic" out. The premise is fun and there are a few moments worth your while, if you manage to get over everything I've said. If you think that the above mentioned things would not bother you - enjoy being the resurected and modern version of one of the best composers the classical era has to offer.","January 1","false","0.1"," 24 of 34 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","24","34","0","1"

Well, this was something that caught my interest at that point. After watching some videos, I gave it a chance.\n\nThere isn't much of a plot there. Frederic Chopin rises from the dead and he needs to find out about identity of a mysterious guy who wants to beat him. The story is pretty flat, in fact but this is more like an arcade game that a story game.\n\nThere's a limited amount of tracks to play, however four difficulty modes. It may sound boring but what makes it exciting is the ability to challenge yourself. It's pretty hard to get to three stars rating even in 'too easy' mode.\n\nWhat's pretty interesting is how the music and mechanism is made. It looks like there's a bunch (or at least one) pianist down there in the software development team. If you've ever played Chopin on the piano, you'll get what I mean once you play the game.\n\nSome people complained about controls. I don't find it very hard. What can be confusing at first is that if you're used to the piano, you feel frustrated with no black keys, which are obviously situated above the white ones on the piano's keyboard. But it's not something you can't live. You'll get used to it at the end anyway.\n\nThe game is addictive. I tried once and I keep returning. Probably my return rates will fade out with time but the game has this "something" any decent game needs and I'm pretty sure of it.

The variation of Chopin's music in different styles, including Irish, rock, and others, is an absolute delight to listen to. The music alone is worth the price of admission as far as I'm concerned, and there are several of Chopin's best pieces to perform. The minor issues include mostly bad voice acting, especially that of Chopin, and *really* long (but thankfully skippable) cutscenes.\n\nThey can easily be ignored; however, I have to recommend this game primarily to people who have touchscreen PCs or laptops. As an amateur keyboardist, I found it very difficult to come up with a PC keyboard layout that was comfortable for me. Admittedly, you might find something better for you. But the game felt far, far more natural when I played it on my touchscreen laptop. (The game has its roots in the tablet arena, so this isn't totally unexpected.) It was much more enjoyable to play, and I had a lot more fun with this game than I expected I would, especially after getting frustrated with the PC keyboard.\n\nSo, if you own a touchscreen laptop or Windows tablet, I absolutely recommend this game, especially for the price. Just don't expect the best voice acting out there and get ready to skip cutscenes.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dronak/recommended/301190/","dronak","Dronak","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dronak/","2192 products in account","This is an enjoyable music rhythm game:  think of DDR for your fingers, which is what Flash Flash Revolution is BTW. but with 7 notes and keys in a piano layout (F through B, for pianists) instead of only 4 for up, down, left, right.  The music here is classical, remixed in a variety of styles.  While there aren't a whole lot of unique levels, there are four difficulties you can play them on, as well as three Arena modes which I can't review because I haven't unlocked/played them yet.  The main story is fun, though after you've heard it once, you might just want to skip it to get straight to playing the levels.  The game also mixes things up by allowing a space bar attack to be used (it will signal when), as well as offering up gold notes for bonus points that appear on other keys, not the main 7 used for the piano.  This definitely adds some variety to the basic game.\n\nA few points to note:  Piano experience probably won't help you a lot.  Notes stream vertically, not horizontally, and key size and spacing differ, so playing one-handed can be difficult IMO.  Pretty quickly I decided to acknowledge that this isn't like playing a piano, it's a keyboard game that uses a piano layout, and switched to a two-handed approach; using DRGYJIL seems to work pretty well for me.  This helped me out quite a bit.  The space bar attack isn't really disruptive to the main game play, since it's fairly easy to use a thumb to tap it when the signal appears, but the gold notes are harder to accommodate.  Because they appear on non-game keys, finding the right key to hit while keeping up with the stream and not getting your fingers out of position can be difficult.\n\nOverall, I like the game and would recommend it.  The music is nice, it feels more like actually playing the music than other games, and has some additional actions that add to the experience even if they can be tricky to get right.  If you generally like music rhythm games, I think this one is worth a try.","November 9, 2014","true","2.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The gameplay is simple in theory but decently challenging in practice.\nThe songs are all nicely done mashups of various Chopin classics and the musical style of the musician you are currently facing.\n\nThere are definitely some downsides to the game, primarily the... odd quality of the voice acting.

Also, some of the characters really were a bit too much of a racial stereotype.\n\nDo I recommend this game? I'm not sure.

Difficulty in levels also fluctuate quiet significantly between the stages some earlier ones I found harder than some of the later ones and the last two are extremely hard suddenly notes seem to come from everywhere.

It starts off with our hero being brought back from the dead and immediately showing up some hipster with his mad piano skills (GOTY?). In all seriousness the weird story doesn't make a lick of sense until the last stages. It consists of Fredric traveling all across the globe and battling various ham fisted stereotypes of various cultures. Which is all well and fine with me but what slightly irked me is that Poland had no negative stigma attached to it (Devs are Polish). Just a small thing I wanted to mention before talking about the game.\n\nWell starting off the game you immediately notice the awful graphics and even worse voice acting followed by a mediocre story. Though to be fair, who comes to a rhythm game expecting those? Gameplay and music is where its at. Unfortunately getting used to the default control scheme (rebindable)  is going to take quite a bit of practice and you cant help but shake off the feeling of how much more fun this would be on a touchscreen. But once you do get a hang of it the game is a blast! One little trick that helped me out is keeping my middle finger hover over the E key and visualizing everything under it to be white keys.\n\nBut what of the music you may be wondering by now. It is brilliant, amazing, I can not praise it enough. I am not familiar with Frederic Chopin's compositions but have been told the songs in this game are remixes of his work. It's a shame whenever you miss a note and the song distorts a bit. Which will be happening quite often until you get used to the control scheme. I strongly recommend starting off on the easiest settings until you complete the game once. Which took me less than two hours and I left the game open for awhile. One very nice addition is that the game comes with the great soundtrack. So if you were searching Steam for a decent rhythm game or want some awesome new tracks to listen to, do not ignore Frederic and his epic keytar!","October 20, 2014","true","2.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Frederic: Resurrection of Music is a fictional tale of the Polish composer Frédéric Chopin who awoke from the dead and listened to pop music.  Like most people, he became so enraged he immediately sets off on a world-wide manhunt to kill the people responsible for this trash, and will destroy anyone who gets in his way.  Seriously, this is the story, except you beat people via piano numbers on your keyboard instead of going all Geralt of Rivia on their heads.\n\nInterestingly, the music you play is -very- loosely based on Chopin's works.  For instance, the game contains a reggae version of Polonez A-dur Op. 40 Nr 1 (look it up on YouTube).   You have seven rebindable keys you must use to play the notes in rhythm with the song.  Anyone familiar with music games in general with pick this up quickly, although playing piano on a keyboard takes a little adjustment.\n\nWhile everything is drawn in a cartoon style, I cringed a little at some of the charicatures of people in different countries.  The Jamaican had really big lips, the Japanese had really slanty eyes, and the Americans were either gun-crazy rednecks or white kids dressed as wannabe gangstas.  At least they got the Americans right.\n\nIf you like music and rhythm games, you'll probably enjoy Frederic: Resurrection of Music as well.  It has forgiving beginner modes right up to Chopin-level difficulty.

Trying to use a PC keyboard is just awkward enough that I'm not particularly compelled to go back and master the tougher difficulties, but if I still had a little USB MIDI controller, or something similar, I'd definitely be there. Something like this would be perfect for playing this game (and, I assume, the sequel): http://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/LaunchkeyMini\n\nThere are a couple boring tunes, but for the most part the tracks were done very well. Classic music with a modern touch (think Boom Boom Rocket for XBLA, but taken down a notch or two). The art and cutscenes are fun and amusing, along the vein of (and, I would say, surpassing the entertainment level of) Elite Beat Agents for the NDS. I actually enjoyed watching them and never particularly had an urge to skip ahead.\n\nIt's not the best rhythm game out there for the PC, but if you like the genre and catch it on sale, it's definitely worth a try.","October 4, 2014","true","2.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The core gameplay is so-so: on most standard keyboards, the WER keys are not exactly between the ASDF but shifted slightly to the right which makes the default binding awkward to use. The cutscenes have nice artwork, but the pacing of the dialog is so slow, it becomes infuriating to sit through. On the other hand, if you want to force yourself to not skip them out of fear of "missing out" on content, be warned that any keypress you perform will skip the cutscene. So for example, if you press shift-tab to open the steam overlay, you'll skip the cutscene. Or if you press F12 to take a screenshot, you'll skip the cutscene.\n\nFor rhythm-game fans, if you've played any amount of Beatmania/IIDX, go ahead and jump straight into the hardest difficulty "Chopin": It's still easier than even a mid-level light-7 song on IIDX, and there are only 8 levels/songs in the whole game. On the otherhand, you'll get to look forward to a decent remix of Revolutionary Etude (which you might know as "Kakumei" from Dance Dance Revolution).","December 14, 2014","false","1.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I bought this game blindly, it was only about 70p so I thought it was worth the risk. I'm not really sure how it's classed as a game you just press the corresponding keys to the notes using ASDF and for the semi tonal sharps and flats the keys 'WER'. It's essentially Guitar Hero with a "piano" but without the fun. The music on the game is horrible, I only played one song I enjoyed which was the none remixed Frederic Chopin classic, most 'songs' sound like the crap I have to endure at the gym, just constant, repetitve noise. I wanted to like this game cause it's a genre which has potential, however the horrible voice acting, horrible cut scenes and lack of gameplay just makes me hate it. The animations in the background constantly put you off too and often visually interrupt the sequence you have to follow, making it even more frustrating.\n\nThe game is different to anything I've played before and hope for more titles within this niche genre, however the issues I have with the 'gameplay' and horrible bits inbetween make it impossible to recommend.

This game used to be one of my top 5 favorites before it let me down.\nI can't recommend this game anymore due to it's crappy touch input, "freezing up", and scoring screw ups.\nAs I've remarked on several occasions in community discussions (which gets no response as well), the touch input stops responding after a few minutes. It not only ruins gameplay, but it also messes with the timing- the game "freezes" for about a second and then starts at a totally different spot, and the "keys/notes" are no longer in sync with the song. This has happened on more than one device- so far I've tried at least 6 (4 laptops and 2 tablets), with different specs ( 1 laptop with a 2.0 GHz processor and 2 GB of memory, 1 laptop with a 2.0 GHz processor and 4 GB of memory, 1 laptop with 2.1GHz processor and 6 GB of memory, 1 laptop with 2.5 GHz processor and 6 GB of memory, a tablet with Windows 8.1 OS and a tablet with Android OS).\nAt times, the game "freezes" even when I don't use touch input.\nAlso, for some reason, after quitting a game and then coming back to it, the scores are not the same, it's like either the game can't "remember" my last score or it totally ignored it.\nI bought the second game, "Frederic ESB" and that happens every once in a while, but with "Frederic ROM", it happens a lot and has been getting worse.\nWhat a waste of time and effort.

The controls are awkward at best and you can't even perform some of the actions on with a keyboard (the game seems to let you progress anyways though). I could see getting used to the controls after playing for a while but the music was awful. I have been a big fan of rythm games in general but I cannot play this game becuase of the music.","January 5, 2015","false","0.1"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

Has a great story (while Cheesy), and even better music. As Chopin is a my favorite classical composer I was itching to get in this game, even more since i got it very cheap.\n-You play as Frederick Chopin raised from the dead to save the world from terrible music. Through your journey you duel, Frenchies, Irishies, jamaicans and wannabe gangsters.\n- The controls take a little bit to get used to but if you've played piano they arent actually that far off, and soon youll be nailing riffs and loving it.\n- Few things I didnt like, no German, Chicago, New Orleans, Bluegrass, Chinese, African Music stage. Though there is supposed to be a sequel so maybe they will get to those. Also the game is very short. If you skip all the animation you can knock it out in less than 30 min.\n-Other than those its an overall great game would make Chopin proud, It doesn't matter what music you play as along as it comes from the heart.\n-100/10 would definatly raise Chopin from the dead again.","January 4, 2015","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I certainly found the game to be pretty cute and also enjoyable. There's some goofy humour and you could smell the satire. If you like challenge, go for the highest difficulty. It might be pretty handy if you're familiar with the pieces, though it's not as easy as it seems if you were to play this on a computer keyboard (some changes to the default keys would help.) For the length and content of the game, the price is very reasonable.\n\nAs a person who loves Chopin's music, I'd recommend this to fans of Chopin...or people who just feel like battling the evils of today's music industry.","January 1, 2015","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If youre a hardcore fan of his music it doesnt exactly delve deep into his repertoire.  In fact, it can be very short, theres only a handful of songs, and theyre each arranged as the enemy's style of music, or generic rock arrangement. but I got some achievements in morning of gaming so whatever\n\nEach missed note is so devastating to your success. Im not good at rhythm games but I like them, and I like chopin, and the summary of this game seemed silly, possibly fun,  and hell it was $1.37. The story parts are sloooow, but you can skip past them, theres a long pause at the end of the songs before it "ends" that you cant skip. The final song has a slow part in the middle and the difficult part at the end which as rhythm game players know is a pain in the ♥♥♥, because a lot of the game is muscle memory. Having to wait through the easy and drawn out parts to learn the part that makes you fail isnt fun, however that just boils down to me sucking. The song before the last is also difficult and scripting gets in the way of accomplishment on that specific song. However, since those two are the final boss, it is understandable. 1.37 or even 5.99 if less money than most songs/song packs for rock band and i wasnt exactly expecting a piano learning simulation, so I got what I paid for.","December 10, 2014","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Replayability comes with harder difficulty levels for those who like rhythm games.  However, I'm not into rhythm games, so I stuck with the "Too Easy" difficulty level and managed to complete the campaign in 75 minutes and had a good time doing so.\n\nWhile some don't like the graphics (per other reviews), I did like the animation and the graphics and found them to be good.\n\nOverall I'd give it a 7.5.

Usually that means an over-priced, un-optimized, low budget piece of garbage.  And I will say the regular price may be high (it seems to be free on IOS with in-app purchases, I haven't downloaded it on my iPad so I don't know how bad the IAPs are...)  But if you can get this in a sale, go for it!  (I paid $2.52 CAD for both this and the sequel).  There are no microtransactions in the Steam version, so it's a pay once and play sorta deal.  No BS energy bars, no paywalls,  just sweet sweet game.\n\nStory and Voice Acting:  The story is terrible, but it's terrible in a campy B-Movie sort of way.  Chopin wakes from the dead in the modern age, gets handed a magical golden carriage and grand piano, and travels the world to music duel various folks.  The voice acting ranges from terribly hillarious to simply terrible.  For example, the Rasta trying to hide his Eastern European accent was a good laugh.  Also, some of the racial stereotypes can been seen as racist, whether intentional or not (this falls under story and VO as well as art.)  2 out of 5, but only due to the campiness of it.\n\nArt Design:  The art is pretty decent, done in a motion-comic style.  It is definitely done in a comical style.  Nice use of colour.  I enjoyed it, although again racial stereotypes are a thing here.  4 out of 5, they are on a budget, but did well with it.\n\nMusic:  This is where the game shines into the shiny gem it is.  The music is Fragging Incredible!  It is inspired by Chopin's classic compositions, as well as the regions you duel in.  There is not a single track in this game that I do not like.  They are all really well done.  The music director of this game did a fantastic job.  Admittedly, it will not be for everyone.  However, they touch on many genre's here, yet with it still being very piano heavy.  Dubstep with piano is now the only way I can enjoy that attrocious genre.  10 out of freaking 5 here!\n\nGameplay/Controls:  DO NOT USE THE DEFAULT KEYBOARD MAPPING!  I will combine gameplay and controls into one category, as they pretty much are the same thing in this game.  This is a rhythm music game.  Not unlike Guitar Hero without the plastic guitar.  Now, I was not able to test the touch controls as I do not have that as an option.  From what I hear, they are great.  If you have the option, that's the way to play.  I, however, used a mouse and keyboard.  Mainly keyboard.  I first tried the default control mapping, and I could not get my head around that.  It basically maps all the keys to your left hand and relies on the mouse with your right.  Couldn't do it.  I remapped everything to the home row, going left to right and not caring about the white and black keys on the piano, and bingo!  With my setup, I had no noticable delay between the sound and when the key is supposed to be pressed.  This control scheme worked well for me, all though it made it difficult to get the extra points from the few notes you need to swipe left/right now as this uses the mouse.  As gameplay is control in this, as it's a rhythm game, I'm going with 4 out of 5 once you get a mapping that works for you.  From what I hear, it could be higher with an appropriate touchscreen.\n\nOverall:  Alright, all things considered I really enjoyed this.  The price I paid comes into play as well, as I paid about what a large coffee would for two games (this is only a review of the first), as I got this on sale.  So, a charming art style, decent controls once you fine tune them to you, excellent music, and a terrible but campy story and VO...  Hell, I had a great amount of fun with this.  Near 4 hours so far on the first game, and more to do with the Arena and the final achievement if I want it.  I am giving it:\n\n4 out of 5.  Even at full price at $6.49, it's great fun.

This was a beauty for me. It was almost as tacky as the movie "the Room", but at the same time, it was really entertaining.

I tried a few rounds with the keyboard and failed pretty terribly, so I switched to the mouse and found that to be much easier for me.\n\nWhile the story was "eh", the sound and music seemed excellent to me through its 10 levels with some of Chopin's music done in some different styles around the world.  Replayability comes with harder difficulty levels for those who like rhythm games.  However, I'm not into rhythm games, so I stuck with the "Too Easy" difficulty level and managed to complete the campaign in 75 minutes and had a good time doing so.\n\nWhile some don't like the graphics (per other reviews), I did like the animation and the graphics and found them to be good.\n\nOverall I'd give it a 7.5.

I love this game a lot even though it is shorter.\n\nThe game banks on music, but still can deliver when it comes to visuals and gameplay. Easy cutscene and charactor give off the sence of what the tone is. Many diferent themes are set. The game is very responsive and works well. I would suggest maybe changing the layout the keys to resemble a piano or just use a mouse and hone your FPS skills.\n\nThe sound. Oh boy the sound. It is outstanding. Every track brings a perfect blend of one type of music and the piano. There are so many diferent types and cultures of music here. I wish they would sell the sound track alone, because I would buy that.\n\nThe game is 100% worth $6 if you love music.

Few things weren't obvious st start (perfect hits, key sliding, how to use an attack (specific parts of song if you're doing good enough)). Penalized for pressing notes when nothing is there (most rhythm games don't do this). A story in a rhythm game is hard to do well. This was a bizarre story. Difficulties are the same notes?
