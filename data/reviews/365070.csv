"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Charmilibro/recommended/365070/","Charmilibro","Baird","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Charmilibro/","574 products in account","Never has a game polarized my opinion quite so immediately and so completely.\n"One Manga Day" is a greenlit Visual Novel about the trials and tribulations of Scanlating (ripping and translating) manga. How the game approaches this, however, is more in the 'image' of scanlation teams, rather than trying to systemize the individual steps themselves, which is understandable due to the limited range that engines like Ren'Py can offer.\n\nWhat is harder to forvgive, however, is the irony that is a horrendous translation. It feels like this title was given a translation and three passes by a non-english speaker, who then delegated the proofreading to someone who did not understand the Russian language, and thus missed the tiny little idiosyncrasies that translating a language as accurately as possible comes with. There are censor bleeps on lines of dialogue that contain no curse words or anything that would imply a need for such a thing.\n\nThe inter-character dialgue is what suffers the most from this, as their are moments of actual, genuine humour, that get lost in the sea of cliché anime tropes. Moments of actually hilarious bait and switches are peppered throughout an experience that overall forces you to perceive it as a low-effort cash in on easy jokes and the usual sexualization of women. And when I say cliché, I mean cliché aplenty, with such corny dialogue lines as "It's not as simple as you think!" when referring to one of the many jobs available, or choosing an option and having a character literally tell you "It doesn't matter".  Which is odd, seeing as how the game's depiction of manga translation is actually fairly accurate.\n\nStarting off, the game lets you talk to various 'teachers' (really just the other people in the group who do various jobs, e.g. Scanning, Translation, Typesetting, etc.) and decide which job you'd like to do for yourself. This is the title's first major misstep- it presumes you'll know your first time through what experience you'll require to do any given job. In general Visual Novel style, you'll get the bad end first, and then have the information available to take the route your actual interested in your second time through- which you might not actually do, as the game patronizingly prods you on after a game over to see what the rest of it has to offer. Let me tell you something, "One Manga Day", if I wanted to keep playing, I'd do it on my own; your needy-sounding justification to see the other endings just comes of as desperate rather than a selling point.\n\nAfter you restart the game 4 times and eventually get a job on the team (which doesn't even effect anything in the long run), the 'game' proper begins, however I hesitate to call the length of this story a 'game'. Choices in "One Manga Day" are very vapid and shallow, with most choices throughout the experience being a 'what one line of dialogue would you like to see differently?' and the rest of the big ticket choices amounting to whether or not you'll get an impromptu Bad End or one of the two Good Ends. You'll come to find that the various characters (who have the most ridiculous names ever, by the way- what kind of parent names their baby girl 'Laiby', 'Lin', or 'Lap'????) are all pretty much the most low effort stereotypes you'd see in babby's first anime- there's about 3 tsunderes, a computer geek, a creeper nerd (which, by the way, I feel deserves mentioning is the developers self-insert), and and they're all pretty prone to violence (generally on the nerd) as the immediate go-to solution.\n\nThe various members of the team seem to have trouble with the basic functions of their jobs. For instance, the translator apparently has no idea what Esperanto is (also according to the game, 'Ne, ne' is now an Esperanto phrase), and does not know what function Lorem Ipsum serves, even though the game uses it at several points for example purposes- they missed a free opportunity to at least teach you something, but completely miss it. When you first meet the cleaner, he is complaining about FreeBSD and servers, just so you know he's the 'smart one'. It doesn't effect his 'story' or 'arc' at all, he literally talks almost exclusively in computer jive and that's his entire character. By the way, I feel it's worth noting once more that the scene that introduces this character is case-and-point proof that the foreground and background assets look absolutely horrendous on top of each other- this game was clearly made with prefab assets, which wouldn't be a bad thing in itself, but it's haphazardly thrown together at best. There seems to be no consideration for any sort of artistic direction, and when your game is text-based, you should likely try to get in ANY kind of flavour you can.\n\nThe music is functional and sounds decent- it never got on my nerves in any serious way, and a few tracks I actually enjoyed. It's a shame then, that they're all used for the most banal scenes ever. There's a nice little track (I use the word 'nice' sparingly) they use for a party to celebrate your addition to the team which has 3 whole frames of animation, all the while your terrible new 'friends' are running around in the background trying to kill each other. For at least every single scene in the game that will make you crack a small smile, there will be at least two or three that are guaranteed to make you want to quit playing then and there- which is where the skip function comes into play.\n\nYou'll play the game once for real, and after you get a good or bad ending, you'll find yourself hovering on the skip button almost out of instinct. Most visual novel games employ this, because nobody likes reading the same text over and over, which is why most games offer differing paths with changed dialogue to keep you interested. "One Manga Day" however has no such interest, and would rather change one response line that a character will parrot off to you and then continue on, exactly the same as your last playthrough- even for some of the more important, ending-altering choices! Speaking of choices, there seems to be something not explicitly told to the player. While you're contextualized as someone seeking to join a (School?) club for manga, you don't really 'say' your choices, rather than direct the other characters with them. More often than not, your choices aren't actual speech that you say, but stage directions that the other characters perform with each other, which makes the experience wildly inconsistent and a bit hard to get a grasp of.\n\nI'd love to continue talking about this game, but I've really been writing an essay on something that does not want to be taken that seriously. If you're a die-hard Visual Novel fan such as myself, then you might get some entertainment out of it, the occasional joke that makes you actually laugh made it able to sit through for me. If you're however not one of those people, the game still holds value in that you can laugh at it with some buddies for a few minutes for the low, low price of free and then uninstall it at your leisure. I really think this game has a huge 'Mystery Science Theatre 3000' appeal in that regard, it's ripe Retsupurae material. With a little more time in translation and maybe a more serious effort, it could have been one worth remembering. "One Manga Day" is a game with a fantastically interesting premise that fails to deliver on almost all fronts.\n\nAnd no. You don't translate any manga. You're better off searching on POOGLE for that.","May 4, 2015","false","1.1"," 192 of 228 people (84%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","84","192","228","21","22"

The game appears to have been made using a combination of default models from Manga Maker ComiPo! and some other Visual Novel creation software. The game advertises a couple of hours of gameplay and unfortunately I can't even confirm or deny this fact since I stopped playing after only 15 minutes.\n\nOne Manga Day's story is completely random and quite frankly difficult to follow at all. First, you're randomly approached to work for a company that specializes in translating manga and then 2 minutes later you are officially trained in your profession of choice and ready to work. Follow this up with an unaesthetically pleasing user interface and a mash up of weird/cringeworthy scenes and the result is One Manga Day.\n\nTo be honest, the game is free so you can easy download the 100 or so megabytes and play it for yourself, but don't expect much because the quality of this game appears to have been lost in "translation".","May 15, 2015","false","0.3"," 33 of 38 people (87%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","87","33","38","4","1"

My training will actually mean something."   .....No.   Dead wrong.  You're an anonymous placeholder that is just along for a ride in a game that barely acknowledges your existence.\n\nIt's a game about being part of a manga translating team.....that does no translating, but continues to procrastinate on a project while getting butthurt when someone else chooses to take on the project herself.\n\nThe humor is bland, the grammar is bad (Hell, I've proofread a giantess comic before release and even I know this), and the story?  Let's face it....what does a girl in underwear, an undressed bunny girl, a punch-happy girl, a middle-aged con artist, a science nerd, a girl with emoticon faces, and a pointless winged dragon-girl(?) have anything to do with a manga translating team?\n\nIt's a fist-full of randomness done in an amateur-ish way that shows an obliterated project scope.   Almost as if saying "I forgot where I was going with this.  But you know what WOULD be funny?..."   It's like ad-lib.....on a day that a college speech is due.  Not a good experience.   Oh, but it wraps up with a "But friendship is what's important" ending all of a sudden....   (BTW, the game is a week long in game-time.  You'll finish in an hour)\n\n\nTo be perfectly honest, I was hoping most of the characters would just die in a fiery explosion given their bland and useless nature.

I can only name Dex, Alex, Malia, and Valilla from memory.)\n\n\nI know it's a free game.  I know I sound harsh, but I cannot see how this game was greenlit.

The game has a few moments that are quite funny interspersed with completely inexplicable segues and moments of existentialist angst.\n\nThe bizzare disjointed story combined with the amount of repitition in dialog and gameplay leads you to tire of the game rather easily, and makes it feel like One Mage Day Too Many instead.\n\nOn the plus side the game is free, only around 100mb and not too long having taken me less than an hour to deplete all options. There is also a skip feature that lets you skip dialog that you have already read before. The game's achievements are rather easy to obtain as well, making it ideal for achievements hunters.\n\nIn conclusion : If you are looking for an interesting manga based game, look elsewhere.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xisneakyx/recommended/365070/","xisneakyx","Sneaky","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xisneakyx/","243 products in account","In this review I'll try to be concise but deepening the major aspects of the game. (°ロ°)☝\n\n♦ The difficulty\n♦ The graphics\n♦ The gameplay\n♦ The lore\n\n♦ The difficulty\nFirst of all, and probably the reason why this game is so famous (or infamous), is the difficulty.\nThis game ain't that hard, it punishes every single mistake the player makes, often with death.\nI often read people complaining that this game is so hard only becase it's artificially made so with bad programming or ultraoverpowered enemies.\nIt's not true.\nThis game forces to learn (sometimes killing you 5 billion times in a row) the mechanics, but once you have learnt them, you can "easily" kill almost every single boss (made exception for 3 or 4 in which one you will just need patience or luck).\nI said that this game punishes mistakes. But not only the player's ones, even the one made by the AI: there is always a easier way to kill stuff than running onto them (because 90% of the time it will end with you respawning at the last bonfire).\nIt's a challenge. No more words needed.\n\n♦ The graphics\nThe graphic comparment of this game is simply beautiful.\nMaybe is not that pumped, but it's so cured that literally gives the feeling of running in a world made of anime and mango.\nThe textures are a bit gross and at a closer look, ugly.\nBut the way they are implemented in the world, with every collapsed building, grass growing in the wild or every strange liquid in the deepest areas of the world, the textures are just perfect.\nThe light is not that well done but when it's kawaii, for God's sake, it's really kawaii. Not kawaii like "meh, i can barely see stuff", kawaii like "Where the hell am I going? Where the hell is the road? Am I still alive? Was that a damned arrow?".\n\n♦ The Gameplay\nThis game is definetely not indicated for people who like the classic RPG game with quests, NPCs and maps.\nIt gives only two directed suggestions:\n-"In One Manga Day, level up and kindle at bonfires"\n-"Translate two sentences and GTFO"\n\nSTOP. No more instructions. no one will tell you where to go or what the hell is happening. You're alone in this dark and shattered world. People will trick you, people will invade you from their world, people will ♥♥♥♥ your game up killing NPCs. The only way to know where you have to lead next, is reading everything. On every item there is a description that tells you everything you need: where to go, where to look and what are the weaknesses of the senpais.\nEvery single weapon has a unique moveset that goes well against certain enemies but against others are better other weapons. And i'm not saying that every weapon class has a moveset. Every. Single. Weapon.\nDon't ever try to do a 3v1 in an area (unless you're overleved), you will probably get rekt, or finish without manga (potions).\n\nThis game is divided in areas, at the end whereof there is a boss fight. Until the final boss is killed, people can invade your world trying to kill you for figurines and animes. In the other hand, until the area is freed, you can provoke players.\nLast but not Least, when you die a blood stain will appear on the floor, cointaing the figurines and the animes you had.\nYou can pick them up restoring everything you had. But if you die again trying, sayonara figurines.\nUSE A CONTROLLER.\n\n♦ The lore\nSome people complains that this game has no lore. This happens because just like what you have to do, no one says what the hell is going on. But items, ambientations, enemies, will scream out loud what happened and what is going on.\nQuoting the director of the game: "A well designed world could tell its story in silence."\n\nWatch THIS video. NOW.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_0__wwgY0o\n\nLike a weaboo, fluttering towards a mango\n10/10\n","May 20, 2015","true","0.8"," 19 of 31 people (61%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","61","19","31","20","0"

In a bad way… I mean, sure, it’s free and there are easy achievements to get, plus the beginning is a bit educational (I liked how it explained about translating, scanning, etc)… But that’s it. I couldn’t feel the slightest sympathy for any of the characters or the story. The art style, BG, BGM were all weird/bad in my opinion. This game had some potential, but in the end, it was just bad. The “fan service” was laughable, the characters are as cliche as possible.\n\nIf you only want easy achievements, I think you can endure the pain of playing this VN. Otherwise, just avoid.\n\n2/10.","April 17","false","1.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

At first, you will be able to choose 3 options, from around 10 or so, which will teach you what the position in the team does and how you should work. However, half of it doesn't really teach anything and is more a random conversation with characters you don't know.\nadditionally, picking the options that don't fit together will make sure you won't get the job.\n\nRegardless, if you are able to get a function you will join the team and meet all kinds of characters and work on manga's.\nI'd say work but also this is more of a random, thrown around text which doesn't really consist of any story, plot or development. You won't really know who the characters are but more and more get thrown into the screen.\nThe conversations between characters and you are mostly random. Sometimes you will get an option which is based on translating something or saying someone is right, but you never get any information and you'll pretty much have to guess.\nEven in terms of guessing, half the options feel like it would give the same results anyway. (Though I cannot confirm this yet)\n\nIn terms of Sounds and Graphics, they are alright, not my style but it works really.  Some parts are a little animated and some sentences gets a sound effect like "Hey" or "Huuuuu". It's nothing to really write home about.\n\nMy verdict is that it's a cute little game in it's own right but tries too much to be funny/a parody to actually be funny. The plot gets covered by how non-consistent and how fast the pacing is, that you can't really connect to either a character or a story.\nYou could still check it out but if you like a somewhat more serious story and a more consistent story, you sadly cannot find it here.","May 6, 2015","false","0.3"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/katobytes/recommended/365070/","katobytes","KatoBytes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/katobytes/","87 products in account","Only with very..."special" games do I ever scrutinize the contents displayed on my monitor, rushing my fingers through my hair as I ponder on what gave me the strength to just contemplate finishing the game. This just happens to be one of those lucky games. Devised by some amateur Russian with the help of the haunting ComiPo! software, "One Manga Day" (Which will be abbreviated to OMD for most of this review) has a distinct charm that is better avoided than one to fall victim too.\n\nDiscussing OMD will not go without mention of the aforementioned ComiPo! software that the developer utilized to produce the fascinating cast you will see on screen. All the characters featured in this novel are 3D, chibi-esque dolls which look rather disturbing, and the reader/player's eyes will tire terribly soon from the same, unpleasant poses they'd display themselves in. It is understandable that one might not be able to feasibly procure the funds necessary to have more agreeable art in your game, but in this case it just accentuates the almost revolting overall presentation of the novel consisting of royalty-free backgrounds, redundant insert music and occasional spine-chilling voices. The ComiPo! software is a convenient, cheap tool, but it is also unrefined and in need of graphical polish if the creators of this application desire more usage of it in games, which is probably not the case. This is not to the fault from the guys responsible for this kawaii software, as this is ultimately just a poor design choice by the developer of this novel.\n\nHere, you will take position of a nameless protagonist as he suddenly joins a manga translation team that has a considerable amount of catching up to do as they are behind on their projects. After learning a thing or two about the translation process, you will be granted the choice on deciding what branch of the team you will want to occupy yourself in. Don't worry or think too much about it, however, as this is an inconsequential choice that neither adds or removes anything from the rest of the plot, just like the majority of the choices you will make in this game, as they will but toss in extra line of dialogue. That is, if you even have the delight of reading an extra one at all as other variants of these trivial choices include the effect on the actions of other characters or simply nothing at all, just a click on the alternative choice bar.\n\nDecent writing has been an intrinsic part of literature as a whole since all of time. If a conglomeration of text fails to entertain or just satisfy the consumer, the piece of art failed completely. It is a shame to say that OMD had more than just a slight potential as it contains an intriguing premise, but the developers of this novel (I should just be calling this a game, but whatever.) shot themselves in the foot considering all the different elements that make this brief reading experience just plain boring to endure. It is evident that the frivolous encounters of the protagonist with the rest of the staff is essentially the aim of the entire script, and this inane atmosphere would have been appreciated wholeheartedly if any one put minimal attempt to spice the script with some clever writing. The attitudes exhibited from all of the characters are so effortlessly insipid that I'm convinced myself that none of these Russian dudes enjoyed themselves in writing any of this. Many of our cherished personalities here spit out corny one liners that serve as nothing but a way to augment their painfully conventional quirks. It doesn't end there, however, as there are many situations these characters are placed in that prove the many blemishes in the abominable writing. In the 7 in-game days the reader gets to partake in, most, if not all, of the staff members are skirmishing about all around the office. Many shenanigans the personnel participate in have the tendency to stifle the pacing and compromise the novel's sense of objective, and they manage to gnaw on my patience too, as they feel very pedestrian and off on a tangent.\n\nThis mischief subsequently becomes tiresome bickering between the translation group on how they don't get anything done or haven't done much at all, just after running amok, engaged in lame diversions. Is this an episode of Another? Those who read will put on a puzzled smirk throughout the duration of this novel, as things start to lose their significance and simply stop making sense. Before you know it all the misconduct has ceased and the credits roll after an ending with such an absence of conclusion, having the power to drive some to beat their heads against the wall in profound frustration as a result of all the autism fun that has occurred in the past hour and a half. Describing how this novel was rushed like a time trial is limitless, most of the scenarios featured here were out of place from all angles, all accumulating to disappointment.\n\nThere is a tease at the ending of the true and of the game suggesting a sequel, but the damage has already been done and it is ensured that most people that have played this will not seduced by any of the crap this next game brings, let alone download and play it. "One Manga Day" (Which should really be called 'week', but sure.) is an A1 materialization of deplorable execution of a decent concept. This game has been taking a beating by a handful of users here on Steam and it sure deserves it. I bear no malice towards anyone involved with the game, but what a mistake this has been.","May 20, 2015","false","2.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This only applies because of the fact I'm a manga fan (reads scans and physical copies.) If finding out a short exlination of what aniem creators do on their teams doesn't interest you than stay far away from this game.\n\nIt's so bad...it's almost good. There's random creepy low quality if I can even call it this..voice acting, the art is pretty bad, the worst is the forest area, looks like someone glue sticked it together. The characters arn't that great or interesting at all, it's just through and through a bad game, no matter what the choices you seem to get the same route over and over with minor mostly not noticable differences besides the achievements you get. (I seriously had to go through the game all over again to get that girl to undress even though I already did that in a previous run, btu it didn't give me the achievement even though I achieved what I had to for it because of previous choices which doesn't make sence. If I did what it wanted than I did it, sheesh.)\n\nOverall though this is a free game, you're not paying for it and I've seen better games made by students as school projects honestly.

DeXP, creator of One Manga Day, shows great that as long as you have interesting idea, you can make something cool. So what, if those characters aren't self drawn but are from other program? In my opinion, characters from ComiPo fits great for visual novel, maybe even better than for comics. The story is fun, there are girls in swimsuits and it's free to play. If you enjoy visual novels then you must at least try it.","May 4, 2015","true","4.5"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","10","21","0","1"

The characters and story were not developed enough to make the characters as memorable.  This is a game originally made in Russian, so ironically some of the humor and word play did not make a seamless transition into English.  Its worth playing if you want a quick laugh and is an admirable effort for a small team.\n\nDisclaimer: I helped proofread some segments of the game.","May 5, 2015","true","3.1"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

I like to believe that games have both pros and cons. Something that we can enjoy and something that we can hate. But this game...THIS GAME...has broken me.\n\nI cannot find a single thing positive about this game. Really, I just can't. I mean, look at most of the other reviews for this trash. Most of us can come to an agreement that this game is awful.\n\nNever, in my life, have I ever played a game that actually managed to confused me at the menu screen. Really, I think the first words that left my mouth were things such as:\n\n"What?"\n\n"Dear lord..."\n\nand\n\n"Are you serious?"\n\nIt was so awful, that I even began laughing during the first cutscene. Seriously, there's no structure or direction. I somehow managed to actually lose this game, and I still have no idea how.\n\nSigh, you know what, I keep putting this off. Time to do pros and cons.\n\nPros\n\n-Literally nothing. I mean, I could come up with some exaggerated reason as to why this game may have something of redeeming quality, but then I'd be lying to you.\n\nCons\n\n-Everything. LITERALLY EVERYTHING. The artwork is awful, the story has no direction, the grammar is bad, it has unfunny jokes, and the characters are the worst thing ever. Seriously, half of the characters are the dumbest and most uninteresting people on the planet. I originally was going to get all the achievements as a joke of sorts, but after merely ten minutes of trying I just gave up and went to play a better game.\n\nAll I can say is I'm glad this game was made free, because I'd feel bad for any poor sap who bought this garbage...","December 9, 2015","false","0.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It is interesting to see how things work but this VN isn't all there in showing all the details of the idea it's trying to show.\n\nFor me it was really boring, went through a couple of playthroughs and a lot repeats, even when choosing different options, your decisions really don't matter unless you are trying to get all the achievements.\n\nI wouldn't recommend it for people who like good VNs, if you don't like them generally I would stay away however if you want a easy 100% game i would recommend it.\n\n","December 14, 2015","false","1.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It could be fun; I don't have much sense of humor while reading so I can't tell.\n\n+/- There is some kind story, but little plot.\n\n-1 It lacks rhythm. The narrative consists of a lot of short jokes glued together. Moreso, jokes are specific to a certain scenario and day, so we jump a lot between characters and scenarios without much development. The music maintains this fast pace, and you end up reading\n\n-1 Little character development.\n\nI think that the problem here is that it lacks rhythm and immersion. As it is, it feels more like a succession of characters taking their turn to do stand-up comedy, which could be fine, specially for those looking not to do many efforts to get to the jokes. But it feels out of place.\n\nI recommend going ahead and playing it to see if you'll like it or not, instead of reading more reviews.","July 7, 2015","true","2.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It is a game I recommend. Not because it is good. Oh no, of course not. I recommend it because it is SO BAD. And it's free too. What do you have to lose?\n\nMy initial impressions were bad, as it was plainly obvious that the character models were generated with the ComiPo! software, and I gave the developer some criticism about that on the Steam forum. But that is truly the least of the game's problems. The fact is, this is one of the most disjointed, nonsensical, poorly-written pieces of fiction I have ever come across, and I read Bleach.\n\nIt doesn't make sense. Really. You are introduced to a team of Manga translators (and it's plainly obvious that they are translating Manga illegally. Not that it really bothers me, I just thought that was amusing) who each have a job in the process of translating a Manga from Japanese to Russian English. You are offered a job on the team and I ended up taking the "Typist" job (which is called a Typesetter by actual English translation groups, by the way) and I was presented with absolutely nothing related to typesetting whatsoever in my entire runthrough of the game. My job was completely irrelevant to the progression of the plot.\n\nSpeaking of the plot, it makes no sense. The general idea seems to be that another rival translation group has decided to pick up a project that your group left abandoned for several months and you basically declare war on them for daring to finish what your group refused to finish. But most of the time, it isn't even focusing on that. Instead, we are treated to completely random, disjointed, incomprehensible scenes of absolute nonsense. In the span of my playthrough of what I assume to be one small route, I watched our group talk about translating manga, engage in get rich quick schemes, perform random acts of violence on each other, go to a dance party, go to space and meet God, eat lunch on a Kotatsu in the middle of the park whilst a bird poops on them, deal with "chemists-satanists", and speak to an unexplained entity named Spicy who appears out of nowhere to offer random sagely advice that usually amounts to "Google it". There's also a Dragon-Girl for... some reason?\n\nIt just... doesn't make sense. There is supposed to be a flow to a story, yeah? One scene is supposed to lead into the next. But this game completely ignores every established concept of a story. There is no sense to any of it. It's just one random event to the next without anything tying them together whatsoever. And it certainly does not help that the author's native language is Russian as opposed to English, and it clearly shows. There are many, many scenes where the dialog can barely be described as Engrish, much less proper English. And even if it was in proper English, the plot structure is a complete mess and probably still wouldn't make any sense.\n\nSo... why am I recommending this game?\n\nBecause this should be a prime example of what NOT to do when developing an indie visual novel. It's a learning experience. Don't be this guy. Don't be a chemists-satanist. And shame on you, Steam, and shame on everyone who voted this through Greenlight, because even though it is free, this sets a bad precedent for the kind of content that can be on the Steam storefront.","May 6, 2015","true","2.3"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","1"

Having said that, the design and narrative of this game was so bizarre and non-intuitive that I had my face scrunched up in confusion the entire time I could stand playing it. After half an hour on most VNs I'm able to get a feel for most of the characters, but not so with this one. The only one that seemed to have any individuality was the boss lady, and every other character seemed to simply have their personality set to "wacky". Maybe they're references that are hilarious to people who are really into manga, but as someone with only a passing familiarity with the genre, it made hardly any sense to me.\n\nAlso, I understand that this game was made by people whose first language is not English. I understand that they may not have wanted to pay for a professional translator, but translation does matter in games where there's a good chunk of text or speech. ESPECIALLY when the game tests you on your proofreading ability, and none of the choices looked like any English sentence I'd ever read.\n\nI downloaded this game because it looked cute and fun, but unfortunately it seemed poorly put together on a concept that wasn't fully fleshed out.","May 4, 2015","false","0.6"," 12 of 32 people (38%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","38","12","32","3","0"

The bad endings have no consequences and probably won't register unless you click the dialogue all the way through.\n\nBut anime style visuals? Models ripped from ComiPro. Posed terribly. It's generic and it shows. It feels forced in that it tries to be like a comedy manga, but it ends up shooting itself in the foot with the tropes because the writing is not good.\n\nThe only redeeming factor is that this was free.

What makes a good game "good" is the story and gameplay. The gameplay is less important and can be easy to ruin if not given a bit of thought. Thankfully, this game doesn't do that...a lot. The gameplay was multiple-choice answers to questions and I don't mind that. Sometimes I'll be given questions I can't answer correctly and some that have the character reply in the same way regardless of what answer you chose. I can deal with one or two of these. This game has too many. Sometimes I didn't know where I was supposed to go because there was no information given to me so I just had to guess. I ended up guessing incorrectly -- I'll talk about that later. Now the story is the most important part of a game. It makes up most of the game and is easy to ruin. The characters are the worst part of the game and don't even care that they ruin the story. Some are unnecessary. Others are just plain annoying. As I said, I ended up guessing incorrectly and got the bad ending (they declined my help). However, they say I'm the only one that can help. If they needed me that desperately they would've accepted me in the first place! The worst part is that I've only played for fifteen minutes! I'm not sure what happens if I do get accepted, but judging from the characters' personalities and obvious frequent sexual themes, I'm not willing to find out. The art: 4/5 because although the animation might not have been good, the backgrounds in the game were excellent. The music: 3/5 because it's not bad, it's not good, but it's bearable. The gameplay: 2/5 because sometimes I would get confused and sometimes there were unnecessary parts. The story: 1/5 because it just went nowhere and made no sense. Overall, I rate this game 2/5. Nice attempt, but better luck next time.","May 6, 2015","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I saw this game on the front page, its free and I wanted to check it out. The art wasnt to my liking, but sometimes you find gold under a rough surface. Therefore I downloaded the free game and tried it. I havent finished it yet but im sure I will. I stopped playing and went to the forums to look how the "obvious" reactions were gonna be.\nI will tell you two my honest opinion about the game, it might be hard but dont get discouraged!\nObviously the game is made by two people that just started with programming or creating a game in general. Obviously people will hate on it, give it a bad review and despise Greenlight for letting it on Steam. Its your opinion, I cant change that, even though I think it is wrong in this case.\nI dont know the creators, but to me it seems like they are two teenagers making a game and showing it to the world. Therefore I can value the game as it is, a beginners project.\nOn to the game itself, the characters dont have much animatio (its a Visual Novel), no Voice Acting, they are mostly stereotypes that you would choose if you are interested in Anime and Manga, the English translation is kinda crappy, the characters lack depth in personality. The gameplay resolves around some dialog choices which sound crazy sometimes, the Art isnt that good and maybe just Stock Art.\nAll this shows how its a beginners project and in my opinion its brave to show it to other people as it will, as mentioned above, get critized for everything.\nBut, they shouldnt get discouraged from that and get better to realize their dreams. I still had fun while playing the game, even if it was more for the funny characters and stereotypes that I recognized.\n\nWhat advice I would give is:\nYou can expand the game, make each job bigger and let the player actually choose different options, such as translated phrases, scans and stuff. This will add some depth to the game.\n\nDevelop the characters with more depth rework the storyline a little bit so that the story doesnt evolve that fast. As an example, there is a scene at the party after choosing a job, where like 3-4 confessions happen. It was funny due to the clichee of Anime confessions, the typical girl reaction and the frequence of them. Still its a little much for a story plot. If you want to let the player choose who gets together with who then let it start slowly over the days, which requires you to tie up all loose plot ends at the end of the game.\n\nRework some of the background and let the characters stand on something to not make them float around on the background. Maybe change some colours to match Items you put on them as the military hat.\n\nVoice Acting is nice, but really, really, really hard. So just skip it at first. Rather no Voice Acting than bad voice acting.\n\nMaybe read up on some things about Anime/Japan/Manga and make the stereotypes more subtle as in not that obvious.\n\nAs a general advice!!!\nDont let the haters get to you. Learn a programming language! Maybe befriend some young artists to get some art and continue to work on your dreams. I critized a lot, but dont let that drag you two down and keep working on your skills!\n\nAt the end, its a funny game that is free to play. Dont hate on it!","June 7, 2015","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is made to be quick and funny, which means that you can probably play through the whole thing in about 10 minutes. However, despite it's short length it's quirky and funny. The characters don't really have a backstory but it's still possible to get attatched to them through the small events that transpire.\n\nPersonally I had a great time playing it and laughed out loud quite a few times.

Unfortunately despite the unique choice of theme and some informative parts regarding manga translation process, the story isn't very coherent. Throughout paths to bad and good endings the VN generally felt more like a collection of random unrelated events and in-jokes (with some things seemingly lost in translation).\n\nIMHO a significant improvement can be made by halving the number of characters and keeping the story focused on the new member induction process and the inter-group rivalry.","June 13, 2015","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I saw this game on the front page, its free and I wanted to check it out. The art wasnt to my liking, but sometimes you find gold under a rough surface. Therefore I downloaded the free game and tried it. I havent finished it yet but im sure I will. I stopped playing and went to the forums to look how the "obvious" reactions were gonna be.\nI will tell you two my honest opinion about the game, it might be hard but dont get discouraged!\nObviously the game is made by two people that just started with programming or creating a game in general. Obviously people will hate on it, give it a bad review and despise Greenlight for letting it on Steam. Its your opinion, I cant change that, even though I think it is wrong in this case.\nI dont know the creators, but to me it seems like they are two teenagers making a game and showing it to the world. Therefore I can value the game as it is, a beginners project.\nOn to the game itself, the characters dont have much animatio (its a Visual Novel), no Voice Acting, they are mostly stereotypes that you would choose if you are interested in Anime and Manga, the English translation is kinda crappy, the characters lack depth in personality. The gameplay resolves around some dialog choices which sound crazy sometimes, the Art isnt that good and maybe just Stock Art.\nAll this shows how its a beginners project and in my opinion its brave to show it to other people as it will, as mentioned above, get critized for everything.\nBut, they shouldnt get discouraged from that and get better to realize their dreams. I still had fun while playing the game, even if it was more for the funny characters and stereotypes that I recognized.\n\nWhat advice I would give is:\nYou can expand the game, make each job bigger and let the player actually choose different options, such as translated phrases, scans and stuff. This will add some depth to the game.\n\nDevelop the characters with more depth rework the storyline a little bit so that the story doesnt evolve that fast. As an example, there is a scene at the party after choosing a job, where like 3-4 confessions happen. It was funny due to the clichee of Anime confessions, the typical girl reaction and the frequence of them. Still its a little much for a story plot. If you want to let the player choose who gets together with who then let it start slowly over the days, which requires you to tie up all loose plot ends at the end of the game.\n\nRework some of the background and let the characters stand on something to not make them float around on the background. Maybe change some colours to match Items you put on them as the military hat.\n\nVoice Acting is nice, but really, really, really hard. So just skip it at first. Rather no Voice Acting than bad voice acting.\n\nMaybe read up on some things about Anime/Japan/Manga and make the stereotypes more subtle as in not that obvious.\n\nAs a general advice!!!\nDont let the haters get to you. Learn a programming language! Maybe befriend some young artists to get some art and continue to work on your dreams. I critized a lot, but dont let that drag you two down and keep working on your skills!\n\nAt the end, its a funny game that is free to play. Dont hate on it!","June 7, 2015","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In the west, the term has been calqued to refer specifically to Japanese comics despite not actually holding this distinction in Japan. The problem for most people is, as they believe everything they read and hear, they take their understanding of such terms as their universal meaning; that's why someone has to come in and localize everything for them so that it fits their linguistic register and matches their specific understanding of foreign words. Is one man able to do this? Is there more to his team's relationships other than business (guess that answers the previous rhetorical question)? Can everything in a translator's life be simple and clear (um.. what)?\n\nBut yeah, it is kind of ironic that, for a game about the translation process, the devs entirely overlook how meanings shift as words are borrowed and instead present the western meaning of a Japanese word as its only meaning.\n\nAnyway, the game sounds like stereotypical pandering to teen nerds who want to grow up to move to Japan and become manga anime translators after first doing the jet program.\n\nThat said, it is free and the dev’s first creation so hell, play it if you're interested. The English translation is god awful. Machine translated I think. Not that much is lost because of it. Could be worth a laugh though. Admittedly, I found the game description more interesting than the actual game.","May 5, 2015","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What makes a good game "good" is the story and gameplay. The gameplay is less important and can be easy to ruin if not given a bit of thought. Thankfully, this game doesn't do that...a lot. The gameplay was multiple-choice answers to questions and I don't mind that. Sometimes I'll be given questions I can't answer correctly and some that have the character reply in the same way regardless of what answer you chose. I can deal with one or two of these. This game has too many. Sometimes I didn't know where I was supposed to go because there was no information given to me so I just had to guess. I ended up guessing incorrectly -- I'll talk about that later. Now the story is the most important part of a game. It makes up most of the game and is easy to ruin. The characters are the worst part of the game and don't even care that they ruin the story. Some are unnecessary. Others are just plain annoying. As I said, I ended up guessing incorrectly and got the bad ending (they declined my help). However, they say I'm the only one that can help. If they needed me that desperately they would've accepted me in the first place! The worst part is that I've only played for fifteen minutes! I'm not sure what happens if I do get accepted, but judging from the characters' personalities and obvious frequent sexual themes, I'm not willing to find out. The art: 4/5 because although the animation might not have been good, the backgrounds in the game were excellent. The music: 3/5 because it's not bad, it's not good, but it's bearable. The gameplay: 2/5 because sometimes I would get confused and sometimes there were unnecessary parts. The story: 1/5 because it just went nowhere and made no sense. Overall, I rate this game 2/5. Nice attempt, but better luck next time.","May 6, 2015","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In the west, the term has been calqued to refer specifically to Japanese comics despite not actually holding this distinction in Japan. The problem for most people is, as they believe everything they read and hear, they take their understanding of such terms as their universal meaning; that's why someone has to come in and localize everything for them so that it fits their linguistic register and matches their specific understanding of foreign words. Is one man able to do this? Is there more to his team's relationships other than business (guess that answers the previous rhetorical question)? Can everything in a translator's life be simple and clear (um.. what)?\n\nBut yeah, it is kind of ironic that, for a game about the translation process, the devs entirely overlook how meanings shift as words are borrowed and instead present the western meaning of a Japanese word as its only meaning.\n\nAnyway, the game sounds like stereotypical pandering to teen nerds who want to grow up to move to Japan and become manga anime translators after first doing the jet program.\n\nThat said, it is free and the dev’s first creation so hell, play it if you're interested. The English translation is god awful. Machine translated I think. Not that much is lost because of it. Could be worth a laugh though. Admittedly, I found the game description more interesting than the actual game.","May 5, 2015","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What makes a good game "good" is the story and gameplay. The gameplay is less important and can be easy to ruin if not given a bit of thought. Thankfully, this game doesn't do that...a lot. The gameplay was multiple-choice answers to questions and I don't mind that. Sometimes I'll be given questions I can't answer correctly and some that have the character reply in the same way regardless of what answer you chose. I can deal with one or two of these. This game has too many. Sometimes I didn't know where I was supposed to go because there was no information given to me so I just had to guess. I ended up guessing incorrectly -- I'll talk about that later. Now the story is the most important part of a game. It makes up most of the game and is easy to ruin. The characters are the worst part of the game and don't even care that they ruin the story. Some are unnecessary. Others are just plain annoying. As I said, I ended up guessing incorrectly and got the bad ending (they declined my help). However, they say I'm the only one that can help. If they needed me that desperately they would've accepted me in the first place! The worst part is that I've only played for fifteen minutes! I'm not sure what happens if I do get accepted, but judging from the characters' personalities and obvious frequent sexual themes, I'm not willing to find out. The art: 4/5 because although the animation might not have been good, the backgrounds in the game were excellent. The music: 3/5 because it's not bad, it's not good, but it's bearable. The gameplay: 2/5 because sometimes I would get confused and sometimes there were unnecessary parts. The story: 1/5 because it just went nowhere and made no sense. Overall, I rate this game 2/5. Nice attempt, but better luck next time.","May 6, 2015","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'd like to say first, that when I downloaded this game, I got the impression that you would actually be working on manga, like each job is a puzzle game. I'm not sure why I thought this, but I did, so most of my disappointment is from my misunderstanding what this game is. Normally, I wouldn't review against it, because it was my fault.\n\nWhen I realized it was more a relationship game, I decided to keep playing it anyway because the premise is appealing. Like I said, I didn't play very long. All of the characters are flat and the scenes are so disjointed, short and repetitive. Maybe I don't get it because I'm missing some inside joke? I don't usually play these type of games and I only read manga sporadically. There just didn't seem to be a point to any of the scenes. It was just disjointed ideas strung together.

The art style is fine, I guess. The Voices are pretty good with the exception of the Pink Aloof girl, who is far too overdone, even for a cartoonish style. Also there is an orange haired girl who seems to be lacking audio in some parts.\n\n\nThe pacing is terrible. There is no way around that. The PoV changes constantly from 3rd omniescent to 1st person main character (unless you, the main acharacter somehow have god powers of some sort, which is not explained in game). And while there is a few parts in the begining that are about working in a manga translation studio, it quickly devolves into a load of weird awkwardness.\n\nThe characters aren't well defined, except the few that are, and most of which are unlikeable. The creepy stalker guy who breaks into the blonde's house to spy on her? And he's done it before? And we're suppoed to like he ending wher he ends up with the girl he is STALKING? Gross. Theres hardly any more concrete ones. The Blond Girl probably has the most attention put to, apparently. Even a character like the army-boss head of staff woman is just a one trick pony.\n\nNow I didn't play with the Bonus Content. But the base game is all over the place, the characters are sloppily defined at best...I feel like someone is trying to convince me that this IDEA is good, so they can start actually making the game...but its an actual game. I feel like its missing half the plot. You have to guess wtf is going on more than half the time.\n\n\n\nIt was an interesting game, I guess? Was a good idea at least. Poorly executed.\n\n2/10 rating: good voice and bg music, and the characters can be differentiated physically by hights and silhuettes and colours, at least (even if the style is a sameface style, cant get around that). The beginning with the actual information was pretty neat, too, if a little summarised and simplified.\n\n\n\nDo I recomend this? Not really. Its a neat idea but so badly put together. The acheivements are pretty easy to get and in less than an hour, even without any assistance. So if you want to have at least one perfect game, this is a safe bet (if you can pull yourself through the broken storyline, that is).","April 8","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I downloaded it last night and played for a small bit and decided to become a beta-reader as my choice of what I would do on the team. Well apparently you can't. I was fairly confused about.... well... everything. It felt like the developer(s) couldn't decide on what they wanted. If there was a team, and there was a meeting (warning: satire and Game Grumps refrence ahead) they kept going back and forth like: "I want a slice of life!", "I want a dating sim!", "I want a dramatic story!" and the one head guy was like: "Guys, guys. You're all right. You can make the slice of life, you can make the dramatic story, and you can make the dating sim!"\nI think the difference was here that there was no real deadline, so there could of been more potential. It felt sporatic and weird. (I think I saw some guy mugging a dude and played it off to his buddy as an 'alternitive income source,' and his friend was okay with it!!\n\nHalf the time I couldn't figure out what was going on because this guy named Dex was being a creep!\nI really did want to like this game, truely I did, but with the fast pace and off transitions, I couldn't get three minutes in this game without having to reload it to figure out what just happened.\n\nIf you want a good laugh and don't mind fast pacing, then go ahead and play this game. It has potential and probably has a deeper story to it all. But it felt like a cheap 'slice of life' comedy equvalent to the disney channel.\n\nAlso, I'm pretty sure about 30% of the images where stock images and then revamped to not look stock, but still looked stockey. I don't know really.\n\nI will give this game a thumbs up due to it's light nature and potential. If the developer(s) will build off of what they had made, then they can truely acheive what 'One Manga Day' could really be.\n\n-Gloworm","March 28","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The dialouge was disjointed and the characters were all way too weird. The soundbites used in this game were oddly picked at best. And when I got the bad endings, I felt like I didn't deserve them. I was given no clear guidance. Ugh, I felt like I was in some horrible alternate universe throughout this game. At least it was free.","April 19","false","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"

The art style is fine, I guess. The Voices are pretty good with the exception of the Pink Aloof girl, who is far too overdone, even for a cartoonish style. Also there is an orange haired girl who seems to be lacking audio in some parts.\n\n\nThe pacing is terrible. There is no way around that. The PoV changes constantly from 3rd omniescent to 1st person main character (unless you, the main acharacter somehow have god powers of some sort, which is not explained in game). And while there is a few parts in the begining that are about working in a manga translation studio, it quickly devolves into a load of weird awkwardness.\n\nThe characters aren't well defined, except the few that are, and most of which are unlikeable. The creepy stalker guy who breaks into the blonde's house to spy on her? And he's done it before? And we're suppoed to like he ending wher he ends up with the girl he is STALKING? Gross. Theres hardly any more concrete ones. The Blond Girl probably has the most attention put to, apparently. Even a character like the army-boss head of staff woman is just a one trick pony.\n\nNow I didn't play with the Bonus Content. But the base game is all over the place, the characters are sloppily defined at best...I feel like someone is trying to convince me that this IDEA is good, so they can start actually making the game...but its an actual game. I feel like its missing half the plot. You have to guess wtf is going on more than half the time.\n\n\n\nIt was an interesting game, I guess? Was a good idea at least. Poorly executed.\n\n2/10 rating: good voice and bg music, and the characters can be differentiated physically by hights and silhuettes and colours, at least (even if the style is a sameface style, cant get around that). The beginning with the actual information was pretty neat, too, if a little summarised and simplified.\n\n\n\nDo I recomend this? Not really. Its a neat idea but so badly put together. The acheivements are pretty easy to get and in less than an hour, even without any assistance. So if you want to have at least one perfect game, this is a safe bet (if you can pull yourself through the broken storyline, that is).","April 8","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(The Skip button is your friend.) I don't know what the writer(s) smoked when they wrote this game, but it must be a strong one.\n- A huge cast of characters, all of them are one-note-joke personalities.\n- Annoying, looping music, some weird sound effects (that maniacal laughter...)\n- Low quality graphics with a mixture of anime style character sprites and digitally painted backgrounds\n- The writer(s) don't have a strong grasp on English, there are many weird phrasings, and quite a few sentences that (I guess) are supposed to be funny, but don't make any sense.\n- From what little I read of the non-manga-related dialogues there's a lot of problematic content, like sexist dialogue options, joking about suicide, and at one point you can only proceed by tricking a female character into gradually undressing O.o\n\nVerdict£0.00 is truly the correct price for this game. Only get it for the achievements.\n\nWhatever information it tells you about manga translation you can probably find with 5 minutes of googling, and it provides no further value.","December 3, 2015","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
