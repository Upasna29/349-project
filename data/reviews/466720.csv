A few were a bit out of sorts for me, but 99% looked great.  Brought back memories of using my grandparents viewer when I was a kid.  If you could add some ambiance to it, maybe have a soft volume level old time music playing on the record player instead of just static.  Or maybe it is there and I missed how to turn it on.\n\nOverall well worth the price of free.","May 2","true","0.1"," 60 of 66 people (91%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","91","60","66","6","3"

This seems like one of the most useful things that VR can achive, a presence of time as well as place. I was surprise just how much time I spent in this seemingly simple demo. I love the concept, and the way that I'm taken to another place full realized with a unique focus.","May 23","true","1.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Just need to bring my chair in here and position it just right and this will be a welcome break from other games. Would be kinda nice to have other music as others have said. I don't mind the static though. I'm a horror fan so static as BGM can put up a creepy mood.","May 4","true","0.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I'd pay for this content! Feels like you took a step back in time, relaxing and looking at 3D stereoscopic images from the early days. If you're a history buff like I am you'll totally enjoy this experience! Thank you very much for the content I enjoy on my HTC Vive! Maybe add some music from the time period to endurance the ambiance?","May 3","true","0.1"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

Great as a quick VR demo for anyone interested in history.\n\nThe developer is still working on it, so it'll get better. I'd say the most needed feature would be sorting the photos into categories so someone interested in one type of picture doesn't need to click through 700 photos to find what they are looking for.","May 15","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
