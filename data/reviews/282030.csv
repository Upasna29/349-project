The 90s :)\n\nIf you go to your Steam Library and look for "Carmageddon 2: Carpocalypse Now" then right click on it you will only find "Play Game..." and "View Player Manual" There is no option to configure the glide wrapper aka "nGlide" You have to do it manually go to your SteamApps/Common folders and inside "Carmageddon2" you fill find the "nglide_config.exe" so you can configure correctly the wrapper.\n\nAlso when the game was released (Late 90s) it came with ipx support so for this release (Prolly the GOG version have it too) they added an ipx wrapper, that wraps IPX packets into UDP, so modern OS can run this legacy games with multiplayer support.\n\nAbout the music, The amazing soundtrack is still here, this time is compressed using Vorbis (Lossy compression) The original release of Carma2 came in a CD, it was an Enhanced CD (Yellow Book CD-ROM + Red Book CD-DA) where the 1st track was the Data (The video Game) and the rest of tracks were the music, meaning your were allowed to put your Game CD in your CD Player and listen to the music, of course if you played the 1st track the one that contains the game data you will only hear random noise. While writing this review I was listening to the songs and found out that track Number 8 "The Trooper" by Iron Maiden at the 3:04 there is an error in the song prolly the CD was damaged/scrached, and you guys ripped it anyway, Lazy Stainless :P\n\nExcelent Game, lots of fun.","September 19, 2014","true","3.1"," 53 of 56 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","53","56","0","6"

Mind your compatibility mode and do some googling to find advise. the game itself may run smoothly (like it did to me) but there are plenty fixes published for those who can't run it. (because hey, 99% of old games need a little something in order to run on win 7 and win xp platforms like they did on win 98s etc)\n\nThis game was obviously the awesome sequel of a major idea of a racing game where you can smash and disable your opponents instead of just winning the race first. Numerous games took after this franchise including the burnout games. The game has an awesome point awarding system where you can earn points by running over pedestrians, smashing opponents, destroying them, going through checkpoints and of course winning the race. The point system helps the player to buy the cars of fallen opponents (only when they're smashed to death) and use them onwards.\n\nMeanwhile the variety of cars available in the game is ridiculous and pretty awesome. You get to drive vehicles from hot rods and rally cars to supercars and heavy duty trucks, all buffed up with blades and addons that make them look ready to kick ♥♥♥.\nAll cars have a pretty hilarious way to be introduced, each unique and each with a driver that is one of a kind. Another cool thing is that you don't have to keep buying new cars if you don't want to since there's an upgrading system the evolves you car's armor, force and speed abilities as you play alloying you to stick with your favorite vehicle even by playing 99% of the game with it if you want to.\n\nThe game includes some nasty missions along with the races. Kind like boss battles. Some are really stressful and some are way too fun not to make you wanna replay them.\n\nThe graphics of the game are awesome of its release. You can smash your opponents' and your own vehicle in any way imaginable. Crash on them, throw them off cliffs, push them on explosive barrels, cut them in half, fry them explode them.\nUse ridiculous powerups that make you throw flames or elecrify pedestrians, fart bombs from the back of your car and on your opponents behind you, make your car bounce, jump, turboboosted, undefeated or mess you up with drugs and alcohol effects.\n\nThe game is CRAZY and totally worth having fun with if you are into the genre.\n\n\nDo mind that of course its not perfect. There are physics issues like the levels of handling on some cars, the was steering works on most, the sticky feeling of some walls of you crash on their side and other little details that for me didn't take out of the fun of the game at all.\n\nCan't wait to play the sequel :D\nRecommended? HELLZ YEAH! This is one of the most memorable and unique titles on racing gaming history.\nEven if its really old, it is worth trying to play again!! And if you haven't ever played this, GET IT NOW!!! (or on the next special offer :P )\n\ncheers!","February 15, 2015","true","21.8"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

Not only this, but they actively, and severely influence the gameplay itself, making you actually aim for certain ways to collide at times, just to cripple your opponent.\n\nThough crashing into your opponents, racing across the creative maps, and killing all the peds you see is great fun by itself, this is even made better with the addition of tons of crazy and goofy powerups. Nowhere else can you send a car flying across the whole map using a coil spring, but here. (and maybe soon in the new Carmageddon too)\n\nFIND ALL THE SECRETS!\nYes these maps were all designed to be explored, making them not only great and interesting battlegrounds, but also filled with tons and tons of secrets, powerups, and curiosities. Not only this, but most maps also have challenges ready for you, to unlock those secrets; ever tried a jumping puzzle with a car? (or 10ft truck?)\n\nThe Fun, The Crasy and the Annoying.\nNow a lot of fun is ready for you as you already read, but there are also some warnings I’ll have to give, especially regarding the physics engine.\n\nCarmageddon has a great physics engine, but it doesn’t feel or play like one of a racegame; often you will feel like you’re actually floating on water, or flying through the air like you’re on the moon. (even without the lunar-gravity powerup) This by itself means… DON’T EXPECT FLUIENT RACING. Jumping puzzles are made easier because of this, but making tight corners, or any corners at all at high speeds, are impossible.\n\nBe certain that you want a crazy, goofy, arcady game if you plan on buying it. This is not a real actual racegame, even if it is definitely a car game.\n\nThe glue that keeps the mess together.\nThe game has a simple GUI and should offer no problems at all. There are many quirky things to keep in mind like stats and cars to own and buy during and around the actual ‘races’, and the GUI certainly makes it easy to keep an eye on everything. The big flaws here lie with the controls settings, and the ‘map’.\n\nThe controls are by default mapped to the NUMPAD KEYS… I know, a total WTF, and to make things worse, you can’t rebind them to any key you want… meaning that you won’t be able to use arrow keys or WASD.  Trust me though, even if you could rebind them, you wouldn’t be instantly comfortable either due to the physics, so please forgive the game for this and give it a shot anyway. It won’t be long before you get used to it. I do however recommend that you try to rebind the other keys (repair, handbrake, use power, etc) to keys convenient to you. I know the game used to work with a steering wheel, but I am uncertain how it responds to the more modern ones. I do recommend using a steering wheel if you get the chance.\n\nIn regards to the map, this bugger is probably the only annoyance you’ll have with the GUI. There is a minimap you can put on your screen, but initially it’ll be in the center of the screen. You can fix that using Shift+arrow keys though, to move the lil bugger around. However, due to the low resolution of the game, it’s too small to be able to actually effectively use it as a minimap the way you’re probably used to. Apart from this there is a big map, which is a big overlay displaying the whole map at once. You can still drive though using a little portrait sized window… a bit the opposite concept of the minimap.\n\nThe GUI has a little trick that helps with the map issues though, which basically locks on to targets and the next checkpoint. The minimap displays a line in that direction then, so you will at least be able to find the checkpoints and chase enemies, after looking at the big map on how to get there.\n\nSounds And Visuals\nNow it’s 2014 so be gentle on this old-timer. Regardless I can already tell you that, although low quality, the sound is generally satisfying and applicable within the context. Scraping, bending and crashing metal sound very much as you’d want it to, as well as a very pleasant sound for breaking glass. Apart from this, Carmageddon offers you 4 tracks of heavy metal from Iron Maiden and 3 songs from Sentience… which… I don’t even know, but it sounds alright I guess, considering the game it is. So you’ll probably want to play your own music the 2nd time you run the game, since you’ll be hearing the same song over and over again otherwise.\n\nVisually Carmageddon is very simplistic, and very dated. This however isn’t any problem within the context of the game, and in fact can be amusing at times. If you don’t mind the old graphics style, then you’ll still find that artistically, the game is unique, entertaining and satestfying.\n\nPersonal Opinion\nThis game I have been playing since childhood, and has never let me down in entertaining me with some good old fun, even if it’s old.\nEverybody has some game which is like a child to them, often old and forgotten by most of the population, and this is mine.\n\nNotes\nHave a Wacom tablet? I have, and with this game it’s been a pain in my buttocks. Often windows would suddenly start thinking my tablet is my main cursor input, causing many annoying bugs with my mouse. SOLLUTION: turn off the Wacom driver, either before or after, depending on how skilled  and knowledgeable you are with your keyboard.\n\nI have never played this game online yet, so this entire review is based upon single-player experiences.\n\nFor all of you who don’t have enough fun yet with the game by itself, there are many cheatcodes available that allow you to do countless amounts of things. This game was made with FUN in mind.\n\nAre you 15 to 25 years old? Good! This game will have exactly your level of humor if you know where and when to find it.\n\nThere apparently have been ports for this game, so you collectors, N64 owners or PS1 owners, you might be able to find this baby somewhere for those consoles as well.\n\nThis game has aliens, rideable rollercoasters, zoo animals, clowns, nuclear bombs, airplanes/jets, underwater driving, juvenile humor, rideable 10ft high trucks, rideable bobsleigh tracks, aircraft carriers, flamethrowers, tesla powers, rideable ski-jumps, underground mines, landmines, volcano’s, farmyard animals, the grand canyon, pyramids, helicopters and much much much more.\n","October 9, 2014","true","2.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Cars feel lighter and more fragile in Carmageddon 2 - they're bending, losing parts, flying around swirling, splitting in half - it's ridiculous. It is so much fun to destroy your opponents.\n\nMissions, in my opinion, are a nice addition for people who like a challenge, but I have to agree that some of them can be really hard and frustrating. Keep in mind that the higher difficulty level you chose, the less time you get to finish them. I managed to beat them on hardest difficulty setting except the last one, which I theoretically beat on medium by editing the game files and adding myself those extra seconds.\n\nWhile a lot of people praise Carma 2's soundtrack, I'm not a big fun of it and I usually play with music turned off. Iron Maiden while great and all, gets boring pretty fast. I liked the first game's soundtrack a lot more. Back in the day I even used to play the game with Carma 1's disc in the drive so it would play its audio tracks.\n\nI highly recommed this game. It still holds up. It's still fun to play.

The AI on the opponents will sometimes stop for no reason or will make them go around the race course even though they can't win. The prices on the cars is so high that you will either have to grind upgrades on maps like the quarry or the City with the scrapyard or just plow through the game and get all cars and maps unlocked automatically.\n\nThat is not to say that it is not fun, but when you consider that you can kill all drivers in less than 5 minutes and get very little money or ignore them in favor of grinding for money witch becomes boring, fast, but is a necessity.","September 26, 2014","true","34.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

A great classic in short, has a different gameplay a racing game, but entertains a lot.\n\nthe problem is that version. U will need to delete two files to get the game open in Win7 or> and thus u lose the sound tilha (Goodbye Iron).\n\nIt kills a lot of the atmosphere of the game and the game always presents small crashes and trouble off.\n\nIf u want a 100% working version of Carmagedon, this version is not for u. If you want to know or remember only can you have fun.\n\nI finished the game even with these problems and had fun, but it could have been much better\n\n\n\nveja bem, o jogo é muito legal e trilha sonora é ótima. Um grande classico em resumo, tem uma jogabilidade diferente de um jogo de corrida, mas diverte e muito.\n\no problema é essa versão. Vc vai precisar deletar 2 arquivos para o jogo conseguir abrir no Win7 ou > e com isso vc perde a tilha sonora (Adeus Iron).\n\nIsso mata muito da atmosfera do jogo e o jogo sempre apresenta pequenos travamentos e problemas para desligar.\n\nSe vc quer uma versão 100% funcional de Carmagedon, essa versão não é para vc.

It's still fun splattering pedestrians and smashing the other racers into oblivion. Honestly though, just buy the new Carmageddon: Reincarnation which comes with Carma 2 and the other games in the series. Plus, it really seems to capture all of the fun of the old Carma games with graphics that don't look like they were designed on a potato. It does run well on my current machine, which is nice, but after battering my way down memory lane for a bit, I realized I'd rather just play Reincarnation instead.\n\nBut seriously, it was a really cool move on the developer's (Stainless) part to not only get these games on Steam, but to give them away to everyone who bought their new game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mcdux0r/recommended/282030/","mcdux0r","dux0r","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mcdux0r/","1067 products in account","A casual, fun pedestrian smashing romp through Cities, an airport, a countryside village and more. Carpocalypse Now is a more fleshed out and greatly improved sequel with plenty of playtime, and even existing multiplayer for those willing to set it up. Racing is a minor part of this title and most of the fun comes from upgrading your vehicles and destroying your enemies.\n\nCarmageddon 2 released at the height of video game censorship in the late 90s, and instead of benefiting from the widespread but controversial publicity like the first game, it suffered low sales in Germany, the UK and elsewhere where the law and market made it harder to promote. It was also mostly disliked by critics at the time who criticized early technical issues, and it took a long time before Carpocalypse Now was accepted as a great game and classic in its own right.\n\nFollowing on from Carma 1 and the updated Splat Pack edition, Carmageddon 2 added a huge number of new tracks, powerups, enemy vehicles, abilities and more, all under a much better engine that, due to some intelligent designs, still runs well today despite aging graphics. For me, this was a game that never got the attention and player-base it deserved at the time, and remains a cult classic.\n\nHighlights\nThe development company SCi were basically a collection of 8 young programmers and developers with varying skill levels and very little experience in launching a game. They went with the principle that "if it sounds like fun, let’s try and do it", as a result, there were crazy little things added to these games, like the Prat Cam, the culture references in other drivers and cars[en.wikipedia.org], and a number of weird secrets and mission modes. These help to add depth and humour to an otherwise flatter racing game.\n\n* An amazing soundtrack with several tracks from Sentience and Iron Miaden. The original game release contained the uncompressed tracks which meant you could play the game CD on your CD Player/CDROM and just skip the game data as a single track.\n* Incredible responsive handling and controls for the time which help controlling the cars remain a fun experience of itself.\n\nMistakes\n* Arguably too easy a game due to the unrestricted customization and different play styles. The single player campaign can either be too hard or too easy depending on the way you choose to play, but a cast of difficulty modes would have worked better.\n* The multiplayer framework used IPX, which was outdated even at the time of release and made multiplayer all but dead for most players. To this day, you need to use a private network like hamachi to play with friends.\n\nRecommendations\nPriced on Steam at £5.99/7.99€/$9.99 at the time of review, and with at least 9 hours of gameplay, multiplayer (via use of a private network like Hamachi) and plenty of replay value, Carmageddon is good value for money so long as the dated graphics and gameplay aren't a problem for you.\n\nThe previous title, Carmageddon: Max Pack is available on Steam at the same price, and may be worth picking up if you've never played the classic before.\n\nAt the time of review, Carmageddon 2: Carpocalypse Now and Carmageddon: Max Pack are available together on GOG for the same price as either title alone on Steam, and may be a better choice.\n\n* Carmageddon was originally intended to be licensed under the Mad Max movies, but after the developers were unable to find the company who owned the rights, Carmageddon was moved to match the Death Race 2000 movie license and was actually filenamed Deathrace.exe right up until release when the first movie license deal fell appart.\n* Carmageddon 2 comes with 3dfx Glide support, which means you can run it in full HD with a little configuration\n* There are still many cars, maps, skins and mods for all the Carmageddon games which work with the Steam client, a great list of content and links is maintained here http://rr2000.toshiba-3.com/links\n* The original uncompressed soundtrack is also included in the game directory as .ogg files","June 29, 2015","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
