The girl can push/pull things and jump and the floating boy can interact with onscreen objects with the mouse cursor. If you've played Limbo you'll have an inkling of what you're in for, if not, that means that you will learn what to do by being killed, repeatedly. Some deaths are unavoidable the first time around. This aspect makes the game frustrating, especially coupled with the obtuse puzzles you'll have to solve. The puzzle-solving boils down to clicking any suspicious object on-screen to determine its utility. The unresponsive controls confound the puzzle-solving further, as there are instances where I knew what should be done, but the controls failed me. Despite the colorful presentation and surreal imagery, there is no story in this game. It is one of those games that throws as much weirdness at you and hope that your mind would probe for meaning, when there isn't any. If there was an underlying thread of meaning that ties up this adventure, it went way beyond me. Game duration is about 1-2hrs.","June 15, 2015","false","2.4"," 38 of 44 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","38","44","0","0"

The game sacrifices the logic in the name of the surreal flavour. Yes, this means "trial and error" most of the time. Like Hapland.\n\nThe controls are not horrible, as other people claim. Granted that using X and Z together with WASD movement is very awkward, but you can use Shift and Ctrl instead.\n\nThe atmosphere is great at some points, and just off in others. The "Ophelia is Distressed" thing in the first part was great, why did that stop? I was expecting more of that. Actually, I was expecting more of everything, the game is ridiculously short.\n\nOnly get this during a sale.","August 22, 2015","false","3.8"," 33 of 43 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","33","43","0","1"

It's surreal, beautiful, charming, and you get a great half experience from it, the other half is frustration, which is surprising for me since barely any game does that to me.\n\nThe game is a damn beautiful art piece, which as vibrant colors, great art work that looks like it was inspired by a mix of Indian, Arabian, and English art. The puzzles are really simple and hidden so plainly that you'd just miss it somehow, and that's kind of what I think is makes (one version of) a good puzzle game.\n\nThe beginning section is annoying, along side with most of the game. I get what they're trying to do, adding a creepy/scary factor to it, but it's more annoying than being effectively creepy.\n\nThe controls/gameplay are less than solid work, sometimes frustrating, where there actions are delayed, moving objects around are noticeably laggy, and half of the time the character won't hold on to a ledge.\n\nTulpa is absolutely astonishing in the way that it looks, it's art is just fantastic, it's creepy factor is amazing, and the pacing of it is good too, the characters are also great with how one is working with the other to continue their adventure, but it's a shame that it has such low quality control in the gameplay side of things, which includes the platforming design, the controls, the interactions with items and the environment, the movement and jumping system, that and the guides/tutorials are bad or not even there to help sort out what you can do in the game, which I think they aren't there because of the shortness of the game? not sure.\n\nI'm actually more disappointed that angry with the game, looking forward to it before release, and then finally playing the game, it did an amazing job in its looks, in the characters, in the puzzles, but not in the gameplay sadly, which is why I recommend this game only at a price cut, around 6 dollars is a good point, but if it didn't have those problems that ruined half of my experiences, then I would wholeheartedly recommend at full price, even if it is short 2-3 hour game, I'm more into a great experience rather than length, to an extent, and this Tulpa delivered half a good one.\n\nShameless link[www.ksalue.com] to original post.","February 13, 2015","true","3.9"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","19","22","0","0"

It's layout is pretty bizarre and has a slightly hellish feel about it, with basic colour schemes for each level (white, black and one other colour). It's worth playing if you can get it on a discount, but the length detracts from the value and so I wouldn't recommend buying it at full price.

The gameplay is very light fare as you simply walk around- or face basic jumping sections- and face a few puzzles for each level.\n\nThe aforementioned puzzles go from ok to annoying as some are quick, logical affairs while others rely on clues or visual cues that can be a bit hard to get and either leave you stumped or require several deaths to pass successfully. It's a quite forgettable experience most of the time and the extreme shortness'd doesn't help either.\n\nAll things considered Tulpa is worth a playthrough for the art style and atmosphere alone if, like me, you got it from a bundle: but its price tag and bland gameplay aren't enough to recommend as it is.","January 27","false","2.4"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bobisonlybob/recommended/331340/","bobisonlybob","BobisOnlyBob","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bobisonlybob/","188 products in account","There's an achievement early on in Tulpa, called "Could I have skipped this?". My answer to the game is yes, I could have skipped this, and watched a movie instead - it would've been better use of my time and money.\n\nA mediocre game in the style of Limbo and many other recent atmospheric indie platformers, it vaguely hints at a tragic story with death and suicide imagery, but never elaborates. A shapeshifting tree and colour-changing background mark the major acts. Imagery is taken from a number of real-world religions and occult practices, but is never used meaningfully. There is more story in the Steam Cards than in the game itself. The art is at best sufficient for the tone and atmosphere, and at worst reminiscent of a 15-year-old pagan art student's sketchbook. The title of the game isn't even justified within the experience. The payoff is unsatisfactory and inconclusive.\n\nThe game mechanics are near identical to another, superior game which is itself average at best - Never Alone (Kisima Inŋitchuŋa), which had the decency to include narration, a good story and relatable characters, as well as a full documentary on the history and culture of its setting. The tutorial text offers more exposition than any of the non-sequitur and esoteric actions you have to perform to progress. The platforming is poor to downright inadequate, with sloppy physics objects that you click and drag to build bridges or click on, elements to interact with, but only when directly controlling the tulpa (often leading the host to her death if you move more than a little distance away from her). The host herself has simple push/drag abilities, which are still somehow made awkward through an unusual choice of key, and a jump which is prone to not working near the very same edges it is necessary to jump from in order to not fall, shatter, and be forced to repeat the simple drag-and-drop puzzle for the eighth time.\n\nStrongly advise against playing this unpolished and lacking experience.","November 1, 2015","false","1.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Mechanics not the best i stuck in one place only because i had to take "thingy" from top not itself. Completed it almost in 2 hours.

The challenge isn't so much "what to do" as "what am I even supposed to click on?" The control scheme doesn't help either: You switch between two characters, a presumably not dead girl, and her ghost boyfriend. The girl can push and pull certain objects, and the ghost can pick up and move objects and interact with distant switchs. Sounds good, right? Except the girl "dies" if the ghost gets too far from her, "too far" being "about 6 feet". To that end, she'll follow the ghost around, including right off ledges to her death. Since the ghost's interactions are all controlled via the mouse, and the girl's via the keyboard, and you lose if they ever split up for more than 15 seconds, there's no reason you should have to switch characters at all.","September 3, 2015","false","1.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Nearer the end, the game starts to use some evangelion 3 level visuals which fit right in to the game, but I have no idea what they mean.\n\nThis is actually true for a lot of the game.

The atmosphere is wonderful, with a strong art style (let down by terrible animation on Ophelia, the main character) and a great soundscape. I actually really like that the story is a little obtuse, other than a clear Orpheus inspiration - although the Ophelia reference might imply it's all in her head, making the final bit doubly ambiguous.\n\nI think there's two problems, basically. This is a mix of a platformer/side scroller and a puzzler. Unfortunately the platform bits are stymied by sluggish controls, especially affecting jumping. The puzzles are varied, some being fun and clever, some being obvious, and some being just plain weird. I solved several without actually understanding what the hell was going on or what I was doing. A lot of them are trial and error, and many are random pixel hunts, clicking all over the screen. I did, however, enjoy making the dead body of Jesus flail around like a ragdoll. Great corpse animation is a plus.\n\nSo, as an experience, this game is pretty decent; as a game, it fails. It really annoyed me on several occasions. I got this as part of a humble bundle, and I don't regret spending 23p on it, but if you can't get it that cheap think twice. Having finished it in under 2 hours, it's a bit annoying that none of my steam trading cards have triggered. If you've got a short game, don't add insult to injury by making people play it for ages just to get the cards!\n\nAll in all - this feels like a wasted opportunity, but makes a fascinating failure.

When I first saw it in the store, this game seemed like a gem buried in... Well, more commercially successful titles. But boy was I wrong.\nGameplay: 4/10\nControlling both characters is incredibly awkward, Ofelia cannot jump or grab ledges properly half of the time, while Oliver can accidentally kill her because she keeps running towards him. I mean, game explained that they must be close to each other, why implement this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t mechanic? Overall movement is kinda sloppy, this isn't something you expect from a platformer-ish game. Puzzles (which I assume to be the core of the game) are either very basic, or very "hard" - the cheap and nonsensical type of hard. Sometimes those puzzles just kill you, because it's the only way to find out how it works so you can solve it, sometimes you won't be able to figure out what to do for good 10 minutes, and when you eventually will, you'd feel no pleasure, you won't slap your palm across forehead, saying "My, how stupid am I, the solution was so obvious!", because it wasn't.\nMusic/SFX: 6/10\nNot good, not bad. Sounds are basic: footsteps, clatter, splats and such were most probably promptly taken from some online library. Music is just ambient, seems like composer tried to fit the "atmosphere", but he couldn't succeed nor fail for reason I'll explain later.\nStory: ...\nCome on now. Game wasn't even trying to tell a story. All there is to it is a blueprint: you get a few hints of what's going on in the beginning, in the end, and couple of times during the playthrough.\nGraphics+"atmosphere": 4/10\nIt seems like that is exactly what everyone is praising about this game, and this is exactly what I imagined this game would be: an immersive experience, packed with simple, but beautiful backgrounds, little exploration here and there, just... You know, I wanted this game to play with me, take away my reality perception and throw me out in the end, sitting here, astounded, kinda like Nifflas' or Pixel's games do. It promised to do it. It never did. Backgrounds are straight up bland and uninspiring, most objects seem SO out of place, color solutions are unsatisfying. The game was trying way too hard to be a mysterious, but it ended up just shoving it into your face: "Hey, there is a limbless skeleton on the wall, and he operates the elevator, isn't it brilliant? And look at this pheasant assembly animation! You speechless yet? What? Random doesn't mean genius? Well, screw you, have some hands growing out of ground".\nMy overall score: 4/10\nThis might be a little biased, since I had such high expectations about this one, and being disappointed right from the title screen out-of-place syndrome: the beginning, just look at this font doesn't help.\nTL:DR only buy this game on sale, without expectations and, if possible, without experience in Yume Nikki type of games.","June 13, 2015","false","2.2"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","0"

However, a lot of the puzzles are either hard to figure out of you just walk past them going, "I guess I solved it...". There's a couple of times where the rules of the game aren't stated that well either. For example, the game starts out telling that you can only interact with white objects and then at later points you can pick up black ones that blend in perfectly with the background. Additional, you will spend most of your time staying, “What killed me?!" and then feeling cheated when the solution was simple but not apparent. During another part the game introduced what was a vortex but in a small hallway so I never thought to move vertically because of how small the area was.\n\nAnyways, if you played and really liked "Limbo", give it a try.

How beautiful and artful it is comes in a close second, however. The imagery is fantastical. I loved the colors and how each level centralizes (or tries to anyway) around a certain theme and color. I found that the character breaking into shards of glass when dying was interesting and the entire concept of what a tulpa is. The visuals and the atmosphere of this game is the most fascinating and enjoyable aspect this game has to offer.\n\nOn the other side, this game has some hefty cons. It is incredibly short. One playthrough takes roughly about an hour to get through (this is coming from someone who gets stuck on the simplest of puzzles). The ending is very abrupt and unexpected with no real plot involved - unless I am perhaps too vague to understand the depth that is presented in the surreal imagery. There does appear to be a hint of a story underlying the imagery, but after spending my time going through multiple playthroughs I simply cannot fathom what I am missing. With so much to look forward to regarding the imagery and the atmosphere I was hoping for at least five levels to go deeper into the concept of a "tulpa" (which is a fascinating concept on its own and I did not feel as though it explored this idea at all). I was, admittedly, very disappointed with the abrupt ending as I was enjoying the game up until then. I had expected a lot more from it.\n\nRegardless of its hefty con ... it is worth playing in my opinion, especially if you enjoy atmospheric games with lots of imagery.

Long load times, terrible responsiveness for a platformer, and for those comparing this to Limbo: did you forget how good Limbo's controls were? You felt like you were doing things, while in this, it feels like you're dragging everything slowly and then it wants you to be responsively quick to finish the platforming sections. Not worth the time or effort, even on sale.","September 11, 2015","false","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

How beautiful and artful it is comes in a close second, however. The imagery is fantastical. I loved the colors and how each level centralizes (or tries to anyway) around a certain theme and color. I found that the character breaking into shards of glass when dying was interesting and the entire concept of what a tulpa is. The visuals and the atmosphere of this game is the most fascinating and enjoyable aspect this game has to offer.\n\nOn the other side, this game has some hefty cons. It is incredibly short. One playthrough takes roughly about an hour to get through (this is coming from someone who gets stuck on the simplest of puzzles). The ending is very abrupt and unexpected with no real plot involved - unless I am perhaps too vague to understand the depth that is presented in the surreal imagery. There does appear to be a hint of a story underlying the imagery, but after spending my time going through multiple playthroughs I simply cannot fathom what I am missing. With so much to look forward to regarding the imagery and the atmosphere I was hoping for at least five levels to go deeper into the concept of a "tulpa" (which is a fascinating concept on its own and I did not feel as though it explored this idea at all). I was, admittedly, very disappointed with the abrupt ending as I was enjoying the game up until then. I had expected a lot more from it.\n\nRegardless of its hefty con ... it is worth playing in my opinion, especially if you enjoy atmospheric games with lots of imagery. I would wait until it was on sale to purchase, though.","September 25, 2015","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Almost impossible to solve some puzzles at first try. Puzzles quite primitive and most of them don't conform to any common sense. In addition, there are some flaws related to mouse control - sometimes some parts are clickable too late, making player think that it's not clickable at all. Apart from that from audiovisual side it's quite nice, that doesn't save the day for the game though.","December 31, 2015","false","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I realize it's just a platformer at it's core but style and visuals here are so unique! Most of the deaths are unavoidable because it's pretty random. "Puzzles" are not actualy puzzles - it's trial and error. You are not given any rules or hints most of the time, it's just trying this or that. Chances are you couldn't beat the game without the walkthrough. Game is very short if you know what to do, 1-2 hours. Maybe price is too high for such playtime but give it a try on some sale. I guess it even has some replayability not because of the gameplay but because of such unique visuals which makes you want to see it again.","February 4","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I hear what the negative reviews are saying, and agree to a point, but the artwork, music and style of the game hit all the right spots for me. It's creepy in a non gory way, the puzzles are fine, not great. The mechanics feel a little clunky, as well, but all of that was overshadowed for me and I really enjoyed my playthrough. Definitely worth grabbing on sale, or in a bundle like I did.","January 21","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is $10 for a game that is about two hours long. While sometimes paying $10 for a short but very good game is ok, this game is NOT good. The controls are clunky, the story is nonexistent, and the puzzles are infuriating. In one puzzle near the end of the game, literally the only solution is to play it over and over again, and to just get lucky. Seriously.","May 15","false","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
