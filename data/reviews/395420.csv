At first, I was like Iceywind1980 and was about to give up on the game; it ttook me 30 minutes, or so, to get going and figure out how to play.  Also, the default difficulty setting is "Difficult," but you can change it in game.  The fusion of point-and-click and rpg is really succesful.  Solving inventory puzzles, searching the enviroment, and talking to things is really just as essential to your progress as combat.  The writing is very good and never fails to entertain; party dialogue also frequently gives subtle clues as to how to progress.  The graphics and animations are good, for this type of game, and add to the enjoyment.  The game runs pretty smoothly and load times are minimal. The rpg mechanics are pretty sophsticated for a modestly priced game like this; for instance, your characters earn combat experience based on how much damage they did in the fight.  Also, turd zombies.  A very enjoyable game.","October 24, 2015","true","5.7"," 36 of 42 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","36","42","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ratrogue/recommended/395420/","ratrogue","ratrogue","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ratrogue/","601 products in account","The Dwarf Run is a fun "little" role-playing game with pretty demanding battles and an unusual story. Actually, the plot is what kept me playing it even when there was (in my opinion) too much combat. I only played it in the easiest mode, and even then it can be very hard, so be aware.\n\nIt combines (easy) Point'n'Click puzzles with a tactical combat RPG system, with a big emphasis on the latter. It's a pretty linear game (it's even subdivided in chapters), but sometimes you can explore the area a bit and choose to do fights in your own order. I actually liked the graphics, maybe because I'm nostalgic of older games; and the humor is often pretty good, which makes it okay that the story doesn't always make sense.\n\nMinor spoiler: I wish the elf from the bar scene in the beginning would have welcomed me back or something when I finished the game, to make it more round.\n\nBigger spoiler: Near the end of the game comes The Arena, a part of the story where you will fight. A lot. Oh, so many fights. But I must say, even though I'm not a fan of long, complex tactical combats, The Dwarf Run (at least in the easy mode) is rather well balanced and I learned the ins and outs of the tactical combat so much I actually enjoyed it (most of the time). And as the developer listens to feedback I am sure this part of the game will even become better.","January 9","true","22.7"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","21","22","2","0"

I was skeptical when I launched it for a first time, and the feeling I had was that it was going to be another easy to play low rating game for an hour or two. What surprised me most is that despite the fact that the game is cheap, has low poly, lack of voice dialogue (it would be strange to have that for such a price though), it still feels great and plays much better than many other AAA games of the same genre. In fact, it feels like a quest, a parody, a mix of modern RPG and old school dungeon crawling at times, which in my opinion, is very interesting way of making a computer game.\n\nWhat I really enjoyed in this game is the game mechanics - I am not saying it is something new, but you cannot just hack and slash entire game without some strategy. Every move, every battle, every level up of your hero requires you to think twice. What is interesting is that, unlike many similar RPG games, this game is challenging, if not impossible at times (especially for people who never played RPG games before) - in fact, you may end up reloading a game several times after every single battle (!) because of the one mistake you made either in battle or (the worst) if you developed your characters wrong (and trust me, for a first time you will do this). So if anyone want to avoid the mistakes before they are made - do not follow a typical RPG paradigm - your heroes will be useless if you focus just on what is best for their classes in other games - thus, if you think STR and con are great for fighter, INT is only issue mage needs to solve, and good ranger only needs to have high DEX - then you will need a new keyboard because you will kill it by hitting the same reload button 1000 times. Again, universality is key in this game - this will be clear once you enter the pits.\n\nSecond thing I liked in game is the sense of humour. I thought I saw everything of the genre but this game made me laugh so many times, I am still trying to understand how weird the situation can end up from a usual (as it seemed) dungeon crawling attempt. Yes - you have to be prepared to read the story, listen to your companions, and pay attention to details in order to really enjoy the game.\n\n9.5 / 10","October 25, 2015","true","48.1"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","17","18","2","0"

I think this really shouldn't be underestimated in a game, at no point was Dwarf Run coming grindy for me, and as a result it's one of the few rpgs that I've played through to the end.\n- The story is fun, again without giving spoilers, it's different, it'll have you scratching your head a couple of times, and it's in some ways pretty simple, but put simply its engaging, it leave you always wanting to see around the next corner I was a lot more curious about where everything was going than in some AAA titles where you have to defeat the 9 lords of blah blah before finding out that they were just minions of the 12 gods of yada yada.\n- The levelling system actually makes you stop and think, it does something really really well which upon reflection make you wonder why other games haven't been doing it. For instance, a spell will cost you 1 point to learn, it might still only cost you 1 point to get a second copy of it, but the third copy might then cost you 2 points, a forth copy might be 3 points. The result it that you can't just one trick pony your way through battles, you have to have to plan a bit and make yourself a strategy in order to succeed.\n-Those arena battles end up being strangely addictive.\n\nSo the verdict is clearly a thumbs up from it, I hope that we get to see more games from the same developer, a sequel perhaps, that said I also hope that any sequel we do get doesn't move away from the formula that's been set up here in the first Dwarf Run. Even with a bigger budget I hope that any follow up games retain what Dwarf Run has at its core, and that's Charm.\n","February 19","true","34.8"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","17","18","0","3"

The puzzles weren't really out there like some other point-n-click games. Yeah the difficulty might have been a little too rough even on the leisure setting, and the arena had way too many fights that drew the action down, but with a little tweaking, it's a sure challenge for anybody who wants to test their mettle.

Yes it is a linear game, but it is alot of fun. The first fight you get into, you'll probably get your butt handed back to you, so you look for another solution, Then once you figure out what you need to do before you get into that brawl, it becomes much more managable. The puzzles are pretty straight forward, they are common sense. It does take a little bit of an effort to understand the mechanics of the game, but once you do it is fun to play.\nYou will spend the most of your time fighting, the turn-base system, is ok as well, you need to pay attention to the amount  of action points you have, ie...you have your Cleric cast bless on someone, then you cast regeneration in the same turn, but nothing happens and it is the next characters turn, you are like WTF happened, But the next time around when it is your Clerics turn again, the first thing he does is cast regeneration on the toon you had told him to do it on. So with that in mind, you need to plan ahead.\nThey say it should take 15-20 hours to play, but maybe because I like to see what all my options are, it took me a little longer, or maybe if you know what to do, it might take the suggested time. All in all it was a good game to help me get through the weekend. And now that I know what needs to be done, I'll play it again.\n","October 25, 2015","true","63.6"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

Then read DerWizard's review because it pretty much covers most of what I was going to say.\n\nYeah, the camera  is wiggy.  Yeah my 11+ dex ranger with 83% hit chance misses eight times in a row and does minimal damage per hit.  (*maybe the random number algorithm is borked. . . maybe)  And yeah, some of the spells are half useless because some enemies are immune to some of them and others simply don't work the way you might think the work.  Most of that can be dealt with by adjusting tactics or, in the event that you just can't buy a frigging hit, load and re-play the fight.\n\nIt certainly is not perfect, but it's challenging and I have fun playing it.  As often as the random number generator kicks me in the teeth (83% chance missing 7 or 8 times in a row. . . I know.  I know.  It happens, but it's annoying) I also have had success in some encounters by changing tactics.  Many games reward the rinse/repeat and don't think about it tactical combat style.  This one, in some fights and encounters, does the opposite.  It seems to reward you for doing different things.  For example, I made one fight way, way easier by doing one simple thing.  I went from getting stomped into the mud on the first attempt to an easy, easy win on the second.  And this particular fight is known to be nasty.  The walkthrough actually informs you that it's hard, and suggests using consumeable items.  And no. I didn't cheat.  I also read the walkthrough for that section *after* I finished the battle.  Shame on you!  (just kidding)\n\nAnyway, I like that a different approach to some fights can make the fight harder or easier depending on what you choose to do.  It is not necessarily always required.  If you want you can keep hammering away using the same tactics and *eventually* the random numbers will come up in your favour.  Or you can change your tactics and make the fight a bit easier.  Usually.\n\nI'm having fun with it.  It was cheap.  I've paid more and gotten less out of a lot of other games.  It's challenging, but not always for the right reasons, however the dev (yeah, to the best of my knowledge it is one person) is tweaking game balance fairly frequently right now and added tips to the game reminding people that certain stats, like constitution, are essential to success later on.\n\nPerfect game?  Not even close.  Fun?  Usually.  Challenging and frustrating?  Both, sometimes.  Linear?  Yup.  Good story?  Up to you to decide, I think it's pretty basic but does the trick.  Good writing?  Not particularly for me, but I read a *LOT*.  The dialogue has made me laugh more than once.  Great graphics?  No... but they work.  You can tell what things are supposed to be.\n\nRecommended?  Yup, 'specially if you know what you're buying *and* get it on sale.  I'd argue it's worth the base price, however if you're not sure just wait for the next sale.","November 2, 2015","true","35.3"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Simple basic system with emphasis on the right stuff.   The leveling feels right, the gain of new perks/talents/spells is well balanced and make a difference.   So much so that you are always looking for the next level any of your toons is working to get.   The story telling is funny and well done.\n\nThe fact that you can change the challenge level at anytime is a great feature.   The interface is efficient.\n\nI greatly recommend this jewel of a game.","March 3","true","19.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The game I'd consider it most similar to would be the Drakensang games, with some hints of Blackguards (it's of similar difficulty to Blackguards, if not more so). The graphics are ok, not it's strong point. Similar to games that perhaps came out in 2005. The music is excellent however, and the game does a good job of creating atmosphere. The writing is very good as well, with elements of humor throughout. The game is pretty linear, but that's not exactly bad.  The only fault I can find is the fights are perhaps a bit too difficult. Many fights might come down to who gets the last hit in. There are times you might think a fight is impossible, only to discover there is another room where you can fight 1-2 more batches of monsters, and they drop a weapon or level up one of your guys, and that tiny edge is what you needed to make it through the next fight. Some of the encounters take thought, and require a solution you would not normally think of, forcing you to figure out an unorthodox solution. All-in-all, I think this is a good game.","October 27, 2015","true","39.1"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Few things  on both the good and bad sides.\n\nFirst its hard.  You have to use your brain to solve problems, combat requires a few restarts and some planning.\n\nThe game has some great humor, a few tricky puzzles, and it isn't open ended.\n\nThat said be prepared to be frustrated as a few puzzles will test your ability to think outside the box.  You will hit yourself in the head (or at least I did) when you realize the solution was always there and you just missed it...\n\nReplay is meh but I'll be honest I haven't had this much fun in a game in a long time.  I've spent 2-5x more $$ on a game and had less fun.  Support a game made by one guy, and I think you will enjoy it also.\n\nTake a look at my twitch stream to view the videos as I played the game.\n\nhttp://www.twitch.tv/fallout4king/v/22537617","October 29, 2015","true","18.5"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

The puzzles are fun and not too hard, rewarding when you work them out and the overall gameplay is great if you like a party rpg where you are constantly trying to get better loot.\n\nThe fighting system is simple but good.  A few more skills and abilities may have been nice but most the fights are very interesting.  There are a lot of boss fights many of which you really need to change tactics to beat, some may keep you scratching your head for a while.\n\nI didn't like the default camera setting wasn't to my taste as it kept panning out and round but once I changed it I had no problems (there are 3 to chose from).\n\nAll in all a very good game, amazing for the price.  10/10","October 31, 2015","true","21.0"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

To be specific, the combat is difficult, the point and click puzzles are simplistic at best.\n\nDo you enjoy really hard tactical combat? This game is recommended for you.\n\nUpdate: Upon getting further in to the game I'm rewarded with endless arena combat. Ok, so level design is hard and it's great if you can make one level and then reuse it for 50% of the game, but ... ENDLESS!

I am a newer gamer at 16 years of age so I was unfamilar to this style of game. The story in incredably strong, forced, and rushed. I lost the first battle and had extremely little to what I could have done to win. Not to mention the writing is forced out of these characters with the wizard man going "oh this colony is magical" or saying that "this torch should last 200 years with that fuel in it". This may appeal to a certian type of old school gamer but the turn based combat and the envrioment made me unsure of how to over come situations. Was I suppost to equip my dudes with rocks to attack the Zombies? Was I suppost to use a plank on the door to wedge it open.
