I manage to take on the wizard by myself and use up my last healing spell keeping myself alive, as I know my friend is dead and I've already wasted my other charges on him.\n\nHim- "Why didn't you heal me? It's your job."\n\nI rooted and managed to kill the lackeys using bear form and using my potions. With just me and the dwarf left, I notice that he really does hit mega hard and decided to run out of the house to try and lose aggro and catch a rest. He didn't stop following me, and 2 wild dogs came out of nowhere and attacked me too. In a moment of true tension I turn 180 and run straight passed the dwarf with dogs in tow. To my sheer amazement and relief, the dogs started attacking the dwarf and he stopped to fight them!! In the moments of freedom I got, I casted a root spell from out of view distance and then ran inside the house.\n\nI noticed I still had my daily heal spell up, so I used it on myself, getting me to about half health and I turned into a bear and waited. In comes the dwarf, mad as hell and covered in dog's blood. The next 10 seconds were a blur. He hits me, hard, I'm one hit from death. I hit him, he misses. I hit him again, he misses. I miss.... he misses, then I kill him with a final maul to the face. PHEW!!!!!\n\nCarrying all of his gear, I only have enough strength in bear form to carry it plus his corpse to the temple in the city to revive him. So I trundle across the land carrying him and all of his gear over my back, as a bear. By far the most epic and tense moments I've EVER HAD in any RPG, ever. Full stop.\n\nHim- "If you didn't pause it so much I would have killed them. It's so annoying when you're pausing it all the time"\n\nMe- "Did you see what happened?

The new characters are a little annoying and I ended up turning the girl in the copper coronet to stone because she wouldn't shut up about going to the crypt to find the treasure, like literally she went on about it nonstop and her voice.... argh.... she makes a pretty statue.\n\nBut just make sure you have a teammate who understands what this game is all about, understands tactics, is patient and has an IQ above 80.\n\n\n\n10/10","July 5, 2015","true","63.0"," 784 of 871 people (90%) found this review helpful 840 people found this review funny","90","784","871","840","65"

The game was originally released in 1998. I played it while I was in high school my senior year. It introduced a LOT of new people to Dungeons & Dragons. It's a 3rd person isometric RPG in which you control all members of your party. It's paused based(instead of turn based), which means that when combat starts, you pause, issue commands, unpause, wait for something to happen, pause again, issue commands, etc, etc. There are lots of games with that type of system now, but as far as I know, BG was the first.\n\nSo the way you're -supposed- to play it solo is to create one character and go along recruiting AI NPCs to join your party of up to six. Well you can get around all that by playing in multiplayer mode by yourself. Multiplayer mode lets you create all six party members and tweak them to your desire. You can also export/import different characters at any time. You can easily get away with this from an RP(roleplaying) perspective by saving your game in an inn and swapping party members in and out saying "Oh I met this guy at this inn". So to start with, I created my own party of 3: Human Fighter(me), Paladin, and Cleric, then I pick up NPCs along the way. Not completely satisfied with the NPCs in game, I finished the game with 5/6 party members self generated, and only one in-game NPC(Yeslick the Dwarven Fighter/Cleric). If you enjoy character creation and tweaking things and micromanaging party members, gear, stats, and other RPG elements, this game is definately for you.\n\nLets talk about the story. This is where the game really drew a lot of people in. For those of you that have already played, you know what I'm talking about. I'm not going to spoil it for anyone that may play the game in the future(even if it IS 16 years old), but it's a great, great story that lets you choose your own path. Of course my path is that of the good soldier fighting for... well... good. But if you enjoy the darker side of things, it's always allowed, which a lot of games give you trouble doing. You can lie, cheat, steal, and murder and still complete the game.\n\nOftentimes now that I'm in my 3rd decade of life, I've gone back and tried to play games from my childhood that I remember really enjoying, and graphically none of them have stood up to the test of time(X-Com, Doom, etc). Since all of the assets in BG are more or less hand drawn and the enhanced edition lets you play at your native resolution, the game still looks pretty damn good, especially amidst the recent indy dev 8 bit gaming boom. So graphically, it passes the test. The environments are pretty freakin cool too. A whole lot of unique, hand drawn areas that I had forgotten about since I first played a long time ago that made me say "huh, cool" when I came across them recently.\n\nAnd now let's talk difficulty. Holy ♥♥♥♥ is this game hard. It's been so long since I've played a game that didn't just blatantly hold my hand and coddle me the whole way through I'd forgotten what it's like to play a game that punishes you. AD&D 2.0 core rules are a huge ♥♥♥♥♥ and completely unforgiving. There are 5 difficulty levels in the game:\n\n-Easy - Everything does half damage, all hit point gains per level are maximized, and characters can't permanently die.\n\n- Normal - Everything does 75% damage, all hit point gains per level are maximized, and characters can't permanently die.\n\n- Core Rules - Everything does 100% damage, hit point gains are randomized(so you can get as little as 1 hp/level on your badass front-line fighter that needs ~10 hp/level), and characters can permanently die.\n\n- Hard - Everything does 150% damage\n\n- Insane - Everything does 200% damage and you are a satan worshipping masochist\n\nI may have added that last little part on the insane bit.\n\nSo being the badass gaming veteran I am, I of course choose Core Rules. I understand what THAC0 is, I know what the different classes are, I know how to D&D. I'm good.\n\nOr so I thought.\n\nI'm actually not as good as I had thought. I had to do a LOT of fights multiple times because Jesus Christ, this game can be hard. Mostly with the crowd control abilities the enemies get(note - If you fight against a group that has a mage, KEEP YOUR PARTY SPREAD OUT just like in ArmA). A lot of times I'd get hit with an AoE fear or confuse or stun, etc, etc, etc. It could be infuriating, but I kept re-loading and going at the fights in different manners from different angles, and analyzing my party and their abilities and switching things around until finally, at the end of the game, I had SOME sort of idea of what I was doing... I thought... until the final battle.\n\nLet's just say that the final battle in Baldur's Gate had me curled up in a fetal position in the corner of my room praying to Torm asking him what I had done so poorly to have been punished so badly.\n\nSo somewhere between 20 and 50 attempts later, I managed to defeat the final boss and win the game. I even had to google strategies for the final boss. I actually felt a sense of accomplishment like I haven't felt in a game in a long, long time. The funny part is, 17 year old me beat the game in 1998 without the internet for guidance. I have NO CLUE how I managed that feat.\n\nSo I immediately went to steam and bought Baldur's Gate 2 enhanced edition, even though it's not on sale, and started a new game. This time, however, I'm playing on normal mode. It seems to be a much better balance of playability vs difficulty. I've still lost some fights, but I've learned a whole damn lot and built my party around the strengths needed.\n\nI have a Cavalier paladin because he: 1. Can't be feared, charmed, mind controller, or poisoned; and 2. He can make the entire party immune to fear pretty much all the time. He's also a badass tank alongside my main character which is a frontline fully maximized fighter with sword and shield. I also have a pure Dwarven Cleric, Fighter/Thief, Fighter/Mage, and Dragon Disciple Sorcerer. I dual classed the Thief and Mage with Fighter bases so they could use longbows for good DPS instead of being relegated to a shortbow and a sling. The nice side to that is that they get fighter HP for their first 7 levels so they're pretty beefy on top of it all.\n\nI just pretend(roleplay) that my entire group is a squad of trained military soldiers that have been sent on a mission, so they almost all have that base fighter class from their military training.\n\nSo I have 2 tanks(FIghter/Cavalier Paladin), a pure healing Cleric, and 3 pure DPS(Thief/Mage/Sorcerer). But don't be fooled, that fighter and paladin can put out some melee hurt too. The cleric is really the only non-dps class. Oh... Make sure you -always- have a thief in your party with the script that makes him passively detect traps. Trust me on this. You don't necessarily need a thief/rogue that can stealth, but you damn sure need one that can detect/disarm traps and pick locks.\n\nAnd on that note, there are pre-set scripts that you can use for each character. There are about 20 for all the different classes in the game to mess around with. I pretty much have my whole group on the standard "I see an enemy and attack with my equipped weapon", except for my rogue, who is set to always passively detect traps when not in combat, and my cleric who is set to dynamically run around and heal. I micromanage everything else(mage spells mostly).\n\nRead the rest of this review here: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Jester814/discussions/0/648817377413793428/","January 15, 2014","true","111.9"," 630 of 716 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","630","716","0","10"

Back when we were still buying game in box. It became my favorite game of all time and is still is. Devollopper dont make games like that anymore. It is based on the D&D 2nd edition set of rules. It have the most depth story, a lot of side quest and the main quest is one of the best written I ever saw. The interaction between your party members is even better than anything done recently like Dragon age or Mass Effect\n\nThe enhaced edition add some cool features to the UI to simplify thing and make it easier for gamer to enjoy it, without removing its hardcore gameplay or any game design. There is 4 new playable NPC with their quest line and they are really awesome. There is more dialogue line and quest and a whole new campaign called "Black Pit 2" along with the original expension "Throne of Bhaal".

Who you are and what you have done have been generalised in a way that starting off in BG2 verses playing the first title of the series doesnt leave you lost.\n\nInfact, anything you may have lost in terms of playing BG1 is redoubled in the amazing expansion called Throne of Bhaal, which takes the story of your past , present and potential future to levels that werent even touched on in the first title.\nThis expansion is included in BG2 EE so if you choose to buy this remaster , you will miss very little in terms of story.\n\nIf your old enough to remember Terminator and then watch Terminator 2 year later will understand this completely because they share a common trait.  The second incarnation is so vastly superior to the first that there is no need to experience/watch the first.\n\nIm not going to beat a dead horse on the actual review of BG2:EE.\nThere are so many amazing reviews online that illustrate , far better than i could , all of the brillant traits that make this game one of the BEST RPG's of all time.\n\nWhat stands out for me is the writing and PACE of the game.\nBioware crafted BG2 in a way , in the quest structure, that you never feel very far off the beaten path towards the end. All the side quests are meant to compliment the main story in some way or another.\nAnd the side quests are easily the BEST of any RPG ive ever played.\nThat is not to undermind the main story at all, but only reiterate the strength of how impactful the side quests are.\n\nI mentioned the pace of the game and I wish there was a virtual table I could bang to get this point across.\nThere are so many past and present RPG's I play where I get so wrapped up in the vast open nature of a game that the main quest or objective becomes a second priority.\nThis isnt the case in BG2.\nBioWare cleverly crafted a way to keep the story in focus but give the player all the time they needed to explore and experiment. When you were ready, the story took main focus and ran forward at amazing speeds.\n\nBy the end of BG2 you feel satisfied. It truely is a complete story.\nYet if you feel is there more to the backstory that hasnt been complete, the expansion Throne of Bhaal answers them.\nThis expansion was made before the invention of DLC. Its a TRUE expansion with 20-30+ hours of content and RICH , character driven story. It could possibly be the best expansion ive played in my life.\nIt ends the story of a character you started from BG1 and ends it in excellent fashion.\n\nThis review was writtten for a very esoteric perspective. Made for a RPG fan who doesnt mind the learning curve of a good game and appreicates a epic story.  If there are gamers out there of this nature who havent played this game, I hope this review helps.\n\nIn the end, BG2 stand alone as one the best games ive ever played. It is a reminder that story, characters and solid gameplay trump impressive graphics and superfical gameplay.\n\nIm old enough to see the progression of gaming in a unique perspective.  I owned pong, i watched nintendo and sega battle out in console wars that lasted 3 generations of systems, the rise of the X-box and sony into the market and a game that was so massive that 12M people played it online at the same time.\n\nYet through all of this , even more than once when ive been amazed at a technical breakthrough, its how games have impacted me intellectually and emotionally that have stuck with me through the years.\n\nThis is one of those games.\n\n\n\n","January 13, 2015","true","67.3"," 197 of 238 people (83%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","83","197","238","9","4"

You wouldn't need something else to say.\n\nBut 2.0 update came out.\nIt did bring some improvements with it. Some spells and abilities were tweaked, a new class was added, some bugs fixed. Changes were made into a save system - now there are 4 slots for quicksaves. Cloudsaves and achievements were enabled. Off-hand weapons became equippable with launchers and two-handers, preventing constant jumping into inventory.  Further zooming is enabled. That's a good thing.\n\nSome of the graphics was changed. Outlines were added for sprites, for instance. This gave the game a cartoonish look, turning them off replaced thick lines with thin ones thus retaining cartoon style.\n\nAnd now, for the complete disaster of this update - UI. I don't know who came up with the idea that switching a classic interface which proven itself over years and perfectly fit for PC with a mobile version's UI was a good call, but this person needs to think again.\nLet's go over the interface screens separately.\n\nJournal. Now it looks like a plane tablet with two sheets of paper attached. It takes left part of the screen when active. It now stores active and completed quests together. It also now needs each entry separately, which means that if quest has numerous stages you need to click them all to view the whole quest. And "no objective" text almost on each entry.\nOld one kept active and completed quests separately, opened the whole quest for player in one click, looked like an open book and took the whole screen, blocking the player from the current situation and allowing to concentrate on reading (you wouldn't go into journal without pausing anyway). And it's the good old journal we're used to. So old one for me.\n\nMap. Turning on the map screen gives me the impression of receiving data from spy satellite:) Map notes really get in the way and disabling them removes  map marks as well. And the control pad on the local map looks completely alien, too. Travelling on the world map now requires either double click or clicking on the destination and then "travel" button instead of the single click of old world map. Improvement of new world map? It now always shows you the time needed to get to destination.\nOld map had a button to switch marks on/off. Hovering the cursor over map mark displayed their description in the special window. This allowed the player to get the info needed and to not overload the screen with text. It is also more aesthetically pleasing. Plus, it's something we're used to.\n\nInventory. The new inventory isn't really different from the old one. Improvement? It now shows how will character's AC, hp, Thac0 and damage will change if he/she equips item held with the mouse. Downgrade? Attacks per round value is removed from the "damage" box. Jumping between inventory and character sheet, yay!\n\nCharacter sheet.  Keeping  the info on separate screens is very inconvenient. Exp bars look out of place. I, for one, prefer to see the exact amount of exp my character has accumulated. Plus, a quick calculation never hurts. Aesthetically, it looks terrible. Seriously, old character sheet had everything you needed on ONE screen. If devs felt so strongly about changing something there they could just take the old sheet and make the info stored in the right side box, which was already broken into categories, foldable. This would allow the player to keep the necessary info on hand and hide the excess one.\n\nMage book/priest scroll. This is an example of actual improvement. It keeps the old aesthetics. It definitely is more informative as it gives the description without needing to pop up description windows for each and every spell and having to close it after. Left page – list of spells, right page – descriptions. Well done. Downside is if you have a vast spel repetoir, you have to scroll. Devs need to organize the left page so it can accomodate more spells. One way would be leaving just spell icons placed as tile.\n\nText bar is now manually expanded. A good decision. It now stores text without giant gaps as it did with dialogues. Definitely an improvement.\n\nSave/load screen. Should have kept “delete” button where it was - along with the “save/load” one. Now a player needs to click the save, then hover the cursor to the bottom of the screen and press “delete” instead of having it on hand. Plus, these save/load and delete buttons were made to be paired – one button had upper corners cut, the other bottom corners cut. A minor inconvenience and can be fixed by just making a “save” button symmetric. A bigger Inconvenience is that saves now change their order accordingly to date of change. That’s a bad thing if you have multiple walkthroughs simultaneously. But that’s not much of a problem, too.\n\nHealth bars. Not really a necessary thing, but someone might find this useful. A good thing, that devs thought that not everyone might like it and included the option to remove it.\nNew and new “old” hightlight circles. I didn’t like the new “new” highlight circles. The new “old” ones are much thinner like imported from some RTS game. I prefer the old thick ones. Still, for the option to keep the new “old” I’m grateful.\n\nThat’s all the criticism I can come up with now.\n\nOverall, this new update brought some nice tweaks, but with the exclusion of text bar and spell books, the UI is butchered. And since this is a “video”game, the update ruins a large part of player’s experience. I understand that new players might like new UI. But, I’m a new player myself and I found the older UI both more aesthetically pleasing and functional (again, with the exception of spell books and text bar).\n\nWhat we have now is literally Android port’s of BG interface glued to PC version for some unfathomable reason.\nBhaalspawn saga is considered classic for a reason and classic basically doesn’t need any changes. We’re now stuck with a heavy-metal version of Moonlight sonata.\n\nTL;DR Unless devs appease both parties by including an option of switching between old and new UI, I can’t recommend Steam version of this magnificent game. Hence, GoG.\n\n9.04.2016. Reverting to 1.3 actually started working. Took devs just 9 days to hand me back the product I payed for.","April 1","false","275.8"," 174 of 213 people (82%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","82","174","213","8","8"

The "Enhanced" version is actually WORSE than the original -- and that simply should not be! EG: 1) At least one of the "rez" spells DOESN'T -- it merely harms the caster and leaves the dead character dead. 2) The pathing of the characters, whether controlled by the player or the AI, is almost offensively nonsensical, resulting in members of the party wandering off in the OPPOSITE direction of where they are supposed to be heading or taking the most circuitous and perilous path to a space mere feet away. The AI will often halt a character mid-path and just leave them there, meaning you may find yourself missing a member of your party during an important battle. 3) The voices cut in and out, sometimes not even finishing sentences or words. 4) The "triggered" dialogue will sometimes skip ahead several steps, ruining some potential romances and preventing the player from making their own choices. 5) The AI-controlled party members will often disengage or cease attacking enemies, and casters will often stop casting spells or just freeze mid-spell. What is more, many characters will freeze in the middle of drinking a potion, meaning they receive no benefit from the potion but also cannot/will not fight back when attacked. 6) Many NPCs will simply stand in place, refusing to move, which can be game-breaking if they are blocking the only doorway or path to a game-crucial location. 7) Characters can have the wrong abilities for their class and/or race.\n\nIt's so bad, it's virtually unplayable at points. Sometimes you have to start the entire game over again and hope that an issue won't occur again. I've literally seen people in the official forums advising new players to just uninstall this and get the original, older version because it (ironically) has LESS bugs than this new "Enhanced" edition. A tragic wasted opportunity to revive a classic rpg.","February 12, 2014","false","131.6"," 220 of 288 people (76%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","76","220","288","4","12"

Therefore, the base quality is still there. The original game had beautiful 2d artwork used as locations and they held their eye candy to this day.\n\nWhat needed work was the paper dolls, spell effects, the UI, screen resolution (original one only supported 800 x 600 and 640 x 480) and one of the nightmares: 64 bit compatibility.\n\nThe initial release had bugs but at the moment, this game is quite solid. The story itself is probably one of the best modules ever written for Forgotten Realms. The characters (original ones) are all quite fun in their way and the newly added ones somewhat blend in. Although, they are neither as interesting as the original cast (like Minsc, Edwin or Jensen) nor their voice acting matches the quality of the original NPCs. Still, they don't disturb you much.\n\nI have probably played and completed Baldur's Gate 1, Tales from the Sword Coast, Baldur's Gate 2 and Throne of Bhaal over 20 times, modding them to the bone. Nowadays, I am replaying the EE and I am quite happy that it helped me return to an already favorite, not causing issues with my high end rig. I am already halfway through the game, saving Imoen, and wife laughs at me whenever she sees me mimic the NPCs and their war cries.\n\nNow that Pillars of Eternity and Torment: Tides of Numenera are coming, it would be nice to re-visit this masterpiece.","October 28, 2014","true","72.0"," 62 of 73 people (85%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","85","62","73","8","0"

This is no update, v2.0 EE is to BG2 what the fourth Indiana Jones film was compared to its predecessors, the difference being Spielberg only crapped all over the new film whereas Beamdog have taken the game I was in the middle of playing and made the UI, in particular the character arbitration screens, almost unfathomable even to someone who is a veteran of D&D style RPG's.  I don't care that you've added the Google maps zoom level view - what use can that honestly provide anyway when you are limited by line of sight??\n\nThis has to go down as as bad an "update" as Windows 8 was, unless there is a way to back out the v2.0 or Beamdog release a v2.1 which reverts certain "updates" or allows the users the choice of the "updated" or the better view I will no longer play EE, I will get out my old discs and play through them.\n\nIn summary, I would no longer recommend BG2EE it's like some hideous modders w*nkfest, I would however highly recommend BG2 - it's a great game, an epic game, a game that has yet to be truly surpassed with a very effective UI already in situ - the only thing I'd really miss from BG2 EE is the looting bar.\n\nWay to go Beamdog, looks like you've also lost a future sale of Windspear too","March 31","false","177.3"," 111 of 149 people (74%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","74","111","149","3","1"

It's one of my favorites of all time. The story is quite good, and there are so many different party/class configurations that will keep you coming back for more. There are a huge number of quests, a great deal of them with hours worth of content and multiple outcomes. Every class has their own unique quest chain, and there are numerous others for each side of the alignment spectrum. The game is hugely improved over Baldur's Gate 1, and there are even a few small improvements here over BG: EE.\n\nI like the additions that Beamdog made, but it's worth noting that this game is still very, very buggy - especially in online multiplayer. Unfortunately, it seems like they've created more problems than they've fixed. It can be tolerated or worked around, but people who have the original and are thinking of upgrading to this should perhaps weigh their options. If you're looking to play multiplayer, expect to see good old Biff the Understudy fairly often.\n\nMy personal favorite additions are the hugely reduced load times, auto-loot, and the conveniently organized/bulleted journal. I haven't played around a lot with the new NPCs, but I like them a lot so far. Their romance options, however, seem incredibly superficial at present. There is now a same-sex option for both males and females respectively, so that's nice, though both of these NPCs are unfortunately evil.\n\nThis version is compatible with a lot (although not all) of the countless mods created for this game over the last fifteen years, allowing you to configure your gameplay experience if the hundreds of hours of vanilla content aren't enough for you.\n\nI cannot recommend this game enough, and that extends also to the first game.

To go almost 70 hours into a game and have the UI changed this drastically without being able to switch back is annoying.

Unable to find anything on the Map now, the text for points of interest all overlap so can't read any of them now, find myself having to enter multiple doors to eventually find the correct one I'm looking for.  The new sprite outlines make the characters look like cartoons, have no interest in playing Scooby Doo (least this can be turned off).

No more blurry combat and squinting hard at the screen through a grainy and pixelated mess.\n\n3. There is a lot new content for this game. There are 4 new party members, and each has their own quest associated with them. And that goes for both SoA and ToB, so that is 8 new missions and 4 new party members.\n\n4. While still a little bit buggy, it's much less buggy than the original. And it's nothing you can't fix with the console commands.\n\nSome people don't think it's worth 25 dollars.

I loved the combat, the UI was tight, everything was well-polished when Beamdog re-released the game. I was actually in the middle of a run through the entire game on the hardest difficulty with only the main character...\n\nBefore IT happened.\n\nThe update to Siege of Dragonspear affected both games, and it's been nothing but negative for me so far. I can no longer access the Command Console (used for fixing the many glitches that can happen here and there), the UI is buggy and, when it does work, is clunky and, frankly, ugly as sin itself. My saves have all disappeared into the wind, and my character's data has become ridiculously bugged (Level 34 at the tail end of Throne of Bhaal suddenly turning into a level 17 with all of the items from her run through BG1 and 2? What?) and more.\n\nBefore now, I would have recommended this series in a heartbeat. This game, nearly two decades ago, defined and revived a dying RPG era. But now? Now it's nearly impossible to play.

Insane difficulty jumped from enemies doing 50% more damage to 100%, and Legacy of Bhaal makes the game nearly unplayable.\n\n\nAs it stands right now? DO. NOT. BUY. THIS. GAME.

Baldur's gate.\n\nI cant even tell you how many times i've played this game through to the end.  The world is massive, the NPCs feel human,  the quests are exciting, and the combat system is deep and nuanced.\n\nAnd then there's the 'Enhanced Edition'.\n\nIt's difficult for me to recommend the enhancements 'overhaul games' added to baldur's gate simply because there aren't very many of them.  Almost all of the issues which existed in 2001 are present in the enhanced edition.   This includes (but is not limited to) :\n\n- Cheating the combat system by initiating dialogue with a neutral NPC and then attacking them while they are stuck in the 'i want to talk to you' animation.\n- Casting a spell in an area covered by fog of war and having your spellcaster get stuck in an endless casting loop which never results in the spell actually being cast.\n- Pathfinding bugs\n- Awkward looting of certain objects which requires that your character be in a specific spot to interact with the object.\n\nI could go on.\n\nIn Overhaul's defense, they did add a few new NPCs to the mix, all of whom seem interesting and useful in their own right.  But it feels like they did this to try and distract from the underlying issue -  which is that they are adding icing on top of an old, rotting, cake.\n\nI love baldur's gate and i'm enjoying the enhanced edition, but Bioware / Black Isle deserve the credit for that,  not Overhaul.  Only get this if you are a rabid fan of anything Baldur's Gate (like me) and just want to have one last spin around Faerun.  Everyone else should probably just buy the original version from GOG.com.

Black borders around the menu screen regardless of resolution, the Barbarian is tossed into the Fighter sub-class category, the original new portraits are replaced with some new-new portraits, and a slew of bugs and incompatability problems that make the game bug out more than it ever has before.\n\nSome mage specialties are impossible to play as (such as Transmuter) because now you need to have a specialty school assigned for every rank during character creation. Except the problem is that not every school has a spell at every rank, which means character creation comes to a screeching halt when selecting your skills.\n\nMaking any kind of spell caster is a pain too, because they decided to throw away the Pick For Me option and make it automatically pick for you; as if you're too stupid to make your own decisions.

Originally released in 2000, you should really play the first before considering getting the second as it DIRECTLY follows the storyline created in Baldur's Gate 1 and starts you at a much higher level. Therefor, if you haven't played it yet, head over to the Baldur's Gate 1: Enhanced Edition first and then come back and buy this game for it is fantastic.\n\nBoth Enhanced Editions offer a much more convenient experience with some great solid new content. Baldur's Gate 2: Enhanced Edition offers four new companions, each with a great storyline and dialogue, new class and race combinations and  "The Black Pits 2" campaign (an arena-style combat campaign). They are both definitely worth getting as they are the definite modern way to experience these fantastic classic games that offer a tremendous amount of content, quests, great dialogue and a huge sense of freedom. Visually there have been few improvements, and a shocking lack of options is disturbing, but if you can set aside these problems and have the patience to learn these obviously outdated gameplay mechanics then both Baldur's Gate 1: Enhanced Edition and Baldur's Gate 2: Enhanced Edition are absolutely worth it.\n\nFull review (Includes BG1: Enhanced Edition): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5qqfOXRRaA","December 17, 2013","true","169.5"," 29 of 36 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","29","36","0","0"

I'm not going to comment on whether or not the series is good or bad since it goes without saying that any rpg fan needs to at least give it a spin. What's important and what I struggled with since the enhanced editions launched was whether or not these new editions were worth it, or whether or not I should just dust off my CD copies from the days of yore.\n\nIt's true that there isn't anything in the enhanced editions that can't already be done with mods. The last time I tried installing the CD versions and modding it all up was a tedious experience though. It's also true that the added content is forgettable; the Black Pits is something that I'll never touch and the new NPCs range from tolerable (Neera, for example) to poor (Hexxat, for example).\n\nBut I couldn't care less about the above. For me it boiled down to two things: One, was this version easier to set up and two, was this version buggier than the originals. The enhanced editions are no doubt easier to jump into on a modern computer due to many of the enhancements mirroring typical mods that you'd want to install (porting BG1 to the ToB engine, for example). Many of the community's mods have been updated for the Enhanced editions as well, so you can still cry in a fetal position as Swords Coast Stratagems mages rip you to shreds if that's your thing.\n\nNow, bugginess is obviously dependent on many variables and I can only experience my own playthrough of the series, but apart from one crash to desktop in the opening dungeon of BG2 my playthrough from BG1 to ToB was smooth and clean. The official forums would make you think that the game is a bug ridden mess and it kept me away from purchasing for months, but I do not regret purchasing it in its current state. I won't be touching my CD copy of the series again.","July 30, 2014","true","85.6"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","21","24","0","0"

I promise to change that one day soon.\n\nI'll start by addressing my low playtime on here. I bought the steam version before it supported Mac, foolishly without checking, and because I spend almost all my time on it throughout the day I knew I was never going to play on my main rig - so I purchased it again from the AppStore.\n\nAs for a review, the EE version of BG2 doesn't change much of the original game, but what it does do is fix it and update it. It brings compatibility with different resolutions, bug fixes, smoothness. The whole shabang. It's startling that since playing the Enhanced Edition I've not had a single crash, save game fail, or random lack of an NPC or item vital to completing a quest - all of which I have experienced in the past a number of times on my countless playthroughs. The EE's main strength is that it optimises it for modern hardware (not that it was hard to run in the first place) and as a result runs smoother than a velvet undergarment.\n\nBut what I would say about the Enhanced Edition is that at no point did it feel like I was playing a different version of BG2 (aside from it's lack of faults) which in one way is fantastic as the game was near-perfect anyway, but in another way feels like a bit of a con given the price difference - if you're happy to put up with the occasional bug or crash, then £15 is a bit steep compared to the £5 the original is available elsewhere.\n\nIn the end, for me, the multi-platform capability and faultless gameplay of the EE version on here justifies what is, in all honesty, not too much to ask for one of the greatest games of all time. You just have to ask if the extra £10 is worth it to you.","May 25, 2015","true","0.5"," 28 of 37 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","28","37","0","0"

Since 2000, when Black Isle Studios finally released this role-playing game (rpg) sequel of its signature series Baldur’s Gate, the fan community has significantly grown in numbers.\n\nThis lavishly produced game quickly established itself as the most compelling, intelligent and exciting rpg available for PC. After Fallout, Planescape: Torment and Icewind Dale it was the next milestone of unparalleled quality, its renown extending far beyond the boundaries of the genre. For instance, the people, who were not interested in the rpg genre at all, were drawn to it, and particularly praised the smart and sophisticated gameplay.\n\nThe protagonist and companions have an incredible chemistry, and are surrounded by some of the most vivid and compelling fantasy creatures ever created. The storytelling is epic, and the memorable characters offer loads of witty and mature dialogues. Furthermore, the different classes, alignments and team combinations create an amazing replayability.\n\nIn addition, the expansion – called Throne of Bhaal – offers up enough gameplay improvements, innovations, technical advances, and new content to justify itself as a worthy add-on to the main game.\n\nAmusing quotes:\n\n“Edwin do this. Edwin do that. Someone get this jerk a banana!”\n\n“I wanted infravision like the elves... But 'tis more than just taking their eyes.”\n\n“Boo points, I punch. Is very simple relationship, but it is effective.”\n\nTrivia:\n\nDuring the game's development, a quality assurance department was added to BioWare, and the game's publishers lent their assistance in testing.

These two RPGs are simply the pillar of western production of this genre, and when the two are combined in a single game they definitively are among the top 10 of the must-play for every PC gamer out there, no matter the age.\n\nBG:EE and BG2:EE are simply THE definitive Dungeons & Dragons experience, including almost all the possible 2.5 Edition Core and several optional rulebooks of the Forgotten Realms setting and translating them into a marvellous duo of 3rd person games.\n\nAlthough both games are very old (they were developed and published between 1998 and 2001 by Bioware / Black Isle Studios), they have been “enhanced” and made available on modern systems (including Windows 7/8/10 PCs, OSx, Android and IOS) by the guys at Overhaul Games / Beamdog, who not only re-tooled the original Infinity Engine to make it run on modern platforms, but also added several other goodies that were not present in the original release, in addition to bug fixes and standard “curator” jobs.\nI could go on for pages and pages describing in detail the marvels of the Baldur’s Gate Series, but I’ll try to cut it short and stick to a much shorter format.\n\nPROs\n- Ever dreamed of taking your typical AD&D session with your friends out of the pen & paper setting to a PC screen? This game is for you!\n- Charismatic characters and companions: Minsc the Ranger (and Boo!), Jaheira, Viconia, Xzar, Sarevok… what else can I say?\n- Longevity: both games combined are well over 100 hours of gameplay\n- Replayability: seriously, there are hundreds of possible combinations of classes / races / kits / alignments / companions / choices to completely change your experience at every playthrough\n- Every action you make affects the game world, like it is expected from a proper Western RPG. Apart from some scripted events to progress with the main story, the rest is up to you\n- Multiplayer: join with 5 friends to create a fully custom party!\n- The (new) developers are supporting the game with patches and fixes, and they actually listen to the community\n- Compatible with most of the original BG / BG2 community mods\n- Runs on every system, even your mobile phone / tablet (NOTE: the Android / IOs versions are separate purchases). HW requirements are very low\n\nCONs\n- After more than 16 years from my first BG playthrough I still cannot find a single flaw in any of these games. They are simply a masterpiece.\n\nIn a nutshell, these games set THE standard all the following RPGs on the market were measured against, and none of them was able to surpass Baldur’s Gate until now.\n\nBuy them, play them, enjoy them. 12/10, would pickpocket Drizzt again","January 5, 2015","true","41.1"," 23 of 30 people (77%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","77","23","30","5","2"

In order to tweak base attributes, I had to really try clicking on the + - buttons.\n\n-I wanted to start a Fighter/Mage.  I found the spell selection went from a grid/icon view, to a list/icon view.  Before you were able to at one glance see all the spells you had selected and all the available spells.  Now, you can only see about 5 at a time.  You have to then scroll down to see the other options.  Not a good design decision, and I can't imagine this being better on a tablet either...\n\nI've clocked a LOT of time into this game, not even mentioning the legacy version.  I like to re-visit this game every-so-often as well.  Upon doing so last night I was horrified.\n\nAfter accidentally choosing the wrong spells I gave up in frustration.

However, I can't recommend this "enhanced" edition.\n\nI spent quite some time debating whether or not to recommend this game. It boils down to this: The original content is great. Still is, still always will be. It's an epic adventure with great characters, good plot development and fantastic modified-2nd edition gameplay. The graphics show their age, of course, but there are still some great backdrops and whatnot. The dialogue in this game is probably the best of any game ever made -- epic when it needs to be, and hilarious otherwise.\n\nWhy I don't recommend this game is the new content, which is poorly written and boring. The new characters are written by people who clearly don't comprehend the wit of the original game, but think they do. It's painful.\n\nSeriously, go find the original version on the internet somewhere for a much cheaper price, and enjoy. If you can't find it or just want a Steam version (which is what I did), then go for it!

I have noticed far more bugs in the enhanced version of the game then I ever did in the origional, including broken spells. monster spawns, and quests.\n\n2. The price... need I say more $25 for an improved UI and multiplayer, 4 extra characters, a new expansion, and a host of new bugs, when you can get the original bioware clasic for $10 from other places.\n\n3. With the improved engine comes a lack of settings present in the original, one of the more important being the number of pathing nodes, the enhanced version seems to be set at the default 400,000 nodes with out any way of changing it, so prepair for plenty of "You must gather your party before venturing forth"\n\nAll in all I have still put in 20.5hrs in the last 2 weeks acording to steam and I plan on putting in many more just for the sake of finishing what I started, but I would definitely recommend waiting for it to go on sale before getting it unless you are a die hard fan like me and must have it right away.\n\n-Every hamster has his day!","December 2, 2013","true","30.2"," 18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","18","24","0","2"

At least for me personally. I still rate this to be one of the best games ever so can't really write about it neutrally/objectively.\n\nEpic story, ageless visual style, brilliant voice acting and sounds overall, interesting tactical combat, solid controls though mayhaps a bit outdated for the modern gamer (very natural for me as I played this at an age when I didn't even speak English), challenging, the writing on the party members is just gold and the list goes on.\n\nThrough the game it's great how you feel as the power of your party increases steadily and towards the end of the game you have seriously strong bunch of badasses wearing rare powerful gear, with stories of their own. And as you've finished the game you can't but help feel touched by what an awesome literally epic adventure of struggle and finding what and who you are and what is your destiny in the world you've traversed through.\n\nTo keep it short I'm gonna stop rambling here. I'm suggesting this game to anyone whose loved the old CRPGs and pretty much to any fantasy RPG lover. I'm sure it's going to feel a bit old and rough to get into for some but if you put the time to play it in length, get into it, play through it, I'm sure it'll be an interesting and rewarding game experience for you.","September 2, 2015","true","33.0"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","14","19","2","0"

Well, lets start with the flaws. Whoever designed the romances had a thing for elves. That's it really. That's the only thing close to a flaw. It's an amazingly solid game filled with some fantastic characters and some genuinely imaginative quests that rewards careful planning and thinking things through, something modern games seem to have abandoned in favour of letting players just facetank everything. The challenges combined with the brilliant characters just make winning so much better, especially when that one fight you thought was impossible suddenly turns out to be easier than eating cake when you think to try one of the fun little counters to whatever was petrifying you/eating you/setting you on fire/Charming Minsc, setting him to BLEND and sending him back after you.\n\nCarrying a character through from a level one scrub in Baldur's Gate and into Baldurs Gate two then onto Throne of Bhaal is an amazing journey full of frustration, laughter, lots of swearing and ultimately watching your level 40 character effortlessly wipe out entire armies is something everyone should do at least once.\n\nHamsters and rangers everywhere, rejoice!\n","November 30, 2013","true","56.8"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TekDragon/recommended/257350/","TekDragon","TekDragon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TekDragon/","485 products in account","Baldur's Gate 2 EE is frequently (but not always) given the crown for best of the classic isometric Forgotten Realms RPGs, and that reputation is well deserved. With a dark and provacative main story arc, the ability to play as both good and evil with alignment-appropriate companions, side quests with enough content to rival main quests in other games, compelling companions with deep stories, and a RTwP (real time w/ pause) combat system that manages to make combat both chaotic and strategic - BG2EE should be a slam-dunk recommend. Unfortunately the game does have flaws, and I'll use this review to detail these weaknesses so that users on the fence can make an informed decision before buying.\n\nBG2EE owes much of its incredible story to the environment in which its set. The Dungeons and Dragons universe is rich with both lore and mechanics. While the game unarguably benefits from the rich lore, the same cannot be said of the mechanics. The AD&D ruleset, cumbersome and obtuse even in its time during pen and paper play, is a harsh ruleset for a PC RPG.\n\nNew players will need to spend a substantial amount of time learning about AC, THAC0, weapon proficiences, Ability Score modifiers, weapon enchantment levels, combat protection spells, spell protection spells, various dispels, and so much more. Diving into the game without a basic understanding of these rules will almost certainly lead to a 'gimped' charachter and near-guaranteed slaughter by certain encounters.\n\nThe need for an intimate understanding of the rulesets is made worse by the choices the developers made in crafting companions. Your companions, while having emotionally compelling stories that draw you deeply into the game, will join your party with weapon profeciencies and leveling decisions that are questionable (at best). My recommendation on this is to download EEKeeper and use it to tweak your companions' weapon proficiencies. Problem solved, so long as you have the dicipline to not break the game by boosting instead of tweaking.\n\nYou'll find another flaw with BG2EE when you examine how the story is balanced. Completionists (as I imagine most hardcore RPG players looking at this title are) will want to complete all available sidequests before advancing to the next main story chapter. In BG1EE, this worked fine. Every chapter unlocked additional sidequests in a relatively steady flow. Not so in BG2EE. You'll step out of the introductory dungeon with the vast majority of the game's sidequests front loaded. Literally dozens of hours of deep, rich content that will you keep you enthralled for days before you even touch the main quest.\n\nNormally this wouldn't be an issue, and most would consider it a good thing, except the main story arc's hook is to remove from play one of your best (imo) companion choices. This made party selection more difficult than it needed to be, at least for me.\n\nTo wrap this review up, which has now become my longest review to date, I'll say this:\n\nIf you're willing to play the prequel and immerse yourself in the story and willing to take the time to learn the mechanics, plan out your party choices, and use EEKeeper to  tweak those companions - Baldur's Gate 2 EE will be guaranteed to be one of your most unforgetable gaming experiences. If not, you're still likely to have a great time, but the experience may be tainted by frustration and confusion.","January 15, 2014","true","81.6"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nupraptor1/recommended/257350/","nupraptor1","Azimuth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nupraptor1/","375 products in account","Baldur's Gate II:EE is the combined pack of Shadows of Amn+Throne of Bhaal which continue and conclude the story of Gorion's ward and their ascension into Godhood. BGII is arguably one of the best roleplaying games of all time with an incredibly deep, intricately woven and dark story that plays host to one of the best game villains and a plethora of tangential side missions, stories and npcs that make the world of Faerun come to life.\n\nShadows of Amn's story begins shortly after the events of the original Baldur's Gate, the opening cinematic and cutscene opens with your character being the unwilling constituent in the antagonist's demented BDSM fantasies. Little is revealed initially other than his name, Irenicus and he has shown some interest in you, or more specifically your heritage. His experiments are quickly interrupted by a besieging rival guild and in the ensuing chaos you are able to escape and you begin your journey in pursuit of Irenicus and his ilk to seek out your revenge.\n\nYour adventure will see you travel the city of coin, Athkatla and the surrounding countryside of Amn as you pursue Irenicus down the Sword Coast. Throughout your travels you'll slowly learn the motivations and misdeeds that drive Irenicus and your interactions with him reveal the true nature of your lineage. Irenicus is a solid and well written antagonist although he isn't as insidious or devious as Sarevok.\n\nDefeating Irenicus will throw you into Throne of Bhaal which is the culmination of the Bhaalspawn saga which pits you against the other most powerful Bhaalspawn in a Highlander-esque showdown to become the reincarnation of Bhaal himself. 'There can be only one..'\n\nThe gameplay is essentially unchanged from the first Baldur's Gate, at least at its core, it's still very tactical realtime combat with the ability to pause. Overall though the 'meta' is very different with [arcane] spellcasters being very strong in BGII due to the increased level cap and access to higher level spells and the abundance of powerful items, where as BGI was much easier as a warrior. Generally though the combat feels more enjoyable with a wider array of tools at your disposal and a greater array of vastly differing enemies to fight makes many battles feel varied and memorable. The further you push through the story of SoA and into ToB the more action oriented the game and combat will become as enemies get tougher and your character grows stronger. The increase in action will help accomodate for the weaker story in ToB. Overall though the combat is still very slow comparatively with any Arpg as it is designed to take some level of strategy and meticulous planning to succeed in BGII.\n\nGraphically the Baldur's Gate series is timelessly beautiful because of the development decision to use painted 2d backdrops. The spell effects still look amazing and vary greatly between spells. The character models on the otherhand have not aged well and look very bland, pixelated and blurry but is a minor grievance in the grand scheme of things.\n\nHaving completed this game several times now, both playing with a full player created party, solo and then picking up npcs along the way the game offers a lot of replayability whether it be from the particular challenges and different strategies required of each class during fights with certain enemies and bosses or from the story arcs and commentary provided by the npcs you choose. This is a thinking man's game so if you're looking for a game with which to turn your brain off and have some mindless fun you may wish to reconsider. Those looking for a challenge and a riveting story this is the game for you. On a personal note, this is one of my favourite games of all time and I recommend it wholeheartedly, especially to those that enjoy a good rpg.","April 2, 2015","true","56.5"," 15 of 23 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","15","23","0","0"

The story picks up directly after Baldur's Gate 1, so I would say its definitely necessary to play that game before this one and for the fact that it gives a much better pacing in the actual gameplay because in BG1; You start off as a lowly level 1 and can slowly learn all the ins and outs of the DND 3.5 system and fight smaller challenges because in BG2, you start off at a much higher level with advanced skills and greater challenges to face and might possibly have some difficulty especially if you choose a hard area to go to first.\n\nThis game is also one of the biggest games I've ever played and that's saying a lot because this wasn't 80+ hours of messing around...it was all me trying to just playthrough the game and doing most of the quests. Speaking of quests, after the initial dungeon, you are treated to an entire chapter where essentially you are free to explore and do as many interesting sidequests as you please and this will take you most of your time playing through the game, but doing a good amount of them is also the key to even be a high enough level to take on the main storyline, but the quests  are varied and interesting enough that you might not even want to touch the story for a long time (even as urgent as it is)\n\nAll this and I've barely even mentioned that after you finish this extremely lengthy game that there is the expansion called Throne of Bhaal which adds another 15-20 hours of gameplay and picks up right where the story left off and it adds even more to such an amazing game.\n\nIn Conclusion, I would recommend this game to any WRPG fan and even just fans of the genre in general. There might be a bit of a learning curve because of all the DND talk, but a few google searches or even just doing the in-game tutorials will help you understand things better, so no need to be overwhelmed.","December 10, 2013","true","78.3"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

Beamdog in all their 'enhanced editions' has managed to introduce game breaking and software breaking bugs that can only be cured by running the Linux versions in a Linux steam. and even then this solution is not neccessarily an end all. if you're not old enough to still own your 4CD BGII: SoA and Disks for ToB then i reccomend getting it from GoG. Beamdog totally destroyed any semblance of quality in the BEST RPG series ever made.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nissue:\n\n1) if you have had a different experience that is great, that is, in fact, VERY GOOD. however is does not discount the numerous bugs and performance concerns you can find that match and exceed the ones i have seen in 30 seconds with google or bing or whatever search engine you prefer. so please do not post drivel about how "my experience trumps your experience". hardware and software are complicated and undoubtedly people will have conflicting experiences, KEEP IT TO YOUR SELF.\n\n2) Using a decent intel processor seems to remedy much of the issues in terms of performance. however the performance requirements of the game should allow for anything AMD FM1/Phenom II or even Core 2 but they do not and those systems will, in my experience completely fail at running the game when a lot is going on. this, in some cases prevents issues with the GPU however intel and NVidia GPUs still seem to have framerate issues when a lot of activity is present.\n\nfinal note: the issues with the HUD are almost always a CPU issue. also any card that is being controlled with a driver that uses an OpenGL version higher than stated in the GPU spec (note 500 series NVidia cards only technically go to 4.1 but modern 500 series driver uses 4.4)  will possibly have issues.\n\ntl;dr this game used to run well and it doesn't universally run well anymore, use the original on GoG or if you have the disks, the only reason to buy a beamdog update is for IceWind Dale because the old infinite engine ran on IPX for multiplayer which is no longer supported outside of WindowsXP and is only workable for local area networking.\n\nThe March 31 update for this is UNSIGHTLY, UGLY, and ultimately destroys any semblance of authenticity to the aesthetics of the original and should not be bought. as of now i will be using the original from GoG or my CDs, THIS IS AN AFFRONT TO THE USERS AND SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN DONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","July 15, 2015","false","555.8"," 46 of 83 people (55%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","55","46","83","4","7"

Well they would be correct mostly however there are a few notable improvements, mainly the new introduction of multiple new characters each with there own areas and quests thrown in which does provide quite a few extra hours of interesting places to explore. The other note I will make on people who owned the previous game is that not everyone is into messing around with mods and tweaking the game, what this does is pretty much give you all those tweaks in a nice easy to use bundle which suits me just fine.\n\nFor those of you that have never played baldurs gate 2 or the first one I would suggest getting that one first and then playing through. The reason why is because this in my opinion is simply Bioware's story telling at it's absolute finest, you know the good stuff before EA came along and basically ♥♥♥♥♥ the companies games  like they did so many other's "cough mass effect". "cough dragon age 2". Not that i really had over tone problems with dragon age 2 it was just the fact that I had to upset my companions by turning down the OTT sexual harressment from my general party members if your into that it's cool not judging but anyway i digress. #\n\nUltimately however I have written this review off the top of my head in about the last 2 minutes so it is most probably full of typo's and spelling errors feel free to correct me.\n\nSolid combat system\nSolid inventory system\nSolid plot line\nSolid party characters that you can love I mean Minsc is da man\nSolid villans both first and second game.\n\nWhen you consider that they can create these characters without the CGI of newer games like mass effect or the voice over acting just done through partial voice acting and mostly text is a testament to how well written the dialogue in this game is.\n\nThe more notable flaws I would say are in summation\n\nHas not really done much to improve on the original few extra chars and high res\nCertain classes do have limited abilities however this is probably because they stayed quite true to the D&D rule set 2nd edition could be third... unsure never played D&D off the computer.\nCertain classes defintely kick out way more power at certain levels to others this game can be power gamed.\nFew bugs in places but nothing major imo.\nAction pace can be slow for some but i liked this made me feel emersed in the game like i actually was going to a tavern and meeting characters and conversing instead of just fight fight fight....\n\n","January 7, 2014","true","77.7"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","14","22","0","0"

If you can get a single party properly imported from Baldurs Gate Enhanced Edition version of the Black Pits (this games Enhanced predcessor) then add another achievment to your wall of meaningless trophies.  Give yourself about 10 trophies if you can get through either games original campaign without an interesting, brand new to the EE bug that stops you in your tracks and forces at best a fall back to an older save (you are saving every 12 seconds yes?  that should be part of the Store page for these flawed and broken releases).\n\nWhat it boils down to is this:  this game is inferior in every way that its possible to be to the original or digital releases of the games, with some mods applied.

Oh, and there are some changes to the original games cutscenes that, for some people, are heinous because they change the tone of certain areas.  I am not that bothered by it, you can always look at the original cutscenes on youtube, but its something that should be noted.  Its the bugginess and lack of anything meaningful added that gives these EE's a big fat NOPE.gif","July 16, 2014","false","92.1"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

Hexxat is a really cool new character.\nThe game is pretty difficult, but if you are willing to adapt and try new things you can win. I actually have died more in BG:2 in the first 3 chapters then I have in all of dark souls and demon souls combined.\nTons of improvements over the old game. The red diamond for mass looting is amazing.\n\nCons:\nGameplay really didn't age well.\nFound a few minor bugs, nothing game breaking yet.\nThe slower pace takes a bit to get used to. It is an punishing game if you rush.\n\nOverall the game holds up well and I recommend it if you like any of the other games that use the infinity engine.","November 29, 2013","true","175.3"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

I've been playing this game for years and loved it. Unfortunatly I lost the disks during a recent move and was crushed to learn I could play my fav game. I've never really used steam and when I was surfing the store I saw this on sale for $10. Needless to say I was delighted to no end. I bought there and was surprised by all the added content to the original game.\n\nI have probably several hundred hours on the old version and this new Extended Edition has made some changes that I find interesting and helpful.\n\nBGEE has some small changes such as loot finder, improved combat rolls, character creation, inventory perks, ect. But the change that got my attention was the item stacking increase.\n\nI have played about every role there is to play in this game, but my most favorite is the ranger/Archer. The old problem was never having enough arrows. The old game had arrows in stacks of 40, now they stack to 80. Potions as well have increased up to 20, the old was 5. Small but very important changes like this make the game more enjoyable without having to fret over the constant nuscience of running out of supplies all the time.\n\nAlso there is a inreased amount of data availible about Armor Class, Damage Throws, Thaco, ect. that wasn't in the original. You can now see how much damage your charcters can take and deal (and how fast) with relative ease. Another useful feature, is the fact you can now zoom in and out to adjust the point of veiw of the game. A wider range of resalutions give the most access to play on any screen (I'm playing on a laptop). The perk about the EE is that it plays seemlessly with any version of windows. I'm currebtly running on Windows 8 and works without a hitch thus far.\n\nIf you've played this before and need more information on the changes made you visit the community page (also many tips on what class to start with and the changes made to the roles of each one). All in all a very good remastering of a classic and deffinatly recommend this game to new and old players alike.\n\nHappy Gaming :)","November 19, 2015","true","61.8"," 22 of 38 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","22","38","2","0"

I added a couple player-made mods that I didn't want to have to scour the net to find again the next time I wanted to play.\n\nI heard people screaming about Beam Dog molesting my 2nd favorite game of all time and against my better judgement, I gave Beamdog the benefit of the doubt.  I installed it cleanly from Steam and loaded it up, started creating a new character and felt like I'd just taken a sip of beer spiked with Rohypnol.  I continued though determined to see all the changes they've made.  "Surely they can't have completely destroyed this masterpiece." I foolishly told myself as I finished creating my character.\n\n"Oh god, those sprites look terrible" These were my first words upon seeing the opening scene with Jon Irenicus. Every sprite now has gaudy thick black outlines, completely ruining the way the original developers seamlessly melded their spritework with the prerendered backdrop of the game world.  I hurredly retreated to the options menu to tweak everything as best I could back to the original.  The menus look so tiny now on my 23 inch monitor.  The UI overall doesn't scale well how it did before.\n\nThe map is awful, the journal is awful, the character sheet is awful, the inventory is awful, the spellbook is awful.  Even the gods damned Save/Load screen is awful!  How could Beamdog mess up this badly?  It's like they purposely made everything worse, piece by piece.\n\nI can tell a lot of things they changed for "streamlining" but this is a classic crpg.  We know how to play D&D computer games, we learned how when the game first came out with no problem.  Why do you feel the need to dumb this down?\n\nI didn't continue playing this way.  How could I?  I'm not a fan of people staying in marriages where the husband continually beats and rapes his wife, and that is what Beamdog is doing to every fan of the Baldur's Gate series.  Something truly wicked is happening within this company.  I saw the signs when that accursed liberal politics expansion was released for Baldur's Gate I.\n\nI opened up my archived BG2 install directory and copied the entire contents over this new patch, I've erased the abomination from my own PC, but I won't stop there.\n\nBeamdog, this is directly for you.  I am going on a full assault against you.  You are Jon Irenicus holding my sister prisoner and experimenting on her in disgusting and abhorrent manners.  I'm going to assemble a party and come after you. You will roll back these changes, you will publicly apologize for being child molestors of all Baldur's Gate fans.  And you will relinquish your rights of this game to a different group who will treat it and its fans with the respect it deserves.\n\nI never thought I would be posting a negative review of one of the greatest games of all time.  Look at what you've made me do.\n\nAll you had to do was fix some bugs.  Instead you wanted war.  Well, now you've got it.","June 3","false","93.3"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

The Enhanced Edition doesn't really change much except add things that were added through mods, and add 4 new characters; Neera, Dorn, Rashaad, and Hexxat. Each character has a romance arc, a major quest in SoA, and a quest in ToB. So far I have mostly played with Neera (been bouncing back and forth between B♥♥♥♥nd BG2EE to pay mods that are not BG2EE ready), and the dialogue she has is hilarious. Also some areas have been slightly altered like the Order of the Radiant Heart. If you love B♥♥♥♥nd want to see what they changed, then I would say buy this game when its on sale. If you do not care about any of the new characters, then I would just go get it off GOG. Regardless I like BG2:EE for the most part. Also several of the NPC mods have been updated for BG2:EE. I have played BG/BGEE 5 times, and BG2/BG2EE at least 15 times, so if you play the game a lot the enhanced edition is worth the money.","June 11, 2014","true","89.7"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

It was Bioware's Magnum Opus, their "Dark Side of the Moon", if you will. The Enhanced Edition is the same game, but there are some improvements that I feel make it a better experience. The improvements in BG2:EE are actually more helpful in BG2:EE than they were in BG:EE. BG2 severely lacked Evil aligned party members, most notably a thief. This has been rectified in the Enhanced edition, and you can now play a fully Evil aligned party. Dorn, Neera, and Rasaad return from BG:EE, each with their own extensive questlines, as well as a new companion, Hexxat the neutral evil Thief. The companion questlines span the length of the game, with additional quests every few chapters, concluding in Throne of Bhaal. Of course, these companions are totally optional, but I do feel they are a very welcome improvement if you happen to play an Evil party. Of course, the other Enhanced edition improvements are also here, like the name, object, and contaniner highlighting when pressing tab, as well as the adjustable zoom. They are very helpful, and make the experience much more enjoyable for a modern audience. Another cool thing is that a few new items will be  imported into Irenicus's dungeon if you happened import from the original BG:EE. They are nothing special, and they are mostly just items that you would find semi-early in the game anyway, but it's a helpful addition. On the subject of bugs, this game is significantly better than it was on release, but I did notice a few bugs along the way. Granted they were bugs present in the original game, but they were there. They were easily rectified by use of the developer console, and were very rare throughout my 220 hour playthrough, but just be aware you may or may not have to deal with that. Over all, I think BG2:EE is a fantastic game, just like the original. If you love Baldur's gate 2 and are itching for another playthrough, it is definitely worth it. If you haven't played Baldur's Gate 2, it is even more worth it, as this is the definitive version of one of the finest games ever crafted. Even at full price, you will get your moneys worth, as this game is around 200+ hours long.\n\nIf you are going to play BG2:EE I highly recommend you try out BG:EE first, as you will be more familiar with the new companions, as well as be able to import your character. Check out my highly rated review of that if you are on the fence.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/infernal_machine/recommended/228280/","March 31, 2015","true","223.0"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","2"

The Writing - Quite simply, above and beyond anything you find in most modern games.  A compelling story (IF YOU LIKE HIGH FANTASY), memorable characters, beautiful set-pieces, and the best flavor text in any game...well, maybe ever.  If you love fantasy epics, this one is a classic!\n\n2.) The D&D - Let's face it: this is a Dungeons and Dragons game.  For people playing it for that reason, it delivers!  A perfectly (well...mostly) executed take on 2nd/3rd editions, with the best parts of both (THAC0 forever!) mixed together in a way that translates well.  To get the true D&D experience, show the dice rolls in terminal and and pause after every round.\n\n3.) The Graphic Design - Yes, by today's standards, this looks like an indy game.  But what a game!  Beautiful static backgrounds...I mean, hang them on your wall gorgeous.  Excellent effects that made the spells and effects really pop off the screen.  Detailed, well animated sprites that gave the characters a sense of life that other, similar games still struggle to achieve.  The monsters were so varied and detailed, it's a wonder the game didn't win more awards than it did.\n\nThere are some downsides.  It's a big game, takes hundreds of hours to do everything.  The gameplay can be frustratingly hard for the uninitiated (PROTIP: drink all the potions!!!!), and the lack of quest markers and waypoints and glowing exclamation points means the casual gamer will be lost without a walk-through guide.\n\nBut if you're like me - and if you are reading this, you probably are - and you want an old-school, authentic experience, BG2 is IT!  It's a masterpiece that I will continue to play into my waning years.

I've spent about 500 h (at least) playing original BG Saga and BG 2 EE it is good old Baldur enchanced to today requirements (improved graphics and add use without problem of new windows systems). I would not tell anything about story to avoid spoilers and only admit that is one of best, if not best, in all games ever. Graphics is ok (only when zoom very close you can see pixels), music is perfect and game is hard (not like todays games which are just easy), there are many ways to resolve quests too. For me there are  only two disadvantage. They're only english version of game (original BG 2 have best polish version ever) and uncompability with most of mods. So I can refer with pure hart to buy this game but maybe it will good to wait when more mods would me formated to works with EE as they add much content to game (you can as well buy original game and install mods which enchanced graphics etc etc ).","February 8, 2014","true","109.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It took me years to finally complete it. I'd wager an experienced player can get it done in a week or more. No less.\n\nBaldur's Gate is hands-down one of the best games I've ever played. While initially, porting D&D into a tactical real-time gameplay setting should set off some alarm-bells, this game is one of the most tactical games I've ever played, requiring precison, patience and understanding.\n\nIt's also a roleplaying game that allows you to explore the, now venerable Forgotten Realms setting that I grew up with (Fantasy books ect.). It features a soundtrack and memorable characters that you will NEVER forget. You'll find yourself hearing things in real life, that almost makes you burst out a quote from this old gem, that no one will get.\n\nThe biggest problem with Baldur's Gate, is that it's ancient by now... Which is where the enhanced edition comes in!\nUpgrading the game to HD and even upgrading the game engine and interface to the same standard as the sequel is exactly the kind of boost the game needed to become playable, even to people who didn't grow up with it.\n\nEnhanced edition also features some new content. While I appreciated this, I'll be honest and say that I didn't quite feel that this new content entirely fit with the mood of the original game. It was a bit too... Humorous and... Cute. I mean, considering the rather dark underlining theme of the game and the story, it just didn't feel quite right, but this is to be expected as the update was done by a third party.\n\nBaldur's Gate, to me, is the predecessor to all modern RPG's.","September 29, 2014","true","81.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

The amount of depth and story put into each character is beyond that of the "Dragonborn" from Skyrim, or the protagonist from Fable series or even those in the Dragon Age series. The perks of completing each quest are well worth it, anything from gaining better loot to sell, high end equipable items to owning keeps/strongholds. To those like me, who are fairly new to rpgs, I would highly recommend this game as I have enjoyed every minute of it. I have been getting my ♥♥♥♥ handed to me lately, and I applaud the fact you have more than enough allies to find and recruit to go with you into your party, so if I find a particular dungeon or whatever to be too challenging, I revert back and rethink my strategy.

It still holds up.\n\nThs is probably one of the rare RPGs that can still, after all this time, evoke in me a sense of wonder and just makes me want to play it. Now, i won't review the game proper, but just the Enhanced Edition, the game is simply a masterpiece and i think at this point most of the CRPG players at least heard about it.\n\nLet's start with the first bônus. The game comes with the expansion, Throne of Bhaal, an amazing expansion that is the size of some games released today. Besides it, the entire system of Shadows of Amn is overhauled to ToB standards, and that is another good point for the Enhanced Edition. And, there's no "mumb jumbo" to make it work in nowadays systems, it's just install and play, simply as that, so, if you wanna enjoy this game without any problem with your OS or the hardware, this is the version to buy.\n\nAbout the enhancements in the game, there are the extra characters, everyone of them with content both for SoA and ToB, and...It's actually better content this time around, than the one presented in the original Enhanced Edition, so you're gonna have some fun. And better, they are romanceable, and that alone makes the replay value of the game to get even better. Of the new characters quests there is just one part that doesn't feel right depending on your protagonist...But the game is receiving feedback and it may get better.\n\nOn sound an video there's not much to tell, it's the same game, but with some improvements in those areas, nothing major, so it feels like the old beast, and that is good, the BG II graphics were beatiful then and they hold up 'till now.\n\nAnyway, i recommend this game, even just for practical purposes, and is a damn fine RPG, one, if not the best.","December 22, 2013","true","26.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

I am one, still have BGII on my desktop, and still have the ToB CD to play through it from time to time.  I dont know why really, but I still enjoy this game after so many years.  I was rather sceptical about buying this, seeing that it didnt really seem to add much more for the $$.  However I have been pleasantly suprised.  They didn't really ramp up the graphics much - such as make it 3D or dramatically enhance the 2D quality.  I was kind of let down by this initially, but the small improvements have grown on me and it remains true to the original.  The new characters and dungeons are pretty good, and while not adding a lot of time to the game, they are still fun.  The new interface I enjoy quite a bit, and see it as a big improvement over the original.  The story remains the same, and this is the crux of what made this game great IMO.  Its like playing a good fantasy book and lacks the ham handed cheese that was so prevelant in NWN and NWN2.\n\nAs far as bugs and crashes, etc.  I have had one lock up and havent seen any bugs other than a few minor graphics glitches here and there (a few sprites flutter and thats about it).  Seems very solid, runs very smooth.\n\nIts an upgrade if you still enjoy this game after so long.  If your new to it... you may not see much here worth your time.  Its an old game and this upgrade doesnt bring it up to 2013 specs.  But for what it is I really enjoyed it.

With the possible exception of the evil paladin none of these are going to make your party on merit, and the writing isn't good enough to make you want to use them for role playing reasons. All in all, nothing that hasn't been done better by the mod community. There's a gay romance for a female player character which I would usually praise, but it's so tepid I couldn't decide whether I'd misheard and it wasn't really supposed to be a romance at all.\n\nSpeaking of mods, not every one has been updated to support EE yet (Item revisions/spell revisions are the ones I'm missing most at the time of writing) so check before buying if you've got favourites.\n\nBG2EE comes with widescreen support out of the box as well as a trick that you can't replicate with the basic game and the widescreen mod - customisable font sizes and interface scaling. Having properly sized sidebars is a good thing on a high resolution monitor.\n\nNo reason to buy this over the standard version other than better widescreen support? That would be true except for one small detail - the standard version doesn't run properly on my laptop. This does. Enough reason for me to buy it - but I still waited for a heavy sale (elsewhere) before buying.\n\nAs for the bugs other reviewers have mentioned: haven't noticed any myself, but I'm mostly holding off playing more than a quick run through the campaign while I wait for more mods to become compatible.","November 26, 2014","true","58.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Fortunately, they all have relatively easy work arounds  if you're willing to tinker with EE Keeper a little.\n\nThat said, those bugs were fixed a long time ago by the community. If you buy through GOG, you can play BG-Tutu with the fixpack and associated content and not have to deal with it at all. The downside is you have to patch it all manually yourself, which can be a bit of a drag for some but should be perfectly doable for most.\n\nIt is, however, nice to have Baldur's Gate on steam and working on a modern machine without any fuss. I expect this version will be patched and the bugs I mentioned will hopefully be fixed.\n\nIt's Baldur's Gate on Steam, which is great. The Enhanced editions bring new content and characters which are themselves quite nice. All in all, I won't fail to recommend it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wrycu/recommended/257350/","wrycu","Comrade Question","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wrycu/","394 products in account","Bladur's Gate II is an old paused based RPG based on 2nd edition Dungeons and Dragons.  The game does very little handholding and very little explaining what the rules mean, which are two of the major complaints I've heard about this game.  I personally love the lack of hand holding, but.. to each their own.\n\nThe game really and truly feels.. alive.  It does this by having interesting and enjoyable characters, locations, and quests.  Sometimes things don't make sense.  Sometimes people say a little something that helps you along, but that little something is not recorded anywhere.  Sometimes things happen for seemingly no reason.  The end result?  The game feels like it's real.  People have their own wishes and desires, and you need to balance each party members' goals with your own.  Combat is fun, and very challenging.  You can make a choice that impacts you in ways you won't even realize until you play through again, which is one of the more amazing things about this game.  Modern games give you 'choices', where you 'choose' good or bad.  Baldur's Gate II blurs the line.  There are multiple paths to nearly everything, and very few (if any) of them are marked as "good", or "bad".  Say the right thing or have the right person with you and you might avoid combat.  Do the wrong thing and you'll get attacked without ever realizing there was another possibility.","July 7, 2014","true","19.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But for people new to the game or who just want a well working version with a few enhancements this version is good to go, (with no extra DLs or patches required).  I am just getting used to the new NPCs and they seem like nice if not spectacular additions.  For me a fan who played several 100 hours of the original version, this is a great way to get back into the game without needing to master a puzzle of patches and Mods it takes to make the original playable beyond the vanilla version I have played many times already.\nI reccomend the EE/Steam version for any BG-fan, Infinity game engine fan, DnD-fan, Party-based RPG-fan, or anyone who likes old school RPGs with all their quirks and complexities.\nWell worth the price, it's BG2 without hassles.\n\n- Nuff said for a 8.5 / 10.","August 27, 2014","true","318.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Make a fighter and cleave your way through the story. A game which has SEVERAL play thrus with different alignment types. Wana be good? Sure, Wana be Evil? Sure play as various classes with an uncanny story to make them. Sure the "core" story is the same but the way it goes down is hilariously different.

Black Isle crafted a masterpiece with this game and brought something to everyone in all aspects.

BG2 stands at the top of the ranking at the classic RPG site GameBanshee - and deservedly so. Beamdog's Enhanced Edition brings the game to modern HD displays, and Steam - so that you never have to look for your CDs again.\n\nThere are many things that make BG2 great, and in their sum, they can be described as a spirit of complete and total confidence. It takes self-assurance to drop the player straight into the big hub of the game, bury him in quests, and let him figure things out. It takes conviction to fill a game to the brim with utterly broken enemies, spells, and abilities, and yet achieve a sort of a balance. It takes grand vision to hand-draw the phenomenal backgrounds of BG2, and compose a soundtrack fitting for a 3 hour epic Holywood production. It takes genius to emphasize the hero's companions to such an unprecedented degree.\n\nAnd the results are magnificent. In BG2, you can one-shot majestic dragons, and be one-shot by nasty mind-flayers. You can yield insanely broken weapons such as Crom Fayr, and still enjoy finding a decent offhand in the Underdark. You can build your entire strategy around brutal backstabs, or never hide in shadows the entire game. You can power-game and try to beat the game with a solo Paladin, or pick an off-kilter class such as the Bard Skald, accept the roll the game gives you, and dive into adventure with your trusty comrade Minsc. You can exploit every mechanic to become a true demigod, or play it hardcore and delete your character if he dies.\n\nAnd though the purely combat-oriented RPG in BG2 is good, it is the characters that really make the game (as is the case with other memorable titles such as Planescape Torment and Mass Effect 2). Video games seem to be a poor medium when it comes to conveying strong stories and plots; but they are perfect vehicles for character development. And fundamentally, as has been the canon in the West ever since the times of Plato and beyond, character development translates to a character's confrontation of his or her weaknesses, a journey through the darker corners of the soul, a quest for self-understanding.\n\nIt is in this aspect of its monumental edifice that BG2 succeeds, while perhaps not totally, at least to such a degree as to leave a lasting impression. Who can forget the trials of dark Viconia, her anguish at facing the cruelty of her kin imprinted upon her own soul, her doubts, her fears, and her eventual ascent to tranquility? Who can forget Minsc who finds himself a new witch in the little waif Aerie? What of Anomen, who visibly grows from a boy to a man before the player's eyes, and with the player's help? Is it not fitting that Sarevok, now humbled and desperate, should ultimately join his brother? Who can forget the player's sibling, the fiery little tortured Imoen?\nAnd what of the protagonist's foes? The nasty little sister Bodhi, and the mighty - yet so tragic - Jon Irenicus? Surely the voicework on Irenicus is among the best ever done in a computer game.\nFinally, there is the protagonist himself - forced to face his fears, his demons, his destiny, and his nature. Will he choose to become a God and wreak havoc upon mortals and divines alike? Will he ascend his throne and try to change the essense of his heritage? Or will he willingly forsake immortality, and tread the roads of Faerun along with his trusty friends? It is up to you...\n\nAnd though one can distinctly see Bioware run out of steam by the time of Throne of Bhaal, the final episode of the saga still manages to include some of the finest fights of the entire series; and loot galore beyond imagination.\n\nBefore concluding this review, let me say a few words about Beamdog's new content. I did Rasaad's missions, and though he had been a pathetic weakling for most of BG1EE and some of BG2EE, after about the midgame, Rasaad became a monster. Toward the end he was as powerful as my main (a Blade) and Minsc. His quests, unfortunately, were horribly broken and buggy throughout the entire saga. When the quests worked, they were great. But most of the time they did not work. The final fight in Rasaad's sequence, in particular, is heroically buggy, and took me an hour of replays to win - because I had to figure out how to activate the correct triggers in the right order.\nBut, by and large, the new NPC's are solid, and fit the game reasonably well. They are nothing to shout about, but they work.\n\nBG1EE took me 30 hours for a fairly complete playthrough; and BG2EE another 60. If you have never played the game, you should. And if you have, like me, last played it maybe a decade ago - well, with this rerelase, maybe it's time you refreshed your memories. Good movies and good books never get old.

I gave BG:EE 10/10 and BGII:EE if anything exceeds that. The gameplay is more refined and driven, and the story as compelling as before. There are less explorable areas than before but each area does have a purpose. Again the hours required to "complete" the game are little short of a century, I stand at 87 hours for one playthrough.\n\nThe game has improved choices and gameplay, as well as more player options and character customisation. Again the visuals show their age but that isn't why you play this game. It is particularly compelling to import a character from BG: EE and complete the game as  your  character. I would recomend this to fans of the original game and just fans of RPGs in general.\n\nNOTE:  The Throne of Bhaal expansion (included) I award  7/10  . Although fun it was rushed and unfinished off the back of a low budget. It provides a satisfying conclusion to the saga and some rivetting gameplay nonetheless but the storyline seems sloppy which is a real shame considering how compelling the other games are in this regard.","July 9, 2014","true","110.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Playing it modless I was also pleasantly surprised that EE offers more than one heterosexual romance for the female MC (if you even count Anomen as remotely approachable), and that the writing for the EE-exclusive Hexxat is interesting. There's an expanded amount of content and both the visuals and audio seem improved in this EE, while a lot of core features are untouched for better or worse. The combat is, for me, the only real drawback to this game for it's lack of balance and a plethora of clumsily wrought out details which makes fights either a chore or a cakewalk. That said, the combat is not the main draw nor timesink of this game. If you love a good story, a nostalgic setting, profound nonlinearity and an endless pool of content you will probably like this game.

Antrider","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LFantrider/","426 products in account","RATING: 9/10\nWhy can't you click the yes and no buttons when reviewing a game?  I wish I could on this one.\n\nHere's your caveat emptor people:\n\nIf you actually care about the new NPC's and Black Pit whatever they added in, OR if you have never played the original version, GET THIS GAME...... just maybe NOT THIS VERSION.  It is an amazing game, Baldur's gate series probably being the crown jewel of the D&D computer games.  However, with Beamdog, it is hit or miss whether the game will work with your computer specs at all.  Best to check with other people that have similar spec's or with beamdog before potentially losing 25$.  To prove my point, beamdog still hasn't even fixed the problems with Intel chipsets on the original BGEE, so I wasn't even able to play it at all until I got a new computer.  No refunds were given to all the people they f*cked in the ♥♥♥♥ on that one.\n\nHonestly, there are only two justifiable reasons for purchasing this one, over the more affordable Original: 1, in rolling the dice for your char. stats, it gives a total at the bottom... which if you're a serious OCD player, will save you countless mins/hrs of calculating your points to assure good stats (you can add up the right column of #'s, e.g. 1(5), of all the stats and want the total around 30.  Such takes a lot more time than just looking at one # and making sure you rolled a total of around 90).\nNo. 2-the better screen resolution, and no3 you just want to increase the number of games on your steam list.\n\nOften, hardcore players will create their own party of 6  unique characters and not use any NPC's at all, so I wouldn't make a couple extra characters being added into the game the fulcrum of your choice on whether to buy or not.  The original game is good with any and all glitches it came with and you won't lose out on any experience by saving money.  The other new changes aren't so significant to weigh into the decision.  Gametstop has a bundle of six DnD games that often sells for around 9$ which contains the BG series.  For getting full-screen out of the tiny resolution options, just plug in a box monitor from your old PC into your laptop or whatever.\n\nBeamdog's work is just not that satisfying.  They released this game before the first travesty they put out was even fixed, and copped out of even fixing it.  Why isn't Bioware or someone useful updating these games?\n\nJudging the game itself, however; guarunteed to make its way to the top of any top10 RPGs list.","February 15, 2014","true","105.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

While the interface hasn't changed much, the addition of a few new characters and storylines, as well as the ability to play this game on any modern PC, really makes it worth the value, IMO. Of course, this is my 3rd purchase of BG2, but being unable to play my old copies on my current setup made it worthwhile.","December 28, 2013","true","86.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

In the years that have passed there are few games that have rivalled the depth and involvement that I felt when playing the original. Although much has moved on since with improvement in nearly every area of computing and gaming, Baldurs Gate II remains a stand out title with peerless depth.\n\nTherefore I congratulate Beamdog and Overhaul Games for their labour of love bringing this (legacy) game to a new audience and making it easily available once more on modern systems and bringing it to new platforms.\n\nI have not owned a GOG version of this game (only the original), and can not comment on the patching needed to play this game, but for me to buy this game on steam for around a tenner is a steal and by Easter it will probably be less than four pound. Therefore not a lot of money then to play a hassle free version of a great game that will now have an extension on patching and support (particularly of new content).\n\nAdditionally Beamdog and Overhaul Games have shown great respect for the original content by adding interesting content that does not include unbalanced NPC's and gameplay and drastically improving the (mainstream) access to multiplayer.","January 2, 2014","true","47.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Playing it modless I was also pleasantly surprised that EE offers more than one heterosexual romance for the female MC (if you even count Anomen as remotely approachable), and that the writing for the EE-exclusive Hexxat is interesting. There's an expanded amount of content and both the visuals and audio seem improved in this EE, while a lot of core features are untouched for better or worse. The combat is, for me, the only real drawback to this game for it's lack of balance and a plethora of clumsily wrought out details which makes fights either a chore or a cakewalk. That said, the combat is not the main draw nor timesink of this game. If you love a good story, a nostalgic setting, profound nonlinearity and an endless pool of content you will probably like this game.

For some unknown reason they changed the auto casting of healing spells upon resting, adding another layer of useless micromanagement.

They just dont make any games as well as the BG series. Not a single title in the past 5 years come even close. Just to give you an idea, the first dragon age was well done and was maybe half as good as BG, all it really had was better graphics.

The world is so immersive, a seemingly endless stream of quests to complete, and so many classes that are all good that you want to play them all (except bard, screw bards). None of the classes are ragingly overpowered, even though mages can feel like it (specifically enemy mages) with time stops and imprisons galore, which just means that you have to be more strategic in spell placement as well as party composition.\n\nOtherwise, there are tons of characters within the game, both companions and NPCs, that are quite interesting, including the ghosts, djinn, statues, etc. that will give you fun riddles. Maybe it's just because the Forgotten Realms world had it's lore well established long before Baldur's Gate became a thing, but whatever it is, this world is unlike anything I have ever experienced before, with little to no hand holding, yet it doesn't feel unfair. There is a strategy to get through everything, you just have to figure it out for yourself.\n\nThere are some bugs, but I found them mostly funny. High Watcher Oisig in the base game and a group of peasants in the expansion just kept randomly showing up in the most obscure places, and it was really funny to just see them pop up.\n\nBest moment definitely goes to the part in Throne of Bhaal where a group of dark elves are disguised as random animals. I just wanted to slaughter a moose and, lo and behold, it was actually a drow. Go figure.\n\n10/10 I'm glad I got to experience this for the first time through the Enhanced Edition on steam.","December 19, 2015","true","45.8"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","1"

Not even the smartest of minds can comprehend what kind of code must have been written to send High Watcher Oisig relentlessly at you, every time you enter a new screen. Maybe Minsc has written it. 10/10.\n\n\nOn a more serious note, this game aged well. The combat surely is not up to todays standard and more than often I found myself letting the scripts do the work except for more challenging fights. The graphics are fine, the dialogue well written and mostly voiced.  The world is filled with life, characters and enemies. Countless loot is to be found, although there are certain weapons that can be found quite early which will be the strongest all throughout the game. For fans of RPGs, I would recommend this, but make sure to bring at least one friend with you and a lot of time.","December 13, 2015","true","68.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

NOTE TO BUYER: There are severe problems with Windows 7 !!!\n\nSo, this is a game that uses mechanics from the earlier versions of the Dungeons&Dragons pen and paper RPG. It is out-dated gameplay-wise, but the story is well-crafted and the level of freedom is still far better than what many modern games allow.\n\nIf you're considering buying this game to play with your friends - hold it, that's probably not a good idea. This game has been ported from the earlier version of the game, and present problems include:\n- Crashes when alt-tabbing\n- Crashes when progressing to the next chapter in multiplayer\n- Glitches\n\nWhile the problems in multiplayer may seem minor, it is still frequent enough to make you no longer want to play after a few chapters.\n\nHowever, if you intend to buy this for the singleplayer content and don't mind the graphics, go ahead - it's a great buy.","July 2, 2014","true","9.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The reason the first games that pulled many of us older  RPG fans from pnp to video games permanantly was final fantasy 2 and 3 was because of the story, party recruiting, and how each party member got legit, emotional back/side stories.  No video game RPG lived up to FF3 (or 6 if your young ) or chrono trigger for me until I played BG 2.  I never played BG1 back in the 90s because I was in college and didn't have my own PC.  By the time I got one in winter 2000, This was out.  Sadly enough despite how hooked i was, I was 21 and the lure of going out and socializing stopped me from ever beating this game.  I got to around chapter 4 and by the time I was ready to game again,  Morrowind was out so I never even bought TOB.   I put 20 something hours into this ee with a premade char just to reminisce.  Still fun!  No quest markers, but since the areas are limited in size and the cursor changes over clickable objects only a few times a screen, they are not needed.  Read the journal, go to the area, click stuff till you find.  we didn't have game wikis if we got stuck back then!  Shoot, I had dialup until 2002!  If you like apgs, crpgs, or played da-o and liked pause and play, try this!  Its like party based diablo with way less loot and way more story!!  I plan on playing thru bg 1, 2 and then tob all at once.  I have some time coming up now that I decided I will NOT be buying Elder Scrolls Online!  MMORPGS are designed to keep you subscribed, not to throw game content at you!  Time Sink with little reward!  I'd rather experience limited static content across multiple games then raid the same dungeons over and over with people I barely like!","February 19, 2014","true","47.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

That being said I always play a spellcaster which means always learning new spells to incapacitate/destroy my enemies with. I can't imagine that could be said about melee fighters. Fighting of the rest of the party basically can be set to fight the way you want automatically but getting to choose when and where my main character would unleash hell was entertaining as well as tactical.\nIn a nut shell, if you enjoy isometric, story rich, rpgs then give this game a shot.","January 5","true","370.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The Baldurs Gate series relies heavily on that tabletop game and its rules, and the Forgotten Realms universe dreampt up by a few men. I previously had the first Baldur's Gate on disc for computer, and by golly was it amazing. I remember figuring out that I can create a multiplayer game and play it by myself to have a full party of 6 characters. Fast forward 5 years, and I discovered Icewind Dale 1 and 2. I (pirated) both of those, and had a blast yet again. Now the 2015 Steam Winter Sale rolled around, and I discovered there was a sequel. I flipped, and decided it would be my first foray back into the series (legally). I love the way the series has presented itself, and it is a timeless classic.","January 5","true","19.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

When the grpahics are terrible and the game play is also bad its hard to enjoy something.   See the time I have on the game?  12 hours or so and I am still trying to get out of the starter dungeon.  Now I've played Divinity and Pillars of Eternity and enjoiyed them quite a bit.  This game is just terrible and if this is enhanced I get the shakes what the basic game is like.  One of the early party member is beyong annoying and the other is less than useless.  Casting any sort of AOE kills or roots your enitre party as well as the enemy.  The fact that I can camp any time I feel like it makes the mechanic of only being able to cast what is memorzied pretty uselss.   Now in most games if you mouse over a spell you will get a tool tip telling you what the spell is.  In this game you put the mouse over the icon and a few seconds later a scroll unrolls to tell you that this spell is "fireball" now if you right click it a window opens and you can see what it does.  Now carefully aim it so it lands 10 metyers BEHIND your targert or you will end up setting the enemy and your group on fire.  The druid in your part cvan cast a root spell which is a handy aoe but watch out where you cast that as it affects the entire area of the window you are in adn effectively roots everyone.

However you choose to get this game, get it, because whether or not you buy it here or somewhere else, you should BUY THIS GAME.

I waited for the enhanced version of BG2 to come out thinking that they would not only make it look nicer but fix the bugs and make it run perfect.  That's where I was wrong.  I now can play online.  But no matter who me or my friend play with the game crashes at sequence changes and map changes which ate up 50% of gaming time.  Ghost sessions stay on the server list for as long as 12 hours.

The second part of the series was in many ways the paramount game that every other computer RPG was compared to and rare were the ones that managed to nail it as well as this.\n\nIt is epic, massive, interesting, it has well written NPC characters, romance options and battles. It manages to find good balance between story and battles. Time has taken it's toll on the mechanics a bit, but not too much. It is still very enjoyable game to play although a bit clunky at times. In my opinion the battle mechanics and stats are more enjoyable than in the modern Pillars of Eternity for example, which felt a bit too "fuzzy" for me. Here +1 is +1, period :)\n\nBut in my books, the very best computer RPG of all times is still the masterpiece Planescape: Torment.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/asylummarionette/recommended/257350/","asylummarionette","(HR) BoundJackalope","http://steamcommunity.com/id/asylummarionette/","106 products in account","Baldur's Gate 2 is an old classic, updated with a fresh coat of paint, and some community mods incorporated as well, along with a bit of extra content. It's a lot longer than most modern RPG's, and offers a ludicrous amount of replayability for its price tag, however, it's still, at heart, a really old game that has not aged well in a lot of aspects, while other components are still stellar to this day.\n\nBaldur's Gate is based off of the antiquated 2.0e D&D ruleset, offering counterintuitive game mechanics, poor balance, limited flexibility, and poor character creation, with minimalistic control over appearance, stats, and no 'feats' like exist in most D&D based games. Its gameplay itself is incredibly wonky and variable, classes like Fighter having at best, a single self-buff skill until epic levels, and otherwise entirely being left click and watch, while classes like Wizard have ridiculously high, and unforgiving skill ceilings. In terms of gameplay, character creation, class balance, and art design, I'd have to say that Baldur's Gate is far inferior to its spiritual successors such as Dragon Age, or Pillars of Eternity. It's aged poorly, and doesn't hold up well, even for its low price tag in these regards.\n\nHowever, there's aspects in which, it still holds up, and I would recommend it. While casters, rather infuriatingly, have their spells interrupted when taking damage, resulting in a lot of unforgiving requirements for positioning, the Wizard, Sorcerer, and Cleric classes are ludicrously powerful in ways that a lot of RPG's usually tone down for balance reasons. In Baldur's Gate, a high level caster will play like a demi-god, summoning pit fiends, controlling minds, calling down angels, raining meteors from the heavens, killing with a single touch, create hordes of undead, extend phantasms of yourself capable of casting spells and fighting for you, etc. The level of power given to casters in this game is phenominal and satisfying when mastered, and a Cleric/Wizard multiclass has such a ludicrous amount and variety of potent spells that it'll take you longer to scroll through them all than it will to handle the encounter itself.\n\nBut let's say casters aren't your thing, there's still a couple aspects in which Baldur's Gate 2 is worth a look. The first, is writing. There's a lot of it, and it's all stellar, and a lot of the time, easy to miss, as the vast majority of content in Baldur's Gate is optional sidequests, but regardless of how you slice it, Baldur's Gate offers a large amount of quality content, with interesting writing, characters, different tones, and those decision making mechanics that people love so much.\n\nThe second, is the main reason that, years later, I still find myself coming back to Baldur's Gate 2, and that is the game's pacing. The common RPG notions of "Oh, you're a normal person, then a thing happened, now there's a secret society, kill it, and save the entire planet", two act arc, is really quite overdone and forced. A lot of RPG's will quickly rush to topics of killing gods, or saving the world, sprinting headlong into the notion of the highest degree of escalation at a breakneck speed.  Baldur's Gate 2 escalates to the same level, but it paces it out, and gives the player time to adapt to each new level of capability before moving onto the next. When you hit epic levels, be prepared to literally have to hold your own against entire armies. However, unlike a long RPG like say, Final Fantasy, do not expect to need to 'grind'. Doing quests is more than enough to fully cap out an entire adventuring party, with a fair amount of content left afterwards. I think the pacing of the game's content in terms of gameplay escalation of difficulty, and the pacing of the content in terms of plot development, is well balanced in a way that most games these days really miss out on.\n\nAs well, the game has built in multiplayer support, with Beamdog hosted servers, along with being able to run your own--usually for modded content--allowing you to bring along friends with split control over the party, which offers even more replayability to an already fairly lengthy game.\n\nUltimately, I recommend Baldur's Gate 2 for people with an interest in longer, well paced out, story driven RPG's with tactical, spellcaster focused combat, or a classical RPG that can be played with friends, and for people who don't mind poor character creation, archaic rulesets, and are willing to overlook the clunky combat.","May 7","true","333.4"," 11 of 25 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","11","25","0","0"

But I find the number of bugs I have come across in this game to be glaring. Five times, NPC's haven't shown up, or are in dialogue loops that require me to google fixes, and then I have to use the CLUA console to fix it.\n\nTo say I am also disapointed at this would be an understatement. I don't imagine I'll bother playing through the EE versions again after this runthrough. And I have gone through these series multiple times.\n\nI guess I should have expected it. After all I bought BG:EE on the day it came out, hoping to play multiplayer and found that it was a borderline travesty. As in, something that had been working for thirteen(?) years was now broken. I guess I should have known that Overhaul Games isn't quite ready for something this big.\n\n\n\nSome bugs I've run into(no where near all):\n\n\nDorn constantly repeating himself when I go to do his first quest(Endless speaking)\n\nThe spirit at the cabin not showing up after doing the first quest in the ranger stronghold\n\nThe mother not spawning in trademeet for the second tanner/skinner quest\n\nIn the planar prison, Renias(sp) and half the troop not spawning so I couldn't even teleport out\n\nAfter leaving the Underdark, anytime I open Viconia's inventory, the game crashes to desktop\n\nHexxat's quest bugged out and refused to take me back from one of her Tomb Excursions. Nothing would happen, everything just sat there\n\n\n\nThe new NPC's are well written and fit seamlessly... when they work right.\n\nBottomline, breaking a game that previously didn't have breaks in it, is a serious issue. And unless you know how to work the CLUA console, are willing to reload from saves MANY hours old and replay areas you already did, I can NOT recommend this in it's current state.\n\nI've finished this series multiple times, and if this is your first time, do yourself a favor, go to GOG.com and pick up the whole Baldur's Gate series for less money, less issues and NO DRM.","August 24, 2014","false","120.7"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

This review features two specific parts: Shadows of Amn and the expansion, Throne of Bhaal. Additionally I'll give my overall experience having played both of these.\n\nShadows of Amn\nYou start off captured as a prisoner* in a dungeon underground by an unknown individual whom you have never seen before and he is basically torturing you in your cell for some unknown reason which will ultimately become apparent as you progress through this game. Only thing that will be apparent at the start is that he seems to be trying to bring out some unknown power you have. All of a sudden the dungeon itself is attacked by an unknown group, forcing your capturer/the torturer to teleport out of the dungeon allowing another prisoner who somehow escaped from her cell (gee I wonder how she did that?) and she reveals to you her name: Imoen. After a discussion about what the torturer did to you and her, she springs you free from your cell, and from there, your immediate objective at that point, is to not only escape the dungeon, but to find anyone that is currently in the dungeon to join your party to make the escape a little easier, but you can attempt to escape on your own if you wish, having others with you just makes it easier. Once you finally escaped from the dungeon (you'll end up in Waukeens Promenade which is essentially a place within the City of Amn or rather "Athkatla"), your torturer, sounding particularly happy (and evil) commends you for escaping the dungeon, the exit of which collapses behind you after escaping. Imoen who had also been tortured by that guy demands to be released and launches a magic attack against him, he retaliates with a magic attack of his own, causing half-a-dozen hooded figures to teleport in to stop it and attempt to arrest him, and after the torturer resists both the hooded figure attacks and Imoen's own attacks, they ultimately arrest both the torturer and Imoen on grounds of using magic in a place (which is later revealed to be Amn) which is prohibited. From that point you'll have two primary objectives, find and rescue Imoen who was captured and settle the score with that torturer.\n\nAdditionally in this game, among the outstanding number of quests you can undertake, you'll have class-specific quests to take on too, so for example, if your protagonist is primarily a fighter, you'll be tasked by a kind-hearted noble, with clearing monsters infesting a huge Keep and killing their leader and if you succeed you'll get a chance to become head of the Keep which you can use as your own home to manage as you see fit.\nAlso for example, if your protagonist is primarily a Mage, you'll be tasked by a ranger to help him defeat his ancestor Lavok in what is known as a "Planar Sphere" located in Amn. That sphere will be yours if you defeat Lavok inside of it.\nThose types of quests depend upon what your protagonist's class is. Something worth keeping in mind.\n\nThrone of Bhaal\nAfter you have successfully completed your final objective in Shadows of Amn, it is revealed that a certain prophecy describes children (including yourself by the way) of a tainted godly blood, that will cause a wave of massive destruction destroying all in existance including each other. in order to fulfil a certain purpose. You are urged by an Elven Queen to visit a sacred grove to discover some answers as to why this prophecy is even relevant to you and what part you will likely play in it. After you have visited the grove and listened to the prophecy spoken (which also states that there is a person you may encounter at some point on your journey, who has "the face of an ally", but has "the mask of a foe"), you are ambushed by what is revealed to be a "Bhaalspawn" (that's right a Child of the dead God of Murder, Bhaal) and her troupe, whose main objective is to kill you as a Bhaalspawn yourself. Once you have disposed of her and her troupe you get teleported into what is called a "Pocket Plane" which is essentially your sanctuary for you to rest and take up challenges and even upgrade certain weapons you have into powerful items via the imp Cespanar. At that point, you are visited by a familiar individual whom you had killed in the past, after vowing to never betray you if you let him join you, he gives you intel about the Pocket Plane you are in and states that it doesn't take you to where you want to go, it takes you to where you need to be: Saradush. Once you teleport to Saradush, which is under heavy enemy attack from outside its walls you meet up with a nice woman who is trying to save the people of Saradush, which ultimately becomes your objective as well, however it doesn't just end there as there are many quests to undertake after that, which may involve you ultimately battling other Bhaalspawn that will also seek your death among others etc.\n\nBoth of these games provide a super thrilling challenge the likes of which no other rpg strategy game is likely to provide, because among other familiar enemies, you'll even encounter monsters/creatures you have never fought before. In my particular case, I always enjoy the thrill of battle, so doesn't matter how hard an enemy may be, I'll always rise up to the challenge. Some will be easy, others will be hard to kill depending on how you have built your protagonist let alone your own party members.\n\n*Please be advised that if you have imported your character from a BG1:EE game or from having played this previously, unless you have figured out the trick to keep your items, you'll lose them all at the start, so just a heads-up about that.","April 16","true","174.6"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

You don't have to grind the main plot right away, there are sidequests, especially in SoA.\n--Character development. During my run, I felt a strong connection to all the characters, especially your romance options.\n--New characters. They may not exactly fit (per se) in the plot development, they add a bit of a flare to the story.\n--Amazing music. Yeah, this isn't a "Great Soundtrack" game. I know. However, the soundtracks to this game is SO DARN AMAZING! My favorite music (personally) is the music that comes up when you fight Irenicus.\n\nIn conclusion, Baldur's Gate II is an amazing game, filling the requirements of what all RPGs should and goes beyond.","March 28","true","331.5"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

At times you will get random party banter, and some of these are hilarious. Certain quests have unique responses, that allow you to be a righeous hero, or a snarky a-hole. There is no set party, and you can recruit any characters you desire to aid you in your quest. Be warned that there is a reputation system and evil characters won't tolerate you being a goody two-shoes, and good characters won't stand by while you punch babies.\n\nThe pathing is still bad, as well as the combat A.I., and if your casters are set to auto-attack they will sometimes interrupt their own spells. The A.I. can be turned on and off with simply pressing the 'A' key, though.\n\nThis game does require some strategy for higher level fights, and you can't just wade in with your two-hander and expect results, unless that result is a dead party member. The learning curve isn't too sharp, with the starting dungeon teaching you the basics of the game.\n\nThere is no real linear path to follow, and many side quests and areas to explore. You can blitz through the main  quest line, or do side areas to gear up and explore the area of Baldur's Gate.","March 24","true","147.0"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

A huge world with plenty of engaging characters, tough challenges, great dialogue, and tonnes of replayability. It's a game I've played once or twice a year since I first bought it ten years ago. This Enhanced Edition is a mostly improved version of that game, so of course I recommend it to anyone looking for a great game. The game has been improved graphically, multiplayer has been modernized, and extra content has been added. The additional content mostly matches the feel of the original Baldur's Gate, and anything that you don't like is easily ignored.  Generally speaking, bugs have been fixed, though there are still some minor ones present. Bugs are going to be present in any version of Baldur's Gate due to all of the complexity and variables. Fortunately, Beamdog is still releasing patches to fix what they can. Most of the mods for Baldur's Gate have been updated to work with the Enhanced Edition as well, so there's very little reason to play the original over the Enhanced Editions.\n\nBasically, get this game. And Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition, obviously, because why would you want to start with 2?","April 26","true","56.9"," 4 of 13 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","4","13","0","0"

I learned how to cheat, but even that could hardly cover just how little I understood how the game functions. I'm in college now, and I still think about those first times I played Baldur's Gate 2: Shadows of Amn. Instead of focusing on the story, which I liked, or the awesome stuff I would find, or cheat for, I thought I should focus on what made me play the game again and again:\n\nMinsc.\n\nMy introduction to Minsc was in Irenicus' dungeon. As we explored said dungeon, I enjoyed his quirky, funny style of thought and speech. Throughout the game, I grew to love his style. I absolutely enjoyed having him in my party, because he was quite a character. I reached the end of Shadows of Amn, eventually. Since Throne of Baal was not even a thing at that point, I started a new game. This time, I wanted to play as  an evil character. My intention was to horde and dish out vengence on whoever I jolly well pleased to. What I failed to realize at the start was that that would involve losing Minsc.\n\nInstead of getting to listen to his hilarious speaches about goodness, buttkicking, and hamsters, I was instead subjected to stern, angry lectures about my actions. Eventually, Minsc left my party. I found others who could fill the role of meat shield, but no one could fill the role of "Minsc." No one had the same level of energy and enthusiasm for ANYTHING. A couple of the evil choices I would have to make as an evil character  also rubbed me wrong. Remember, I was a child at the time. So I abandoned that character.\n\nI played as a good character mostly so I could keep Minsc. Having been the subject of his scorn, I started to seek his praise. I played as different classes again and again, and I continued to zealously court Minsc's favor. Looking back, I can see how much of an impact Minsc had on my development, and how I treat morality in video games. At some point, I internalized a number of Minsc's battlecries and sayings, and started playing as the good guy no matter the game. I played as the good guy because in the back of my mind was "this will allow me to keep Minsc."\n\nI've since developed other reasons for nearly always doing good, but Minsc is still there, somewhere, in the back of my mind. The sting of his disapproval, and the happiness at seeing this strong character devote himself to goodness and justice. Did I idolize that about him? Absolutely. Do I still recall him fondly? Fondly enough to by a digital copy of the game o I can be with my idol and mentor again.\n\nBaldur's Gate 2 didn't have muc of an impact on me as an impressionable child. Minsc did.\n\nGame contains Minsc. (11/10)","March 31","true","155.1"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

From Minsc (and Boo) the loveable fool of a Ranger desperate to do good in the world, to Viconia the damaged Drow desperately trying to survive in the overworld.\nCHARACTERS CAN DIE PERMANANTLY.

All of the Romances have depth and feel meaningful. It isn't give a gift, get laid, romance over.\n\nCombat: 5/5\nStrategic use of spells, abilities, and careful planning will be your only saving grace. This is a difficult game. I suppose it's a mix of real time strategy and action rpgs.\nREMEMBER, THIS GAME IS F**KING HARD. DON'T B**CH ABOUT IT ON THE FORUMS!!!\n\nGameplay: 5/5\nAbsolutely solid. No nonsense. The EE ironed out any bugs (so far as I've encountered) with dialogue. You should'nt encounter any bugs or glitches, definatly not any game-breaking ones.\n\nMusic: 5/5\nPerfect in every way.

People complain about the UI, but the old was clunky and hard to navigate as well, and you had to constantly go to the journal and then back to the map, journal to map, journal to map, while now, while you need to scroll a lot, at least you can control yor party while knowing what the @@@k you're doing. And the graphics update is completely optional, you can change them in settings, for example. All the haters just want to dump on something and this is a target because of a recent OPTIONAL expansion, which shoehorned in SJW crap.

This is just about BG2. If there's some kinda social justice stuff going on with Siege of Dragonspear, it isn't in any way reflected in BG2.) So it seemed there was a lot of stuff about the update, which is fair when it's an old game and has many loyal followers, myself included. But I gotta say, if people's idea of "butchered UI" includes having to click twice to travel instead of once... come on, guys.\n\nI'll break down what I've noticed so far with less of the mass-hysteria.\n\n-The sprites did look odd, but you can turn that off and revert it. Really not a big deal.\n\n-Spellbooks are just way easier to navigate.\n\n-The journal simply pops up over half the screen instead of the whole, but everything is still there. You can easily pause the game for it, but I found it way less of a hassle to quickly check an entry rather than to have to take up the whole screen, while continuing whatever else was going on.\n\n- The local map labels overlap, which I'd prefer to get fixed, but it wasn't nearly enough to affect my gameplay. You can turn them off.\n\n- Character sheet is different, but again, it hadn't really taken up much thought until writing this review. The old one was way more stylish. The new one has separated stats that used to be in a compact all-in-one section, into clickable pages such as ability, kit description, bio, etc.\nIf you click on the "class" section you CAN clearly see experience accumulated just as you used to on the old game, rather than just the exp bar now at the top of the sheet. Just an extra click away.\n\nPersonally, the changes have been barely noticeable, and this has been my favourite game for like 16 years. Tiny things like the width of highlight circles and needing to click more really don't affect my enjoyment of a game. I can understand frustrations with stuff like character sheets, but maybe we'll get some tweaks. This is still the game I know and love.","April 7","true","159.1"," 2 of 13 people (15%) found this review helpful","15","2","13","0","0"

NO! NO! DO NOT BUY! Ok now that I have calmed down, let me explain. I recieved this game as a gift and thought I might as well play it. I had a multiplayer session with other people. We spent about 10 minutes in the character generation screen creating our characters before the session timed out. That was the best part of the game. We tried multiple times, but it kept timing out or dropping people from the session or even needing a computer restart. When we finally got a game started after spending over an hour in the game without even playing it, we found very low quality graphics (don't worry we weren't expecting good graphics in the first place, just thought I'd metion it) and a very confusing inventory and combat system. We spent another 30 mintues mucking around with the very first battle. After finally getting through it and figuring out the inventory system, we lost a player due to his inability to move his character and decided to end the confusing game. Overall, the game's character generation is the best part, and even that is only ok.","January 25, 2014","false","2.0"," 3 of 20 people (15%) found this review helpful","15","3","20","0","0"

I had been wanting a good RPG, and I read about how great this series is. So, at 10 bucks, I figured why not give it a try. But, as with Skyrim, Divinity: Original Sin, and others, BG2's interface and mechanics completely turn me off. I don't know what I expected, but I certainly did not expect everything to be so clunky, clicky, and counter-intuitive. I played the first ten minutes and I was completely turned off by the tedious mechanics and by not knowing what is going on (and not being satisfied by the tutorial's explanation of how to do things). I am concluding that I really am a console gamer at heart, and that games like Dragon Warrior and Final Fantasy are what I really should be playing instead of these PC RPGs. Sorry, this is just too much dull work.

The bigger screen is definitely nice, but I do see what some of the other reviewers mean about bugs.  Companion walking AI is even worse than the original.  At times it's like herding freaked out cats.  I have issues where my characters will try to walk right up to an opponent before casting a spell.  NOT fun with something like Fireball.  I felt like I had better control of my party in the original edition.\n\nHaving all the extras thrown in is nice though.  I do have to agree with the previous reviewer who said Hexxat's voice acting was flat.  Granted until you complete that first mission for her, she's supposed to be in a trance (close as I want to get to a spoiler), but that could have been sold (acted) better.  After that point her voice acting is a bit better, but I was still bored enough with the character that she got the boot.\n\nI'd say the main reason to go with this version vs the old is convenience.  No fussing with mods, etc...  DL and it's done.  If you're good enough at installing mods manually though, you'd be just as happy with the gog version or your old CDs (still have mmine, lol).","August 28, 2014","true","490.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The first part will be for people who haven't spent their fair share of time in Amn, the second will be for those like me, for whom the continent is like a second home.\n\nPart one:\n\nBaldur's Gatewas in many ways the defining roleplaying experience of the 90's. Not because the roleplay mechanics themselves were the focal point of the game. But instead because of the environment, built around that most epic of stories. I've you dear reader have had the pleasure of playing one of the later Bioware RPGs, you'll surely find familiar elements in the BG storyline (Dear EA/Bioware, when can I get to explore the daily trials of a humble grunt soldier / farmer's son in one of your otherwise wellwritten universes?). The NPCs are engaging, their party banter good for many a giggle, and their individual storyarcs satisfactory. The Forgotten Realms (DnD) setting well interpreted / used. One thing to note, however is, that some of the more obscure "classic" DnD mechanics such as Thac0 is used, it's silly in a computer game, and once you understand "which way" the number is supposed to go, you will quite likely happily ignore it again.\nGameplay-wise the game centers around 6-man party combat. Unlike another classic CRPG series, Fallout, you can't talk or sneak your way through the game. So combat is definetely the name of the game here. Unfortunately combat is not one of the stronger suits of the experience - and is in general something I would say Bioware isn't particularly good at designing. Practically it plays out as realtime 'with pause', which on normal to "harder" is required in pretty much all boss battles. It however lacks any of the in your face realtime satisfaction of hack'n'slash games, and at the same time is utterly hamstring in it's tactical possibilties while paused. So it's more of a half-baked measure of realtime/turnbased than best of both worlds, which is a shame. The spell system of the different caster classes is however rich in variance, and as has always been true, throwing fireballs into the face of your enemy has eternally been 'great fun'.\nThe one thing that may be a dealbreaker for many a younger / new gamer is the graphics. They're not horrible, but they are very dated. And if you are a pure graphics enthusiast it is rather unlikely you'll find much enjoyment in this game.\n\n\nPart two:\n\nFor the non-kids / teens / oldfarts like myself, how've already spent way too much time melting faces as the prodigal son of Bhaal: It's the BG2 you already know (and I assume) love. Not much has changed. It works on modern systems, without issues.\nThe extras haven't been noticeable enough to not seem entirely forgetable. Depending on your "internal rate of nostalgia", beware that Beamdog has redone the cinematics / cutscenes.\nIn my opinion the "it's on steam!" and multiplayer are really the most valuable features of this enhanced edition.\n\n\nAs a small conclusion: Would I recommend this game to both the new 'uns and oldies? Wholeheartedly yes! Although I don't feel that the enhanced edition adds much, it's still one of the very best RPGs ever made, and will most likely retain that title for a very long time. Buy it!","February 22, 2015","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I felt like I had better control of my party in the original edition.\n\nHaving all the extras thrown in is nice though.  I do have to agree with the previous reviewer who said Hexxat's voice acting was flat.

After that point her voice acting is a bit better, but I was still bored enough with the character that she got the boot.\n\nI'd say the main reason to go with this version vs the old is convenience.

Baldur's Gate 2 is a CRPG from 2000-2001, which uses the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition (2.5E really since they introduce kits & high level "feats") ruleset, with a real-time twist. The game plays in real-time but can be paused at any point to assign orders, cast spells, or use items, which execute upon unpausing and complete during a combat round.\n\nHuge amount of character customization, over 200+ spells, high levels of character advancement, and a ton of items, all with interesting background and stories behind them to really appease the min-maxing crowd.\n\nThe biggest selling points however, are the characters and storyline. You'll find some of the most unique, interesting, and downright fun NPCs in any game ever. The storyline, which may seem cliched now, makes the struggle with your divinity, much more real, when your divine essence is taken from you by force. Quests are far from straight-forward, with many of them introducing some interesting moral dilemmas. Not to mention the replayability introduced as your party members will chime in with their own thoughts, inter-party banter, and even party member conflicts which will require multiple playthroughs to experience.\n\nFinally, there's a modding community working hard to adapt many of the old mods for the new enhanced edition. Thankfully, most of the hardcode in the EE version is the same, and most mods should work fine. Mods can add another 50-100+ hours to this already content-packed game.\n\nI can't recommend this game enough. To players who haven't played CRPGs from the 80s-90s, be warned that there is a steep learning curve. But once you overcome it, you'll have one of the most defining experiences in gaming ever.","April 29, 2015","true","207.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They did a great job of reviving the game, but their NPCs are mediocre at best, unfortunately.\n\nIf you've never touched the series: the graphics are old-school but charming, the story is intensely personal instead of a standard save-the-world fantasy trope, the voice-acting is phenomenal, and the original writing is either really good or so hammy it's hard to dislike it regardless of its quality.

Mages can be gods on the battlefield, and not having a diverse party could quite simply ruin your life. However.....\nI do not recommend this game because at the end of the day it is exactly the same as it was when originally released so many years ago, the main difference is that there are a few extra characters/items and an additional quest here and there, but nothing truly ground shattering. As an owner of the original game, I could have simply loaded it on my PC and had nearly the same exact experience. Buying it on sale offers me a bit of satisfaction though, but still leaves a rather bad taste in my mouth.\n\nOverall, this kind of thing makes me realize that staying away from HD upgrades or anything of the sort is the best course of action. It really is nothing more than a money sink, and the only ones getting anything out of it are the people who profit from your purchase.\n\nIf you have never played the game before, then give it a shot. But you could probably find an old copy of the original game and you'd pretty much never know the difference.","June 23, 2015","false","151.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The most obvious and annoying one is the fact that the voices are rarely heard. They won't play at all, and I'm talking about the default pre-set voices that come with the game, not any custom made voices.\n\nI sincerely hope this bug can be fixed in a later date with an update, because hearing your characters talk is just part of the game! And it takes away a lot of fun if you don't hear the voice at all, or just random snippets from the sentences they say.","July 24, 2014","true","56.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As I age, my patience for tedium increases at the cost of perhaps my jerk reflexes. Though, I have been playing RPGs my whole life, so large blocks of endless exposition are nothing new to me.  Also, I've enjoyed DnD since the second edition, so the complex balance between gear, THAC0, magic and stats is old hat for me as well. Lastly, Forgotten Realms is my favorite fantasy world and I have all the books, most of the games, and it has inspired me to fulfill my own demiurges.\nSo the graphics, audio, gameplay, controls, story, setting, genre, and mechanics are all decent, magnificent, precise, awesome, divine, perfect, and nostalgic....then, why have I waited fifteen years to beat this...\n\nhmm, wait...wait a second....15....1 and 5 is 6. and the game came out in 2000....6 divided by 2 is three. and 15 is divisible by five 3 times...so like the three points of an Illuminati pyramid, this obviously alludes to the coming announcement of Half-Life 3.\n\n\nMy\n\n\nGod","December 5, 2015","true","132.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I first played this game when I was around 8 or 9 years old, and I still remain incredibly impressed by the amount of effort put into this game.\n\nThe most impressive points of the game come to my mind in the form of the story, creativity, and adaptability that this game presents.\nBGI:SOA alone presents an impressive storyline that will likely take you a good 20-40 hours of gameplay to finish if you streamline and know exactly what you are doing. With side quests and random adventuring, you can easily get 100 hours out of this game, if not more. Personally, I have probably spent 500 or more hours over the course of the 10 years that I have owned this game. Anyways, the story is an intense, epic, and intricate path that will keep you invested for the course of the game. It's easy to get sidetracked, but it nver felt to me like I ever lost sight of the main goal, as if everything that you do up until certain points are all just preparation in lieu of the journey and inevitable war ahead of you. There are also more side quests than one may like, and you will not finish them all on your first run through, but they are all significant stories that add something to the main story, never really taking away from the main path, but rather adding extra bits to the lore that you learn throughout.\n\nIn addition, the creativity is most definitely worth mentioning. With beautiful environment and 2d art, especially for its time, the pixelated picture that you walk through is brought to life by somewhat sloppy but still carefully done abiance sound and background music. It is true that the paper dolls, in-game-characters, and animations are all pretty bad, to be blunt, but if you can look past those and a few other flaws, it really is quite a beautiful game when you take it as a whole.\nIt's easy to see that a lot of mindpower and creativity was put into the sensual aspects of the game for the players.\n\nThe last major point of this game I would like to make is how adaptable it is. For one, the difficulty of the game can be increased and decreased, which does more than just power up enemies, but actually give them different AI that makes fights different for each difficulty that you fight at. No matter how many times you've played it, there is always a way for fun to be had, whether it be by making the game harder, or by creating an invincible mage and blowing up every man, woman, and menacingly pixelated cat that has the misfortune to be within your line of vision. I still remember one time when I did just this, but took the additional effort to mod my character for special unattainable spells and a ring that removed the delay between casts, and I spent nearly four hours entertaining myself as I literally blew my way through the main cities and districts of Athakthaktla (whatever lol) as I pretended my character had become the magical equivalent of the terminator as I beelined towards Jon Irenicus in a murderous pursuit of revenge at any costs. It is much like minecraft, in the way that there are many methods to do any one thing. For example, maybe you want to talk to the dragon that kidnapped the mayor's girl by seducing her in his human form, and work out an exchange of her life for your own, or maybe you want to convince him using your charismatic and eerily cheerful paladin that you picked up on your way there. Or maybe, you just want to stick it to him, take his head and jail keys off his dead body, and leave his cave with the girl in arms like Arnold Schwarzenegger walking out of a base he just blew up. The point is, it's a game that truly leaves the amount of fun you want to have in your hands.\n\nOverall, it truly is an incredibly fun game if it is your kind of thing. The replay value isn't great, but it kept me busy for awhile. Definitely worth looking at at the very least.

First people have to realize that this isn't a NEW AAA title. This game came out in 1999 so the graphics aren't amazing. This is a game that 100% focuses on the gameplay and story. 75% of the game is all sidequests and they are well made side quests that you actually want to do. There are so many party options especially now with the added characters in Enhanced Edition. This game was basically my childhood. I think I probably logged 200-300 hrs played when I was younger and I had 0 idea how the D&D Ruleset worked. Mods deff help the game but even playing it Vanilla is well worth your time. Monks are still OP at a high level and it's super fun to try and solo the entire game. 1 thing that I wish the game had is a recommended level for some quests as not playing the game for such a long time, you can forget which quests to wait and do later on. I started a quest that was really high level and I wasn't even close to being prepared for it and ended up spending around an hour dieing and reloading to try and get the right dice rolls so that my members weren't getting 1 shot by spells.\n\nPeople forget that if this game didn't exsist, Dragon Age wouldn't have exsisted.

I have no excuse either.  This is the top echelon of isometric cRPGs. Sure, the graphics have grown outdated in the past decade, but story, gameplay, audio and controls all hold up magnificently and were even the gold standard for what could be accomplished back in 2000 for this genre.\n\nNo, the reasons I have never beaten this title until now solely rest upon my shoulders.  As I age, my patience for tedium increases at the cost of perhaps my jerk reflexes. Though, I have been playing RPGs my whole life, so large blocks of endless exposition are nothing new to me.  Also, I've enjoyed DnD since the second edition, so the complex balance between gear, THAC0, magic and stats is old hat for me as well. Lastly, Forgotten Realms is my favorite fantasy world and I have all the books, most of the games, and it has inspired me to fulfill my own demiurges.\nSo the graphics, audio, gameplay, controls, story, setting, genre, and mechanics are all decent, magnificent, precise, awesome, divine, perfect, and nostalgic....then, why have I waited fifteen years to beat this...\n\nhmm, wait...wait a second....15....1 and 5 is 6. and the game came out in 2000....6 divided by 2 is three. and 15 is divisible by five 3 times...so like the three points of an Illuminati pyramid, this obviously alludes to the coming announcement of Half-Life 3.\n\n\nMy\n\n\nGod","December 5, 2015","true","132.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you've never played a CRPG from the 'good old days' you might find BGII incredibly tough to comprehend and a slog to play, but put some effort into trying and you'll be rewarded with a sprawling adventure with space hamsters, rotten nobles and insane sorcerers.\n\nThe enhanced edition comes with the expansion which ties the whole story up, adds some new party members and new content to play through, which makes this the version to get.\n\nLooking for an RPG to sink some time into, then you might want to check Baldurs Gate II out, just know what you're getting into.","March 17, 2014","true","19.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is a game with such scope it is startling. It never relies on repetition to keep you playing. It never exchanges any compenents in its enthralling story for predictable and cliche story archs. The story shapes and shifts to the relationships you make in game, the choices you pick and the way you dealt with plot progression.\n\n--The depth of character development in each companion is top tier, each character could have a movie or a book written on their back story. They never feel like clones or following unwitty AI.\n\n--The voice acting especially brings out the characters' traits and refine our vision of the story unfolding.\n\n--The evil counterpart to the hero is a psychological and thought provoking psychopath bent on warping our ideas of how a villian should appear to be. He transcends pain and fear into distinct physical pleasure as he explains his sick fantasies of the world he wishes to have his revenge upon.\n\n--The music is rapturous and epic. They are stadium echoed masterpieces throughout the game like a grand orchestra of emotion.\n\n_______\nNow this remake does little to add to the game's true glory and it shouldnt be appreciated this way. I simply purchased it because I support the return to classical cRPG's and turn based games that have been resurging recently.\n\n-The new characters in the story are clunky and horribly voice acted.\n-The interface was changed pointlessly and it seems less streamline.\n-The menu's are easier to navigate and certain time consuming tasks have been fixed in this edition.\n\n___________\nGet the game on GoG, this version is ok but no where near the great way it was originally created.

I wasn't able to beat the game until I was in my early teens and that was from spamming spawn monster wands with all of my party members then sat back and watched as Sarevok was mauled by various monsters. It took about 2 minutes for about 50 monsters or so, quite an impressive amount of patience for me. Now that I have a job I can buy my own games and stumbled onto BG2EE after forgetting that I still had the sequel to play.

A lot of it comes from the fact It is based on 2nd Edition Dungeons & Dragons, and while that edition is particularly confusing to learn, it comes to you pretty fast. Most of the learning curve comes from spells and their interactions, and some unintuitive things like "lower is better" for Armor Class, THAC0, and attack speed.\n\nThe story is one of the best ever written for an RPG, and it is beautifully voiced to boot! The artwork and graphics, while technically dated, hold up incredibly well in this day and age. They give the game a fantastic sense of character that immerses you into the world with ease. Characters in the game are very fleshed out and are full of dialogue that makes the game world feel like a living, breathing place. This is one of the few RPG's where you can actually roleplay. (GASP! , SHOCK!) In fact, the game is practically designed around you roleplaying your character the way that YOU want. For example, it doesn't punish you for playing one alignment or the other, nor does it accomodate playing one alignment over the other. Characters simply react to you appropriately to your alignment vs, their own.\n\nTo anyone who has played the game before the EE came out, the game is now better than ever.\n\nSome very good improvements I've noticed:\n- Updated UI, much more functional and friendly\n- Graphics as a whole feel more polished\n- Revamped spell effects look AWESOME!!\n- New recruitable party NPC's fit into the world seamlessly, and have very fun side-quests to boot\n- Brand new areas to explore with fun rewards for doing so\n\n(These are only some of the many improvements to the game, there are too many good ones to list here.)\n\n\nThis game is an absolute masterpiece. Anyone who enjoys RPG's will fall in love with this game and its previous game (Baldur's Gate) instantly. It is worth every fraction of a cent and more. Ultimately this game deserves your time and you should buy it immediately ;)","September 10, 2014","true","76.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is a game with such scope it is startling. It never relies on repetition to keep you playing. It never exchanges any compenents in its enthralling story for predictable and cliche story archs. The story shapes and shifts to the relationships you make in game, the choices you pick and the way you dealt with plot progression.\n\n--The depth of character development in each companion is top tier, each character could have a movie or a book written on their back story. They never feel like clones or following unwitty AI.\n\n--The voice acting especially brings out the characters' traits and refine our vision of the story unfolding.\n\n--The evil counterpart to the hero is a psychological and thought provoking psychopath bent on warping our ideas of how a villian should appear to be. He transcends pain and fear into distinct physical pleasure as he explains his sick fantasies of the world he wishes to have his revenge upon.\n\n--The music is rapturous and epic. They are stadium echoed masterpieces throughout the game like a grand orchestra of emotion.\n\n_______\nNow this remake does little to add to the game's true glory and it shouldnt be appreciated this way. I simply purchased it because I support the return to classical cRPG's and turn based games that have been resurging recently.\n\n-The new characters in the story are clunky and horribly voice acted.\n-The interface was changed pointlessly and it seems less streamline.\n-The menu's are easier to navigate and certain time consuming tasks have been fixed in this edition.\n\n___________\nGet the game on GoG, this version is ok but no where near the great way it was originally created.

You have several classes to choose from, alignments, and you can decide who you want in your party and how you want to play. I have enjoyed this a lot, and if you enjoy old RPG's, have played the original, or want a ride in nostalgia.. This is certainly the game for you.

I mean now I was just a crappy warrior with low weapon skills and no fancy healing abilities and buffs to make me useful in any way but surely something will turn up...it got progressively worse over the next few hours of play. (Solely my fault not the game I should point out.)\n\nThe solution to losing all my abilities I decided, was to make my character almost constantly drunk for approximately 4 in-game (thankfully) months (i dunno like 3 days worth of play real time? It was strong mead...real strong.) This did little but lower my all ready pitiful weapon skills to nothing and cost me all my gold but I did hear a few interesting rumours. (basically hints on where to find quests) Then through more bad choices or drunken stupor, I ended up having to flee the city with a drow cleric (evil) and a deranged gnome (basically evil too) in tow. Don't cast magic without a license friends! I tried to redeem myself by helping out a local lord with a dragon problem, ended up killing some paladins, you know, reeeaaallly "good" guys.\n\nHowever it gets better from here (no, seriously) I end up killing a dragon after solving some puzzles and finding some awesome dragon slayers gear (very handy obviously) and fighting some other nasty monsters, I saved a girl, reunited her with her father, the Head Paladins decided I had atoned and everything was all good, paladin status given back (sweet sweet abilities) I go back to the city do more quests help more people, earn a good reputation, earn TONS of gold, pay for my magical license (fear my mad gnomes level 8 magic missile!) Then remember I'm supposed to be saving my friend. So head off on my merry way, band of probably 85% evil party members in tow. (Kept 'em cos I assumed I could try and convert them to good being a paladin and all, I could not, however, the inter-party banter was pretty hilarious bloody jan jansen and Viconia.)\n\nWithout spoiling the storyline, s*** goes south real quick. My guy ends up going full rage mode mid way through some maze, PERMANENTLY killing (as in hit them so hard they explode into chunks kinda dead) all my party members barring the drow cleric and the friend I came to rescue, who I managed to get outside the room my main guy was in till he regained control. So at this point i'm down 3 party members heading into what ends up being the more difficult part of the game. Does this dishearten me? pfft, no! I'm loving every minute of this!\n\nSo I end up through good luck and several reloads (god dam acid breathing dragons man...yeesh!) beating "Shadows of Amn" I then rolled my character and what few party members that still survived into "throne of bhaal" and came out the other end (several days and reloads later) with hither-to unheard of attributes for a mere human paladin. I had some sweet armor, some super paladin only 2-handed, Holy Avenger, demon smiting, sword of awesomeness, became a God, (cos why the hell not right?) and then sat and read through the "what happened next" for my few surviving party members. Wrapping up my play through very nicely. I actually felt quite sad at this point as I had to lay my Paladin to rest. (No carrying on questing for you when you ascend to Godhood, but I guess theres more important things to do at that point...like maybe killing Gaelan Bayle, god I hate that "Coo!" noise he makes...)\n\nIn short, in my opinion of course, best rpg hands down, possibly that good that nothing else will ever come close in terms of storyline.\nTotally worth the money, i've played what...70+ hours...i'm defintitely gonna be replaying this and exploring all the places i skipped, finding the party members I missed etc there is sooo much I still have to do. What more can you ask for...maybe a Baldur's Gate 3? oh whats that? Its possibly in the works right now!? Take my money...Just...take it...","August 8, 2015","true","74.0"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

Period.\n\nNow that the opening pledge of perpetual love has been declared, we can get down to the gritty of the review. The Baldurs gate series is no longer groundbreaking. Not in graphics, not in sheer scope of content - even though its storyline still is very strong compared to other RPGs out there. It's a solid game, even today some 13 or 16 years after its initial release. The series starts in candlekeep and the protagonist finds himself (or herself) very soon as a haunted individual, then the story pretty much goes from there. The plot, the twists and the mechanics of the game functions very well and even if the graphics are rough they still work. In short its great entertainment for a very reasonable price, keep in mind tho that beamdog hasn't really added much to the series so if you own the original series don't buy unless you're like me - a lover, a fighter - keeping the magic alive at all cost.","November 3, 2015","true","206.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Do it, or butts will be liberally kicked in good measure!Starting simple: I have played too much BG2 back in the day. (I believe my final count on my save file then was 275 days and 22hrs) How I ever played so much BG2 I will never know.. but I cherished every moment in mind in heart.\n\nI spent weeks aimlessly traveling from place to place for random events. I spent maybe a month, slowly delving through all the floors in The Watchers Keep. I fought dragons and braved The Underdark. I have been both good and evil. As well this- I have received the gift I was owed by the blood in my veins.\n\nAlso, Jaheira will always be my main squeeze- despite the comment of: "You sound like you were dropped as a child.

It offers a potential of hundreds of hours of D&D gameplay and is an incredible game to play if you want to get sucked into a great story. The enhanced edition offers the entire experience in one easy to play package that doesn't require modifying files just to get it to run. If you've never played any of the Baldur's Gate or Icewind Dale games before, pick these up.
