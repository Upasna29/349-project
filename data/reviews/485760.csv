After 2 seconds of looking for a match it starts to move showing you which match you can make, and I don't really like that. I think there are plenty of "Candy Crush" styled games out there, and this is just another. Also at the end of the game it gives you "pop time", which is really similar to the ending on Candy Crush. I think it's a good looking game, but not original.","June 2","false","0.1"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","7","14","0","3"

I needed to be told immediately that 3 can be matched next to those other two 3s. It was nice of you to explain how the 'pure' numbers had to be the same number, it would have been extremely annoying to try doing addition instead of doubling. Addition is too hard for my brain and it's so much easier to just pair numbers. My favourite aspect was how obnoxious the hints were. It was so easy to concentrate with this none stop rattling out the corner of my eye.\n\n10/10 would be spoon fed again.","June 3","false","0.1"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","5","10","0","0"

Its boards have two types of tiles: the usual kind that can be matched in the usual rows/columns of 3, 4, etc., and those that can only be combined with an exactly matching tile. These two types of tiles can block each other, which adds an extra level of tactical thinking to the game: is this the tile I want to create with this match? Is this a good or a bad spot for it? Is there a way for me to maneuver a particular tile where it'll make the best match?\n\nI don't know whether I'll enjoy this long term, but the first hour or so has been a fun experience, as I start learning the new rules, and figuring out the best ways to solve the board.","June 2","true","4.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"
