"http://steamcommunity.com/id/offraymond/recommended/32760/","offraymond","Angry_Ray","http://steamcommunity.com/id/offraymond/","52 products in account","In my opinion, one of the greatest unknown games of all time. The story is compelling, the graphics are good for the time period, and the acting is amazing for such a low budget game. You aren't going to be thrilled by how amazing the explosions are, by the thrills of the space-borne dog-fights, or even by the cutscenes. However, allow yourself to be immersed in the game and you will put at least 20 hours into the story. The best part is that there are two routes to follow, which means another playthrough is required to get both endings, with new charcters and ships to fly.\n\nAll in all I give the game 10 out of 10. The voice acting is brilliant, the game is highly immersive, and for a game made in 2000, the graphics are great. I grew up with this game being one of my first PC experiences. Oh, did I mention? BRUCE CAMPBELL, the king of B-horror voices the main character. That should be enough to sell the game to anyone.","December 11, 2013","true","23.3"," 77 of 79 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","77","79","0","0"

This little gem has been a classic and to my knowledge no space fighter game has been able to live up to this, unless somebody would like to make a recommendation.\n\nThe intuitive nature to this game is beyond compelling, I've taken down multiple capital ships, overcome insane odds, all while strategically being able to manuever my craft and manage my shield and energy/ammo reserves. The ability to turbo and then slide is exactly something a space simulator should have, I'm not sure how I could play any other without it. The way the physics are set up are awkward, but make sense to how true space physics would be.\n\nWhile I am extremely attached to the gameplay, everything else is top-notch. The explosions aren't amazing but still satisfying, voice acting is great and while limited the playful banter between you and your wingmen is just added fun. The only thing missing? A second game, more missions/ships, whatever else. I might check out Freespace 2 eventually and see if it can truly live up to this legend.","September 30, 2014","true","140.0"," 27 of 27 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","27","27","0","4"

Tachyon the Fringe takes explosive, white knuckle space combat and meshes it flawlessly with a compelling story and believable characters. Two divergent storylines play out with you at the focal point of the action; either as a Bora freedom fighter or an Ace fighter pilot for the Galactic Spanning Corperation. Your choice to join either the Bora or Galspan influences the outcome of the overall story, as well as what ships, weapons and components are available to you as you make a name for yourself on the fringe of civilized space.\n\nThe game has aged fairly well, you can even run it in your native resolution with the help of nGlide.

Although the campaign is linear to some degree, the addition of small optional elements and side missions niecely mixes things up. Both factions have a distinctive storyline and ending, and are NOT just a rehash of the same missions with different flags (minus a few decisive overlaps, for good reason). In my opinon Tachyon: The Fringe is one of Novalogics best releases and if you enjoy space combat with a decent story, it's well worth a try.

The control scheme is daft and requires memorization of a full-size keyboard layout (the boxed version shipped with a huge trifold reference chart, which you may still be able to find if you're exceptionally good at Google searches). Also, If you don't have a joystick with twist/rudder support you might have to hit up Ebay for one before you start playing. BUT, if you've got the time and feel like playing a genuinely satisfying and entertaining starfighter game, this is one of the best there is.\nThere is a multiplayer mode, and while the online servers are quite likely dead these days, I had some great times trying to match my wits, skill and ship upgrades against opposing pilots. The real draw, however, is the campaign. Based around jobs and for-hire missions, it'll have you chasing down troublemakers for private shipping magnates or joining up with the enlisted military against common enemies, all as a mercenary pilot voiced by none other than Bruce Campbell. The voice acting is substantial, in fact, and serves the story in a way that invites you to root for the Nathan Drake-esque protagonist's otherwise short and unremarkable journey from self-interested freelancer to potential 'good guy' with a cause. You can save your earnings to buy new ships, improve your weapons payload, and add new functionality to your ship's capabilities (lateral thrust, for example).\nOn the downside, the learning curve is substantial, and if you want to play this game right you're going to need a flight stick with rudder controls. But smooth and enjoyable space combat and a broad range of available unique ships and environments to fly them in may have you coming back for more.

After blowing away my save and starting over from the beginning, "Withdraw from Independence" finally became winnable.  I also restricted the game to one CPU core in case of RDTSC-related weirdness, but that probably wasn't necessary.\n\nTachyon is a great space combat flight sim.  The storyline is fairly compelling, the missions are interesting, and the environments are neat, too, even though it's in space.  The Twilight region is appropriately spooky, the lawless fringe has a number of interesting starbases, etc.  It's not quite as open-ended as some others of the genre, but it's not all shooting at ships, either.  I had a lot of fun with this in the mid 2000s, and I'm having lots of fun with it again.\n\nDetails on bug:\nApparently there was some weird persistent bug that caused the full Galspan force to be present in the Independence sector as soon as I arrived.  Let me assure you, that mission is a LOT harder when there's a destroyer right in your face as soon as you arrive.  Somehow, something I did fixed that, but those shuttles still went down way faster than I remember until I deleted my save and started over from the beginning.","April 27, 2015","true","12.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A basic one, in fact. More like Freespace than Elite. You click on the next mission(escort, destroy, defend, deliver, etc.), equip your ship, hire of fire wingmen, and launch to kill some bad guys in space. That's it. There are shield/energy management mechanics, that many other games of this type have.\nThe story will branch at some point and after choosing a faction to fight for, you'll have access to ships and weapons specific to that faction. Different ships have very different cockpit interface, requiring some time to adapt, which is a nice touch.\nGraphics are ok, for 2000, but nothing spectacular. Sound design is decent, voice acting is good, synth music somewhat repetitive. It only supports 4:3 aspect ratio with max resolution of 1024x768, which is expected.\nIf you are easily irritated by ocassional sexist jokes you may want to play a different game.\nAnyway, this game is not a masterpiece, but if you can't get enough of space dogfighting, try it.","September 20, 2014","true","12.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I suppose Windows 8 is as much to blame, but I can't recall having ever purchased a game from steam that has worked 100% correctly, if at all.  It is a credit to my own stupidity that I keep wasting my money with them.\n\nSo to begin with, to even get the game playable, took me a couple of hours of research and tweaking.  Then it seems at last, once I fixed the graphical issues, the game is still completely unplayable with the mouse.  I was hoping for a joystick game so this isn't such a huge issue, but be advised, that at best, after quite a bit of tinkering, the game will not ever function completely right in windows 8 as far as I can tell.\n\nIf anyone has a fix for the mouse issue, please respond!","October 12, 2014","false","1.4"," 3 of 40 people (8%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","8","3","40","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/remixer1993/recommended/32760/","remixer1993","Remixer1993","http://steamcommunity.com/id/remixer1993/","63 products in account","This game is one from my childhood, and if you like a good space simulation game get this one.  The gameplay is deep but easy to get into, the voice acting is great, the story is fantastic, and even the graphics are great since it was created in 2000.  Is it a perfect game?  Oh hell no, some missions range from "these are way to easy" all the way up to "This is impossibly hard."  and sometimes the reward can be underwhelming.  But other than that it's a great game.\n\nI'm going to go in depth on the good and bad, you don't want to read this it is fine.\n\nFirst off, let's start with the bad:\n-There are no other races besides humans which makes no sense.\n-Some of the choices and missions have stupid reasons to be a thing.\n-Some of the characters are forgetable.\n-It's an extremely depth combat so this is only to be considered if you don't like learning quite a few things.\n\nNow that's out of the way, let me explain the good:\n-All the ships are varied.\nThis means all the ships are different.  Not one ship is the same on either side.  Just because the Mace is the Bora Variation of the Pegasis, it doesn't mean it's the same.  Same with the Battleax and the Orion.\n-The graphics for the time hold up pretty well.\n-The ships feel like their actual space ships, and you can do a move called "sliding" which cuts all thrust from your engines and allows you to continue in the way you were origonally heading.\n-The voice acting is great\n-The Stories are amazing, worth seeing if they could make a Tachyon 2\n-All the places are memorable\n-Both sides feel unique instead of just flip flops of the other.\n-All the missions are memorable in some way.\n-The combat is very deep and very interesting.\n-The Twilight for how beautiful it can be, along with how dangerous it is.\n-Bruce.  F'n.  Campbell.\n-Both sides feel like they're good and bad.\nThe Bora do feel like the insane phanatic collonists who just are ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off because someone legally is telling them to get off their new proporty and Galspan (the Galatic Spanning Corporation) seem extremely corrupt.  You can't really side with one or the other because they're both horrible, but you have to.  Bora you go with if you think they deserve their freedom or Galspan to try and get money to get you back into Sol space.  All the sides fight with different people as well, such as the barrons or dealing with different traders, thus it questions their morality.\n-The endings are worth it.\n-The weapons on both sides feel different.\n-The different paths feel extremely differet.  I know i'm repeating myself but if you choose Bora, you feel like you are flying a mining ship and using mining lasers.  If you choose galspan, you feel like your flying a proper fighter ship with proper fighing weapons.\n-The game stays its welcome and is a good length.\n\nTL;DR:\nI love this game too much and it's pros outway the cons.","January 1","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
