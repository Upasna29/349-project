Instead, they chose to release an awful PC port of a likewise-awful pay-2-win mobile phone tower defense game.\n\nThe gameplay is your standard 2D tower defense, nothing new whatsoever. Almost nothing in this game is original, for that matter; the backgrounds, the characters, even most of the music is ripped out of the previous (good) Metal Slug games. You know, the ones that didn't have $15 character DLC. The ones that actually had passionate developers who didn't care about maximizing profits by making their game into a microtransaction-friendly skinner box.\n\nAre you a fan of mediocre tower defense games (on a platform which has no shortage of them), microtransactions, mobile-to-PC ports so lazy that the game prompts you to tap the screen, and seeing your favorite video game franchises wither to dust before your eyes? If so, then Metal Slug Defense is the perfect game for you.\n\nIf SNK Playmore is reading this, just... just release the other Metal Slug games on Steam. Who asked for this? Who WANTED this? Go look at all the Steam Forum threads filled with people saying they'd buy up 1, 2, 4, 5, etc. in an instant. None of them mentioned this god-awful game that should have been left in the iOS peanut gallery.","May 1, 2015","false","0.1"," 274 of 318 people (86%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","86","274","318","24","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wisdomeye/recommended/356310/","wisdomeye","Thanos Of Titan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wisdomeye/","153 products in account","It's free-to-play and not necessarily pay-to-win on the original, better mobile version. You can also purchase units with medals in that version. No pressure, no harm done. You get medals over time (if you're willing to part with that) and so spending money is merely an express method to getting what you want faster.\n\nIt remains free-to-play in this version, but you cannot under any circumstances purchase units with medals. Instead, you have to fork out upwards of 30+ dollars (Canadian) for not individual units, but for entire packs of units. This monumentally insulting flaw paints this as an indisputable cash-grab, and nothing more. The original, mobile version was a decent way to kill time and didn't force you to spend money at all; this version is mostly unchanged but FORCES you to spend hard-earned money on units you might not even like, and in groups, too, rather than units that you actually want.\n\nWhat if I don't want all of the Ptolemaic Army units but just want the Metal Rear? Well the joke is on me, then, because I'd have to fork out $16.99 regular price for that ONE pack (there are two for the Ptolemaic army, but that's just one group). The joke is not just on me, but on all of us.\n\nSo what of the way it plays? Well, unfortunately much of the interface remains unchanged. Sure, you can change the window resolution in the title screen, but that's the only thing that makes this resemble a PC title. On top of that, which buries the hatchet further, is the garbage control system. Somehow SNK Playmore missed the fact that you will be playing this version on the PC, which in most cases we can all assume will have a keyboard & mouse setup. You can use the mouse, but the controls are entirely designed with touch screens in mind. You know, the same screens adorning the mobile platform this game was originally made for. You have to click & hold your mouse and swipe to scroll horizontally (and as you go along, you'll do that a lot); you will have to do the same movement to scroll through the battlefield. All of this could have been changed with little work yet SNK didn't even bother.\n\nSo why should we bother, then? Why bother giving them dozens of dollars for apathy?\n\nWhat is the excuse, that they were releasing it as a free-to-play so "f*** it"? Why not just stick with the mobile platforms if you're going to be this unintuitive, this lazy, this...condescending? It's fine on that platform because in contrast to this port, if you could call it that (minus the resolution options, which doesn't even affect video quality but rather the mere size of the window...), but this version is a complete money-grab. It won't appeal to everybody for sure because it's basically a collection of all the assets from the Metal Slug series retooled in a tug 'o war TD gameplay format, with little to truly set it apart from the series as a whole. But that's not the important part; the important part is that this version is meant to nab your money, and SNK Playmore wants to get as much money as they can get all things considered.\n\nI'm not sure how far they think they'll go with the schemes on display with this half-♥♥♥♥♥ 'port', but minus the dolts who bother to pay out for the unit packs, no one is going to buy into it. If you really want to play this game then do it on your mobile phone, assuming your platform is supported anyway. If SNK Playmore wants to put this game on Steam then fine, but don't let them do it this way.\n\nGets a 1/10 for even bothering to do it anyway. Oh yeah and I have BlueStacks, so I could already play it with all of my progress from the game on my phone, on the PC with the aforementioned emulator, intact.\n\nFIX THIS NONSENSE!\n\n===================================\nEDIT: Patch 1.0.3 Review Revisions\n\n+ Keyboard + Mouse, plus Xbox 360 Gamepad play have seen some attention.\n+ Instead of seeing "Tap" on the title screen, we now see "Click." That must've been so hard to do, gaiz.\n=/= You still have to scroll around as if you're tapping on a screen. Those arrows you see all the time are just a form of condescension rather than an interactive part of the interface.\n- Of course, the shop is still the same as it was upon release; grouped units that must be purchased as such, for up to $32.99 a pack. Because that's not ridiculous or anything.\n- Medals feel damn near useless in this version, still. Yeah you can buy items with them, but you hardly EVER need them anywhere in the game, hence why I made this point.\n- SNK Playmore still doesn't understand what 'resolution' actually means. It's not screen size, gaiz!","May 2, 2015","false","1.2"," 176 of 206 people (85%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","85","176","206","7","2"

I WANTED TO WRITE IT A REVIEW TO LET EVERYONE KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THIS "GAME" IS.\n\nI'm a devout fan of the Metal Slug series, I got this game on Day 1 when it came out on Android.\n\nIt was... OK. At most it is just a timewaster, what you see is what you get, nothing else. I played it A LOT, I really wanted it to be GOOD . But of course it was JUST a mobile game. From day 1 it was riddled with "PAY MONEY, GET GOOD".  I hate that crap so much, but because it was Metal Slug, I was able to ignore it, for the most part.\n\nWith every update it got, it got more microtransactions and Pay to Win injected into the game. Multiplayer became near impossible to play it you didn't buy all the Pay to Win and characters locked behind a microtransaction wall just to destroy everyone with a giant robot that shot lasers out of it's eyes. Single player missions were still OK but if you used up all your "Sortie Points", or to speak more correctly "being able to play the god damn game points" you had to stop playing and wait a few hours to play some more.\n\nI can say without a doubt in my mind this game isn't worth the trouble of downloading and playing. I wanted this game to be good, I wanted the next Metal Slug game, but it wasn't, and it NEVER WILL BE. Don't support this absolute trite mobile game garbage. I'm disappointed in you, SNK. I thought you were SNK PLAYmore not SNK PAY-More.\n\nThese, were of course just MY thoughts on this. There are people out there who enjoy this and these types of games.

Having to swipe with the mouse to access all your units during missions is particularily awful.\nOnline 1v1 and 2v2 ranked and friendly game modes, which should be in the good stuff section, if it only worked.\nHilariously bad monetization.  Units are only unlocked by buying ridiculously overpriced DLC packs in the Steam store, on phone versions you could buy them with ingame 'currency'.  The PC version also has this currency, but it serves no real purpose here, it can be used to activate boosters instead.  It blows my mind.\nSummed up:\nMetal Slug Defense has some charm and I can see myself returning to this if only to get a bit further on the missions, but the bad interface and horrendous paid system is a huge deterrent against serious investment of both time, and money.

Here's why:\n\nThis game is great if you play it casually... meaning, you don't care about obtaining 100% of the P.O.W's or getting S ranks on every stage. This is basically the epitome of the meta in this game... Just perfect every stage and replay them to rescue prisoners (meaning, wasting your stamina)\n\nHere's the catch, you need items in order to earn S ranks on stages... and items cost currency. So you're basically in this endless loop of replaying stages (without using items) in order to earn currency so you can buy all 4 items and then attempt to earn the S rank on the stage.\n\nBuild enough money to buy all the items, then replay the same level with all the items activated.\n\nYou proceed accordingly: You toss out a couple lower level units real fast, send in the Metal Slug characters you've unlocked and then finally throw out the tank style characters to finish the job. Guaranteed S rank.\n\nThat's all you do.\n\nIf you throw money at this game for "special units" you're a dolt... The "P2W" aspect is a myth because it's strictly a cosmetic thing. You literally can't S rank a stage without using those special items, and those special items don't cost real life money... just in game currency (which can be edited FYI)\n\nEven if you manage to S rank a stage, some how, by not using items, it was merely luck because the game is built for you to just continue to waste your time grinding currency to basically cheat on each stage with over powered items... fairly lame game design.\n\nI got bored after basically S ranking the first 20 stages by simply using items to win... what a joke.\n\nIf the design wasn't so lazy and involved some actual strategy intead of trying to beat a time limit by using every cheat (a.k.a. item) at your disposal... it would of been a better game... But what do you expect from some mobile junk app?\n\nI'm actually quite upset with the developers because the Metal Slug series was always about skill, not about buying items to beat stages easily. This is just a shameless cash grab targeted at the plebs with addictive personalities...\n\nIt's just a sad state the world is becoming that people are so easily duped and idiotic to fall for this crap without seeing through it before it becomes too late. Thankfully, I've been kind enough to do the work for you...\n\nI'm not saying to not play the game (as terrible as it is), just don't support the stupitidy of it by throwing money at it like a complete imbecile as it won't help you in the long run... I've explained the game mechanics quite clearly, the items determine a perfect win, not the paid for units.","May 3, 2015","false","1.2"," 63 of 83 people (76%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","76","63","83","4","1"

It uses sprites from the Metal Slug series very well. And it is good fun for short periods of time.\n\nSo what is it doing wrong? Well It is ported from IOS and carries a lot of things from that, that just don't belong in a PC game. First off is needing munitions (which regenerate over time) to go on "Sorties" AKA~ wait to play.\n\nThe game also has a premium type currency, but you can't actually buy it. Instead you earn it through playing online matches. Good lucking finding one though. I only got to play two games and the wait time to find them was about 10 minutes. You might be able to earn them via 'daily log-ins' but can't confirm that on first day.\n\nAn units. On the iOS copy of the game, you can earn units via the premium currency. Here, you buy unit packs. I understand that the game is free, but the price of these packs is absurd. Even 'on sale' the prices is way to high. $10 for the cheapest set? ARE YOU KIDDING ME?\n\nIf this game had been thrown on the Steam store for $7 (and took out munitions) and included everything in it I would have picked it up right away. But the munitions and downloadable rippoffs hiding all the interesting units from you make this game a no go.","May 1, 2015","false","5.8"," 29 of 34 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","29","34","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/recommended/356310/","Whiteswart","Whiteswart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/","1424 products in account","Free-to-play defensive version of the famous side-scrolling shooter series Metal Slug. I set the thumbs up button, but that's only because it is free stuff, and can be finished with gold on all achievements - and without any in-game payments, as you can suspect from the f2p title. As of overall fun out of the game, well, there are not so much of it to really recommend it to everyone. Try it on only if you're a Metal Slug admirer, or if you're an achievement hunter and seeking the game with the clear complete goals.\n\nWith that said, I'll describe the game a little. First of all, it is not a tower-defense. The only "tower" you've got is more like the spawning portal for your troops. You need to defend your gate, and destroy such thing of your opponent. You'll be fighting over different locations, but all of them will be quite short (and based on the backgrounds from the previous Metal Slug games). Basically, when you clear all locations, you'll get your "complete" badge - but to clear location, you need to save every prisoner that is holding there - and that is your grind point.\nTo complete the game, you'll be restarting the same levels over and over... And there goes another blasphemous thing of the f2p games - the energy bar. Every fight you're engaging taking a portion from your energy bar, and when it will be depleted, you gotta wait some real world hours... or pay to get more stuff right away.\nTo end the list of the bad things - there are not that much challenge. Of course, there will be some tough enemies, but nothing really touching.\n\nSo, it is another grindfest f2p and another crude port from mobile platforms, only based on the Metal Slug, right? What's good in there, then? Not much, really: the arts of the Metal Slug (which can be branded as FanService), and fair mechanic with dozens of various units at your disposal, to beat another deck of such creatures from your opponent, in the push-pull contest. And 64 achievements. And all of it can be accessed without your money (except of some packs of troops, which sells as dlc - not that they were really needed). As for me, I get at start one serious unit as an in-game present "for joining", the crab-tank, tuned that unit to the max level, and that was my major champion for all given levels. Not that one unit is enough, but I'm certain you don't need to buy any dlc - just get one serious armored champion, and you'll be fine.\n\nIn sum, Metal Slug Defence is a strange game. The most of Metal Slug fans will turn it down, as Defence give completely different experience. And since the major part of the game (at least, the first two worlds) are not quite challenging once you get the winning pattern - I can't really vote for it for anyone.\nAnd yet... It is free, and yet it worth something, so I'll not be the one throwing the stone into it. My mark is 5.2/10, BUT it is not a complete disaster - for a f2p game. I've got my complete, in the end, as well as some smiles on the way.","April 22","true","21.0"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","24","26","2","0"

But, for Playmore to re-release this mobile game on PC with no way to carry over your progress from the mobile versions, and then to give us (even more) exorbitant prices for non-basic units, leaves me disgusted.\n\nI used to recommend the mobile version to my friends as an example of a F2P game done right -- nice pixel art, fairly balanced gameplay, from a developer I (used to) respect -- but the idea of grinding through the levels again only to have to pay in order to get units I've already spent months acquiring on the Android version an insult. Hopefully Playmore can do something to make it right, but the way it's looking right now, this is the last straw. I'm not spending any more time or money on the Android version, much less the Steam version.

Most units have a special attack that charges up over time and can be triggered.\nThis isn't a bad core concept, but it's also nothing special and it's easy to find free flash games that have a similar, if not better, execution.\n\nOn top of that there is an energy system, premium currency for booster items, regular currency for upgrading units and base attributes and DLC packages with characters that can't be acquired any other way.\nWith so many ways in which the game restricts you from having everything it should offer something amazing, and it simply does not.\n\nThere is little to no strategy involved in winning levels, requiring little more than grinding enough money from earlier levels to upgrade your units to be strong enough (or pay some premium currency for helpful/cheaty items).\nThe only thing that felt at least somewhat novel was the POW system (short for Prisoner Of War), in the levels you can free prisoners. Freeing all prisoners in an entire chapter gives you a passive boost to an aspect of gameplay separate of the base upgrades or unlocks new units. The problem is that even this system is weirdly designed and trying to get money out of you. Prisoners are 'hidden' across the levels in random locations that need to be hit with charged up special attacks. You can use a booster item (for every single level) to get at least one prisoner for completing the level, but even with that it could easily take 3-6 playthroughs of every level just to get all of them.\n\nThis game is free, so you should not expect much.\nBut I'd feel we should expect more than this.\nMobile games can be properly ported to Steam, but not like this.\nNot like this.","May 12, 2015","false","10.0"," 40 of 58 people (69%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","69","40","58","4","3"

As an example, the controls work as if it were on a phone, with text instructions being to "tap," such as, most evidently, tapping the screen. As of now, characters are only earned through purchasing them with real money, and, from my understanding, they are normally purchasable in the phone version through its in-game currency, which should have been transported between the two. Presentation wise, the game seems as if a lousy hacker transported the game in haste, with its informal title and the money hungry dlc for fast cash. Finally, for my rant, the damned "Sortie Points", or, as I saw Toasterman describe them earlier, "being able to play the god damn game points" where you must let them "regenerate" for some time.\n\nFor now, I am NOT recommending this game, but if, atleast, charcters were buyable, that may change.\n","May 3, 2015","false","17.0"," 28 of 37 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","28","37","0","0"

Your mouse and your pointer is just a simulated finger. You need to click and drag to move the camera, the units, basically it's a chore to move around.\n\nPlus, you don't get to have the same units as in the mobile version. I remember starting with the bazooka soldiers and I breezed through the game with those guys along with shield dudes. The initial units they give you are no fun at all considering the controls.\n\nI'll consider giving this a recommend if the developers consider mapping the controls to the keyboard, particularly assigning the units available to the digits on your keyboard, scroll and scroll through the map with the arrow keys. Or better yet, give the ability to modify keys.\n\nAlso, it carries over the "energy" or action point meter from the mobile game. Essentially, you're playing mafia wars where your energy recovers over time. I think it's 1 AP per minute so it's not that bad. Then again, each mission has their different point value depending on the stage. This is mitigated by upgrading your bases, but requires points from missions, so you'll have to grind a bit.\n\nI'd recommend this only if you want a bad time, or if you're an achievement hunter.","May 2, 2015","false","1.5"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","19","22","0","0"

They totally screwed up the steam port, Here goes the full explanation.\n\nThe steam version is totally Pay to Win! :In the android/iOS versions of the game you can purchase new units with Medals, a type of currency that you can earn through wifi matches and completing maps, but in the steam port you can only use medals to buy items (fairly useless) and MSP (the other not so valuable currency), the units are only available as DLC on steam which means no real money = no new units, not to mention that they rendered medals now useless.\n\nThe port screams LAZY: There is no real difference between playing this on an android emulator than on steam, the graphics didnt get any rework so they look pixelated even in the lowest resolution, they didn't bother changing most of the text so you can still find instructions telling you to "tap the screen", and there are no new functions or shortcuts added to make use of your keyboard, click=tap and thats it, thats the port.\n\nInferior version than mobiles: The game was released in an earlier version of it compared to mobiles in every aspect except one, the units, the current steam version lacks some content and the event that is going on right now on mobiles for the game's first anniversary, while that is not much of a reason to complain as SNK will surely update it soon its clear what SNK's priority is, money. I didnt want to make an extra point for this but i must mention that you also cannot transfer the data from your mobile to steam so you have to start from scratch, without a chance to get shop units for free.\n\nThats it for my rant, as i said in the beggining the gameplay is really good, they gave the series a new aproach while keeping the whole Metal Slug feeling on it, and the process of gaining new units in mobiles gives the game a true feeling of progression, it just feels right, but as the game is right now on steam i cannot recommend it, if you really must give the game a try do yourself a favor and use an android emulator or play only the campaign and stay away from multiplayer in steam and hopefully SNK will soon realize their mistake and make the steam version as good and F2P as the others.\n\nTL:DR: Lazy port, P2W, Mobile versions are much better.

But the thing that is a big-ish deal is that it's a complete port of the Mobile version.\n\nThen right when I click sortie, it brings me right into the game and right as it starts a text box comes up telling me to tap on the so-called unit. But before it tells me to tap on something that looked sort of like a.. Medic! :P It says "You need more AP to buy that, so wait a bit." (Didn't really read it because I wasn't planning on writing a review, so some stuff I might not have right.            The one thing I didn't understand was the map layout, it seemed like there should've been an option to scroll In And Out so I could see the whole map. I mean like because of this I didn't know where my soldier guys went, or where the other enemy guys came from til' the 2nd level mainly because I didn't look up until I had to hit pause to turn the sound off. And that brings me to my next point which that there is no customization of the options, c'mon SNK don't just port the game from a different platform without changing anything!\n","May 1, 2015","false","0.5"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

Many units have special moves you can click to use, adding a bit of strategy and timing to the gameplay.  A lot of different units available (though many locked behind a paywall).  Overall, a pretty fun game of it's type.\n\nCons:  While you can earn medals (real cash currency) in game, you can only buy temporary boosts and in-game currency with these medals.  Any pay-to-play units require you to buy them as DLC on Steam.  The game has multiplayer (1v1 and 2v2) which would be a plus, if anyone played this game.  I've tried many times to find both 1v1 and 2v2, but never have found anyone to play with.\n\nEssentially the game is fun in single-player mode.  But it falls flat after a while, when you realize the only reason you're grinding is to become stronger, but it's pointless when nobody else plays the game to compete with.  If you want more Steam achievements, that is really the only purpose to play, other than to pass a little time.  And games of this type are often free and a dime a dozen all over gaming sites like Kongregate.  It brings nothing new to the genre, but if you were to buy everything, you'd be spending close to $200 on a dead game.","May 3, 2015","false","6.1"," 15 of 23 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","15","23","0","0"

But this pc port unfortunately doesn't build up the same experience you would have experienced on a tablet. Control locations and layout make it difficult to fully interact with the game. The pay to win scenario is almost forced onto the user, with overpriced DLC packs that does force you to buy units you didn’t want in the first place.\n\nThe game in itself is a great concept and would highly recommend playing this game on its native device. Where the game is more balanced with the pay to win narrative, and the controls make more sense by adding to the overall experience.\n\nI really hope they fix their mindset on how the pc port works, the game brings back many fond memories of the metal slug franchise, and its disappointing to see it end up this way.","May 2, 2015","false","3.8"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","1"

It feels like a lazy mobile port that is locked to 4:3, the controls feel unfinished on both controller and keyboard/mouse and the game balance seems to be based around premium currency (which does not seem to be included on the Steam version, but is on mobile).\n\nThe DLC prices seem to be extremely high for a game ported to PC with such laziness as well. A poorly executed mobile port which can only be played in two 4:3 resolutions should not cost as much money as GTA V, Skyrim and Far Cry 4 combined.\n\nIf they'd re-balanced the game to be fun without microtransactions, included most of the DLC, optimised the controls/settings for PC and then charged £10 for the game, I would be rcomending it. Of course, they'd make less money if they had done that, so they didn't. Not recomended.","May 3, 2015","false","1.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's a poor imitation of the real "Metal Slug", true, but it's still a very nice game and I loved it! The one reason that makes this game pay-to-win is the "vs mode" because if you haven't bought any of the DLC or at least the most powerful one, there is no way you can win a battle in the "vs mode". But that doesn't ruin the game... at least not for me. Find a few friends and play with them on "vs mode" if you REALLY want to play versus people that bad. But if you don't want to play this game with anyone, then just stick to everything except the "vs mode" you'll get REKT in less than 10 seconds. :D  Overall my personal rating for this game would be 8/10, because of the pay-to-win-unless-you-have-friends "vs mode". Enjoy the game! It's quite entertaining. :)","June 3, 2015","true","15.8"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Ahh the medals in here are just to buy items that nobody gives a ♥♥♥♥ why? because they are gone when you use them so it's like to put little wheels on your bike and not LEARN how to play without the help of powerups.(of course some people actually needs those Power ups but this is my personal opinion)\nWhich units can you buy? like EVERY SINGLE ONE YOU CAN and Want\nRootmars = 500 Medals, Kyo Kusanagi = 300 Medals, Mature = 300 medals, etc etc and a long etc\nof course on the mobile device you can pay for those units with google money but that's up to you\nit's not needed since you can afford them by your efforts and time.\n\nSECOND: CONTROLS! and this is one of the most FU CK S annoys me,\non the Mobile Device you use your fingers to tap the buttons on the menu to produce units or making the\nAP rating increase, so you have those "controls" to move free and it's comfortable.\nAND HERE YOU HAVE NOTHING MORE THAN THE STUPID MOUSE... yeahh\nthat means you have ACTUALLY HAVE to use the mouse FOR EVERYTHING, NOO macro key shortcuts\nfor units or EVEN to move the Camera (Some Stages are Larger and you need to move the camera to see the\nother side of the map to plan your strategy on wich units you should use against the enemy ones)\nso it's more more difficult and tedious here with only using the mouse to do all that ♥♥♥♥ stuff\non the phone you have all the fingers on your ♥♥♥♥ing hands to play in any way you want.\neven with your feet if you ♥♥♥♥ing FU CK ING Want ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥it.\nwith the mouse only its horrible AND I MEAN HORRIBLE to play\ni was hoping for massive improvements, like using keys to move the map around,\nfor assigned macro keys to the slots on the units, like Starcraft or Something\nso it would be easier and comfortable to play on PC.\n\nTHIRD: GraphicS!

Now with a nice little defense game from phones to pc, this is basically a mobile port. Weird to see these mobile games come to steam huh?. Well, the gameplay itself is very nice, very fluid, but the game most of it is pay to win. So i wouldn't play much of this game since it kinda dissappoints me, every now and then i see these mobile games coming to steam. I really am that one guy who owns an android device and an iOS device and to be honest, we mostly get a bunch of these kinds of games now and then, the appstore being filled with clash of clans copies, minecraft copies and even this one bad company called Gameloft copying games from console games like lets see, modern combat? NOVA? how about Gangstar?, mostly turning them pay to win and dissappointing, but heres something funny, these mobile guys playing these games like no tomorrow. Well im not that person who plays those games, im one of those who play games that have been ported to mobile. Honestly, SNK is not a bad company since they have been releasing a bunch of great ports from arcade games, and i own Garou: Mark of the Wolves, The king of Fighters series, fatal fury and specially these brilliant metal slug games on my android phone. So back to the topic, we find these games mostly on the appstore and google play and then surprisingly we find these games on steam, i wouldnt play this game at all since its more of a pay to win type of game. The only games i seen good for mobile are Clash of Clans and games that have been ported. So yeah, there are also copies of these kinds of games around the appstore, mostly i seen are ads popping out like this one called Heroes Charge. Anyways, i would not recommend this game at all, if you play this game since mobile then keep on going, but note that there is no cross platform from mobile to steam.\n\nIt's not that metal slug is not a bad series, but this game dissappoints me and others.","May 1, 2015","false","0.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This is a great port.  Its probably the version of Windows you are using that sucks.  Im using Windows 7 and this game has worked flawlessly.  Great graphics, simple but difficult gameplay.  If you know how to use your guys abilities at the right time and making sure you adjust your lineup, you should have a lot of fun with this game.  Sure sometimes you are going to die and you will need to save for an upgrade or two.  This game is challenging and rewarding at the sametime.  Eventually your progress will slow down a ton since you will have to die and grind gold to upgrade in order to pass the current level, but that's the style of this game.  I give it a 9/10 and highly recommend it since its free.","August 8, 2015","true","2.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

If you've played games like Warfare 1917 then you might know what the gameplay is like.  It's a defense game where you need to combine offense and defense to push back the enemies and destroy the enemy base(or a boss in this game).  It's a type of gameplay that's easy to learn but can be difficult to master.  The game is great as a single player strategy game that you can play if you've got a little bit of time but I haven't played the vs mode yet.\n\nThis game doesn't play anything like the old Metal Slug games so if you're a fan of them then there's no guarantee that you'll like this.  The DLC is quite expensive and should be able to be earned in-game(my opinion) but you should be more than powerful enough to overpower the enemy if you grind a little.  There are reports of a bug that makes your SV-001 tank disappear if you remove it from your hand so I suggest checking the forums to see if it still exists before you think of removing it from your hand.\n\nAll in all it's still a fun game even with its flaws.  I suggest checking it out since it's F2P and you don't need to buy the DLC to enjoy it.  Probably would have been better as a $10 title that comes with all of the DLC.","May 6, 2015","true","11.6"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","6","14","0","0"

I dont mind at all. works fine on my desktop. I downloaded this not really expecting much but within an hour i was hooked. its pretty addicting TD style is different for Metal Slug but works well. I played for free as long as i could but eventually hit a wall. I saw steam was having a sale on all the DLC 13 bucks or something like that. Figured that sounded fair and picked it up. The game kinda feels empty without it. The business model of the game is really trying to milk you for money as all F2P games usually do. However knowing that SNK Playmore is in and has always been financial crisis i felt like handing over a few bucks to the company thats given me so many childhood memories with its awesome roster of arcade games....didnt really need to think about it long. The DLC is heavily priced at normal value...so wait for a good sale. What really bites me is that the online VS mode is so crap. They should really have a community in the game. see who is online. chat or battle it out. instead you have 2 modes 1 on 1 or 2 on 2. click which mode you want to play and wait for some random hook up...usually way better than you. but getting my ♥♥♥ kicked made me laugh so thats something. all in all. i would recommend it but as it is fun. Pick up at least the KOF DLC if you really want to get more out of it....but wait till its like 75 percent off or something.","May 22, 2015","true","39.0"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Its pointless.\nAll you do in the game is click a few places on the screen theres no real gameplay so it gets boring fast.","May 2, 2015","false","1.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Though, there are rare occasions where there are stage hazards (invincible enemies underneath the playing field shooting upwards etc.) to mix things up.\n- More grinding sessions than a dollar strip joint, but there is Autoplay for already completed levels and the occasional Raid option to cash in directly.\n\n\nBad:\n\n- Medal prices are a TOTAL scam, given the huge amount of expensive units and items. Standard price is 30 Medals for a buck, while the sale price (100 for a buck) makes much more sense and should be standard instead. This is THE major flaw of the game.\n- YMMV, but if you meet cheaters online, they WILL anger you for at least a minute.\n\n\n===================\n\n\nNow, moving on to the Steam version:\n\nIt has no improvements over the mobile version, it's a direct port. In fact, it's worse. It's in fact a bigger scam because you can't even buy units with Medals, you can only use real money. Not only that, you HAVE to buy them in packs, you can't pick the ones that you want.\n\n\n\nVerdict: I don't know what's worse; this or King of Fighters 12.","May 2, 2015","false","3.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Personally i think there should be keys that let you send out a unit instead of scrolling your bar. All the setting are for a mobile device i feel like it was a copy/paste situation. Example: when Resident Evil 6 came out the graphics where out of it and it was acting super buggy because  they did something similar, it wasn't prepared for PC so it was off. The issue i had was this was not the idea but how much work was put into making it a PC version.

It's actually a fun game. It's definitely not like other Metal Slug games and it definitely has some overpriced DLC and broken matchmaking, which pairs you up against players that are way stronger than you are. And you indeed only have a limited amount of sortie points you can use to start missions that regenerate rather slowly.\n\nThe game however, does not require you to purchase anything to play and have fun, you can unlock plenty of units by simply playing the game and upgrade them, the DLC units are definitely not required to beat the game. You are also able to change your windows time to get more sortie points, which sort of goes around the sortie point limit you have.\n\nAbout people saying the game is a bad mobile port. The only 2 things that annoyed me were the fact that the splashscreen said 'Tap the screen' and that you have to unnecessarily scroll through your units, which would have easily fit in the PC screen.\n\nAnd about the people complaining about the graphics being bad when you play in full screen. It's sort of true, but people tend to forget that the graphics of this game are just like the old Metal Slugs and that those were not meant to be on huge monitors like me have these days and that the game can also be played in smaller windowed mode, which is just as fun.","May 23, 2015","true","10.2"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

There is just one question that you need to answer if you want to know if it's a hit or not for you. Do you want to play it on single player or multiplayer?\n\nSee all of these DLCs? I don't think any of them are of use while playing alone - you can beat everything with basic and few unlockables units. It might be hard at begin but all you need is good strategy. And some time to make yours unit and base more powerful. Sure, it probably makes some things easier - but then you won't have much fun beating hard or very hard levels.\n\nThe problem starts if you want to fight 1vs1 or 2vs2 online. Units from DLCs are sure to bring you victory but paying this much for few units... nah, don't do it. Don't waste money over a free game. Even if it's Metal Slug, it's not worth this much money. Even at -50/75/90%.\n\nBesides that, it's kinda addictive game. They didn't bother to change even "tap to begin" at main screen but it's just a little thing. It's fun game, as long as you will limit yourself to playing alone.

For this style of game, Metal Slug Defense is okay. I've played better, I've played worse. The main problem here is how slapdash a PC port it is. Even in windowed mode the jaggies and low-res graphics will slice your eyeballs, and the game's menus and movement are still very much based around tapping and dragging. A mouse works, of course, but clumsily.\n\nI still recommend the game though, albeit barely, because it's free and you don't really need to buy anything to play it for a few hours. If you're wanting a Castle Defense styled game on your PC, well, I'd suggest you look up the excellent game CastleStorm instead. But if you don't want to pay any money, this one will do the job cheap and dirty.","May 1, 2015","true","0.6"," 16 of 60 people (27%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","27","16","60","6","1"

It's pretty nice when you are on the toilet or visiting your wife's parents, but yeah, it's a mobile game. I don't think I will be playing it on the PC. But if you have never played it and wonder if it's any good, then just give it a go. It's free and you CAN actually play it without spending a dime.\n\nThe In-app purchases are not very well thought out in this port. I played this game on Android quite a bit and my favorite units are the natives. I would have probably gotten them in the Steam port too, if they weren't in a $30 bundle with some other stuff I don't need. I mean, the bundles ARE actually cheaper than playing on phone. You would easily spend more than the $30 buying them one by one.\n\nBut that's where this game goes wrong. The whole point of micro-transactions is to offer a lot of small and seemingly harmless purchases. Take Hearthstone for example. One pack of cards costs what? $1,5? That's nothing. However, the amount of packs I've bought is somewhere between 50 and 100 which totals over 75 bucks. Could have bought GTA V with that.\n\nThis turned out as more of a blog post than a review. Oh well, final verdict? I'm going to give it thumbs up, just because people keep downvoting it without even giving it a try first. Just give it a spin.

That is a good thing, since it forces you to  continue using the basic units, instead of never again using them after unlocking others, as well as being  slightly more authentic to Metal Slug.\n\nAll in all, I will probably play the ♥♥♥♥ out of this, again.

Lane defense isn't quite right but it seems to fit so lets go with that. Your troops come from the left and march to the right. If they reach the end then the enemy base will be there and they will attack it. If they destroy it you win and if the same happens to you then you lose.\n\nI am going to grit my teeth and recommend this game. The reason being is that while these types of games are badly recieved and this one is no exception, It's Metal Slug! I don't say that with tearful nostalgia blinding me, but the animations the music the atmosphere, all of it comes from the Metal Slug series and it still holds up here. Okay some parts are jarring like having 3 marcos on screen at once and no, this is not a game you 'play' so much as it is a game you click a lot and it plays itself but that allows you to really take in all the Metal Slug style and quality of animations.\n\nUnusually or maybe just lazily the port features a stamina system like most pay to win/cash shop games do in their phone iterations. These are normally cut for PC release and maybe that will be the case later down the line for MSD as well especially since the game has a ton of DLC and no doubt they will want to shovel that onto you ASAP, as these games go.\n\nA lot of negative reviews are saying this isn't Metal Slug, they took the graphics and art and assests and just strung out a mannequin to say "hey kids, come spend your money on Metal Slug! We even skinned Fio alive so now you can wear her as a hat!". This game is as blatant a cash grab and resprayed paintjob as you will ever see. But the worth of any game is, can you have fun playing it? For me the answer is yes.\n\nDespite what you hear from blind fanboys hating the game and downvoting my review this is a large game! Infact it is the largest Metal Slug game to date! I have played them all and this is more of a celebration of the history of Metal Slug.\n\nAll the key boss fights are here and this time you can also play as the bosses too.\nWell over 200 missions/quests, plenty of free units if you don't want to spend money on DLC, truey fantastic netcode with 0 lag and the option to fight 2v2 as well as 1v1.\nThis game is tremendous fun if you can get into it.

Let me say that again, it's free. Beyond that it's fun and easy to control. Just replace "touch" with "click" and that's the biggest obstacle a lot of nay-sayers have with this game.\n\nYou are only allowed so many plays at a time judged by "units". You start off with 110 units with missions in the beggining costing 5 - 10 units. If you beat all missions in a level (of which there are a whopping 4 in the first level) you regain your units back. Some missions even award units based on performance.\n\nWinning will award you credits which you can use to level up units and such. You can also buy items in a store to aid in a mission. You are given 200 "dollars" at the beginning and I'm not sure how you get more.\n\nIt's free, simple to play, and easy to learn.","May 1, 2015","true","36.7"," 4 of 37 people (11%) found this review helpful","11","4","37","0","0"

It's an interesting take on tower defense that repurposes old sprites into a different genre. It's a nostalgia trip and a delightfully funny action romp that could eat your time away.\n\nIf only this PC version wasn't so fixated on destroying your wallet, I'd recommend it to everyone. As it stands, one cannot progress past a certain part of the campaign without either getting lucky, spending an exorbitant amount of time in the multiplayer or paying for better units.\n\nWhile the campaign is a no thrills trek through every arena, what I truly enjoy is the Mission Mode. That allows you to play with all the units from the game in quick, challenge based objectives. It can be a bit unfair at times (which falls in line with the Pay-To-Win mentality of the game), but it is quite fun.\n\nWhat isn't fun is making progress through the map and hitting a brick wall. The game cleverly masks this by claiming certain levels are "Hard", but that is a bunch of malarkey. What SNK Playmore has done is just boosted the players ego until they eventually hit one of the "Hell" levels.\n\nIn these scenarios, the enemy already has units out at the start and charges forth with units you cannot possibly obtain yet. It makes for frustrating, soul crushing defeats that leave you wondering what you're doing with your life. A game shouldn't make me question my own mortality.\n\nI could maybe get on board if there were a buy all pack for $10, but SNK saw it fit to sell you 12 characters for $30. That isn't even every piece of DLC available, either. Couple that with the way you're trickle fed medals, which act as currency for power-ups, and you might as well not bother.\n\nNothing about the pricing structure in Metal Slug Defense is redeemable. To make matters worse, the multiplayer doesn't even work well. If you wanted to grind out medals online, you might be waiting upwards of 20 minutes to find a match. I've got much better things to do than stare at an alien twirling a ray gun.\n\n2/10","May 10, 2015","false","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's no option to turn off the music OR the sound, it's both or nothing, and I always hate that.\nbattles are hilariously small, short, and senseless. There's very little strategy to it.\nThe tutourial is built up like taking it slow and saving up money for stronger units is the better strategy, but no. You can just spam the 2 soldiers you get at the start and it'll be just as good, if not better. If anything, it'll be faster.\nThe screens are hilariously small which makes no sense. The second a unit goes off-screen, it's attacking the enemy base. Where's the tension from not knowing what your soldiers are doing?\nMaybe it woulda been OK if your base LOOKED LIKE A BASE AND NOT LIKE A TUBE. And NOT 10 miles away from the EDGE OF THE SCREEN.\nand of course, it's a mobile game, so MICROTRANSACTIONS GALORE. Bait everywhere, items you can use to overcome the challenge with your wallet and not your skill!\nThe units don't even look Metal Slug.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AlexAminous/recommended/356310/","AlexAminous","AMIN THE GAMER","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AlexAminous/","354 products in account","An enjoyable game when you got that extra time or when you start your morning pace.\n\n1. All bases max out at Level 30, plus there are all 34 characters if I'm not mistaken and all Maxed Level 30.\n\n2. The best unit I've used by far is the SV-Camel since it's cheap and fast to deploy to the front.\n\n3. Max AP is 690 which took me about 11 hours and 30 minutes to fill up.\n\n4. Tips: If you want to get extra resource drop quicker, you should deploy the samurai plane, it's the most effective resource collecting unit I've tried by far.\n\n5. Always use the Wall barricade and max it up because it holds your front units from heavy attacks.\n\n6. If you set for the daily missions, first aim for the ones with the highest AP, so that later you can get the POWs early and quick and you can easily focus on the easier missions later on. Always aim for the daily missions first because it will unlock more units which are stronger and better for late missions.\n\n7. FYI Max number of medals gained from completing all missions would be 1005 in approx. since I never use up all of it and I never cheat in this game anyway.\n\n8. If late missions too difficult you could try older easier missions that could give you more money for your HQ and unit upgrades. Check for the rewards gained. The best would be the daily missions since the 40AP missions give you 42000 plus 6000 if you finish with S.\n\n9. ALWAYS upgrade your units especially since it will give you more MAX HP and improved firepower.\n\n10. Never forget to use characters' abilities (flashing characters means they have special attacks available) since it gives you advantages when under siege. More characters deployed means more advantage over firepower. It's the SV-Camel I use that is most handy in most of the time. And make sure to have backup units like the Wall Barricade.\n\n11. Use balanced units for missions that require them. In missions where zombie Fio spew hazardous long-range vommit, you need to unlock zombie Marco since he is capable of similar long-range attacks that could kill even Morden's Tank and the huge Robot thingy (screw the names I forget that often). You need backups though since zombie Marco is slow and has vulnerably poor HP. Some tanks would do, with the Kermit tank as the best tanker for the front.\n\n12. When things went nuts, use Kermit Tank to sweep your foes away from the base.\n\n13. I'm bored, that's why I type this thing. To wash my boredness awaaayyyy.....\n\n14. I have lots of assignments with deadlines and what did I do? I wrote a thesis of gaming techniques instead dO.ob\n\n15.

How it grew as an arcade makes it hard to grow in today's industry of consoles. Nonetheless, all companies can find a way around this console curve to make it fit well in a PC game or console.\nThis feels like a spin off or like somebody made a flash game. While it IS indeed playable, it's just a game of grinding MSP (The currency in the game) and using it on computers that give less than a decent challenge.\n\nGood thing there's multiplayer, right? Wrong. The multiplayer is obviously "Pay to win". On my first search for a fight, I was fighting a guy with helicopters bought from the dlc pack probably. Not only that, but everything I threw at the helicopters proved useless as it FLEW over all of my units and killed them FROM ABOVE. These are not advanced players. These are players who are literally just so bored of this game that they are willing to pay to make it fun. This game is unbalanced in multiplayer unless you are willing to give real money. So forget that tag that says "Free to play" because that's only for an easy fight on computers with a grinding system of MSP while getting overthrown by your fellow competitors who actually paid.\n\nSNK, you made Metal Slug really hard to beat without dying, but it was never impossible. You just made it FEEL impossible, which is fine because you still proved that you can beat the game with just one quarter.\n\nBUT, for this game here, it is simply just not okay. Even if it WASN'T about Metal Slug, I would still complain about the huge difference of powers between players. You should've thought more about the balancing of powerful units in the PVP. I'm quite ashamed of you, especially since I don't hear much of Metal Slug anymore. Leaving this as your mark for your games would be disgraceful. Leaving this as your last mark for Metal Slug means you are ready to let it die.","August 10, 2015","false","20.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't know where people get the "Pay to win" attitude from, because so far I am on the 5th area and the only thing that has slowed me down is waiting for the sortie count to go back up. The only thing you have to pay for is the new characters and quick boosts which happens in EVERY free to play game. Nobody is forcing you to spend anything so quit the whining.\n\nA very fun and unique take on the tower defense game and infused with Metal Slug characters and humor. And it's free.\n\nPay no attention to the entitled fanboys.
