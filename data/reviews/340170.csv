Perhaps a hi-res texture/shadow pack will arrive in the future (or modded in) but for now we're looking at a pretty crappy variety of graphical options.\n\nNOTE: This game is locked to 30fps due to engine limitations, being a PSP game originally. There will likely be no fix/mod to make it run beyond that. If you are one of those people who consider 30fps to be unacceptable, you will not like this game. However, for those who don't mind 30fps, this game runs very smoothly on 30fps, haven't seen a single drop so far, even during the most intense part of the opening section.\n\nFinal rating: THUMBS UP if you can get over the fact that this is a port of a game on vastly inferior hardware and not a PC game made from scratch and can get over the 30fps lock and somewhat lacking graphics in some areas.\n\nTHUMBS DOWN if you can't.","August 18, 2015","true","29.5"," 1,009 of 1,205 people (84%) found this review helpful 41 people found this review funny","84","009","1","41","20"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/topologic/recommended/340170/","topologic","Topology","http://steamcommunity.com/id/topologic/","153 products in account","I'm one of the (seemingly) few people that had the luck to have played the PSP version of Final Fantasy Type-0 before having purchased this version.  For this reason, my opinions might not resonate as well with some of you as with others.  Bearing this in mind, I've come to appreciate this game for what it does well (combat and story), even in spite of what it does not do well (this list is longer).\n\nFirst, the graphics are going to be a sore spot for many that have played and that will play this game.  The cliche argument is that, since Final Fantasy Type-0 HD is a current-gen port of a PSP game, our expectations concerning graphic fidelity must be tailored accordingly.  This is true, but I don't think it is entirely fair, either.  I doubt there are as many people out there that genuinely seem to be affected by graphics as the trolls might suggest, but Square Enix has unintentionally made this issue worse than it had to be.  This is because they decided to rework graphics in some areas, while leaving others indistinguishable from their PSP counterparts.  This is apparent in textures, character models, etc.\n\nNow, that doesn't sound so bad, but when you consider the fact that changed and unchanged models and textures can appear in tandem, the difference between new and old is made more stark.  The earliest example of this that I can think of occurs after the first mission, where General Qator Bashtar (with a relatively updated model) appears next to a random imperial grunt (whose model was not updated).  The difference is jarring, and it casts the game in a poor light relatively early on.  Now, I don't care about graphics in the least, but to say things like this are not noticeable is a pretty ludicrous claim.\n\nSecond, the gameplay.  Square Enix got it right this time.  I thoroughly enjoy games in the Kingdom Hearts series, but I worry that I'll get diabetes from the sickly-sweet tone and story.  Well, Final Fantasy Type-0 HD takes what the Kingdom Hearts games do right in terms of combat, and pairs it with a much more mature plot (to be discussed further down).  In Final Fantasy Type-0 HD, you are given fourteen playable characters with relatively distinct archetypes ranging from slow, heavy melee (Cinque and Jack) to quick melee (Machina, Seven, Eight, Rem) to quick ranged (King, Ace, Cater), to slow ranged (Trey), to buffbots (Deuce and kinda Queen) and pretty much everywhere in between.  The game gives you many ways to play, and is likely to please any player that enjoys action RPGs.  Combat is further augmented with Killsights and Breaksights, which leverage the game's lock-on system to allow the player to deliver powerful attacks on opponents at certain times (usually tethered to the target's activity).  Magic is sufficiently powerful, as well, though it may seem more costly in the early game than in the end.  Summons are one of the game's weak points, as I've found that Eidolons are generally not worth using unless you absolutely have to, since the forced death that they inflict on you is reflected in your post-mission statistics and score.\n\nMissions are fun, and they can take place in either a pure-combat corridor style similar to some FPS games, or they can take on a more RTS-like feel in campaign missions.  I've found both to be enjoyable, though how much enjoyment I take from the game is dependent on the mission itself.  One notable improvement in this version of Type-0, as opposed to the PSP version, is that you can replay the RTS missions from the main menu.  This was not possible in the PSP version, which always irked me, since I would've liked to have been able to replay them from time to time, as you might be tempted to do if you need to grind levels to get past a roadblock, in typical JRPG fashion.  The missions themselves tend to be fairly combat-heavy, with some other objectives sometimes interspersed amidst the carnage.\n\nNext, the story.  Type-0 does not spoon feed the story to its players, so you'll probably need to spend some time reading the Rubicus (the game's in-world encyclopedia) to get all the background information necessary to appreciate what is going on in the world.  I think the game is better for this, though.  Orience is a place whose complexity seemingly mirrors our own world in its sheer depth.  I certainly wouldn't expect any game about our world to be immediately and completely understandable to any external players.  As the game progresses, the stakes of the war at hand escalate until a victor is decided, but the end is sudden, abrupt, and brutal.  It took me a fair amount of external reading to make sense of it, which is rare.  At the end of the day, though, I consider the story to have actually been one of this game's stronger points.\n\nOne of the worst changes I think they could have made with respect to this version of Final Fantasy Type-0 is the complete removal of its multiplayer component.  Honestly, when I first heard that Type-0 was being remade for consoles, a revision of its multiplayer sprang forth as one of the first overdue changes that would be made.  The original PSP version had a sort of local multiplayer that required people to convene and play together, despite the fact that the Internet was a thing.  Granted, it's not like we needed Link Cables or any other such antiques to engage in jolly cooperation, but the game came out in 2011 and eschewed the seemingly more user-friendly Internet-based option for something that parents nowadays probably tell their children about when the Internet is out in true "back in my day..." fashion.  However, and I guess I shouldn't be surprised, this version of Type-0 has absolutely no multiplayer whatsoever.  As anyone that's played this game for more than an hour can tell you, this game desperately needs multiplayer, since the party AI is dumb as a bag of rocks.  Many times, your teammates will only be good for casting Cure spells on you when you get hurt carrying them to the finish line.  Functional, practical multiplayer could have helped alleviate many players' frustration with this.\n\nAs for good changes they've made, I already mentioned the new ability to replay RTS missions.  Additionally, opening the menu now actually pauses the game (that pause option on the first screen of the menu used to be the only way to pause the game), so you won't be taking bullets while you navigate to the item you want to use.  I think the updated character models look pretty good, as well.  As I continue to play through the game, I'll probably encounter more good changes than bad ones.\n\nSo yeah, that's my review.  I consider this game to be worth purchasing, and I consider its current review score on Steam  (53% positive, 47% negative as of this posting) to be both unacceptable and troubling.  It's unacceptable because I think this game is good, and troubling because this kind of knee-jerk response, toward what is likely a new experience for many of those angry reviews, reflects on gamers and gaming poorly.  I like this game, and if you like ARPGs and JRPGs, I think that you should buy it.\n\nEDIT (8/20/2015):  See the comments section for some more information about the game, since these reviews apparently have size limits.","August 18, 2015","true","61.5"," 456 of 548 people (83%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","83","456","548","13","36"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/faerly/recommended/340170/","faerly","Faerly","http://steamcommunity.com/id/faerly/","230 products in account","Great combat lost in a mediocre game\nLet me start this off by saying I'm a huge fan of Final Fantasy games both old and new, and am always excited by where they take the series. That said, this game preserves a few of the worst aspects of the series and doesn't quite make up for it enough with what it tries to do.\n\nFirst, it's very obvious that this was a PSP game. Low-resolution textures, stilted cutscenes where characters just stand and talk at each other, and a camera that swings wildly for no reason at all while locked onto enemies make the game a lot harder to digest than one might expect from a different, bigger-budget title. Some games find ways to shine through these issues, but unfortunately Type-0 is not one of them.\n\nManaging fourteen different party members is tiresome, and most of them don't recieve any character development besides a one-dimensional attribute. While the ability to navigate towns and the overworld as any character is a welcome touch, the symptom of this is your character doesn't have any meaningful interactions with the world, and often interacting with other characters shows you a scene that your character isnt even in. If you are the type of person that likes to understand ambient dialogue, you're out of luck. The english dub is atrocious, clearly made by paying the lowest-budget actors possible to simply read their lines off of a page. They also like to pause in their sentences where the subtitles stop on the screen, even if it makes no sense in the sentence. I'm guessing this is a symptom of some sort of PSP audio buffering where they had to divide up the audio files, but I've never noticed it in other heavily voice-acted PSP games so maybe I'm just giving them too much credit.\n\nThe story isnt necessarily bad, the world is an interesting take on the Nova Crystalis universe, and the opening cutscene is incredible. However, after the game's opening, the story is mostly told through stilted dialogue sequences and war documentary-style voiceovers, with very little in the way of actual character or action. The soundtrack is forgettable and plays softly in the background of these sequences, never shaping the emotion of the scenes.\n\nThe gameplay loop seems fun at first glance, but quickly becomes tiresome. The actual draw of the game, the missions, happen somewhat rarely, and much of the sidequests consist of wandering the empty overworld hunting for specific random battles. To make matters worse, you can only hold one sidequest at a time, though quests to deliver monster drops thankfully let you farm those drops while completing other missions. Still, this system often results in you wasting time trekking all the way back to turn in quest just so you can accept another quest that you could have completed at the same time. There's no excuse for this system, especially since the game is further slowed down by random battles on the overworld rather than a more modern approach such as overworld monsters.\n\nThe one thing this game does absolutely right is its combat. The breaksight/killsight system, essentially giving you "moments of opportunity" before or after enemy attacks to do massive damage, interrupt, and/or kill them, makes combat feel exciting and not the "mash the attack button" that other action rpgs such as Crisis Core devolve into. Each of the fourteen characters has different combos and feels unique to play, requiring different timing to hit killsights and letting you navigate the battlefield uniquely. Unfortunately, even the combat is marred somewhat by the camera not behaving well while locked onto enemies in close quarters, and since there's no manual aim, ranged characters will have difficulty hitting certain moving targets since the lock-on doesn't lead them properly. Still, even with these issues, I'm confident in saying that combat is a blast, and plenty challenging.\n\nAll in all, I can't find myself able to recommend this game, except perhaps to a small audience that's looking for fun action-rpg combat and doesn't mind a lot of grinding and lackluster characters. To the rest of us, we can hold out hope for some of Square's newer games in the future.","September 24, 2015","false","14.8"," 318 of 436 people (73%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","73","318","436","15","6"

Despite that, I decided that I wanted to review it.\n\n+ Fairly long, took me about 60 hours to beat it once, but then again I play like a tortoise.\n+ Game looks great, especially Class Zero and a couple of other NPC's. Same goes for certain maps as well.\n+ Story is engaging enough if you're into that.\n+ A likable main cast that are well fleshed out. They're fairly cliché, but they also gets the job done. In this point I also want to include that there are a lot of playable characters, each with their own set of abilities and playstyle. You will most certainly find a favorite amongst them, and one of the greatest parts of the game for me was experimenting with all of them to figure out which one suited me the best.\n+ Good replayability, if you want to experience everything you will have to play it through at least twice, and with several difficulty levels and the amount of characters available this will not be boring.\n+ Combat was a bit difficult for me to get into at the beginning, but once I got the hang of it I was treated to one of the best combat systems I've experienced in recent years.\n+ Voice acting is nice, although I thoroughly despised the English voices. The Japanese voices are amazing however.\n+ No major difficulty spikes as you're encouraged to explore. If you find yourself underleveled, there is always the arena and special training.\n+ Skill improvement for both abilities and magic is pretty fun, since you won't be able to unlock everything in a single playthrough most of the time.\n+ Fun conversations/cutscenes and quests around the main hub.\n+ Death system works great, and you're encouraged to try to keep everyone alive in order to get as high a rating as possible on missions.\n+ Super speed for when you want to move from one place to another quickly.\n+ In my opinion, a great ending. (reminded me of Mass Effect though...)\n\n- A controller is a must if you are going to play this. Don't get me started on how poorly optimized mouse and keyboard is for this game.\n- Textures for everything but Class Zero is generally pretty bad. Though since this is a remastered PSP game that is fairly forgivable. If you're not the type of person that cares much about graphics (like me), you will likely not mind the occasional Tomb Raider III type of graphics.\n- Not very noob friendly, while it does explain all the major aspects of the game, some things are left out.\n- The antagonists are not very memorable, and neither is the plot as a whole.\n- While you're given the freedom to explore freely, there is time limit on how much you can do at once. Later on this was reversed and I was given more freedom than the US but not enough stuff to do.\n- Side quests, while fun, are not as many as I had hoped for. Especially when you visit minor towns there are often only one quest to do in each, and you probably won't need to return to that town ever again.\n\nAll in all, I can definitely recommend this game. In the beginning I was not sure whether or not I wanted to continue playing it, but I'm glad I did. This has been all I've been playing for some time now and I don't want to put it down anytime soon.

This right here is what the internal dev teams at Square Enix need to channel when creating new and more Final Fantasy games.\n\nGranted, Type-0's PSP roots show. We have ourselves many many "Loading" pauses in between levels, intra-level sections, rooms/corridors during exploration, loading for the Crystarium (ingame library... sigh; BUT we also have game systems that actually work in spite of these limitations. Team micromanagement that's actually not a chore. Quick and satisfying switching between numerous varied team members during battle.\n\nAnd what a bloody awesome team these characters of "Class Zero" have turned out to be. Imagine for a moment that you have to somehow juggle a ridiculous three-man team of a mace wielder, a PLAYING CARD master and a girl with a rather powerful FLUTE..... Think on that last for a moment..... Moving on, imagine further that on ANY DIFFICULTY this game can throw you some nasty curveballs to the extent that you'd better not develop favorites.

And believe me, the war-torn world depicted in game does this system credit. The motley crew of 14 members of Class Zero have the uneviable task of putting an end to a gruesome war waged among four nations. Each with their own motives. Each very susceptible to shifting alliances. And all not averse to a little betrayal. This story is told in a rather fascinating documentary-esque (yes, I created some word to serve this review) format with timeslots describing events in no particular order. First impressions of these approach would have you thinking that the story is ridiculously incoherent...\n\nExcept you'd be wrong. Very wrong.\n\nFor good or ill for some, this serves to create alot of suspense and poses questions that build up especially at the end of the game with its multiple endings. The explanation of which requires a second playthrough to unlock more information in the form of cutscenes and dialog. It's even more surprising that the story is so much more engaging and with real pathos as compared to FF-XIII; which incidentally shares the same "Fabula Nova Crystallis" mythos, but executed in a totally different way.\n\nIn closing, will there be niggles, yes. For now your framerate will be locked to 30FPS. Minor characters apart for Class Zero have some very dodgy texture work inluding some environmental areas and level design here had to take the portable nature of title into account. But, it is all executed very well in terms of pacing and story beats. Add in the fact that the New Game+ explains more of the story and we may have ourselves a winner here in terms of a great sub-series with mature sensibilities.\n\nTake the plunge.","September 10, 2015","true","141.9"," 89 of 111 people (80%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","80","89","111","7","2"

And yet, it succeeds where past entries in the main series failed: it captures the Final Fantasy magic while adding its own identity and mixing the formula. The game has its flaws, but most of them have more to do with its portable nature than game design.\n\nThe story is about a group of elite cadets called Class Zero. The game starts as your nation, Rubrum, is invaded by the adjacent empire and almost succeeds in seizing the crystal from which all of your magic comes. Class Zero manages to repel the enemy forces, but Rubrum loses a considerable chunk of territory. The plot revolves around the resulting war (and more, but let's not spoil anything, okay?)\n\nGameplay is fantastic. Not because it is innovative. It is an action RPG with pretty standard controllers. You dodge, attack and use special skills and magic. However, three things make it great:\n\n1. It is incredibly smooth. This version fixed the blurry camera and you don't need to lock on enemies all the time (though you'll end up doing it anyway, because of killstrikes.) Everything is responsive and intuitive.\n\n2. There's an enourmous cast of characters, and every one of them feels different. Some dodge better, some are ranged,  others attack faster or may even finish combos with AoE attacks. Every one of them has a distinct advantage (and disavantage) that changes the way you experience the game.\n\n3. Combat is strategic. The game will punish you for dishing out attacks without thought (some enemies will just dodge forever.) Also, attacking at a specific window of opportunity signaled by a visual cue will kill the enemy instantly, or at least deal considerable damage, if the enemy is too strong. It rewards you for playing the game well.\n\nAs for sounds and graphics, it is a mixed bag. Soundtrack is great and sound effects are perfect, as with any Final Fantasy, but the voice acting is surprisingly bad. Most voices are decent to good, actually, but when they're bad, they're distractingly awful. Graphics got an overhaul. Kinda. Main cast looks amazing and new lighting effects make for beautiful screenshots, but most NPCs and towns look blocky and with low-res textures.\n\nActually, the main problem with this game on PC is that it was designed for a portable system. So the portable design is all there: it's grindy, towns and dungeons are mostly corridors and dialogues are poorly animated. But don't get me wrong: there are absolutely more good parts than bad ones. In fact, even as a portable game, it surpasses its Fabula Nova console counterpart Final Fantasy XIII in content. There are tons of sidequests, open world map with explorable dungeons, you can breed chocobos, liberate towns... You'll definitely get your money's worth in gameplay hours.\n\nNow, the reason this game really gets to me: it is a fantastic deviation of the Final Fantasy usual tone. This game is all about death, but it chose not to take the easy route. Yes, there's a lot of killing and blood. But it doesn't stop there. It permeates the story, with its constant war. Characters in this world have their memory of the dead erased, so they can continue their neverending battles. In gameplay, fellow members of Class Zero can't be revived until the end of the mission. If they die, they stay dead until you go back. Eidolons need sacrifices to be summoned and magic is upgraded with Phantoma, which you harvest from the dead. It is a fantastic change of tone, well executed and more than welcome.\n\nNow, this is not a good port. It is resolution and frame locked. It has terrible performance issues (I can only get steady 30fps at all times without AA.) Keyboard layout is awkward and can't be changed, so you need to play with a controller for a decent gameplay experience.  Basically, it has none of the advantages PC gaming usually has over console gaming.\n\nBut what I really want to say is:\n\nIs this a good port? No.\nIs this an incredible addition to Steam's jRPG library? Hell yeah.","August 24, 2015","true","23.7"," 48 of 64 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","48","64","3","0"

There is no need to defend yourself against me. If you have a differing opinion on the game, I encourage you to write a review of your own. I do NOT encourage you to leave nasty comments and/or personal attacks on this review (nor does the Steam SA). You're welcome to disagree with my opinion, but please be civil and decent.\nFirst of all It is part of the "New Crystal" setting, like XIII and XV, meaning that it shares mythology/world concepts with them (while they are not the same world, the death/rebirth of life as a cycle is a major part of said mythology), which means that you will see concepts like l'Cie and fal'Cie, superpowered servants of Crystals (though you will not be playing one, unlike XIII), Magitek technology also plays a prominent role taken directly as it was in VI.\n\nGameplay-wise it is closer to an action RPG style brawler, combat is real time in a party of 3, but from the get go you maintain a group  of 12+ characters, if one of your current party member dies and you do not res them, you can replace them with another one from your Ship on the fly. You can switch which party member you control on the fly and there is at least basic AI programming and they generally are fairly competent.\n\nBoss fights can be a little bit underwhelming, but overal the game plays nice enough for a PSP (?) port and at least imo gameplay was solid.\n\nThe games story is told via "missions" which typically have save points during them, but have to be completed using the stuff you currently have on you. You can cancel your mission, though  and grind up if you need to when you find yourself stuck, though that has happened to me literally only once. In between missions you have a set amount of actions you can take, like attending classes, talking to other people (which typically gets you stuff), doing side quests or exploring. Unlike some other jRPGs that use similar mechanics, what you do during those segments has no real influence on the storyline though, it's all on rails (which isn't unusual for an FF of course)\n\nEach character uses a different weapon and has different traits/abilities that you unlock as you level up (though some abilities, especially passives, tend to overlap) and while it's fairly possible to just maintain a group of your favorite 3, there are multiple segments where you have to split up your group. You do not have to grind to catch up too much though, as you can attend lectures that at least somewhat level up the party members you do not use and you get enough money/loot to keep them all updated. Maintaining the entire party is sort of a ♥♥♥♥♥ at times, though.\nI just found 2 reasons which you might be afraid of..\n\n1.

A must play for any fans of the Final Fantasy series. Completed my first run through of the game in about 42 hours. With that being said, I'll state the pros first before the cons.\n\nPros\n-Interactive battle system.\n-Up to 14 characters for you to choose and master, each with a different playstyle.\n-One of the best storylines out there amongst the series.\n-Traditional Eidolon summons such as Shiva, Odin, Ifrit.\n-Soundtrack is amazing, as expected from Square Enix\n-Japanese VAs are unparalleled.\n-New game+ after completing the game for the first time.\n-Chocobos.\n\nCons\n-Needs a controller for a good gameplay experience.\n-Locking on system is abit clunky. Sometimes the items on the floor might be just infront of you and it takes ages for the system to detect.\n-AIs are abit ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at times, not hitting mobs, range supports not targetting aerial units etc etc.\n-FPS drops to about 15 on certain parts of the maps.\n-Certain boss fights are confusing, sometimes I'm not even sure if characters dying due to overpowered moves from bosses are part of the progress.\n-Gets grindy if you wish to unlock end-tier items for your characters.\n\nOverall would rate this game a 9/10.","August 31, 2015","true","46.3"," 42 of 56 people (75%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","75","42","56","5","0"

Lock-ons and targetting is clunky at first but you get the hand of it later on as the game progresses. If you like the more traditional style then this type of gameplay isn't for you. Skills and loadouts are fun to play around with and the AI for your teammates are mediocre so you'll see yourself swapping controls frequently in combat (with the exception of AI Deuce since she is amazing). Game also has its traditional summons like Ifrit and Shiva which require a heavy price to pay for using them. All the characters are versatile and have their own set of skills so play around with your favourites. Definitely need a controller to enjoy the gameplay - currently using a DS3 Controller and can't see myself playing this with a keyboard/mouse.\n\nSTORY : Story is alright. Not the best writing since I see myself paying attention more to the gameplay and sidequests, but I do find some areas of the story interesting. Considering it was originally a PSP game, good enough.\n\nVISUALS : HD version has made a huge difference for sure. If the original was ported, this would not look as great as it is now (still not up to par with other FF games but once again it is good for a PSP port to PC). Bit of frame rate issues here and there but fixed (at least for me) by optimizing graphic settings.\n\nAUDIO : As you'd expect from any FF game.\n\nSCORE : 3.5/5 Yet to finish and only 9 hours in. The clunky start did affect my score but as I continue playing I am positive I'd reconsider and give it a 4/5 later on.","August 23, 2015","true","14.9"," 46 of 65 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","46","65","0","0"

For a game that was on the PSP it looks about how I would expect. Some textures are clearly left over from the PSP but all in all I can't complain to much about the graphics on a game released 4 years ago on a hand held. I haven't finished the game yet but the story so far seems interesting enough and fairly typical of final fantasy with a bit of a darker feel. The gameplay however is what makes this game a definite recommendation for me. It has completely moved away from any sort of turn based actions during combat and feels a lot like kingdom hearts in terms of combat. However, just because it has taken out the turn based actions doesn't mean the strategy is gone. Class 0 has a diverse group of skills and learning how to manage them to make the best parties to overcome certain areas takes a bit of thought. Also learning how to use each character has been fun as they all have a different play style that takes getting used too. The time management between missions I found cool as it makes you think on what is most important for your team and what you can get done in the alotted time. So if you are looking for a game with ground breaking graphics this probably isn't for you but, if you want a game that offers an fun and thoughtful action you might want to check this out.","August 21, 2015","true","28.2"," 57 of 85 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","57","85","0","0"

It was a wierd turn of direction for Square, but damn was it an awesome direction to go towards. Just how Sega went a different direction with Sonic by making Shadow the Hedgehog have guns and violence, Square went a different direction with Type-0 with possibly one of the most brutal and jarring intro's to a Final Fantasy game we've seen to date. The radical departure might unease some die-hard fans, but for others it brought to light a different perspective in the Final Fantasy universe that we haven't seen.\n\nAnyways, let's talk about the Graphics.\n\nFF: Type - 0's HD remake has done a splendid job of remaking a PSP game into a solid PC game. As a person who generally had little faith in Square's ports (Having experienced FFXIII Being Awful, as well as FFXIII - 2) I was pretty sketchy coming into it, expecting some horribly botched port that wouldn't be worth the time of day. I was pleasantly surprised and can say that without a doubt, this is probably the best port Square's done to date for a Final Fantasy game.\n\nThe graphics have been overhauled, yet there are still remnants of it's PSP origin. Namely, some of the sprite and texture work can still be blotchy/sketchy in some areas. However, they've made an already impressively and beautiful Akademia on the PSP look even more awesome by HD'ing it. If you look at the scenery of some of the area's too, and all the pretty effects they added you can take a small moment to enjoy what they've done with the game. But let's face it, you don't care about that. You probably have one jarring question that is going to determine whether or not you buy this game.\n\nIs it 60 FPS?\nNo. It's not.\n\nWhy? It's because the game itself is dependant on things operating at that speed. Try going into skyrim and disabling your frame limiter and Vsync and watch the physics engine go willy nilly. You're asking for the same thing here by complaining that you want the game to be in 60 FPS.\n\nFor once in my life, I'm defending 30FPS. ......-Facepalm- But it's true. Despite me also believing it should be an industry standard, as a person who played this on the PSP and thought the game ran -extremely- well for a PSP game despite all the crap that was happening, the same feeling extends to the PC. There are times when I hardly notice the 30 FPS either to be honest. And let me give you a pro tip. If you feel the games too slow, they introduced a speed up button to the game that makes everything move at 1.5x speed, essentially making the game feel faster both frame wise and pace-wise.\n\nThe graphics options are actually pretty plentiful, if we're being biased towards Square. The jarring fail here though is their locked resolutions of either 1920x1080p or 1280 x 720. Personally, my PC can't handle the game at 1920x1080p with all of the settings, so I usually play in a windowed mode because it also lets me keep track of other tasks on my PC. You have the options of customizing shadows, motion blur effects (which are an awesome addition to make the game feel more cinematic and action-y <--- Legit word, I promise)\n\n\n\nNow let's talk about the Gameplay.\n\nType-0 is a radical departure from it's predacessors in that it's a hack and slash based game. With an impressive roster of FOURTEEN PLAYABLE CHARACTERS, EACH INCREDIBLY UNIQUE IN THEIR GAMEPLAY, you're guaranteed to find at least one member of class zero that suits your fancy. My personal favorite is Seven.\n\nBattles happen as thus: You have your typical overfield random battles, that throw you in a sandbox-like area where you duke it out with the enemy forces in real-time hack and slash based combat. When you defeat the enemy forces, there's a chance that you have the ability to "go another round" with the same enemies, only they'll be stronger. You can do this up to four times, and the enemies levels will increase, as well as the chance of them becoming enraged. (they don't flinch and deal stupid amounts of damage)\n\nCombat itself in the game is fast-paced and has a degree of skill to it. Essentially if you're locked onto a target a 'Kill Marker" will appear on an enemy if it's in a position that leaves it vulnerable. Striking an enemy while this "Kill Marker' is up let's you score a critical hit that usually will kill the creature in one hit.\n\nMissions are a bit different, as they usually have some relevance to the story and pit you in a location against enemy forces. These are replayable from the main menu and can be done as many times as you want, which is a cool function if you really liked a particular mission.\n\nWhen you're not in missions, you're at Akademia which is your home area. You're given a certain number of "Hours" that you can spend before your next missions starts. This is my only complain about the game, because you have to basically play through the game multiple times to experience all of Academia's scenes, as you simply won't have enough time to get through all of them. Missing events between missions can also prevent you from seeing that event in the future too, so be careful.\n\nEidolon's make a comback in this game in possibly their most epic form, as you can actually play as the Eidolons, or let them fight on their own. You do this by sacrificing one of 12 members of  Class zero during a mission. (12, because two aren't a part of it originally and are not under the same special circumstances as the rest of class zero) It's an epic feeling to rampage across the field as an Eidolon, and it's something I guarantee you'll fall in love with as well.\n\nWhen one of your classmates falls, you can replace them on the fly with other members of class zero if they go down. You can also additionally recieve backup from Akademia itself which lets you earn some points towards unlocking some nice gear.\n\nWhen I finally get around to beating it this time around and actually being able to understand the story, i'll give a story evaluation here as well, so for now this will have to do. I highly recommend picking it up, as it's a gem and deserved to be given a two-hour shot at least.\n\nI hope you enjoy it as much as I have so far~","August 21, 2015","true","13.6"," 52 of 79 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","52","79","0","0"

It feels like this game was not even tested at all before selling it here. If Square Enix can fix these major issues ASAP, that would be great and I definitely recommend this game, especially to Final Fantasy fans.\n\nJust like most players, here are issues I experienced:\n1) Frame rate dropped to 9fps!\nMy device is above the recommended spec yet this game's frame rate dropped as if I run 10 games at the same time! This is ridiculous! Cut-scenes stuttered horribly and I have not even started controlling my characters yet!\nThe 'temporary fix' would be having lower-res graphic settings by selecting 'Low-spec' at One-click Setup in Graphics section (or manually select your preferred lower-res settings). The low-spec setup that I set did help, but still, it was not completely smooth.  And of course, playing on low-res makes the game looks crappy.\n\n2) This game is not meant to play with keyboard\nThis game definitely needs requires game controller in order to play comfortably. This game does not detect my controller (Logitech Rumblepad 2) although x360ce detected it (Yes, I have put it in WIN folder and set my Input to 'Controller', mind you).\nI also stumbled upon an article and tried the suggested fixes (refer to: https://steamcommunity.com/app/340170/discussions/0/528398719790083423/ at x360ce issue section ) yet same thing, the game still fails to detect. This part could just be my controller being too old, though it works fine in other games.\nWhen I forced myself to play with keyboard, I was completely at lost.\n\nHonestly, I already smelled something fishy when this game is way cheaper than the PS4 and Xbox One version, yet I still believe in Square Enix and proceeded with the purchase.

Final Fantasy Type-0 HD is a HD port of the original Japanese exclusive PSP game. While the major characters and most of the areas are actually HD, there are still most aspects that are still PSP graphics. For example, pretty much every NPC will have a flat face and in-game model and some textured doorways or walls have ridicously large pixels.\nHOWEVER, aside from the small flaws in terms of graphics, the game itself runs fine. Definitely alot more optimized than Square Enix's other PC ported games. (There is still a 30 FPS cap though) The story of the game itself is very dark, but a bit repetitive and boring in the beginning, eventually it leads you to wonder "what's going to happen next?".\nThe gameplay is alright, it's very fun trying out 14 individual students of Class Zero and their individual abilities. Some of them are harder to use than others but overall, they're all satisfactory. The replay value of this game isn't that high though.\nFinal Rating: 7.5/10","April 14","true","6.0"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"

Granted, as a port of a PSP game, it doesn't run the smoothest, but if you can look past that, you've got yourself a good purchase here. The main theme of this game is life and death, something the game does a fantastic job of reminding you of constantly. Managing the 14 playable party members keeps you from going with the same party of 3 throughout the game (as I used the two new characters to Class Zero, Machina and Rem, the most. Spoiler alert, they aren't allowed to participate in the final mission.) The side quests are rather fun, you can get your own airship, breed chocobos, and even get ambushed on the world map by enemies you can visibly see that are level 99 and kill you instantly! Some parts of the game are indeed annoying, yes, but past those, it's a fun game. If you're a fan of Final Fantasy and the"mixed" rating is making you question buying the game, I implore you give it a try. Or at least wait for it to be on sale. Or you could watch somebody on youtube play the game instead of buying it yourself because I understand not everyone can afford to purchase games, but they still are interested in it.

Everything seemed tailored to my tastes and sensibilities. But the game kept annoying me with more and new things every 10 minutes. From the terrible lock on camera (you will most likely suffer whiplash when locking on to fast enemies as the camera follows the target TOO precisely), unresponsive controls with most of the characters, questionable design choices (forced deaths, acceptable quests that cannot be completed on new game, the entire RTS minigame, etc.), probably the worst cast across all of final fantasy including mainline and spin offs, non-plot with crazy stuff happening in last 30 minutes, the list just goes on.\n\nWith all that said, there are positive aspects. The combat is a good foundation on which I hope SE will build in the next type-XX game. Main theme of the game is breathtaking and is worthy of being in a Final Fantasy game. Final Boss is extremely climactic and marries video game narrative with the game mechanics.\n\nAll in all I would not recommend buying this, unless you are dead set on making your own opinion and/or game is on sale.\n\nJapanese voice track included, Square enix seems to know what they're doing in this regard, as they are providing it in every japanese game they release. Shame that Miyuki Sawashiro is wasted on an annoying character. At least Tomokazu Sugita is cool and reasonable.\n\n+659 bonus otaku points for voice actin, soundtrack and visual character design.","December 12, 2015","false","46.3"," 37 of 63 people (59%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","59","37","63","3","0"

Not a full remake. Don't expect it to be so beautiful that your eyes will burn of pleasure in front of a next gen ultra realistic game. The game still looks good and IS better than the psp version. Btw I don't really care about that, I'm more interested by the gameplay and the story.\n\nTalking about that, the gameplay kinda reminds me of Final Fantasy Crisis Core that was also on psp, and appears to have been made by the same producer. I like it, you can choose between the 14 characters and decide which gameplay suits you the best. (Rem & Deuce <3)\n\nThe story is as always in FF games really interesting and deep. It uses the same mythology as in the FF XIII serie (don't shout OMG, these were good games D: ), so you may need to check it out to fully understand the background of the story. But you'll need at least 2 walkthroughs and a few explanations to completely understand what really happened, especially at the end of the game (OMG suspens). You'll miss a lot of the story if you don't bother wandering around during your free time to speak to everyone in Academeia. Still, as the game progress, you want to know even more what will happen to our class Zero cadets and feel more and more concerned about them, that's how you end loving a game.\n\nJust to speak about the soundtrack (which is important), I love it. Especially the song "Zero" by BUMP OF CHICKEN that is amazing, check out the credit version of the song.\n\nSo YES, this game is good, I personally had no bugs with it, the remaster is well done even if it's not perfect for the spoiled children and the story is really good. Buy it and decide of the fate of Orience.\n\nNB : too easy achievements, almost frustrating x)","August 25, 2015","true","46.4"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

Why? You ask? Dark and twisted plot ever!  It's not about love anymore, it's about war and relationship amongs comrades! There is some romance indeed, but the whole game is soaked in sacrifice and heart-broken feelings. You should try to exploit all available endings.\n\nCharacters: There are 14 characters you can play, yet SE did a good job to distinguish personalities and characteristics between every single one of them. They are both at high school age but already strong in mind and body. You cannot forget one even you didn't tag along with him/her well in the game. Furthermore, with side quests and communication with NPCs throughout the game, you could find out more about their habbits, hobbies and more. This is a gold mine for mangaka or novelist!\n\nGameplay: the triple chars combat control it's not really impressive and new, yet they still bring entertainment throughout the game. Of course with total of 14 playable chars, you will have a hard time to choose which one is the best and try a lot of combination. Once you get familiar with the game, you will find it's not too hard and you will only play with favorite chars. Howerver, SE knew this and they require you take a good care of all of them, or at least 6 members to do some rotation in later part of the game. If you have played The Last Remnant, another good game of SE, you should be fine with all char development.\n\nTime is essential and it is a very important element in Type 0 HD. You have a very litmited time to do quests and travel around. Communicating with other NPCs and chars could gain some extra hours but it is not much. So choose wisely! (you will have chance to accomplish all once you finish and play New game +, do not worry much!)\n\nBesides RPG, the game includes RTS elements as well. You will command army and squad and do some strategic move to decide outcome of battles. Quite interesting!\n\nSad news for explorers: Type 0 HD's world  is not as big as other FF games. But it still contains some amusing hidden areas with treasures and surprises. And you still need chocobos to travel around!\n\nAh chocobos! Type 0 HD has a good chocobos breeding system that you can experience and produce some rare chocobos to support you in travelling and combating! And that's all! Not much but enough for this game.\n\nThe camera is sometime annoying with bad view angle and motion, but when you get to the speed and control, everything should be fine. I suggest you play with a controller, Xbox one should be good.\n\nGraphics: it's a HD version of PSP version years ago, not quite beautiful and stunning for current trends but it's overally good. Characters and weapons are well done with high texture details. Environment isn't as good as characters but you still WOW when first visit the Academy.  Skill effects and summoning cutscene are still SE style: awesome and epic.\n\nSound: not really a strong point of game, sometimes it is repeatitive and annoying.\n\nMusic: Epic theme and music that suitable for war backgroud of the game. And remember to stay tune until last second of credit after you finish the game, one of the best song of FF is there, with heart broken scene too T_T\n\nPros:\n- Dark and twisted story\n- Various playable characters with interesting characteristics\n- Trio character combat control brings some entertaining and strategic choice\n\nCons:\n- Combat is repeatitive\n- Trio character combat with NPCs is bad with poor AI and power.\n- Small world to explore\n\nRATE: 8.5/10","March 4","true","159.4"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

Not top of the line, but not low end either.\n\nFirst let me address the 30 fps.  I could understand the limit since it's a port.  Likely there's some timings tied with the frame rate (this has been done with some racing games and raising the FPS causes oddities).\n\nBut lets talk about the HD in the name.  I had the games AA set to high (because if I set it to Highest the frame rate drops to about 18).  Which AA it's using I'm unsure as it's not actually labeled but even with the second to highest AA available there's a lot of jagged edges.  So I forced AA through the nVidia control panel.  32x CSAA with 8X super sample and I got a solid 30fps.  Which means thier implementation of AA is terrible.   Second, the only thing that is actually HD is your characters, everything else looks like it's from a PS2.  There was very little effort put into making this port or making it HD.  Constantly things they "improved" just stand out and feel out of place with the untouched environment.\n\nThe load screens/transitions.  This ties into this being a lazy port.  While the load screens are super short since I'm playing on a PC and not the original device this was released on (PSP), the fact there's so many, so frequent shows no one bothered to try to stitch these things together better.\n\nI've only made it to chapter 2 so far, and game play/story wise I have to say it hasn't landed a hook yet.  There's been no compelling story or interesting characters so hopefully it gets better.  FF 7-10 by this point at least had your attention.  Even if the story/characters/etc. do get better, all that work was already done when it was first released.  Putting a fresh coat of paint on something doesn't entitle you to saying you built the thing.  And so far, it's a pretty shotty paint job.\n\nAt a $30 price point, I can't recommend this game.  This is a bargin bin game (since they didn't really put any work on it).  If you could find FINAL FANTASY TYPE-0 in a discount bin for the PSP and ran an emulator you'd get the same experience I feel.  It's another FF game riding the coattales of the FF name.  This may have been a spot on game back when it first released, however, to be re-release it now with putting no effort into it and call it "HD" is doing it no favors.  At best, this is a $10 game.\n\n\nEdit: Added in results from forcing AA through nVidia","August 20, 2015","false","1.6"," 24 of 40 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","24","40","0","1"

My review is going to be quite bias. So downvote me if you like I'm going to give my personal opinion and experience of this game.\n\nI pre-ordered this game for the Dota 2 chocobo courier, wallpaper and moogle ward. I absolutely like the game, the plot, battle dynamics, gameplay, and of course exceptionally well done soundtrack. I've waited 4 years for this game to be released in North America (it wasn't even suppose to leave Japan originally but it gained so much interest that they did bring it over. So there's my gratitude there).\n\nThis has got to be the darkest story plot of any Final Fantasy game, to the point where I started to get a 'Persona 3' feel near the ending. This game does offer multiple endings (3 different endings if I'm not mistaken, plus a hidden trailer for the upcoming game Type-1?).

It doesn't even need "Final Fantasy" attached on it, it has a great potential to be its own series. Again, i must repeat this is originally released for PSP, tl;dr : Amazing game, bad port.\n\nSo far, the most despicable thing in this game is the Control and the Camera which both sucks on the Keyboard. If you think you can finish this game with Keyboard, the best i can do is to wish you luck.\n\nGraphics, Texture, FPS Lock, blah blah blabbity blah, actually it doesn't even matter...People won't die just because playing a game that has 30FPS lock or a small drop into 29FPS, right?\n\nIt's easy to forgot all those crappy graphical and control aspect, especially when this game provides a lot more positive features that we overlook\n\n= Wide range selection of characters, 15 playable characters with each unique style.\n= Cool battle mechanism, a fast-paced hardcore action which would be way more awesome if it's supported by a better camera mechanism.\n= Better story than most other FF Games. No kidding.\n= Great soundtrack and BGM, it really defines the mood and ambience of the game.\n= It's still a part of Fabula Nova Crystallis Saga, the same as FF XIII and FF XV...Probably this is a small hint of FF XV's PC version?\n\nIt's not really a surprise since the PS4 version also has the same graphic and 30fps lock issue. It's originally ported from PSP to PS4 and then it went to PC--i never expect Square Enix would port Type-0 HD to PC, so this is really a huge surprise aaaand if this get a good review, just imagine how easy it would be for PC race master to get a PC Version of FF VII: Remake, FF XV and Kingdom Hearts III...So just shut your inner graphic♥♥♥♥♥ thoughts and you'll absolutely enjoy this game.\n\ntl;dr - gameplay is great. sound is awesome. graphics, fps, texture, camera, keyboard control sux but  doesn't matter...it's still a sold game that deserve a chance.","August 18, 2015","true","12.4"," 34 of 61 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","34","61","0","0"

All 14 characters are varied in combat and fun to play. The plot is meh until it absolutely falls apart at the last second (it's a JRPG tradition at this point).\n\nVerdict: If you're an FF fan you already own the game. For those on the fence it's a solid sale game.\n\nWARNING! DO NOT use anti-aliasing in the game. The method used by the game renders it in 4k then downgrades it to your resolution to get rid of the jagged lines. This is what kills your frame rate (why Square thought this was a good idea idk). Turn it off in the game start up UI and force anti-aliasing through your GPU.","March 24","true","18.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

However, if those are the only reasons you decide on passing this game up you a gravely mistaken. This game has an incredible story, backed with enjoyable combat and wonderful characters. Some of the missions feel a bit rushed and theirs a couple of story aspects they don't fully explain. But overall this game was an enjoyable experience.

Forget the FF title as much as you can, lower your expectations, and you might find yourself having a good time.\n\n\nLong Version:\n\nGameplay - Taking aside the port side of things (rigid controller settings, next to no support for anything outside xbox, yadda yadda) this game plays very nice, the combat is interesting and can be approached in a variety of gameplay styles, there are a lot of different missions/objectives and the newgame+ mechanic feels well integrated with new stuff to do each spin of the cycle.\n\nStory - Loosely based on the same universe as the XIII's entries, the story tries to take a more mature approach with a constant war setting and lots of convictions/lives and blood/deaths on the table. The plot is extremely convoluted and can only be understood after replaying the game 2/3 times while actively seeking side content and reading material in-game, most characters are underdeveloped and/or overlooked. All this makes for a very poor excuse of story that ends in only a semi-pleasent note.\n\nSound - The main theme is pretty powerful and the composer seems to know since it is used as melody throughout too much of the soundtrack. There are some decent tracks and most of them fit the setting but the overuse of the main melody screams half ♥♥♥♥♥ job. The japanese VA is, of course, extremely welcome as it fits like a glove.\n\nGraphics - The movie like scenes look very good and are a pleasure to watch. On other hand, the in-game cutscenes look terrible, with worse than soap opera "you talk, I talk" conversations and only a few select body movements for each character. As for the game itself, it looks decent, but there aren't a ton of different areas.","April 26","true","126.5"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","3"

I am on the final chapter so i will soon have it beat i have around 60% of the achievements i may or may not 100% it  I am about 23 hours in or so\n====================================================================================\nGameplay\nThe battle system is a mix between kngdom hearts and star ocean. You have your 4 button commands and single use item. Though just like star ocean you can open up your menu to use items in the middle of combat. Learn how the evade system works because you will be timing between dodging and attacking.\n\nThe game pretty much forces you to learn how to dodge certain enemies can kill you in one hit with a status known as killstreak.  You can inflict it on enemies as well with well timed menouvers.\n\nI don't hate it but i don't like it either. The targeting system is garbage have the time you will be fighting with it to target what you want it to. It works when it wants to basically and when it does work well you might so well in a fight. I don't bother with it half the time.\n\nThe one cool thing about this game is you can controll eidolons  unlike final fantasy 13 you can move then around. they each have there own moves and of course there signature moves like shiva for diamond dust ifrit hellfire  ect\n\nI do like the stradgy battles they have throwen in i will let you discover thoughs on your own though it was a nice change of pace.\n\n\n====================================================================================\n\nStory .... ....  .....  .... ... ... ... ...  plot ?  ..... .... ... .... ... .....   crystals are controlling you   ... .... ....  mother is strange ....  ... ...  war blah blah blah ... yea you heard it all before i dont need to go into detail.

It's not a brand new title and it wasn't originally designed for PC so don't expect cutting edge graphics.  It's a little laggy with AA turned all the way up but looks fine without it.  Not sure why people are saying it only plays windowed.  If you actually take the time to go through the settings in the launcher there's clearly a drop-down where you can select full screen or windowed.\n\nIf you're a fan of the series you'll probably like it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deathbomb1/recommended/340170/","deathbomb1","Dirk Dickbutt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deathbomb1/","388 products in account","Final Fantasy Type-0 is pretty cool, I guess.\n\nOriginally a PSP game exclusive to a mysterious island nation no one is actually sure exists, Type-0 is a spin off game part of a long lived video game franchise mainstream journalists pretend isn't as good as it actually is. Type-0 is part of the Fabula Nova Crystallis series of Final Fantasy games which includes Final Fantasy XIII and other games nobody actually cares for.\n\nLuckily, outside of a few shared concepts, Type-0 lacks anything to do with the XIII trilogy so don't expect Toriyama's waifu to show up anytime soon.\n\nYou play as everybody. I mean Class-0, an organization of highly gifted individuals who work as special operatives for both the school they attend and their nations government. As a departure from other Final Fantasy games, Type-0 is told as a gritty war drama rather than a grand adventure across a continent.\n\nThe Militesi Empire, one of the four crystal states and named after their obvious love for humanitarian affairs, invades their neighboring Dominion of Rubrum while also dispatching a special unit directly to Akademia, the magic academy and capitol Rubrum. With the use of a special type of magitek armor that allowed them to jam the Vermilion bird Crystal and, in turn, block the use of magic to the academy cadets and legionaries on the ground. Without their big crutch or the use of Eidolins, this games summons, the Legionaries and Cadets are quickly overwhelmed and pushed to the verge of defeat.\n\nThat is until Class-0 arrives, who seem to be unaffected by the magitek's crystal jammer. With the use of magic, the Class-0 cadets push through the Militesi lines and make several surgical strikes on enemy positions which not only disrupted Militesi air superiority, but also destroyed the crystal jammer and allowed the Rubrum defenders to push back the enemy attack.\n\nThat's some WW2 ♥♥♥♥ right there.\n\nThe setting is probably Type-0's strongest aspect, while the Final Fantasy series is no stranger to war, it was never actually represented as the focal point of a game outside of maybe Final Fantasy Tictacs. I do love me some final fantasy Tictacs.\n\nEvery theme from the series itself is reiterated to do with military or war. Ultima becomes a weapon of mass destruction rather than just a spell, summons are used as wrecking balls on battlefields, there are plans that do fire magic bombing runs, and even with all that they managed to fit in things like human super weapons and giant robots.\n\nCombat strays away from the usual FF formula, while random encounters are still a thing, every battle plays out in real time, and managing your parties health and mana works in conjunction with active dodging and finding openings for attacks. Timing your attacks at just the right time also counts towards a counter attack which lets you punch one clean chunk out of your enemies stomach. I mean, I'm no doctor or anything, but that doesn't seem possible, what with the bones, and cartilage, and organs.\n\nOh yeah, the characters.\n\nClass-0 consists of fourteen characters, and while Ace seems to be the series representative of the party, each member seems to be as important as the other. Every character has their own skills and specialties, some are better at magic while others are better at getting in close, and others still work at dwindling down enemy HP from afar. Every character has a unique play style, and while some are obviously superior to others, it's still a neat way to add variety to your game. Or you could always just stand back with Trey and fire a charged bow at your enemies like a total coward.\n\nBy the way, they're all named after trumps. The cards, not the president candidate guy with the goofy hair.\n\nI do have some gripes with the game, though. It was originally a PSP exclusive and it clearly shows, even with the updated HD graphics. And although 30 fps isn't a killer for me, I should probably point out that the game does not run at 60 fps and will sometimes dip with certain graphical settings on lower end hardware, it was no ways an actual deal breaker for me.\n\nThere's also a bit of a grind at certain points of the game, which makes sense considering what the original game was. And sometimes quest drops take so long to find you may as well just order them from Amazon.Rubrum and wait for them arrive a few weeks later. Some characters are also definitely more fleshed out and balanced than others on the battlefield, but the ones that aren't as good are still viable to use.\n\nBut should you play, Last Story: I can't actually make this joke because Last Story is an actual game now?\n\nYeh, I would say so, the game is constantly on sale if the full price isn't to your liking. There are also multiple endings for people who want to go back and give the game a few more runs, but in my opinion, the first ending is perfect for how the game is presented. Still, I have 30 some hours into the game and I'm probably going to go back to Orience sometime in the future.\n\nFinal Fantasy: Gritty War Story with teenagers gets 7 tragic battle scenes out of 10.\n\nNow how long until we get a gritty Chocobo dungeon war story?\n\n\nThe curator: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Dickbuttexperience#curation\n","January 27","true","31.2"," 13 of 22 people (59%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","59","13","22","9","3"

Otherwise I've had no problems with the game. Steady frame rate with no noticeable drops using highest AA (rendering at 4k), no issues with video or sound playback. I'm very happy they gave us the option to set AA levels, and especially to turn off motion blur and  DoF. being a port from a handheld I'm surprised at how good the game looks. Overall it's definitely a very nice port, I believe this is the most effort I've seen in porting a console JRPG to PC. I hesitated a few days before purchasing due to all the negative reviews... but Steam reviews of ports are beginning to be completely worthless. A port can take a lot of time and care and give a lot of good options, but some insist on complaining no matter how much they get because there's always something that could be better. That's life.

This game pretty much has to be played with a controller but to select start game with a controller is not as simple as moving the joystick. You have to use the RB or LB buttons to move the curser down. Not too big a deal once I figured it out.\nNo exit game button - There is no button in game to exit game to desktop. You can either hit escape or if you start in big picture mode press the logo and then select exit game. Thats what I do and the reason why I get annoyed with the launcher and having to use the mouse to selct start game (until I found out I can use the RB button)\n30 FPS lock\n\nOverall this is a very enjoyable game.

Styles however may appear fairly limited, though do expand for a wider range as you level up. An example of this with the character of Queen (Longsword/Fencer) can allow for teleporting setup potential, something akin to the character Nightcrawler in speed, though still bland overall.\n\nWhile I can recommend the game for play, I highly recommend waiting for further development if going for keyboard/mouse setup, with myself using a DS4 controller through the program InputMapper (Make it think it's a x360 controller)","August 25, 2015","true","11.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The number of playable characters gives you many options when taking on a new mission or when having trouble S ranking old missions. Missions can be replayed as well if you want to test new formations or just grind. This is not a remake but instead a remaster of a handheld; this becomes very noticable during cutscenes where you expect the usual over the top graphic treatment Square is known for but instead get the same handheld styled cutscenes. A good portion of cutscenes simply seem for lack of a better word slow and it takes you out of the experience to some extent. There are some decent cutscenes as well so it evens out somewhat. Side quests are present and give you some content to fool around with and the different difficulties and new game plus feature will definitely give hardcore fans something to do even after completing the game once. A pretty good game even with its faults.","August 26, 2015","true","99.6"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Combat is real-time and somewhat reminiscent of Parasite Eve or Kingdom Hearts.\n+/+ Game includes option for Japanese voice acting and English subtitles.\n+/+ Large amount of game content.  Lots of side quests, areas to explore, and people to talk to.  Type 0 is a 40+ hour base game with countless hours of additional content.\n+/+ Excellent soundtrack and solid sound effects.\n+/+ Overworld map, towns, and a game hub come together to create a world that feels alive and dynamic.\n+/+ PC version supports an exclusive speed boost and a screenshot mode.\n+/+ Three difficulties and new game +.\n\n+/- Graphics are PS2 quality, which I find charming and nostalgic.  Others might find the graphics bland and undetailed.  Check out some videos or screenshots for an idea.\n+/- Game requires some grinding on anything above the lowest difficulty.  If this is a problem, plan to play on easy.  That said, Type-0 is not an especially hard JRPG.\n\n-/- Game is locked at 30 FPS, limited resolution options (720/1080 only), and many non-HD (or original PSP) textures.\n-/- Many enemies, locations, towns, art assets, and environments are repeated throughout the game, which cases the mid-late game to feel more stale.\n-/- Keyboard and mouse controls are terrible.  Plan to play with a controller or not at all.\n\nVerdict: 7.5/10.  Type 0 is a solid action RPG.  The characters, setting, story, gameplay, and soundtrack are very good and mesh together well.  That doesn’t mean the game is without its problems, such as lack of keyboard/mouse controls and graphic options.  If you enjoy action JRPG’s and/or Final Fantasy, than it’s a no-brainer.  Otherwise, you should probably watch a video or two…","August 25, 2015","true","30.5"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

Its kinda upsetting that the Graphics of the game look like a Mid aged PS2 game but again It's like a upgraded PSP game; for this complaining "HD where?" Definition of HD is any video image considerably more than 480 hoizonral lines!! so even the most dumb looking things can be HD if there is enough pixels! you'd assume the PC nerds would have the most intelligence when it comes to that! But you know gotta complain about my vidya games!  For 30 FPS this game plays pretty smooth.\n\nSadly Square-enix again has limited the resolutions to 720p and 1080p hopefully this will be fixed, though i'm glad they added more graphical options they arent very optimized! so be warned. but even normal settings looks better than ps4 version.

What people seem to forget about the game is that it was originally an 2011 PSP game so keep that in mind when playing the game and enjoy it for what it is, an awesome handheld game with updated graphics, but hindered by the limitations of the original system.\n\nPROS:\nVersatile battle system with 14 characters that all play differently.\nGreat replay value with more content available each playthrough.\nLots of good content outside of the usual boring fetch quests you get in the beginning, like secret bosses, high level dungeons etc...\nThe main story plays like retelling of a historic war, pretty unique!\nLot's of cool references and Final Fantasy elements for long time fans.\nGlobe spanning war campaign where you feel like you are liberating areas from the other empire and taking key tactical positions.\n\nCONS:\nThe camera, while improved, can still get pretty wild. You can change it in the settings though.\nThe story goes off the deep end at the end of the game and it's hard to understand if you don't play the game multiple times.\nThe cutscenes you can trigger with NPC's at school are pretty heavy on the anime tropes and they have a pretty big tonal shift from the grim main story.\n\nAll in all, a relly good game.

First, you need to get over the overload of proper nouns that are completely new and don't make sense to you. Then you need to ignore that the camera is a fidgety little thing that gets hung up on the geometry and won't let you look at anything you need to look at. Then you need to get past that the characters are more or less tropey caricatures that aren't by any means deep or too real.\n\nBut underneath all that is a good plot that takes the realities of war on frankly, themes of death and the importance of rememberance, epic music, an actiony and competent battle system with 14 (fourteen!!) playable characters and plenty of side stuff to explore and flesh out the world. This is the first Final Fantasy game in years that I've been excited to play again and again to see more of the story and characters...as well as one of the only ones to leave me with an ending that made me FEEL things. (even if much of it doesn't make sense yet without the NG+ plot).\n\nYou're going to be confused, but if you're able to feel out a plot more than needing to understand every bit of it, this could be a game for you.","February 1","true","61.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Leveling up can be somewhat of a hassle when you're trying to keep everyone even (which is also annoying because only active participants gain XP while on missions).\n\nControls are good all things considered.  The game was designed with the PSP in mind and you can tell that they didn't half-♥♥♥ the port over to bigger and better systems.  Just something as simple as Confirm not being bound to a particular attack action.  It's amazing and I appreciate it.\n\nVisuals are mediocre overall.  The Main characters look fine but secondary actors and some textures were obviously not given an HD makeover.  It can be a bit distracting if not hilarious.\n\nThe UI is solid other than in a few places (I'd have liked to be able to swap between characters on the equip/ability screens).  Squaresoft usually does well in this department so good on them.\n\nStory and Themes are similar to FF Tactics.  The War is presented as dark and gritty.

I would suggest a controller over a keyboard for casual gamers. This game would probably work perfectly with a steam controller imo.\n\nYou get to control 3 simultaneous characters in combat somewhat. You actually can controll 1 at a time but can switch to the other characters with a push of a button. Keep in mind the characters that are not being controlled are running on autopilot. If 1 dies you get to choose from an array of other characters and call them into battle. There are 14 character in the game with different styles of fighting(from what i've seen...) there might be more.\n\nThe storyline is pretty solid and basically about territory wars and magic.\n\nNobuo Uematsu and some other guy are making the music. Need I say more.\n\nThe voice acting in this game is really good at some parts and others well...you'll see for you selves. They're lips, mouth movements and facial expressions never match what they're saying in both japanese and english so i don't get it :/ reminds me of dubbed jackie chan films lol.\n\nIf your a fan of ff games buy this game its still worth the 30 bucks, even better if its on sale. If your not a ff fan or an actoin rpg hack slash genre. I suggest stay away from this type of game. I'd give it a 7/10","December 31, 2015","true","20.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If I turned up the settings on it, the game started getting framey, so it doesn't appear to be very well optimized.  However, the game looked fine on the normal settings and was pretty smooth throughout.\n\nPROs\n+ Very fun combat.  It is an action RPG, with some timing involved where you can do large amounts of damage to enemies if hit at the right time.  This system was well implemented and was fun to play.\n+ Engaging story.  I liked the storyline in this game.  There were plenty of epic set pieces in the cutscenes and there was weight to what you were doing.\n+ Bad-a characters.  All playable characters kick some serious butt and are all fun to play (even the flute had its moments)\n+ Music was real good, especially a call back to one particular song :)\n\nCONs\n- Mission flow.  Each mission had these period of time in between where you roam around and do stuff, which got pretty annoying when I was just trying to finish the story.\n- Too many seemingly unwinnable battles.  Now this could be just me, but there were a lot of battles in this game where it felt like I was getting cheaply killed.  And most of the time, losing this battle had no impact on the mission, as I completed the mission after dieing anyways.  And this happened numerous times... I am not a big fan of the unwinnable fight mechanic.\n- The game was basically shoving new game + down my throat the entire time.  All of the trials, and a bunch of the tasks, were all way out of my level range.  So there were a lot of times when I would just skip to the mission day with several days left on the time remaining because I couldn't really do anything more.\n\nOverall this was a fun game to play through, although I don't see myself playing through it a second time even though the game gated like half the content to that.  I would say it is worth the playthrough though.","December 29, 2015","true","25.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The music was very nice as well.\n\nStory: This world is either the same was FFX13 (the one with the MC Lightning) or similar, because there are L'Cie with their focus like in that one. I thought that was cool. Also, the world has a heck of a problem (a curse, IMO), I would absolutely HATE to live in that world. I won't spoil it for anyone. The setting has been done before, a class of super students saving the world, but what I like was the cast. There's some pretty cool characters in that class.\n\nGraphics: I personally like it. More than good enough, and the cutscenes were pretty. There's room to nitpick here but honestly nothing stood out as BAD to me.\n\nGameplay (aside from combat mechanics): This is where some people will have bones to pick with the game. The monster spawns while travelling on the map are random. You can only save in certain places (somewhat annoying to me). You can only change your gear at the savepoints, what the heck?! Traveling at home base is a mild pain in the rear. Other than that, it was ok. Oh and I couldnt play it on my desktop because of some wierd regional setting?\n\nCombat Mechanics: This is kind of a mixed bag but overall I loved it. You can do summons but I haven't had to and I never felt like I needed them, They should have made parts of the game where you absolutely had to summon an Eidolon. Missed opportunity there. Now about magic: another missed opportunity, because magic is clunky and a bit wierd to use at times, I felt it was much easier to use the character's special skills. Now THOSE shine! wow each character is different and has their own style, I ended up loving almost all of the characters styles! I absolutely loved training up the team and then wrecking the enemies with character skills alone. The one SUPER AWESOME part about the combat mechanics is that you can move, run, dodge, and time your crit hits, and the enemy can do the same! Its SOOOOO much better than not being able to move your characters like in the other Final Fantasy games. Seeing enemies throw themselves to the ground just to dodge your attacks is just way more realistic and fun! I totally LOVED the combat in this game.\n\nOverall, Ioved the game, and totally reccomend it to Final Fantasy fans and RPG fans!","October 30, 2015","true","37.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hueprotein/recommended/340170/","hueprotein","ChodeKing","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hueprotein/","314 products in account","Final Fantasy Type-0 is a game I wish I could have enjoyed on my PS4.\n\nLet me begin by addressing some of my original issues with the game.\n\nThe camera, this thing was dreaded, spun incredibly fast and made combat a huge drag that gave you motion sickness so long as you were prone to it(which I certainly am). The combat, this stemmed from the camera as I just said, having a poorly designed camera made dealing with more than one enemy at a time a misery. That was really it though, between motion sickness and dealing with enemies for way longer than necessary it ruined my experience.\n\nMoving on though, has this game improved? Many of you seem to think it's horrific, that the game is near unplayable, that you need your mother and you need her now because only an adult can save you from this monstrosity that is Final Fantasy Type-0. It's so bad that I've gotten a girl pregnant even though I have a vasectomy. Just kidding, the improvements from those two issues are drastic.\n\nI've only messed around a solid 15 min or so just to quickly see if the issues I had from my PS4 copy were still present, they weren't. The camera wasn't moving insanely fast when trying to look around or target enemies and following that handling with a few different enemies at once wasn't a chore and in fact simple to manage which is how a good targetting system should be.\n\nNote: The camera isn't terrible in the PC release like people have claimed, while it's not the best I've ever played with, if you've even spent 5 minutes on PS4 or XB1 with it, this one begins to feel like the smoothest camera you've ever spun in your life.(The console was THAT bad. I'll say it's better than Devil May Cry camera angles to say the least rofl, which isn't saying much I'm sure most of you can agree xD.)\n\nMoving on to everybody yapping about the FPS lock, it's 30 FPS, is 30 FPS doing any game justice in modern times? No. Is it making the game unplayable? Also no. It has a stable 30 FPS, something real JRPG players are very familiar with coming from xbox 360 and ps3 JRPGs. If you look past 60 FPS you'll notice something, you'll notice that the game is running flawlessly with no frame drops below 30 and that it looks smooth because of that. My friends, it's no different on the PS4 or XB1 versions.\n\nGraphics... oh for the love of whatever god any of us believe in if you even do. Calm down, the game is a rescaled PSP game from 4 years ago. There will be some wonky textures and scaling issues present. It looks like a dated PS3 game and there's nothing wrong with that, don't set your standards of Type-0 to the height of the Empire State Building because Final Fantasy XIII looks like a modern next-gen game on PC. They're on two different engines this one on an engine designed to be compatible with mobile phone hardware, the other a poorly optimized engine that looks pretty but can't deliver. (Hence why 14 and 15 both aren't using Crystal Tools and using Luminous instead) The game is presentable and serves its purpose visually, that's fact not opinion.\n\nCharacters, every character is unique, 14 in total. Makes for the most diverse playable cast in any Final Fantasy thus far.\n\nLore, being part of the FNC series, Type-0 shares the same mythology as both 13 and 15. While neither of the games and their characters are related, there are a few references in Type-0 and rumored references in 15 to things we've heard of in 13. Majority of it not being anywhere even close to the same, but you get the idea.\n\nFinal Verdict?\n\nSquare did right by making me not need to take Dramamine in order to play their game, could they have made anything better? Probably, but let's be realistic here, it's not some kind of new game, this isn't the new FFVII where they're taking it and remaking it on Luminous Studio.\n\nFinal Fantasy Type-0 is an HD remaster of it's PSP predecessor that's also a fact, not an opinion.\n\nSo I recommend it to anybody like myself who wasn't able to experience it on PSP 4 or so years back.\n\nI give it an 8/10 for the PC version. (Would have been a 6/10 had camera issues not have been fixed.)","August 25, 2015","true","0.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FragileSnow/recommended/340170/","FragileSnow","sanic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FragileSnow/","65 products in account","Oh boy, where do I begin with this game?\n\nFirst of all, do note that this game is a  PSP PORT  and is  LOCKED  at 30 fps. Now if you can get over these facts and is a crazy/loyal fan towards the Final Fantasy series, then by all means, get this game! I highly recommend it to the aforementioned category of people!\n\nGraphics Let's start with the graphics because  everyone  is always so obssessed with it. Now, I'm gonna emphasize the fact that this game is a PSP port so do expect some things in the game -sometimes even cutscenes- to appear in low textures/quality because they ripped it straight out of the PSP version. Next is the FPS lock, now growing up, I've never gotten the chance to buy myself a powerful rig so my computers(including this one) is usually barely entry level to games or is exactly at the entry level so playing at constant 25fps-30fps is nothing new to me and if you're the same who has  adapted  to 30fps and below then this should NOT bother you. Unless of course, if the game is running at lesser than 20fps, then I think you have to change your settings abit. All in all though, graphics wise, if you're not one of those 'PC Masterrace' who always, always cry about graphics and have a decent rig, you will run this game smoothly.\n\nQuick Heads up:  Setting your anti-aliasing to High and Very High will set the game to run textures at 2k and 4k respectively, so please keep that in mind before you try to pump things up\n\nGameplay Now, being a player of the original PSP version of Final Fantasy Type-0, I can tell you that there are  HUGE  amounts of tweaks here and there which I will not mention because there are simply too many. FF Type-0 is one of the more fast paced Final Fantasy game. You do not wait for turns nor do you wait for an action gauge to fill up. You have complete control of your character to run around and fight with, which makes the game easy to play and get into but hard to master. Though one thing I can't stand is the fact that you can only have 2 abilities equipped for you to use in battle and 1 defensive ability. This of course, excludes the normal attack ability. So in total, you will only have 4 abilties at your disposal.\n\nStory To simplify things without spoiling anything, the game's protagonists are basically 14 chosen students who have the ability to "save" Orience. Pretty bad summary, but you'll know more once you get into the game. One thing I have to mention is that, they do not spoon feed you most of the story plots, characters, etc. You need to either have prior knowledge of these things (ex: What is and what can a L'Cie do) or you could simply read about them in the ingame codex.\n\nCharacters As mentioned earlier, there are 14 protagonists in this game, each with their own unique playstyle and personality. My personal favourites are Deuce, Ace and Queen. Anyway, all of them will play differently than the others. (ex: One is faster but hits not that hard while one is slower but hits a lot harder).\n","August 27, 2015","true","27.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Instead of how well they catered to their 3000$ gaming computer? Pepperidge farms remembers.\n\nFinal Fantasy type-0 is not only a great addition to the Final Fantasy universe, but a great addition to the Fabula Nova Crystallis. Giving us a different take on L'cie and the universe in which Final Fantasy 13 exists.\n\nIt's an action RPG, unlike traditional final fantasies, It's bttle system is a great alternative to the active time battle, or turn based variety. I could honestly see myself playing every other final fantasy using this battle system. The closest thing in any other final fantasy would probably be final fantasy 12, but with no gambits. you're free to move around, and dodge every hit, block and heal and attack at any given moment. An interesting extra feature is a real time strategy/tower defense combination type of gameplay.

(L`cie, Fal`cie, C`ieth? etc etc etc.) But at the end is o-k. Though i still hate Machina because he keeps vanishing for ♥♥♥♥ and the show just goes on..... Also beware that Rem / Machina are strong but also sometimes not aviable in the game for Story reason so yeah, don`t pump too much time into leveling / upgrading those too. I got burned by the end for maining Rem a bit, and Machina is far worse since he is almost 1/3 of the game gone, especially at the end!\n\nAll in all: buy if you look for a semi-good to good FF game and have good Hardware to enjoy it in Maximum Quality.","August 27, 2015","true","26.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Previous Final Fantasy version make me get bored of the battle because of turn based.\n- Story: Dark and a haunting ending.\n- Graphics: I don't really care about other character, so the improved texture on class zero and some other main characters is enough. This is only a port game from PSP, I don't expect much with this price.\n\nCons:\n- Hard to control. Really hard. I think Square Enix should've given players the ability to customize and bind key. That way I think most of us don't have controller but still can play the game easily with our habit of playing other games.\n- No co-op feature. This feature really interesting in the PSP version. I greatly enjoyed it. But they take the feature out of this port, that's a huge dissapointment for me.\nI think the camera is fine, maybe because I've got used to the camera of the PSP version.\n\nFor me, the big flaw of this game is the control thingy.

It's got some of the most graphic scenes in a Final Fantasy game since the final scene of Crisis Core and it's rather gritty representation of war as you watch soldiers and children alike get blown up, set ablaze and just battered and beaten in just the opening scene. The war story of the game is great as it's just dark and repeatedly hits you with shock moments from weapons of mass destruction and a variety of magic that decimate humanity.\nNone of this is down to any of the characters though, every character is about as flat as its non-HD characters. The 14 playable characters you're given at the start of the game have little to no depth to them, which seems apt as they're in Class Zero, zero character that is. This isn't helped by the game's attempts to not actually focus on any character interaction until the final third of the game where at that point you've just stopped caring.\nIt suffers in the final moments where it brings up the Fabula Nova Crystalis meta-lore (the stuff that started in FFXIII) out of nowhere and it leads to the final sections making no sense, but instead of a focus or explanation on the story, the game focuses on the characters and it makes no freaking sense. The closing scene could have been AMAZING, it was good and impactful, but I don't care for these kids, they're a collection of tropes.\nThe combat is alright in that sort of action style, the camera is a large issue as when things start moving fast you can barely keep track of where you are let alone what you're looking at. There are bizzare RTS sections that don't really work and while there are sections of the game that look SO pretty, SO attractive, at the same time only the playable characters got a nice HD treatment, so everyone else has about three polygons for a finger and large pixels of a texture, it was a PSP game afterall.\nOverall, it's alright, two halves of different games and apparently there's a whole load more story on the second playthrough, but I'm not invested enough to really bother.\nMORE HERE[mozillogames.tumblr.com]","May 20","true","32.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Although it kinda fks you up in a sense that there will be overpowered bosses that you can't kill on your first face off, so you HAVE TO DIE. But you can kill it if you play the missino again on higher level. Apart from the plot, Type-0 is basically about farming. Just grind till you die, not literally of course. It's best to keep all, ALL your class zero cadets' level "up-to-date". Why? Because this game can be a ♥♥♥♥♥ that it'll sometimes (spoiler) kill your current character.

By old i mean the ones with ATB (Attack time bar) where we could pause and decide what type of attack to hit the enemy without having to rush with a risk of getting hit by other enemies that you didnt see. I have been avoiding this game because of the mixed reviews, but somehow i got myself this game. Maybe because i was bored, BUT i didnt regret buying this.\n\nYes this might be the "darkest" FF visuals that i have seen so far ( with the bloods etc) but this has its own charm too.\nThe battle is fun and challenging, the phantoma harvesting is kinda cool, also i kinda like the aura it gives off like FF VIII (SeeDs students, instructor, balamb garden, sorcery...)  maybe a mix of FF X too, (this is personal opinion) the demonion and milites mask and clothes kinda reminds me of it.\n\n\nAlso, you have to becareful not to let any members die, because the game isnt forgiving enough to let you revive / phoenix down-them lol. They will only be availabe to fight again once you cleared the mission at hand. So plan wisely with the magic and equipments too, you wont be able to switch as you like during mission.... Unless you find a save zone.\n\nThe thing that i dont like is, yor active leader died when you summon an Eidolon ( Guardian Force) so you have to bring Rem with her Undying Wish to grant re-raise.\n\nThis might not be the best FF series but hey its fun. Im playing this using iMac, the game kinda lags if you didnt put on LOW RES.\n\nBuy it if you have time.... And have no game to play on your list.","May 11","true","123.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","4"

It has a lot of playable character with each of them having individual playstyles which i really like. It features a dynamic battle system which is not as stiff as old ones and is pretty similar to Crisis Core(come on guys, turn based battles are good for PSX but not in 2015...that would look so stupid)\nThe story is a bit simple and filled with clichées but you have to consider that originally it was a PSP game, so don't expect too much there.\nThe port is not too bad either as you can simply adjust the screen size and turn the window into full mode.\nThe difficulty of the game can be set individually as well.\n\nAll in all a good and refreshing interpretation of Final Fantasy elements","September 4, 2015","true","89.2"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

I mean, more HD quality, Speed Mode, Photo Mode, new direct access to commands, customize the camera, a proper launcher, etc. I think now they have worked but they still have to learnt. Like Keyboard/Mouse controles, they are bad, really use a controller.\n\nAlso I had no problem since the launch with the game and it keeps very well the 30 fps (yeah locked, but is not that bad for me). And the only thing is I'm not playing in 4K (The Anti-aliasing on Highest setting, very bad explained).\n\nAbout the game, is a port from a PSP game, expect that. There are some textures really bad for the environment and you can't compare it with the others in details. But actually I think the gameplay is pretty interesting, I'm glad it has arrived to PC. Action combat, multiple characters and they are actually very different to play, world to explore, quest, a lot of lore, chocobos, magic, etc. as you expect from a Final Fantasy.\n\nIf you can't stand is psp game, if you think 30 fps is terrible, if you think is a bad port well we knew how it would be (I was expecting a worse port), forget about it. If you like Final Fantasy and want to play a great game, sure not the best in the series but pretty interesting, buy it. (Okey, I also just wanted that Square Enix release FFXV on PC too, but this game is better than I expected)\n\nFor the others reviews, I just think they are people who didn't expect what I said and that there is too much hate nowdays on the internet. Just see that reviews on the front page are actually good and compare what I said with the bad ones.","August 22, 2015","true","39.9"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","11","21","0","0"

Also the characters show no personality because the story takes no time to focus on any of them.  When I unlocked the "what if" scenario at the end and it showed them as normal students I actually found myself liking them as opposed to the blank slates they are generally presented as throughout the game.  At first I thought having each character from the get-go was a welcome change of pace for JRPGs but I quickly discovered that part of the character building in JRPGs comes from having them gradually join you in addition to having interactions with the rest of the characters.  So although I enjoyed the gameplay, I cannot recommend this game from a story perspective.  I find the best games balance the two out but it comes down to personal preference.

But besides this point, the story is amazing, there is two endings One good and one bad, but still its pretty damn good.\n\nNow, if I had to give a score to this game I would give it a 8/10, it's not a perfect game because of the keyboard issues, and there is some issues in the game where my characters would just randomly die, however this is quickly overlooked since you have 12 members(I could just have missed the Q's that said "Hey you are gonna die") My computer is just under the min recommendations for this game and I still had a extremely solid and great looking graphics experience just makes you quickly forget about the 30 fps cap everyone QQ's about.","August 30, 2015","true","29.3"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Each of the students seem to have a distinct fighting style with their own unique weapons. However, casting magic spells is generally the same for each student. On that note, they 'do' have character unique spell-like abilities which give the game added flavor.\n\nThe HD graphics are definitely noticable in the student's character models, but otherwise the graphics look rather mundane. Not terrible though. Keep in mind that you will spend most of your time interacting and controlling these main characters so most of what you see is very crisp and detailed character models.\n\nThe artwork in general fits the story setting very well and I find that the game itself most closely resembles FFVIII when compared to other FF games (ie: highschool age students thrust into a war due to their unique abilities).\n\nI haven't beaten the game yet so I might write another review upon completion.\nCheers!\n\n\n\n","October 7, 2015","true","74.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I've experienced very few issues with the game. Despite the -ugh- 30fps lock, the game actually runs surprisingly smoothly. The camera is a bit janky, but the fast and fluid combat system is fun and engaging, to where it overshadows many issues. I run a mid range computer on Windows 10, that I built myself from the ground up 3 years ago. No stutter, and no fps drops. Your experience may be different from mine, but as long as you have a gamepad and a decent computer that matches the system requirements, you should be fine.\nA few complaints:\nThe story starts out extremely slow and makes little sense. The narrative jumps all over the place and it's very confusing. There is very little character development. All your characters are largely uninteresting and don't really offer anything special in the battlefield, so you'll be hard pressed to pick a few that you like the most and stick with them throughout the game, even though the game tells you to do otherwise. The graphics are reaaaaally dated, even though you're playing in 1080p. Textures and models are all blocky and very underdetailed. Although, I'm willing to excuse that because this WAS a PSP game. I'm happy I get to play this game at all, considering it was originally supposed to be a Japan-only game. But it was definitely worth it for me.

Thus, familiar terms from the series are used in this game. But if you're worried if it seems foreign, talking to NPCs can give you a hint of the terminologies ingame, it helps!\n- Some would be wondering by the gameplay, that it's not TBS as your norm Final Fantasy system but instead it's actually a quite fast paced ARPG battle system.\n- THIS GAME IS GEARED FOR NEW GAME+. Some of the story contents are locked only after you finish you first playthrough.\n\nBrief review:\n+ Quite dark story surrounding the world they live in, add that to an academy of students whose purpose are to be soldiers (for the main class you're playing as, they get it worse)\n+ Fast paced battle system and vast amount of versatility in roster\n+ Quite alot of achievements to be obtained (not from Steam but ingame)\n+ Better camera and motion blur options than the PS4 version.\n+ You get to play with Square Enix staff.\n\n- Getting some of the achievement rewards can be boring or tiring (whether doing it naturally or grinding them)\n- While it has better camera, you do feel like your main boss is the camera sometimes.\n- That one character.\n\nPerformance Report:\n\n- Port wise, it's an upper touchup than the PS4 HD port from the PSP. Not a large port upgrade as normal people would expect (such as uncapped fps/superior textures/proper graphic settings), but more towards bringing the game to another market to be available without using emulators.\n- I truly have no issue with the game, since I did not increase the quality of my AA (using 1080p monitor), so it didn't tax my system to make it dip in performance.\n- AA settings is actually an upscale, up to 4k. That alone would affect your overall performance.","August 24, 2015","true","30.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This game is very fun, and I can recommend it to anyone who loves real time combat action that is fluid with the gameplay, and to anyone who loves a good story. This game is darker than the other FF titles, so be ready for that. I believe people were disappointed in the game for it having low visual quality in some areas, ie lesser NPCs and many textures. The game may lag hard if you have anti aliasing on highest, even on high end systems. The frame rate also caps at 30, and if you can't handle that.. well.. then this isn't for you I guess. I barely even notice the low frames, and the game is beautiful in many parts. I love how you can play as 12 different characters and can switch between them in combat, not to mention that every character is worth playing as and can be very fun.

I played all the other Final Fantasy's and love them.  I even played 13, which I enjoyed for the cinamatics and story mostly, the gameplay I thought was lackluster.  Final Fantasy Type-0 takes what 13 tried to do and it does a splendid job of delivering that.  I am only about 10 hours into the game right now, but the combat is very rewarding but takes awhile to get used to.  Oddly this game reminds me of a cross between Final Fantasy 8  (story wise) and Final Fantast 13 (gameplay, just drastically improved upon)\n\nPros:\n-Fun\n-New mechanic - action based gameplay (you control 1 hero while 2 others do battle alongside you)\n-Engaging story - Feel like you are part of the world and guiding these poor souls through their own story\n-Fast paced combat (compared to other FF games, you can end battles almost as soon as you start them)\n-Over world map\n\nCons:\n-controls get a bit wonky when you lock onto an enemy and they die.\n-Sometimes felt like I missed something cause a character will mention somehting that I have no idea what or where it is.\n-HD upgrade is a joke, the character rendering is laughable at times.\n-Save often unlike other FF games where you can save almost anywhere, here you can only save at set areas.","August 22, 2015","true","20.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Thanks to some fans, there has been a fan-translated ISO of it floating around for a while now. Earlier this year, the game was released in NA for PS4 with updated textures, resolution and improved framerate. Now, none of these are perfect due to it originally being a PSP game (Look at Metal Gear Solid: Peacewalker HD), but it does look better than the PSP. Especially when you stretched a 480p game to 1080p in the ISO. Sadly, some less important areas and non-main characters or main NPCs have low textures still, giving it early PS2 graphic quality, but it's fine for it being a PSP port.\n\nGameplay wise, it feels a bit clunky at first, but once you get the hang of it it becomes very fast paced and enjoyable.  Plus they finally added the second control stick to be camera moving away from the awkward camera controls on the PSP. The world may feel a bit small or cramped due to the mission based gameplay, but if you ever played MGS Peacewalker, it feels the same way as the missions for that. You bring 3 of the 13 classes to battle with each one representing a Job from Final Fantasy games (though with many liberties taken) each using a unique weapon. You upgrade their stats and what abilities they have in the hub world, the Military Academy.\n\nStory wise the game is top notch. The opening cinematic to the game is pretty dark for a Final Fantasy game, but war isn't pretty. You get a combination of teen angst, Final Fantasy VI-ish story and a bit of XIV's Garleans vibe with this game. And turn on Japanese audio unless you want to hear Christina Vee throughout the whole game.\n\nIf you are a Final Fantasy Fan, I'd say this is a must have, especially if you don't want to buy a Bloodborne Machine (PS4) just for this game. If you enjoy PSP games like Peacewalker or Monster Hunter, this is a must have for you as well.  If you are not too big on games in this style, this game isn't going to make you change your mind about them.\n\nOverall Score: 8.5/10\nIt's a wonderful game, has some very minor kinks, and the graphics are PS2 graphics, but it's wonderful for a PSP port.  I recommend using a controller for this game.\n","August 18, 2015","true","0.5"," 9 of 18 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","9","18","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/excruciate/recommended/340170/","excruciate","Excruciate","http://steamcommunity.com/id/excruciate/","717 products in account","I have an extra 30 hours or so in this game from playing it before I bought it during the holliday sale on steam recently at 50% off. So far this is much better than Square's previous three FF games. FFXIII, XIII-2, and Lightning Returns. They all suffered from poor performance on pc from stutters and slowdown. Especially Lightning Returns which runs horribly. Performance aside, those three games just are not good examples of what Final Fantasy has been about over the years. Most true FF fans dislike them for good reason, although they are decent games in their own right. This game may be locked at 30fps but it still runs solid. Normally I am strongly against games that are fps locked at 30 on pc. In some cases it is downright god awful and near unplayable at 30fps (see: The Evil Within), but there are a few exceptions. With this type of game it doesn't matter because it isn't a action game where fluidity matters. This game has action combat but it is controlled through a lock-on system. It was ported from PSP so the 30 fps lock was unavoidable anyway.\n\nI can say that I enjoy the gameplay in this much more than 13, 13-2, and Lightning returns all combined. I really dont like the combat or the move switching system very much in Lightning Returns. This game has that all beat by a mile. You can control 3 different characters at any time by switching with d-pad left or right (I use a xbox 360 controller which works great). Each character has four moves they can use during battle with X(attack), Y(special), A(defense/cure), and B(dodge), and you can customize their action loadout with different skills and spells. RB locks on and you can switch targets with RS left/right. It all works pretty easily and combat has a good flow to it. It is not confusing at all like Lightning Returns was, and you don't encounter unbeatable/nearly unbeatable enemies in the first area like in that game either. Most importantly though, you never feel rushed with a 13 day time limit like you were in Lightning Returns. I know I keep comparing it to that game when they are completely different feeling games but I can't help it because I really dislike the way they went with that game. Basically this game is just much better overall in terms of both gameplay and design and is much more true to the Final Fantasy name than 13, 13-2, and LR are.\n\nThe mission structure, rpg upgrade system, story advancement, character customization, music, sound, and overall game design meet the standard that was set by the last great FF game, FF12, one of the best ever. We probably will never see FF12 ported to pc, but this game is a decent example of what real FF tradition is.\n\n7.5/10","December 23, 2015","true","11.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I'll save the technical details for the end. I have already played through Type-0 entirely on the PS4, and I'm currently playing this version. It's not a normal Final Fantasy game. It's darker and more mature (hence the 'M' rating), but at the core there is still plenty of Final Fantasy to be had here.\n\nIt's action-oriented, but I find the combat to be very satisfying. The story, although a bit hard to follow at times, ends up being quite memorable & touching, especially if you play it through twice to unlock the full ending. The music is great, which is to be expected from a Final Fantasy game.\n\nSwapping between characters on the fly, each with a very different playstyle, makes for some engaging and varied combat. You've got to learn the strengths and weaknesses of your team to fully utilize them. It takes getting used to, but by the end of your first playthrough you'll have the hang of it, and you'll likely want to go through the New Game + mode with your new skills. As such, it's highly replayable.\n\nPlay it with a controller. Let me just get that out of the way. The keyboard and mouse controls are quite difficult. You may also want to turn off the motion blur and set the camera speed to slow, especially if motion sickness is an issue for you.  Also, if you have a g-sync monitor, you need to disable g-sync for this game. It will make the cutscenes choppy.\n\nOther than that, it runs as expected at a very smooth frame rate. It is a better port than XIII or XIII-2. Unfortunately, the highest resolution is currently 1080p. I fully expect a patch to be released to allow for higher resolutions, but just be aware that currently this is as high as you can go.\n\nI know a lot of people will have gripes about the 30 FPS lock. Those people would do well to remember that this is a PSP port, and it's not a matter of simply clicking a button and allowing 60 FPS. The game's underlying systems and animations were designed for a mobile device. Yes, all new games ought to have 60+ FPS, but it's unrealistic to expect them to entirely remake this game to allow for that.\n\nBottom line: If you can't play a 30 FPS game in 1080p or lower and enjoy it, skip this game. If you are a fan of the Final Fantasy series, check this one out and support Square Enix so they continue to give us more games on PC. It's unique and refreshing; yet it still has chocobos, moogles, flyable air ships, and a world map like the Final Fantasy games you love. New to the Final Fantasy series? If you like combining action with strategy, check it out!","August 18, 2015","true","9.7"," 26 of 52 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","26","52","0","0"

Possibly around 30 fps. Because I've been playing 60 fps games for a while, this change is so noticeable and somehow different on my eyes, somehow strains my eyes on extended gameplay hours/minutes. Anyway, this doesn't stop me from playing this wonderful game! Really dark setting, nice gameplay and story, somehow nice graphics. I was expecting this to be a complete remake on HD but I guess that would be too much for a game that's already been released on the PSP around 4 years ago. Anyway, the improvement from the PSP version isn't that much since the PSP game already offers what Type-0 could offer on any systems it will be released on. Except the updated graphics and added features in this HD release. Well, that's for me at least. Anyway, I'm still thankful for Square Enix for releasing this for western audience as well as being a PC port, They really did well this time! Cheers to SE!\n\nPros:\nUpdated HD Graphics for Main Characters and Some Environment\nNice Story, Dark theme\nSomehow tricky gameplay when played first on the PSP version, but is customizable and is nice.\nNice voice acting, specially if you like Japanese voice <3\n\nCons:\nLow framerate, seems to be capped at 30 fps. Hope some fix for this in future updates...\nMotion blur doesn't look to good to me... Made me dizzy on my first 10 minutes of gameplay...\nNo Vibration on Controller\nThe pre-rendered cutscenes look like the PSP version that has been upscaled a bit...\nSome characters textures not looking HD enough. Specially those dress that look muddy or pixelated. Some environment textures also look pixelated, such as floor textures, some low polygons on environment edges, noticeeable on field area between land and water.\n\nGonna update this review sometime soon, Currently playiing on these PC specs with no graphical or technical problems so far, except for that 30 fps cap....\n\nMicrosoft Windows 10 Pro\nIntel Core i5-4690k @ 3.5GHz\nXFX Radeon R9 290X Double Dissipation 4GB GDDR5\n4GB+4GB Dual Channel 1600MHz RAM\n2+4TB Seagate HDD\nDualShock 4 with DS4Windows for Gamepad\n\n1080p Fullscreen\nHigh Spec Graphic Settings\nMotion Blur turned off (Since I get dizzy most of the time with that even on Weak)\n\nOverall, Like this game so much~ Thank you Square Enix~","August 18, 2015","true","7.2"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

After all, there are plenty really good psp games on steam (legend of heroes/ys for example) and talk abou t the game itself.\nYou know, despite what everyone is saying I really liked the gameplay. Yeah, world map pretty empty and ai could be better, but overall it quite fun. SE just took crisis core combat and upgraded it, and they have also added some missions and a lot of pleasant features and secrets. There are a lot of hidden stuff, bosses, mini games and stuff, also, missions there self are pretty challenging. Gameplay wise this game fantastic! The problem is in the stuff that happening BETWEEN missions.\n\nRight after the moment a started playing there is one annoying questing start to bother me: Is this a Final Fantasy or Call of Duty??? I mean really, ff was always about guys, who fight there personal demons and save the world along the way. As naive as that sounds, it always was an emotional and compelling experience. I always liked Sakaguchi's naive simpleness, and the way he handles eternal questions. In this game, however, main characters are just puppets of some kind of overly complex experiment. And so they are fighting in the war because their government told them to do so! Compelling? As hell.\nThe next thing that putted me off is the way the story is served to you. Millions of overly lengthy cutscenes! Tons of stupid and badly voiced dialogs! In the end I just skipped all cutscenes with crying "stop babbling and let me just get to the action!" And that isn't the reason because you should play jrpg! Hack and slash games, sure, but not RPGs!\nAnd finally what kills me about this game it is the fact that it want you to experience emotional feelings that it didn't deserve! Who is this guy in the early beginning? Why we should care about him? Why we shall care about any of characters in this game since almost nobody of them has a personality? That's quite a riddle to me.\nSo, overall, keep that in mind if you will want play this game.","November 23, 2015","false","16.9"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","7","15","0","0"

Sure it was kind of rushed out, but keep reading.\n\nThe Pros:  Runs stable\nAction packed combat system\nAn entire cast of 14 characters to play\nEvery character feels very unique, they all have their very own style of play\nGreat story\nAn overworld similiar to those of older Final Fantasy titles\nDifferent types of missions that spice the gameplay up a bit\nLots of unlockable lore tidbits in the Crystarium\nA pretty fair ranking system for missions\nAny Mission can be replayed from the main menu to get a better rank if you wish\nGood challenge later into the game\nThe Cons: Bad controls for keyboard and mouse, i would even say unplayable. You NEED a gamepad, and a XBOX 360 one at that, since it doesn't support others. However you can use JoyToKey with other gamepads, ands it works fine, but remember to turn on the NumLock so your camera works with the stick you bind it to. Also turn on all axis in JoyToKey.\nExtremely muddy and low-res textures on most characters that aren't your protagonists or someone important to the story\nNot too many graphics options\nOptimization isn't perfect\nThe camera can be a little bit obnoxious at times\nThere are battles that you have to lose, at least in your first playthrough. (But said boss battles have a much higher lvl boss than your level is, so you will most likely notice which ones you are allowed to lose)\nI want to note that i am playing this game on a PC with a normal GTX750 (not the titan version) with 6 x 3.5GHz and 8 GB RAM. The game runs smooth and stable without any FPS drops for me - that is if i have anti-aliasing set to [Off]. With AA, my framerate drops down to about 15. I guess this is a issue on my end though, since my specs aren't exactly high-end. You can definately play this game without problems if you can live without AA.\n\nThat said, this game is one of my favorite games ever, although it's not a perfect game, and much less a perfect port. For a "HD" re-release, there isn't that much HD at all in this game - the main characters, Class 0, look good, but almost everyone else has low-resolution textures, as do most buildings, cars, NPCs, etc.\n\nBut don't turn your head and think this game is bad. If you can look past the bad textures and limited graphics options, and are interested in great stories and big plot twist a la earlier Final Fantasy games, then with this game, you will find a true gem in the Final Fantasy line of games. Even more so if you like fast, action-rich combat involving timed attacks and dodges, mechanics unique to certain characters and like strategy - because there are strategic recapture missions in this game, somewhat like Advance Wars. They are fun, at least for me, and change the pace from a fast action RPG combat to a more strategic RTS approach.\n\nThis game also has tons of replay value. Every mission has a "Crimson Codex" mission that you can only enter from the second playthrough onwards. This will unlock you cutscenes and other unlockables in the Rubricum.\n\nDon't turn this game down just because of the mixed reviews - this IS a port of a PSP game, after all, and sorry to say it shows, but that doesn't make this a bad game. You should give it a go if you like games such as Kingdom Hearts or the Tales Of-Series.","August 19, 2015","true","97.0"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

This is the worst FF i've played. Don't get me wrong, the game has some good points, like the fact that you have 14 characters with different styles, and music and voice acting (japanese dub) are really good, but those are really the only good points.\n\nThe story is boring and fails to make me really want to know what will happen next. The characters are all 1 dimension (an optimistic one, an intelectual one, a clumsy one, etc...) with almost 0 development, which doesn't help with creating a bound between the player and the characters. The ending is nice but looses much impact due to the fact that there's a lack of bounding with the characters.\n\nThe grinding is just a pain. I usually don't find grind all that bad, hell one of my favourite game is Monster Hunter which is a grind fest, but here is just a pain to kill the same enemy hundreds of times to level up 14 characters. They should made the game so that all characters get exp when you kill a monster.\n\nStill if you are a big fan of FF like me, buy it, but if you don't really care about playing all FF and can live with only playing the main series ones, just skip this one.","December 5, 2015","false","31.2"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

It's no surprise there since its a port from the one and only SquareEnix (in case you don't already know, infamous for their HORRIBLE PC port). Fortunately, there's the option to use the controller so I'd definitely recommend using a controller to play the game. If you're looking for a game with a good story regarding wars with a gameplay similar to Final Fantasy VII: Crisis Core, you'll definitely enjoy this game. I've already put in more than 5 hours of game time and even though its a sh*tty port, I still enjoyed it. The game is meant to be a grindy, long game and it has tons and tons of content with bunch of insights on the history of the world of FF13.\n\nGameplay is unique and its a very fresh concept for a Final Fantasy game. Like I had said, the combat is sorta like a mix FF7: Crisis Core except it's more fast paced and rewards finesse gameplay. There's definitely a lot of room for character skills customization till the point where its almost overwheming (Because of the insane numbers of playable characters).\nOne of my favourite part of the game was being able to play as Eidolons, like ODIN. (OPOPOP)\n\nOf course, regardless of the PC port, the voice acting is.... not good, gave me goosebumps alldayevrrydey. I haven't tried this yet but I think it'll be a better experience to just turn on the subtitles and switch the voice audio from English to Japanese. Also you'll need to take the initiative to read up on the in-game codex regarding the war and world and stuff or you probably won't be able to understand what is going on.\n\nOh yea, there's also a problem with my audio where there's weird popping sound during the first few scenes. Other than that it sounds normal (maybe it's just my headphones idk). And the music is AMAZING as always, exactly what I'd expect from a final fantasy game.\n\nWelp, if you still can't decide where or not to get the game, just try it for an hour and if you don't like it, just get a refund. I think the game is worth getting it (not to mention free doto items) even though sometimes it could feel like a very lazy port from the awesome PSP version of the game.","August 18, 2015","true","13.5"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

Namun quest dan rasa petualangan di dalamnya terasa terlalu monoton, ini karena daripada menjelajah dunia, FF Type-0 lebih fokus ke Akademeia sebagai markas di mana hampir semua event & quest ada. Kita cuma pergi keluar cuma untuk misi atau menjalankan quest.\n\nGrafis (6/10)\nMeskipun disebut HD, FF Type-0 nyaris sama dengan versi original PSP selain resolusi yg lebih tinggi. Bahkan beberapa cutscene terasa begitu "pecah" seperti diambil langsung dari PSP. Ini memang lebih bisa disebut port / remaster daripada remake.\n\nCerita (10/10)\nCerita FF Type-0 cukup rumit dan membingungkan di awal tak jauh beda dengan FFXIII yang menggunakan universe yang sama. Mungkin akan cukup membosankan jika mencapai pertengahan cerita. Namun, semuanya jadi begitu menyayat hati di akhir.\nNilai 10 karena ending game ini yang sukses membuat air mata terus menetes, cuma kemasukan debu sih, Beneran!\nPelajaran dari cerita ini :\n- Jalani hidup sesuai dengan pilihanmu\n- Jadilah dirimu apa adanya\n- Beryukurlah dengan orang2 yang selalu ada & menyayangimu, berbagi dengan mereka akan mengurangi rasa sedih & sakit yang ada.\n- Tersenyum dan bermimpilah tentang hal yang menyenangkan di kemudian hari daripada berputus asa, seberat apapun cobaan yang dihadapi.","October 2, 2015","true","45.1"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

There are 14 different characters that you can play as right from the start, allowing you to experiment and find the right combination that will compliment your playing style. The combat is solid for the most part, though towards the end it becomes more of a "who can one-shot the other faster" game.\n\nRegarding the whole "HD" thing, well.. it's lackluster. The models of the main characters look amazing, almost on the level of FFXV, while the NPCs, enemies (excluding the Behemoth for some reason) and backdrops are straight from the PSP era and clash horribly, no matter how many effects, light options and blur you add.\n\nIf you're interested in achievements, the set that TYPE-0 provides is okay and fairly easy. You can get almost all of them in one playthrough.\n\nTo sum up: the story is trash, the HD conversion is half-baked and definitely needed more work, the music is beautiful, the gameplay is tight, the port is... slightly better than the other ones by Square-Enix, offering more graphical settings than usual but still miles away from the likes of MGSV.

Doing so will lock your screen to target and make it 200% harder to evade any attack, AND not to mention attack and drain is not going to be the same target ( you wouldn't want to attack corpse right ... right? ) Plus since you need to press shift + movement key to evade while trying to attack at the same time. Did I mention that block skill need to press Shift key too and that will not work 'at all' if you just move.\n\nDo you think any enemy will wait for you to do that ? plenty right ? I mean you can see a lot in power ranger and stuff.\n\ntoo bad not in this game and it'll get you killed BUT no worries you got a friend !\nWhich I can proudly say that AI is a lot more stupid than Phantasy star online ( oh stupid one is just your friend not enemies and by PSO I didn't mean 2012 one I mean the 2000 one which is 15 years before this so ... why didn't they getting any smarter ? ) from what I can find you can't manage formation or tactic like in Tales game. ( or I didn't reach that point yet and risk brain cancer along the way) Most keys can be change (thank god) but they are hard to manage nonetheless. use controller just live with it.\n\n2. Camera! since there is no mouse you have to control it with numpad and tab. which won't reset itself most of the time\nresult? you'll facing the wrong way. Still not so bad right ? well, it is not so bad IF you don't have to cast magic that will fire only the way your MC is facing. Let's see, there was a huge robot shooting rpg at you. What will you do? evade right ? but there is a problem you struck in a small passage way. Then it came to you perfect! I can just use Magic 'Wall' and it will cover most of the passage. now you press the key and BANG! a wall appear facing SIDEWAY .... how I curse the devs for this.\n\n3. Menu ... let say took me 5 mins just to find where I can get an explanation to the first skill MC have.\n\n4. Voice Acting if you use English there's 1 - 2 sec lag to mouth movement by lag I mean you can hear the sound without they open it ... must be magic ... right ? please tell me that it is. Oh but Japanese voice work fine. Just that if you listen, You will feel like reading Japanese novel with google translate ( trust me I read a lot of MT novel )\n\n5. Story ... ah ... there is? there ... should ... be one right ? REJOICE ! WE HAVE MORE STORY THAN FARMVILE.\n\n6. Graphic it is the only thing Square can be proud of and the only thing they keep develop BUT NOT ANYMORE I feel like I'm playing PS2 and sometime PS1 which is .... fine I guess still a lot better than Minecraft imo\n\nSO ALL IN ALL\n\nAwesome courier and cool wards make more please.","August 19, 2015","true","61.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

Well, for the most part I quite enjoyed the gameplay and combat, although it did take a little while to get used to. I also really liked doing the strategy missions where you conquer certain regions. They were kind of an interesting addition to the game. But, my gripes with this game mostly rely on the story and characters.\n\nThere's a huge variety of characters in Class Zero; 14 perfect-looking teenagers who are mostly just walking stereotypes, and I found it difficult to be invested in any of them because I found them all to be so...bland. I did my best to go through all the dialogue and extra scenes in the game, hoping to feel SOMETHING for the characters, but I just couldn't, which is quite a disappointment.\n\nIf I had to choose between them, I'd end up choosing which ones I like PLAYING the most rather than ones who I like the personalities of, in which case that would be Sice and Seven. Seven I particularly like literally only because she bears SUCH a resemblance to Lightning.\n\nI get it, though, there's 14 of them so I suppose it'd be difficult to give them all equal screentime and development, but still. They could've done more to flesh them out a little. I mean, in the beginning I couldn't even tell some of the guys apart cause they all had similar-colored blond hair.\n\nAnd as for the story, as far as I'm concerned there really isn't one. It's mostly your typical "we're-at-war" storyline with some cataclysmic event phoned-in at the end for the sake of having an epic and campy final boss. Granted, the stories in FF games have never been THAT groundbreakingly amazing, but that's what the characters are supposed to be there for, y'know? But even the characters weren't enough to make me care about the story in this one.\n\nSo yeah, overall I really liked the gameplay, couldn't care less about the story aspects. But I still would recommend it otherwise, because it does still feel like an FF game.","August 30, 2015","true","23.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/camelsenpai/recommended/340170/","camelsenpai","Camel-Senpai","http://steamcommunity.com/id/camelsenpai/","142 products in account","To start, I'd like to say that I acknowledge the fact that this is originally a PSP game. However, PSP games are not PC games, and therefore this game has to be judged on a PC scale. I'd also like to say that I'm a fan of the FF series and that bias may slip through somewhat.\nThe game starts in a way that I've not seen in the FF's that I've played; which is to say, brutal mass murder. A person that you think could be the hero dies slowly and painfully with his chocobo. This immediate dark take on the beginning of the game could be indicitave of how the rest of the plot is going to play out, but I've yet to complete it. However, the plot so far has intrigue, and is a pretty classic FF storyline.\nHow this plot is told, however, is a little weak in my opinion. Along with cutscenes, there will be an omniscient narrator feeding to you what is happening, and sometimes in place of what could have just been another cutscene. This, to me, is lazy writing. However, that alone isn't nearly reason enough to drop the game.\nThe characters, right now, aren't that fleshed out. This is probably because I'm at the start of the game and most characters in the Final Fantasy series usually don't have their personalities written out until a few hours into the game.\nThe voice acting in English is pretty good until you get to some of the more minor cutscenes. It sometimes feels like Glados is the one who told these people what syllables to stress, and while you can tell that it's trying to be an American accent, it gets a little inconsistent for no apparent reason. Again, I'd like to say the voice acting in general is good and there's no instances of "Engrish" so far.\nOne thing that's worth noting is that the English voice sync with the mouth movements are a bit... Off... to say the least. I haven't played it in Japanese yet, so I've yet to see whether this is because of poor syncing just to English or both versions.\nTo call this an "HD" game is somewhat of a stretch. Your graphics options are limited by the engine and the character models outside of major cutscenes are a bit lacking. You're also locked at a 30 fps maximum. While I understand that's because this is a PSP game, it still can't be judged as such because it's on a different platform.\nControls are fairly easy to get used to, but I'd like to point out that if you're not using a controller, movement, combat, and pretty much anything involving the controls in the game is going to feel a bit choppy. I'd also like to remind keyboard users to turn NumLock on if you didn't, else you're going to have a hard time seeing anything you're not locked onto.\nWhich leads us to combat. There's a lockon system that's prettyhelpful with your single target abilities. Use that ♥♥♥♥. To use your abilities, you have four buttons to press and you set different stuff to those four buttons. Combat can be pretty quick, so if you have a dodge ability, you're spamming it because you're also pretty squishy. I feel like the game gives you enough time to get used to the combat before it throw you into anything real. Also, you eat corpses to replenish mana or something. Pretty metal.\nAll in all, this is a decent game, and I'd give it a 7.5/10 would eat corpses to replenish mana again. I'd suggest it to any fans of the series, but if you're looking for your first FF game, this just isn't it.

All in all, game is kind of good but not good enough to recommend to other final fantasy fans.","February 8","false","21.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I expect about that much from Square games lately.\n\nif you want more details\nWell, let see how bad it is\n\nEDIT: Yeah after a while, I think I should give this positive right? because I'm very please with courier and ward. oh and you can actually play it somewhat using controller albeit vibration and some more issues.( remember those day when you play quirky DOS games and you will be just fine )\n\n1. Control itself is confusing, annoying and doesn't support mouse. You have to press F to attack and drain mp from corpse which doesn't work if you forget to press Space first to lock into target. Doing so will lock your screen to target and make it 200% harder to evade any attack, AND not to mention attack and drain is not going to be the same target ( you wouldn't want to attack corpse right ... right? ) Plus since you need to press shift + movement key to evade while trying to attack at the same time. Did I mention that block skill need to press Shift key too and that will not work 'at all' if you just move.\n\nDo you think any enemy will wait for you to do that ? plenty right ? I mean you can see a lot in power ranger and stuff.\n\ntoo bad not in this game and it'll get you killed BUT no worries you got a friend !\nWhich I can proudly say that AI is a lot more stupid than Phantasy star online ( oh stupid one is just your friend not enemies and by PSO I didn't mean 2012 one I mean the 2000 one which is 15 years before this so ... why didn't they getting any smarter ? ) from what I can find you can't manage formation or tactic like in Tales game. ( or I didn't reach that point yet and risk brain cancer along the way) Most keys can be change (thank god) but they are hard to manage nonetheless. use controller just live with it.\n\n2. Camera! since there is no mouse you have to control it with numpad and tab. which won't reset itself most of the time\nresult? you'll facing the wrong way. Still not so bad right ? well, it is not so bad IF you don't have to cast magic that will fire only the way your MC is facing. Let's see, there was a huge robot shooting rpg at you. What will you do? evade right ? but there is a problem you struck in a small passage way. Then it came to you perfect! I can just use Magic 'Wall' and it will cover most of the passage. now you press the key and BANG! a wall appear facing SIDEWAY .... how I curse the devs for this.\n\n3. Menu ... let say took me 5 mins just to find where I can get an explanation to the first skill MC have.\n\n4. Voice Acting if you use English there's 1 - 2 sec lag to mouth movement by lag I mean you can hear the sound without they open it ... must be magic ... right ? please tell me that it is. Oh but Japanese voice work fine. Just that if you listen, You will feel like reading Japanese novel with google translate ( trust me I read a lot of MT novel )\n\n5. Story ... ah ... there is? there ... should ... be one right ? REJOICE ! WE HAVE MORE STORY THAN FARMVILE.\n\n6. Graphic it is the only thing Square can be proud of and the only thing they keep develop BUT NOT ANYMORE I feel like I'm playing PS2 and sometime PS1 which is .... fine I guess still a lot better than Minecraft imo\n\nSO ALL IN ALL\n\nAwesome courier and cool wards make more please.","August 19, 2015","true","61.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

Lets you turn off blur and annoying effects. You can mod in resolution options.\nThe english voice acting while not great, is not as horrible as it was made out to be. (IE it's not worse than FFX or lightning returns imo).\n\n\nPro's\n-The story and setting is wholly unique for final fantasy. It has the politics of FFXII, however, the banter between characters is there. The dialogue is also much better than the FFXIII series.\n-The combat system is great, however the camera is always marring the combat system.\n-Overall it is a great HD port. The main issue is that the source material is from the PSP.\n\nNegatives\n-30 FPS\n-You have to mod to get resolutions other than 1080p or 720p.\n-It was obviously designed for PSP. The level areas are small and some textures are horrible.\n-The camera.\n\nMainly I think it could be a 8/10 game. I take 0.5 points off for the camera, and 0.5 points off for the small areas.

You can finally move the camera with your mouse. Sadly, there isn't a mouse sensitivity settings in the game so I suppose the camera moves depending on your mouse DPI, so if you find the camera to be really slow, increase the DPI of your mouse.\n\nNow lets start with a few simple things.\nGRAPHICS\nSince everyone is SO concerned about the graphics, I decide to talk about this first. The game is locked at 30FPS because it is a PSP PORT. People just tends to forget that part and starts complaining. If you are facing problems such as low FPS when playing, Lower your anti-aliasing settings. I had my AA on normal and the the rest on (except for motion blur, I turned that off) and the game runs smoothly. Cutscenes do seem a bit of a lower res than the rest of the game, so don't jusdge the game just from the cutscenes. Hop in game and start moving around to get the actual picture.\n\nCONTROLS (OUTDATED)\nI will have to say I am disappointed in the controls of this game. The keyboard controls are unplayable, that is for sure. You can't change the keyboard settings to whatever you want as well. I would advise people to play this game with a controller. If you don't have a controller (like me), you can try something else. I have a Steelseries Rival, I made a profile just for this game, changing my Mouse 1 button to F and Mouse 2 to backspace so that I can use my mouse to attack in game while I move using the keyboard. I have the camera fixed so I don't really have to worry much. In the end, it is down to personal preference.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nI only played the game for 45minutes (according to my save file). Overall, combat is fun, story seems decent. I haven't met any game breaking bugs or crashes so far.\n\nTLDR (UPDATED ON 23/09/2015)\nIt is a great game, just not a really good port. The controls are better now thanks to the mouse support. But it can be rather slow if your DPI is low, and there isn't a mouse sensitivity settings. So for now, you will just have to increase the DPI of your mouse if you want to increase the camera speed. But hey, at least the game is getting better~","August 22, 2015","true","21.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The rest of the world looks pretty low res, but pretty characters and DOF make it HD enough for me :P\n\nI grew tired of the battle system(ended up cheating), reason I kept playing was because I found the story compelling and I wanted to see what would happen dispite it having extremely annoying parts. The game starts with an invasion and all of the main characters are introduced very quickly, this annoyed me as there wasn't much character development appart from knowing that they were named after playing cards and there personalities fall into typical japanese archetypes. There's the dumb blond, the delinquent, the tough guy, the philosophical guy, happy go lucky, the class rep etc etc.  Lots of elements to the lore are mentioned without much explanation which left me quite confused for alot of the game.  The plot also uses deus ex machina ALOT which is a kind of cop out in my opinion....'ah ♥♥♥♥ game over....oh wait..I'm still alive eh?!'  but in the end I really rather enjoyed watching the plot unfold.\n\nIn summary you need to remember this is a PSP port and it still plays as such, the story is dark and shocking in places. if you can overcome its short comings it is an enjoyable game.","September 12, 2015","true","23.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This futher emphasizes the need for a controller. You need to move/dodge the moment the camera jerks around, a keyboard/mouse combo makes this more complicated than necessary.\n\nThe game itself is fun. Kind of a Dark Souls lite with jrpg elements.

The game works perfectly fine for me a runs on a consistant 30fps where some of my friends have told me that they experienced some fps drops on PS4.\n\nAlthough if you don't have monitors that support a 16:9 ratio I'd wait until they patch in all the other resolutions like they did for the 13 series. And to address the framerate issue - just like 13 and 13-2 anti-aliasing is another fancy term for downsampling and setting it on "Highest" would make your internal resolution render at 4k. So unless you're running on a crazy setup I'd turn that option down to "Normal" or turn it off completely to have an enjoyable experience.\n\nAlso, Sice is bae and if you dodge roll you can have a nice glimpse of the girls' panties 10/10.","August 21, 2015","true","44.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SooHyun/recommended/340170/","SooHyun","Hol Horse","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SooHyun/","39 products in account","I'm going to open up this review saying that it's honestly a shame that this game is getting such mixed reviews. To first put it all into perspective this was a port from a PSP game so I was going in not expecting everything to come out perfectly as it would have if it was a port from something like the PS3. I also want to point out that almost 80% of the negative reviews are from players who have played an hour or less of the game and should be taken with a grain of salt. But I will have to say learning from some of their frustrations this game is very difficult to play with a keyboard and a game pad is almost required, and the settings of the game should be played around with most notably the camera speed.\n\nFirst thing that I would like to comment on is the battle system. It is actually quite fun and intense at times which brings much contrast to the other games from Final Fantasy as it is more of a Hack and Slash to a lesser extent. I would liken it to the battle system of Kingdom Hearts with a couple key differences. Overall though I did enjoy the battle system, however i did find most of the boss fights to leave something to be desired as most of them were just straightforward and not as satisfying as boss fights normally are in Final Fantasy games. i feel that the game only becomes actually challenging once the player finishes the game once and enters NG+ (Agito Mode). That being said I did find the battle system quite refreshing and did enjoy it quite a lot.\n\nSecond is the story. The story follows Fabula Nova Crystallis series which is that of Final Fantasy 13  and a couple others, which is honestly a bit confusing to start but once you start to get further into the game it makes a bit more sense. I thought the story was very entertaining with a lot of twists to it which kept the game very interesting all throughtout. The only thing that frustrated me to no end when I was only a few hours into the game is how confusing the naming of the countries were. They follow the 4 Beasts of Asian mythology which is Suzaku, Genbu, Byakko, and Seiryu which are all tied to a country Rubrum, Lorica, Militesi, and Concordia respectively. The problem is that they use words like the Dominion, Suzaku, Vermillion Bird, and Rubrum interchangably which is really confusing until you actually associate what goes with what. But overall that is just a minor thing that annoyed me.\n\nOverall, I did think the game is quite good and the graphics are not as bad as people put them out to be in the negative reviews. The game does come with a fair bit of confusing points and takes a bit to get used to but I assure you that after playing it for a bit it is actually a very enjoyable game.","August 22, 2015","true","25.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's pretty weird some people look CG the npcs look psp-ish, the game looks odd.\n\nGameplay: Took a while to get used to but pretty well thought out, not fond of having to have more than one soldier in that field area that gets on my nerves but thankfully it can be just one soldier at a time on missions.\nThere's a lot of them to choose from and all of them have completely different attacks and weapons except for some baselines abilities. There's even a really basic rts mode on some of the missions too. 9/10 Remove mandatory reserves and it's golden.\n\nStory:Paid alittle more attention to it, eh it's alright but meh. Similar to ff12 where you fight oppression or something, with magister-like whatever with them bigass helmets you know em when you see em.\n\nLevel design: Large scale, interesting to say the least. They took the wild arms 3 approach with this.\nCombat:Dark souls and crisis core all the way. Really feels like that ingame. Right down to the boss fights it really feels like a hybrid souls game with a lighter tone.\n\nRecommended only to those who like games like this. Highly doubt it'll please everybody but it does what it does very well, for an rpg.\n\nOne thing I wish every rpg had is that it lets you train the character without even playing the game, could be doin somethin else and the character chosen levels up alittle, that needs to be in more rpgs cuz it's done very well.","August 20, 2015","true","21.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Really enjoyed the game, I guess the pros outweigh the cons. I was also able to fix the resolution issue using 'Borderless Gaming'. P.S. F11 (snapshot mode) = profit.\n\n- -\n\nAugust 21, 2015\n\nI like the gameplay, pretty fun so far despite the horrendous PC port. There's inconsistent texture quality throughout the game, I was expecting better from the screenshots. I also had to fix my graphics driver because the game uses my integrated graphics card by default.\n\nMore details:\n\n1. The game is 30 fps locked, not a big issue for me. But I experienced frames at 10~20 fps and had to go to my graphics settings to make sure the game uses my NVIDIA card instead of Intel's integrated graphics.\n\n2. Inconsistent quality of graphics/textures. Some parts of the game looks nice, while others still look like you're playing from the PSP. I was expecting more from an HD remaster on PC.\n\n3. This port has only either 720p or 1080p resolution. My laptop has a 900p resolution so it doesn't look too appealing on full screen. I had to keep it on a window that occupies only 65% of my screen.\n\n4. People seem to be having trouble playing it on a keyboard and mouse. Highly recommended to use a controller, preferably Xbox controller for Windows.\n\nUnless you're playing on a 1080p screen and have a good controller, I don't fully recommend purchasing this game as it is right now. Maybe after they fix the resolution and textures or after I fully enjoy the game.","August 20, 2015","true","64.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Dodge!\n\nFinal Fantasy Type-0 HD, where to start, where to start...\n\nI've wanted this game since I first heard about it in 2008. Loved the concept, loved the characters, loved the mature feel to it. And so I waited. 2011. "Only in Japan." 2011-2013. Hope. Then 2014 hit. HD remake. Full ignition of the flame, waves of hope crashed and I knew the day would come when I would play the game. The fan translation hit and I played it. Enjoyed it, but it wasn't exactly what I wanted. 2015. Steam. Boom. Here we are.\n\nThe Good:\n\nType-0 isn't your average, hit, wait, hit, wait, FF game. You're in full control of your character and are able to move around in battle, pulling off skills, healing, and dodging. Dodging a lot. The battles are fluid, putting you right into the action. You move left, right, attack, dodge, run, strike, magic! That freedom is what appeals to me in games. Turned based is great but sometimes you just want to pull off some sweet moves of your own accord. In terms of action of this sort, think FF 12 and a bit of 13, without the linearity of the latter and the sluggishness of the former.\n\nBattles can be pretty easy, if you know your opponents well enough. You COULD rush in and hit everything in sight but good luck with that. Enemies like Coeurls and even soldiers will try to dodge your attacks. You could wait for your Killsight to active, a special innate power that every character has that lets you deal massive damage or instantly kill an opponent, to make things easier. Or you could use magic. Fire's always fun.\n\nBattles can also persist, sometimes you can "feel a presence" of other enemies nearby and initiate another battle with enemies that get stronger and stronger as you remain in that battle chain. You heal after every battle chain, in other words when you exit into the world map, so that's always great, but charcaters who die can only be revived when you return to a town or Akademeia, you school and the central hub of the game. But if you're doing a mission then the character stays dead until you finish that mission so be careful with the weaker members of your party.\n\n(Only characters who participate in battles gain EXP so be aware of that fact. You could just use any 3 character but that's no fun. Diversify~)\n\nThe 14 playable characters are all unique in terms of personality and weapons. You got your long ranger attackers, Trey (bow), Ace (cards), and Cater (gun) for example, your short range fighters, Eight (fists), Queen (rapier), and Cinque (mace), and your magic heavy characters like Duece (flute). Your party can only consist of 3 characters at any given time so pick your favorites but also be aware of the fact that their are enemies best suited for certain characters. Characters like Eight have trouble fighting airborne enemies so be mindful of that. When you level up you get AP (Ability Points I'm guessing) which you can use to learn new skills in battle. You have your passives, your attacks, and power boosts for said attacks. Experiment with different skill types cause their are a lot, and my highest level character is barely 17.\n\nThe story is pretty gritty. Like holy sh*t man, the first 10 minutes of the game and I'm already trying really hard not to cry. These are kids you're playing as. Facing a war. Facing death. Facing things some of us can't even begin to fathom on a very real level. Blood, blood everywhere! But at the end of the day, your characters can still find things to smile about and that just makes you forget what's really going on sometimes.\n\nThe music is pretty good, which is no surprise for a FF game.\n\nThe art and character models are neat but nothing astounding.\n\nI don't care about the FPS honestly. 30 or not, it's a great game and I've loved every second of it. I don't understand why some people make such a big deal about this. I'm an avid gamer. I play a lot of games and have spent hours doing so with zero care about the FPS. Call me what you like, at the end of the day, I'm having fun and that's all that matters to me~\n\nThe Bad:\n\n-My biggest gripe thus far is the fact that the in-game buttons only show the keys on a keyboard, nothing for a controller. I had a bit of trouble understanding what E and R did but I think I have that down now... either way, if I could have read those buttons better in the beginning I think I would have had an easier time.\n\nFinal Fantasy Type-0 HD, a new kind of fantasy for those looking to lose themselves in unique characters and addicting game play.

The rest of the world looks pretty low res, but pretty characters and DOF make it HD enough for me :P\n\nI grew tired of the battle system(ended up cheating), reason I kept playing was because I found the story compelling and I wanted to see what would happen dispite it having extremely annoying parts. The game starts with an invasion and all of the main characters are introduced very quickly, this annoyed me as there wasn't much character development appart from knowing that they were named after playing cards and there personalities fall into typical japanese archetypes. There's the dumb blond, the delinquent, the tough guy, the philosophical guy, happy go lucky, the class rep etc etc.  Lots of elements to the lore are mentioned without much explanation which left me quite confused for alot of the game.  The plot also uses deus ex machina ALOT which is a kind of cop out in my opinion....'ah ♥♥♥♥ game over....oh wait..I'm still alive eh?!'  but in the end I really rather enjoyed watching the plot unfold.\n\nIn summary you need to remember this is a PSP port and it still plays as such, the story is dark and shocking in places. if you can overcome its short comings it is an enjoyable game.","September 12, 2015","true","23.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If ur a fan of the series you'll play it.\n- Action oriented with interchangeable characters on the fly\n- You can play it in Japanese with Subtitles (the way us anime geeks prefer it)\n- If you don't have kids but are employed and not a drug addict.. $29CDN is a decent price\n- The music is, as always, Fantastic\n\nCons:\n- It's a 30fps revamp of a PSP game\n- textures are meh\n- cutscenes aren't as crisp as you'd like, but who cares what u like?\n- keyboard controls can't be remapped to suit your whims, so get a controller or learn to "adapt"\n\nI'm really enjoyin this game so far and once I've totally mastered my keyboard's controls to become 2nd nature I really have nothin to gripe about.

Personally haven't run into any problems with it.\n\nIt is a port from a PSP game but don't let that and the 30 FPS stop you from trying this game. It may not be the most beautiful game on the market but cutscenes look nice and the game plays well (With a controller) One big thing for some people might be that the options menu is lacking and not many settings can be changed.\n\nThe combat IS more action than menu based so just be careful if your a "FF fan" don't be sad when it's a different style.","August 19, 2015","true","6.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Really enjoyed the game, I guess the pros outweigh the cons. I was also able to fix the resolution issue using 'Borderless Gaming'. P.S. F11 (snapshot mode) = profit.\n\n- -\n\nAugust 21, 2015\n\nI like the gameplay, pretty fun so far despite the horrendous PC port. There's inconsistent texture quality throughout the game, I was expecting better from the screenshots. I also had to fix my graphics driver because the game uses my integrated graphics card by default.\n\nMore details:\n\n1. The game is 30 fps locked, not a big issue for me. But I experienced frames at 10~20 fps and had to go to my graphics settings to make sure the game uses my NVIDIA card instead of Intel's integrated graphics.\n\n2. Inconsistent quality of graphics/textures. Some parts of the game looks nice, while others still look like you're playing from the PSP. I was expecting more from an HD remaster on PC.\n\n3. This port has only either 720p or 1080p resolution. My laptop has a 900p resolution so it doesn't look too appealing on full screen. I had to keep it on a window that occupies only 65% of my screen.\n\n4. People seem to be having trouble playing it on a keyboard and mouse. Highly recommended to use a controller, preferably Xbox controller for Windows.\n\nUnless you're playing on a 1080p screen and have a good controller, I don't fully recommend purchasing this game as it is right now. Maybe after they fix the resolution and textures or after I fully enjoy the game.","August 20, 2015","true","64.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Although it says it's 'HD', at 1080p it still looks like you're playing on a giant stretched out PSP. Game is locked at 30FPS and most of the it's barely even hitting 15FPS. Makes the gameplay very laggy at times. Increasing Anti-Aliasing upscales the resolution, which makes it very laggy if your machine cannot support said resolution. It's not unplayable, but it's very difficult to get used to.  Having said that, the number of options in the graphics menu has increased drastically in comparison to the FFXIII port on release, but that isn't enough to make this a good port. Really hoping that they release an update for this to push the FPS cap, although it's highly unlikely.\n\nThe store doesn't specifiy this, but a controller is HIGHLY recommended. I haven't tried it with a keyboard/mouse, but I can't imagine playing this game without a controller.\n\nAs far as the game goes, it's actually quite decent. Pretty good storyline, gameplay is active as opposed to turn-based (similar to Crisis Core), but the bad FPS and horrible resolution (even at 1080p) makes the overall experience unenjoyable. Perhaps if you don't mind the bad graphics, you might actually enjoy this game.\n\n\nGood game, bad port.\nPort: 2/10\nGame: 8/10","August 24, 2015","false","1.7"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","3"

While the game itself is fantastic in my opinion (I received the Platinum trophy on the PlayStation 4 version,) I purchased the game on Steam in order to see how it ran on my powerful machine.\n\nRunning a GTX 970, with a 4th gen i7 and 32 GB of RAM, the cutscenes were an incredibly stuttery mess, and the resolution was capped at 1080p (with a 720p option.) Gameplay ran fine, but I'm left wanting more from this PC port that brings to mind memories of Final Fatnasy XIII...","August 22, 2015","false","0.4"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

And yes, this game is better played with a controller.\n\nGameplay is different from any Final Fantasy I have played. Battles aren't menu-driven so much anymore, but are more action/reaction driven. And I have to get acquainted with a large number of playable characters and figure out how to play with them.\n\nIt's not bad for a ported game.

I use my laptop, which has a 970m-6G and i7 fixed on it to play this game. Performance setting of the 970m is set to high. Unfortunately the game cannot run very well with this card. With high graphics setting, the fps of the game is about 20 to 27.( Maximum is 30 fps) However, even under this setting, the game still seems quite ugly. For example, You will notice that the hands of characters are square not smooth at all and the flames seem like floating on air. In one word, FF0HD is still a PSV game but its system requirement is too high. You can play the game but you will never be satisfied.\n\n2.Comparing to "Way of the Samurai", the story of FF0 is great. However its gameplay is bad. So far the only things I do are running, boring fighting and watching fantastic CG. YEAH, this is a CG moive, just like FFXIII game serie.\n\n3.The game consumes 25.5Gb. It should be a good game or at least a good miove. But the answer is NO. Those CG have many problems. For example when one is speaking you will find that the video and sound are not synchronized. Sometimes the sound is broken.\n\nThe strong point is that this game has a fantastic stoy, beautiful music and a better battle mode. By saying a better battle mode, I mean better than FFXIII serie.\n\nSummary\nEven this game has a fantastic story, but the very bad optimization and ugly graphic make this game very disappointing. I suggest you do not buy this game now.","August 19, 2015","false","6.5"," 33 of 69 people (48%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","48","33","69","2","9"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrGlitters/recommended/340170/","MrGlitters","Mr. Glitters","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrGlitters/","177 products in account","Review [Spoiler Free]\nPlayed the PSP version.  You can find screenshots of it in my profile.\nFramerate is capped to 30FPS due to engine limitations.\nUses controller mode.\n\n***Early Impressions***\n\n\nStory 8.5/10\n- Personally one of my favourite FF titles to date\n- A much darker tone than any previous Final Fantasy titles.\n- Each character has an exaggerated unique personality to differentiate\n- You'll be lost/overwhelmed by what's going on in the beginning.  You may need to play the game twice to fully understand\n- New Game+ has extra things you can do.  It's not the exact same game over again.\n\nControls 7/10\n- The port allows you to change between three controller schemes\n- Camera can be snappy and difficult at time\n- Very brief tutorial and controls are shown in menu.  The game isn't too complicated to  learn\n- SquareEnix added a snapshot mode and a Fast Forward button for the grindy parts\n- When using a controller, the UI interface doesn't switch from keyboard layout -> controller layout automatically.  Must change layout settings in launcher\n\nGraphics 7.5/10\n- Game is capped to 30FPS.  You will not be able to change this\n- A very lazy graphic port.  If you look in my profile's screenshot folder for the PSP version, they barely redone any textures but the main playable characters, boss character, and academy.\nMost of the world textures are ported straight from the PSP version   The redone textures and lighting is super inconsistent with the pre-rendered videos.  What was deveopment team smoking.  The new in-game character models are atrociously glossy and doll-like   To be fair, the redone academy does look pretty sweet.  It's too bad that the game wasn't completely overhauled - Anti-aliasing is pretty misleading.  It's basically downsampling a higher resolution.  Therefore a very high impact to performance (high - highest setting)\nI strongly recommend you to read PcGamers' "Final Fantasy Type 0 Port Analysis..." for full details on settings and the impact is has on performance - The use of bloom is extremely distracting and unnecessary.  A horrible technique to mask bad textures\n- Overall a pretty nasty graphic port.  The combination of oversaturation, gloss, bloom effects, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ texture is almost eye cancer.  The port strayed too far from the original artstyle intended.\n\n\nSound 9/10\n- The music plays an important role in the game.  It sets the atmosphere and has a special meaning behind it.  I'm glad they stuck with the Japanese version during the dubbing.\n\n- There is dual audio [English/Japanese].\n\n\nGameplay 7.5/10\n- The gameplay style is a real-time hack-and-slash.  The closest game control-scheme wise that I can relate to is Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep\n- It can be grindy at times and you'll always encounter formidable foes or enemies which you must fight against during NG+\n- Your AI teammates are pretty derpy.  There's a setting to sub in higher level AI to fight for you to compensate\n\n\nWeighted Score 8.5/10\nMy three true elements to a great JRPG is a great story, memorable music, and enjoyable gameplay.  I should be able to grind battles and not be sick of the music.  I should be grinding for a purpose, either for better skils or to progress the plot.\n\nI won't comment much on the port but the game itself is worth the playthrough.  I highly suggest you to complete the game before you pass off a judgement.  You may find yourself a bit confused at first but it all comes together in the end.\n\nOkay, if I really had to comment on the port then I'd say it's pretty sh*t.  It's not the lack of settings or 30FPS that bothers me.  It's the design change they went with the characters and lighting.  It's so freaking inconsistent with the pre-rendered videos.  I wish they stuck with the artstyle the PSP game had.\n\nFor JRPG fans, I would highly recommend this game to you.  For anyone else it depends.  As long as you enjoy JRPG style games then I would give it a whirl.  I can confidently say that it's one of the better FF titles that has come out in a while.  For once a story doesn't revolve around character romance.\n\nSide Notes:\n- Early review.  Expect changes.","August 22, 2015","true","83.6"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

This poor laptop will die.) But after about an hour so so of check the forms, I found my fix, and check a couple of other things, set it to max and we are golden.\n\nWell when it come to FF many people think story, characters, gameplay, and Narritve.\n\nBut as a long time fan of FF 1, 2, & 3 (Yes those golden boys and girls.) I have had a rather gruel expirence coming up todate on this fish. But After begin drianed by all numbers after 4, I had High hopes for this game. Which are listed as such:\n\nGraphcs are good for a PSP game on a PC\n\nThe combat mechanic is Intresting, althouhg I do miss Turn based combat. (Old School Kids.)\n\nThe cut scences are nice, but I feel they were nto as good as possible (Reminder I am on a laptop.) So I lose my right to complain by limitations.\n\nThe characters depth is very, abrupt. (I feel like am at the petting Zoo.) Their desgins are nice, I like the personalities and everything else so far.\n\nNow for my knit picky butt to start its unconrolled rant.\n\nIts a console remake on to a surpior system, of course there are going be issues so stop complaining.\n\nIt was all ready made, just not for Pc. Look We al know that most gaming folk's towers can easily eat thos console's newest game for a snack at still chomp down on these kind of games, but Do be so hung up on this game its been played before its ust for those who want it on their PC.\n\nNot much else for a Pre-order, I feel betrayed by some one, or am Paranoid. Honestly I do not DOTA, and am very picky about my games. As much of a Weeaboo, Otaaku gamer thin I am, I feel like this game has a beutiful side that will get ♥♥♥♥ on later.\n\nSince it is a remake there are going to be bugs, and its going to be a little buggy.\n\nSo for The final Verdict, Its great, I do like it, I have never cared for many FF games, Because honestly, Cloud has mental bnreakdowns like he is a hipster, Dream squences are over rated, and happy go lucky charcaters do not become shephroth, and Lighting is like Future Jesus batman?????? I don't know, all I know is that this a recommended game, and I do enjoy its precense, don't get comfy, as soon as Persona 5 comes out your are going right back to HELL FF0HD.

Controls are smooth and the developers have opted for the relatively simplistic option of deferring antialiasing to supersampling, and at maximum anti-aliasing the game powers through at a downsampled 4k - and doesn't miss a beat on my i7-4790k/OG Titan combo. Textures do look like they have been put through an upscaling filter but they've tried really hard by adding specular mapping and a host of special effects including switchable color correction, screen space shadows, and depth of field effects.\n\nThe game feels like a slightly clunkier Kingdom Hearts with a very light sprinkling of Not A Real Sheen Maygoomi Tensay Gaem 3/4 in there with regards to timed conversations, and just the lightest touch of Crisis Core for feels.\n\nReccomended at a discount price. I got this for £13.34 from GMG.","August 19, 2015","true","5.0"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

While it fixed a lot of the graphical lag, the game is still almsot entirely a medicore mess. I would warn anyone to caution getting this unless you are not just a dire hard Fianl Fantasy fan but also a very engaged fan of the Crystalsis storyline. The game has nothing to do with the 13 storyline, but uses the same Mythos and Universe. That being said, if you know how FFXIII plays out then you're quite able to figure out how Type 0 must end. In addition to this, the game is overrun with poorly designed characters. The game has you cotrolling an entire team of 13 soilders, and the character development is all over the place it's real easy to loose who is doing what when were and why.\n\nThe story does have a few merits, though. Amazing cutscenes and story presentation make the game almost enticing for that and that alone. You feel truly invested in what happens & that your mission(s) actually save the world.\n\nSadly, this does not recover it fromt he plethora of problems noted above coupled with the pretty horrible voice acting/character idle movements. A saving grace would be the gameplay, except that it is also beyond saving. You can easily complete the game changing weapons/acessories twice, and rarely to never powering up magic/summons. This makes obtaining Armor/Weapons/Summons mostly pointless, unless you want to go into NG+. Suppose NG+ is the selling pont of the game, should it take you till level 40 to need to upgrade weapons? I think not.\n\nIn the end, if you love the mythos, play it, if you hated FFXIII's lore steer clear away from this hot mess of a game. If you've been dying to play this but don't own a PSP, then maybe this is for you. Just know you're getting into a game that can be 100%'d in less than twenty hours with no real effort.","April 14","false","50.9"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

Reason is...you can't play it properly with  keyboard and mouse. What the ♥♥♥♥ are you serious ? This game was a previous psp title, its not made for keyboard and mouse, it wasn't even made for 2 controlsticks, and despite that fact, there are so many other games that pretty much require a controller to play it properly, for example dark souls, wich btw is a very popular game that is liked by many people even though you have to play it with a ♥♥♥♥ing controller.\n\n2. Reason is...the camera sucks. Sure the camera is a bit weird, but you also have to consider that it was a psp game. It is a camera that was based on a handheld console, deal with it. In my opinion you just have to get used to it, i've been playing this game for a while now and im feeling quiet confortable since then, more than on the psp actually. i played the japanese psp version and i know the difference, they fixed many many stuff, including the camera, i know the camera is not the best, but its still better than on the psp, also the controls in general (it feels a lot smoother, 30fps lock is really no big deal, i don't have the best gpu, but i never had any lag at all. As long as it stays 30 fps you're good to go)\n\nAt the end of the day, its really sad to read such things from the final fantasy community. I think Square Enix remade this game, to make a worldwide release, so everybody can play it, therefore giving them such a bad feedback is kinda disrespectful...): You guys should be happy for beeing able to play it in your language, i mean, when you dont like it, because you dont have this familiar "final fantasy" experience or because you dont like the story, its fine, im completely okay with that, but not for the controls and the camera. They really put their thoughts into it and they really made it better. But now to my statement...\n\nIn my opinion its a gorgeous game, i really like the action based gameplay and the story. 14 playable characters offer a great playability and the combat system is very unique because of killsights and critical hits, wich can be performed by hitting an enemy on the right timing. Really makes it advanced and gives many possibilities, for example if you encounter an overpowered enemy you still have a chance to defeat him if you make a killsight, this could be good for leveling purposes.\n\nThe story is darker than usual FF stories, wich makes the game even more unique. The chracter depht could be better but its still good for having 14 playable characters.\n\nNot everything is HD , sure its not, it was a psp game, but the graphics still look good and they put very much effort into the character models (maybe sorroundings will look chunky sometimes, but the characters will always stay HD, they look really nice). For me, the game looks like an early ps3 game, wich is a really good progression in comparison to the old psp graphic.\n\nFor the gameplay, i personally like the world map with random encounters, it brings back many good old stuff i missed in Crisis Core, like leveling and chocobos. The only shity thing (wich is a real pain in the ♥♥♥) is that 12 hours until next mission system. You really have to spend some time just to plan what things you will do in this 12 hours, but on the otherside it makes every playthrough a unique experience.","August 20, 2015","true","108.2"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

I played the original Final Fantasy type-0 on the PSP and, you know what, I loved it.\n\nThe game stood apart from other Final Fantasy games significantly in story and scope without completely abandoning the style. The story was interesting and didn't baby you. The characters were varied and the writers understood that having many primary characters meant not being able to touch on many others outside of that cast. The gameplay was solid, though I do wish there were more strategy segments as that was so, so, so much fun. The parallels to WWII were attractive. This was my favorite Final Fantasy since Crisis Core and gave me resounding hope for Fabula Nova Chrystallis.\n\nWith that being said, don't buy this port. It's slow, clunky and lags far too much to be worth your money. Go borrow a PSP and get the original version then download an English patch for it. It should still be available on the Japanese PSN store. Despite the beautiful graphics and wonderful story, the game is nearly unplayable with the speed it runs with. This was acceptable on a smaller system, but not here.","August 23, 2015","false","0.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","2"

A Final Fantasy game with action RPG combat, a large and diverse cast of characters and a much grittier story than the typical plot from the rest of the series.\nUltimately, I do not recommend the game. Here are my pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n1. The combat system has some good depth to it.\n2. The characters all feel very different, I took time to play as each one before quitting the game. All have different personalities in addition to different weapon types and playstyles.\n3. Grinding, for those interested, is made easy with the repeated encounters mechanic. You no longer have to run around in circles to grind levels. You simply hit a button to fight again.\n\nCons:\n1. Performance on PC is terrible. Sub 30fps regularly even when you're out of combat.\n2. Input lag exists far beyond your typical 30fps experience. When the framerate is at its worst, a full second can pass between a button press and the execution of a basic attack. This results in occassionally frustrating combat.\n3. Combat systems are nicely done, but very poorly explained for non-regulars.\n4. Voice acting, even for a Final Fantasy game, is absolutely horrific. Every character sounds completely uninterested in the plot.\n5. Sound in the cutscenes is completely out of sync. Sometimes sounds would happen almost a full second or two before the action happens on screen. Characters can have closed mouths and still be yelling due to the audio sync delay.\n6. Texture work is actually WORSE on PC than it is on PS4. Every game I have ever played on my current system looks far better on my system than it did on PS4. When I saw my friends play this game on PS4 I was even more upset with this port.\n7. The story is lackluster. I may have a blunted opinion of this because of how much the audio sync issue broke my since of immersion in the first cutscenes, but I am completely uninterested in the story other than the back story about the 4 kingdoms.\n\n\nSummary: This game has a fun combat system and a great cast of characters muddled beneath a lackluster story, terrible visuals and horrible input lag. It also has TERRIBLE audio sync issues that completely ruined my experience with the opening cutscenes. Even with a controller (which is apparently preferred), I can't recommend this game to anyone. Even RPG fans or fellow Final Fantasy players like me.","August 24, 2015","false","4.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Idk why this game currently at the time of this review has a mixed reaction on the User Reviews with a 50% rating. I have not come across any sort of technical problems, such as glitches(graphical or otherwise). There are some odd things however. You can't exit the game easily when you want to. The main menu has no exit game choice, that I do admit is odd, so I had to use my window key to get out of it. Alt-Tab will probably work as well. However the rest of the game is fantastic. They brought back an overworld to the FF series which imo was sorely missed. Graphically when you look closely the graphics aren't that impressive, you can tell the game came from the PSP, however rather than focusing on the details and instead looked at as a whole when it comes to its graphics, it's actually a beautiful game with beautiful design. I loved the combat in Crisis Core FF7 on the PSP as well as Kingdom Hearts, if anyone has played those, you'll be somewhat prepared for the combat. Obviously buttons will have changed and it is instead a party system, but otherwise the combat is very nice and satisfying. I use controller for this game and when using a controller you can only navigate menus using the D-pad and not the stick. It's unfortunate and annoying but I assume it is because it was originally a PSP game. The story is give or take, it can be interesting at times, and not during other times, but it's up to you. I have no problems with it. Overall I'd give this addition to the FF series an 8/10. If you are not an FF fan you obviously won't enjoy it. If you are like me, an FF fan, I feel like you'll enjoy it but again it's up to you.","August 18, 2015","true","76.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

It's definitely a Final Fantasy type of story. However, some things aren't explained very well. No spoilers here. You can read that elsewhere.\n\nGameplay  - An action-rpg that reminds me a bit of Monster Hunter and God Eater. Lots of dodging and timing to get attacks in. Grinding levels and upgrading skills/magic is a thing here too. Each member of Class 0 is fun to play with in their own separate ways. Camera is crazy sometimes but not game breaking (IMO).\n\nGraphics  - Runs smoothly on my PC at 30fps, at 19020x1080 resolution on standard settings. Since it is a remastered PSP game there are many things that still look less than HD, such as generic NPCs. However, overall things look nice as long as you are not counting pixels.\n\nConclusion  - If you enjoy Final Fantasy games and action-rpgs in general, graphics don't matter THAT much to you, you don't already hate this game, and are willing to play it for what it is, PLAY IT.","August 18, 2015","true","5.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

But time will tell whether they truly do or not\n*This review is solely about the quality of the port and NOT the game itself.*\nThe game has been patched numerous times. Though I do not own it anymore. I am unable to tell whether my biggest game breaking problem has been fixed.\nCons  Game seems to do some Texture Filtering. But there is no option for it. Forcing 16xAF through drivers provides better detail on hair''' http://screenshotcomparison.com/comparison/139090\nThere is constant tearing no matter WHAT I do, creating a profile and forcing Vsync doesn't seem to work.\nIf your monitor is less than 1080p, but greater than 720p. You will run into problems\nOn my 768p TV, it will not allow 1080p. Only 720p. On my 1600x900 monitor, 1080p works. On another user's 1600x900 monitor, 1080p doesn't work. http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showpost.php?p=175888043&postcount=1106 http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showpost.php?p=175888290&postcount=1107\nSetting the game to windowed 1080p on one of the set-ups mentioned does not display a 1080p Window but still renders at 1080p.\nEX Screenshots http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showpost.php?p=175886507&postcount=1102 Notice the GPU usage is at around 70+%. This is on a 980 with Highest AA turned on. Highest AA at 720p only uses around 35% GPU usage\nOn one of my Audio set ups, the Audio from FMVs comes out garbled like it's trying to time stretch it.\nClip https://www.copy.com/s/t%3AyxPydE9QwAKqYAQL%3Bp%3A%252FType-0%2520Garbled%2520audio.mp3\nhttp://www.neogaf.com/forum/showpost.php?p=175886507&postcount=1102\nThe audio isn't garbled on my other sound setup AT ALL though! I have audio going from SPDIF out to another room that is run through a DAC to an amplifier. Though if the problem was on the output side I wouldn't be able to capture the audio problem from within windows right?. EX to record the audio clip above, I had to set my playback device back to the analog L/R out. But when I actually USE that output in my other room on my 1600x900 monitor, no audio problems. Dedicated sound card too WHAT:?\n\nMy monitor is 59.790Hz, other have mentioned the audio skipping if they don't run at 60hz or the game goes under 30hz in cutscenes (I have an i7 and a 980)\nThere is no way to remap keyboard keys or Gamepad controls. Only a few presets for each\nThey had the opportunity to further improve the rest of the uneven character model work but didn't. Their explanation was lack of time with the console versions. But Square Enix was the one who supplied them, not HexaDrive. So once again, SE is at fault.\nPatched    Mouse Cursor is ALWAYS on screen, you can move it to the edge, but it doesn't disappear completely. - [PATCHED]\nGame is locked to only 2 display/base render resolutions. 720p and 1080p. (But the game can render up to 4k without problem. WAT - [PATCHED but still doesn't support resolutions higher than 1080p]\nSome players are reporting FMV audio de-syncs [PATCHED]\nhttp://www.neogaf.com/forum/showpost.php?p=175864988&postcount=1034\nHigh refresh rate monitors and GSync users are reporting sync problems. [PATCHED]\nhttp://www.neogaf.com/forum/showpost.php?p=175861143&postcount=1028\nUnless you set the controller to gamepad in the launcher, it will display Keyboard Icons [PATCHED]\n______________________________________\nPros   The game performs without problems at a solid 30FPS, UNLIKE FFXIII and XIII-2\nIt has a lot of graphics options to choose from\nIt has decent Anti Aliasing! AA settings are as follows: Off (NoAA), Normal (Temporal AA), High (Temporal AA + 1.5x1.5 SSAA), Highest (Temporal AA + 2x2 SSAA)  http://hexadrive.jp/hexablog/\nIt looks amazing IMO despite all of the left over textures and models from the PSP Verison. Even the upscaled PSP FMVs dont' look so bad\nFMV quality is VERY GOOD this time, to match the consoles. UNLIKE FFXIII and XIII-2\nOffers separate Audio volume levels and Audio levels are generally pretty balanced.\nOffers option to turn on Subtitles and has Dual Audio!______________________________________________\nThey sure as hell didn't care for any of their other past AAA Final Fantasy PC releases. I wish they would patch those. They NEED it so badly. And this game still needs more patches","August 18, 2015","true","0.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","8"

The story quickly out paces your level, forcing you to grind to catch up (thankfully there's an easy xp exploit to solve that problem). There are side-quests littered throughout the game but they boil down to simple fetch or kill quests. Even the main quests lack excitement as you simply work your way from point A to point B, killing everything in between. That is somewhat alleviated by the combat which I thoroughly enjoyed. The action RPG-style combat combined with 14 playable characters, each with their own different play style, was a blast.\n\n+ Combat is really fun.\n+ The eidolon's are neat, especially watching them in the cut scenes.\n+ The story was decent enough.\n\n- So very much grinding.\n- Too many times where you get one-hit killed.\n- I found the game generally lacking in excitement.\n\nPlaytime: ~ 27h\n6/10","August 30, 2015","false","27.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"
