"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lorenleah/recommended/421630/","lorenleah","Loren","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lorenleah/","70 products in account","Just finished my first full playthrough.  This is by one of the authors of Choice of Romance (Affairs of the Court), and if you enjoyed that writing style -- intrigue, drama, mysteries, complex plots with great payoffs, and deftly-written characters with a lot of emotional veracity -- this will be exactly the kind of Choice of Game/Hosted Game you're looking for.  In comparison to that earlier work Study in Steampunk is a tad more predictable if you know the basic outlines of the most popular Sherlock Holmes stories, but there are still a lot of other unexpected elements thrown in, and the characters are really fantastic.  For me this is the most important point: I tend to judge CoGs on good characters and good roleplaying choices.  This is a game where just about every time I wanted to say X to a character or respond in Y way to a development, there X and Y were exactly on the menu, which tells me it's been well thought out in a way some games just aren't.  It's also got a pretty good length to it -- some Choice of Games may leave you feeling wanting despite a superficially impressive word count, but this one is truly long and substantial.  This is the most enjoyable CoG I've played in years and I really can't recommend it enough.  The only real flaw in my mind is the lack of ability to play as female, but don't worry, you can still romance men if you want ;)","November 20, 2015","true","22.7"," 46 of 50 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","46","50","3","0"

It's got drama, action, deep and heartfelt relationships, mystery-solving, and lots of intense and even painful moments. You play for the highest stakes, definitely. I also cried a lot.\n\nEnter you, yet unnamed male protagonist, stumbling back into your old life after surviving a harsh partly robot/mecha war between your Empire and another country. There's plenty of choices to make -- be a faithful soldier, become a traitor rebel, pursue forbidden magics, and pick someone to give your heart to, if you want.\n\nThe Good+ The general atmosphere of the novel (Victorian steampunk)\n+ Lots of murder mystery solving\n+ Great "buddy cop" story with your partner in crime\n+ Layered story with political intrigue, including spies and rebels\n+ The magic system that's introduced\n+ Action! Drama! High stakes!\n+ High replay value\n+ Save points (!)\n\nThe Bad- Predictability, even if you're just a bit familiar with the stories this game borrows from (Sherlock Holmes, Jack the Ripper, etc.)\n- No skip option for replay purposes\n- ???\n\nSure, I might be biased because I have a weakness for Victorian-style mystery solving and steampunk, but this game really got me invested and involved up to a point where I was genuinely nervous what would happen if I picked a certain choice. The stakes are quite high, and your choices have a huge amount on influence on your relationships with other characters, various story elements, and also on the endings.\n\n10/10 would play again","January 24","true","2.6"," 20 of 20 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","20","20","0","0"

Every choice you make feels like it has weight and impact on the story, while still flowing together to create a whole narrative. The character you play as feels like a real person and rather than making descions based on numbers or what will bring the best outcome I found myself thinking "What would he do under the circumstances?" I just can't recommend this game enough to anyone who enjoys story-based games.","November 21, 2015","true","4.9"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","12","15","0","0"

Like with the rest of the games from this series, there lies an complex interplay of character relationships and political factions that provides a wide array of responses and skillsets to help create your persona.  For example, on my first playthrough I played the part of a pacifist medical specialist that chose to partake in the Resistance's efforts to create a more balanced government, but retaining my humanity by saving all my former allies and those that required help.  It felt like all my choices matter, and that there were multiple strengths to build your character across is a plus.  However, it would have been great for an option to choose the gender of your character, as the game automatically assumes that you are playing as a man, which can take people out of the narratice if using a female persona.\n\nOther than that, the story world of this game is great and encompasses many different morally grey areas. A central focus on the game's lore revolves around a group of people known as "the sun-touched", who possess the ability to drain or give life force to other people.  Through this ability, the sun-touched and the vampiric "light-eaters" have created a feudal society at the expense of treating commoners as nothing more than cattle and serfs.  On the other hand, your country Mercia has broken away from such worship and have ushered a technological revolution, with all the pros and cons that they entail, with constant pleas for labor reform and unions.  In fact, the situation can be viewed as so abhorrent that a Resistance has formed to express the discontent of the working class which amounts to a lot of vigilante justice, sabotage, and outright terrorism.  Of course, as the main character, you are one of the sun-touched in hiding, and it is up to you to choose whether or not to develop these latent abilities or master something else entirely.  The friends and lovers that you make, the factions that constantly vie for each other's power and influence, will certainly provide enough intrigue to last a good few hours.\n\nAs a result, I would highly recommend this game to people who love a good story due to its longevity and cheap cost.","November 25, 2015","true","14.8"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

Playing the Watson to Garrett Finch's Holmes is deeply enjoyable, and the steampunk fantasy setting is well-developed and offers a fresh take on things. There are a few twists I saw coming (I've read too much Sherlock Holmes not to expect a few things), but- without offering any spoilers- they were handled well enough that it didn't really break my immersion in the story too much.\n\nI loved all of the various characters, even the minor ones, who were very deftly and quickly fleshed out just enough to care about them, and deeply enjoyed the character growth my character was able to have.","March 11","true","8.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It stands up to the very best of the other choice of games, leaving very little to be desired. There are a few limitations to your customization, like you can't pick a female character, though that didn't bother me all to much. You also are thrust into the role of a Doctor, without any way to choose a different path that I've found. However, the role of a Doctor is more of a secondary, and the game derfinetely allows you to decide what you want to do with the rest of your character. All in all, one of the best written choice of games I've played thus far, right up with Choice of Robots in my opinion.","December 30, 2015","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've long been a fan of the 'Choice of games' games, and I've never yet played a game by them I didn't like. This one, however, was the best by far. Perhaps it is in part due to my partiality for the oldfashioned England, from the days described so well by (among others) Charles Dickens and Bram Stoker. This tale perfectly captured that setting, described the streets of London so well I felt almost like I was walking them myself. The narrative so well written, the choices I was presented with so heartwrenching and engaging, well... In short, there is nothing negative I have to say about it.","December 31, 2015","true","51.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Donnelly, with his conflicts between what is right and what is dutiful, and the playing out of his character, will remain my "canon" forever. Yet I know that at several points I could have made decisions that drastically changed the canon and the character.\nI recommend this game, but with the caveat that you create a character as the story rolls on, and roleplay that character to make internally consistent decisions, rather than trying to get the best ending, at least for the first playthrough.","April 28","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
