"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TiffanyAK/recommended/260000/","TiffanyAK","TiffanyAK","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TiffanyAK/","1800 products in account","The game is fun, and definitely follows the YDKJ pattern, but the movie trivia does become only more dated and obscure with time, as even what were newer movies when the game was made are now decades old. Even if you're really into movies, you will still be lucky to get more than a handful of correct answers in a full game, despite the impression caused by the screenshots. This is especially true if you don't watch and rewatch classic films and the popular movies from the 70s, 80s, and 90s on a regular basis. It's still very good, and I definitely look forward to playing the multiplayer and hopefully letting others narrow down the answers a bit for me sometimes, but it seems fair to warn everyone that this is not the type of trivia game where one can reasonably expect to be really "good" at it. If you cannot have fun while being utterly clueless and guessing the wrong answers to silly questions, you will despise the game very quickly.","August 12, 2015","true","1.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I've watched probably close to 3000 movies in 3 decades but this particular YDKJ game is still quite hard. I wouldn't recommend it to a casual player, more for the super hardcore quiz / movie buffs.\n\nOn a note to the game itself, I'm pretty disappointed. There is no option to play full screen, no choice of screen resolution or similar. Looks crappy, it's a old game and to be expected. The commentator is funny for the most part but sometimes I'd rather just play than to listen to him.\n\nHate the fact that you always have to watch the intro which takes like a minute until you can actually play. There should be an option to skip the intro.\n\nVerdict: Good value game for hardcore quiz (movie) buffs. Terrible integration on steam as in no achievements, no nothing, no option for screen resolution etc. The "Millionaire" games may be better suited for the casual player.","December 23, 2013","true","0.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I usually enjoy trivia games. But never played a You Don't know Jack Games. The main problem i have with the game is the way the questions are asked. Instead of simply asking you who directed this and who was in that or what scene is this from. It has to ask you question in some nonsensical way. like "In the movie Airplane, Jimmy is asked if he has seen a grown man naked. Who would he see naked in the directors other movies". Its actually a trick question since that movie had 3 directors.  Also i got really annoyed by the narrator constant sarcasm. That alone gives me a reason not to play this again.","May 31, 2015","false","0.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I could play my original disc version, but Win 7 doesn't like Windows 3.1/95 games.  This have never been an easy game series to master.  The questions are often time quite difficult, and crazy (but that's the fun of it all).  It would have been nice it the host, Cookie, had continued through into the rest of the games, but he stepped down for another actor after this outting.  Everything about the first three Jack games are great.  The humor, the setting, the difficulty (which can ♥♥♥♥ you off at times since you come away saying to yourself, "Crap!  I knew that!  Why didn't I choose that answer!?"  Even the credits are hilarious with the fake commercials.  If you love quirky, fun and challenging trivia games, don't miss this or Volumes 1 (the Xtra Larged Edition) and 2, the Volume 4 - The Ride.  Skip Volume 3.  It got bad reviews back when it was first released.","May 4, 2015","true","0.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I bought the bundle pretty much the instant I saw that, at long last, the YDKJ games were available on Steam (well, some of them).\n\nYDKJ Movies was tough when I played it when it first came out, because I was pretty young and hadn't seen that many movies. Now it's still really tough, because the majority of movies I've seen came out since 1997 (or at least are fresher in my memory). I'm pretty good at trivia, so I never found any of the other YDKJ games difficult, but this one's still rough. Still, the humor and nostalgia more than make up for it, and getting questions wrong just means more opportunities for Cookie to hilariously insult me. I don't even mind.","May 9, 2015","true","3.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
