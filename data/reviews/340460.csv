"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rikame/recommended/340460/","rikame","rikame","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rikame/","818 products in account","Stealing Valve's graphical assets and then submitting your game with them inside is a next level strat.\n\nUpdate: My game got reset. That $0.99 I paid for coins (purely for this review's sake) is now gone and so are the coins and everything I spent them on. I reported this game to Steam for fraud. I suggest you all do the same.\n\nPoor graphics, poor audio assets, consistently poor translation and lag on a computer that is dozens of times powerful enough to run a game with this caliber aren't enough to entirely condemn this game. The gameplay can work (maybe a bit better on a touch screen) and it is moderately satisfying to play, but some very poor decisions destine this game for deletion.\n\nSpartans vs Zombies Defense is comparable to Battle Cats. You buy units and upgrades to defend your castle gate from waves of enemies and push forward to destroy their spawn. You can use items and cast abilities to aid your units or to harm the enemy. There are enough mechanics and upgrades to keep the game playble, perhaps all the way through the 60 waves provided.\n\nThe flaw with this game is that it is free to play with in-game transactions. They are not balanced. It begins to become horribly tedious to beat wave 10 without them and I imagine that it would take months of straight, active gameplay to get to wave 60 without them. The enemy/leveling system progresses in a way where they are necessary, and that's just cynical. The game would be much better if it had no microtransactions, had a balanced leveling system, and cost $2.50. It probably would have made a lot more money, too (I feel dirty for spending $0.99 to test the coins for the sake of this review).\n\nWhile I did say that this game had bad graphics, that can't even begin to describe just how bad they are. The icons for the castables are plagarized from DotA 2. I did not immediately realize that Magic Arrow was a colorized Starstorm (Mirana) icon or that Protection was a hue-shifted Time Walk (Faceless Void) icon, but the second that I unlocked Fiery Souls, I recognized it as the Shadowraze (Shadow Fiend) icon. I'm not sure if Wild Attack was stolen as well, but it is difficult to imagine otherwise. I'm certain that other assets were stolen as well - I doubt that the creators asked Gerard Butler or Warner Brothers for permission to slap his face on Leonidas, or on the game's banner, for that matter. I wish YFC luck on their legal endeavors.","January 6, 2015","false","2.3"," 951 of 989 people (96%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","96","951","989","14","13"

This game took the interface, the similar map layout and even the enemy models and used them for their own game, then copy and pasted sound files from the movie 300 into the game, which is copyright on both parts. The game was fun as a mobile game and you can even tell instantly if you're not familiar with the mobile game because the game's tutorial even says "touch the screen". The so-called "author" of this game didn't even care to write new control text for the game, rather than be lazy and just simply copy and paste. Many microtransactions are placed inside this game, which never makes a game enjoyable, but a way for a developer to gain more money from the player.

There is no real objective, other than to protect your castle and destroy the opponent's. One thing is clear while starting the game, it was meant for the mobile market. The gameplay only consists of you moving your character back and forth, collecting in-game silver and gold, and calling in reinforcements (ex: Swordsmen, pikemen, etc). Although the gameplay is utterly simple, it can prove somewhat fun. But going through the first couple of stages, it is oftly repetitive. Now there is a system of unlocks, where you may use your money to buy upgrades for units and even your castle, but they are not really necessary (perhaps the final stages are harder). Graphically this game is horrendus, I do not like the art style and it is very bland and plain-out ugly.

So, let's start with this. I usually don't review by topics of pros and cons, but I'll do it in this case because this game is so bad it doesn't deserve to have a review made out of beautifully coordinated English setences.\n\nPros:\n\n- Fairly easy achievements\n\nCons:\n\n- Soundtrack and other materials were taken without permission from the 300 franchise.\n- It's such a bad port from the mobile version that aks you to touch your screen and has absolutely no keyboard shortcuts.\n- The game is basically fighting the same waves of enemies in the same map and in the exact same way.\n- Has 3 endless modes that, as I understood, are not endless.\n- The animations are awful and the art is mediocre (Leonidas is a giant when compared to his soldiers)\n- The name of the game says it's Spartans vs. Zombies. Too bad this is just regular, undistinguishable soldiers that resemble roman soldiers more than spartan ones fighting waves of armored skeletons. SKELETONS. Not zombies.\n\nAlright, I think this is enough to let you know that you must not ever contaminate your library with this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ized game. If you want to grab the achievements, do it now (I haven't perfected it yet, but from what I saw it seems that it's doable fairly fast). Honestly, that's the only reason to touch this, so if you are not into achievement hunting, ignore this. I said to do it now because this may very well be removed very soon from the store due to copyright infringement. Mobile games reaching Steam are becoming more common. Some of them are quite good, but others are unworthy to even be downloaded. It's time for Valve to take action and prevent this kind of schemes that are succesful through the Steam Greenlight. So, to conclude, I give this abomination a score of 20 out of 100. Avoid it.","January 9, 2015","false","4.1"," 61 of 70 people (87%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","87","61","70","4","1"

It consists of a series of waves, which goes up until wave 60, with enemies attacking from the right side of the screen. The enemies are moving to the left side and trying to overrun your castle. The player moves Leonidas left and right with his mouse and when Leonidas and an enemy meet they start fighting. The aim is to defeat all enemies before they destroy the castle or kill Leonidas. The player accumulates silver over time which can be used to hire units to help defend the castle. They will move forward automatically to fight. Besides of the regular mode you can also play some endless mode (you have to unlock them by completing wave 60), it is the same like the regular mode but instead of waves you will have a timer.\nThe game is really boring, each wave plays like the wave before. After the first few waves everything the game has to offer has already been seen. There are microtransactions which let the player purchase coins with real money.\nThe game has the name Spartans Vs "Zombies" Defense but the enemies are all skeletons and not zombies.\nAnother poor aspect is that every complete sentence in the game is grammatically incorrect.\nIt could be possible that Spartans Vs Zombies Defense could be removed very soon from the store due to copyright infringement. Besides of the look of Leonidas from the movie 300, you can also hear music along with some sound effects right from the movie. Also the game has a very similar look to the mobile game Army of Darkness Defense.\nThe game is a complete waste of time. Hands away!\n\nSound -/10 (No rating because of the copyright infringement.)\nGraphic 2/10\nGameplay 1/10\nAtmosphere 1/10\n\nIf you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guides\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curation","January 16, 2015","false","2.7"," 53 of 63 people (84%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","84","53","63","13","0"

That did not seem like 300 at all. Until I noticed, this game is not based on anything at all, it's own "original" idea. This perplexed me as to why I see King Leonidas on the ♥♥♥♥ING THUMBNAIL. This game is obviously going to be short lived because these people are trying to market off a character that isn't even theirs (The reason I said trying is because the in-game tranasaction doesn't work for jack ♥♥♥♥), so yeah, bye bye Leonidas vs Not-Zombies. Moving on from lawsuits, let's dig in on the misleading store homepage.\n\nWhat the ♥♥♥♥ is happening in the trailer? I can't tell jack ♥♥♥♥ from what's going on due to the amount of chaos happening on screen. They also gave a swell demonstration of the main menu, critical gaming everyone. Other than that, the game just displays the same ♥♥♥♥ all the time. Only telling me about a repetitive style of gameplay. Now let's take a look at the description.\n\nLeonidas actually learned magic, very useful, very powerful, very funny.\n\nWow congrats, Leon, on your acceptance to ♥♥♥♥ING HOGWARTS. Alright, for a game about zombies, magic is a somewhat acceptable concept if the game isn't using the biohazard zombies such as Walking Dead or Left 4 Dead, these are more of Tales from the Crypt drowned zombies type ♥♥♥♥. Useful and powerful? Okay. Very Funny? I wouldn't say so, I don't see any comedic approach in this god-foresaken game.\n\n● A wide variety of allies to summon including swordsmen, Royal Guards, archers, witches and more.\n\nWell summoning is vital, yes. There seems to be no actual flaw here, except for Witches. Witches were a thing that started in the early Mesopotamian Era, but nowhere in history did any form of witches ally with Spartan warriors. Seems off because in this game they seem to be more of from the Dark Ages, which is waaay ahead of Spartan/Athenian times.\n\n● More flexible combination of tactics.\n\nWalking up to something and automatically attacking is not a flexible tactic.\n\n● Special supply system.\n\nI don't even know what this means.\n\n● 60 waves in classic mode, and after accomplished difficulty will increase.\n\nWell thanks for the info because just about EVERY GAME has the concept of increasing difficulty.\n\n● 3 kinds of endless mode, wilder, more fun.\n\nThis is just repetitive gameplay. Where's the fun?\n\n● Beautiful graphics, epic battle.\n\nThe graphics are infact NOT beautiful and makes me want to scoop my eyes out with a spoon made of barbed wire. The resolution is extremely low a Commodore 64 could probably run it faster than Sonic the Hedgehog. As you know the graphics are flat, and the characters look like Munchkins from Munchkinland. If they call this "beautiful", they would die from ♥♥♥♥ing so hard at Crysis. Oh, and the battles are dwarves fighting skeleton midgets with random, uncomprehnsible noises. Pretty epic if you ask me.\n\n\nNow we dig into the gameplay. So you launch the game, it says something about, I ♥♥♥♥ you not, the developer not returning to his wife. So i'm looking forward to seeing how a zombie apocolypse started in Sparta and what do I get?\n\n"Bla bla bla FIGHT!"\n\n............OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHH. I ♥♥♥♥ you not, again, DIRECT dialogue from the game. The devs were so lazy, they couldn't think of a simple storyline for the game! Anyways, moving on, there is no start menu, it drops you RIGHT in. Unprepped. (With an audio clip ripped DIRECTLY from 300.) A lot of this game reeks of mobile port because of the graphics and how some reminiscent "touch" control tutorials are prominent. So you play as... who else but Leonidas, the main character of 300, again, a reason to sue. Clcik to move, not going to complain, a lot of games do that. Moving on to enemies, they aren't even classified as Zombies. When the general topic of zombies show up, you think of shambling corpses, bloody and decaying, or a mutated human being with unimaginable deformities and covered in blood. And what does this game give? The model skeleton in your biology classroom, only armed with a shield and bat. Pathetic, oh and living gargoyles which aren't even close to zombies. It doesn't seem like a zombie apocolypse at all, seems more like a "Hell on Earth" type conflict, like Doom, except it looks like it was made by a twelve year old.\n\n\nOverall, this game is repetitive, eyesoring, boring, and the devs obviously had no idea what they were doing. This game belongs with Steam's other shovelware, Cid the Dummy and Bad Rats, in the trash. Oh and should be brutally sued and shut down for using SO MUCH STOLEN ♥♥♥♥ from 300.\n\nI hope this game gets removed from the library, I don't know how or why it was greenlit, but surely someone behind greenlight was drunk.","January 10, 2015","false","0.1"," 46 of 57 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","46","57","0","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Official_KwS/recommended/340460/","Official_KwS","KidwithSmurf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Official_KwS/","827 products in account","The first time I saw the name of this game, “Spartan vs Zombie defense,” I got excited as I love defense style games thanks to custom defenses in Warcraft. But I digress, the game itself has many good and bad points and I’ll explain them soon.\n\nFirstly before I do get into the points, I want to point out that after you’ve played a few rounds or even look at the pictures advertising the game on Steam... That the game is named wrongly. They call it Spartans VS Zombies... When in fact the game actually uses Skeleton sprites and not Zombies... Like they could be Zombies but to me well, no, just no.\n\nNow onto the Positives and Negatives.\n\nPositives:\n\n♦ Unlockable Modes,\n♦ Unlockable Spells,Units, Items and Upgrades etc\n♦ Easy but time consuming Achievements\n♦ Easy Concept\n♦ Great UI\n♦ Awesome Range of Units to Verse\n♦ Awesome Character, Army, Castle and Item Skill upgrade menu\n♦ Micro-transactions are optional and doesn't force you to buy anything\n♦ Spells can level up (Casting them without purchasing upgrades for them)\n♦ Fast loading between rounds\n♦ Endless Modes are a good concept (However, implemented wrongly)\n\nNegatives:\n\n♦ Graphics (Most of the graphics and sounds are copyright from 300 or the likes)\n♦ Can be pay to win (This would be a once off Micro transaction of $25, Really expensive for a Micro transaction)\n♦ Minimal Options (Only music and sound check boxes with no control setup, resolution, graphics etc)\n♦ Poor Mobile Device Port (Says, touchscreen to move, tap to summon etc)\n♦ Alt+Tab doesn't take you to desktop (It pauses the game on screen)\n♦ Pressing ESC in game gives you the option to quit only (No way back to main menu, you have to click a pause icon and then hit quit to get to main menu again)\n♦ Point & Click but not advertised as a Point & Click\n♦ Micro-transactions (Makes the already simple and pointless game pay to win)\n♦ No way to map controls to A and D or Left and Right arrows to move (Must use Mouse whole game)\n♦ No way to keybind units or spells (Again really annoying as you have to click everything)\n♦ Hardly get any coins per game, compared to buying them through micro-transaction option\n♦ Game seems really slow paced\n♦ No Steam Trading Cards (Could have easily included some)\n♦ Repetitive after about the 10th round (Also if you don't buy Micro transaction gold for upgrades, the levels are really repetitive due to having to do the same one over and over again to get enough gold to upgrade enough to be able to beat that level)\n♦ No incentive to replay the campaign (There is harder difficulty unlocked for campaign once you beat the 60 waves, but why re-do campaign again when you can do endless?)\n♦ Endless mode has no Global Steam Highscores\n♦ Clicking and Moving can lag sometimes and not register\n♦ Unbalanced units (A group of enemy's could barely hurt me whilst one Archer could kill me in a few shots and all I needed was Calvary upgraded to win.)\n♦ Upgrade menu for units on Towers has wrong upgrade symbol when purchasing (Tells me I'm upgrading the units health when they can't die or be attack)\n♦ Seems way too easy (Get to a point where you out way the enemies in strength hands down and never lose)\n♦ Items and Potions seem pointless outside of Endless Mode (Can easily win most levels without using or buying any, they'd just speed things up)\n♦ If you get stuck on a later level you pretty much have to buy micro-transaction gold to pass (This is because you get no gold for dying, only what you've picked up during the wave, I died numerous times on wave 60 and things cost over 20k to upgrade...)\n♦ No Story or Cutscenes (Other than the lame 5 second one at the start)\n♦ Nothing happens when beating the final wave (Taken to main menu and told campaign just got harder in difficulty)\n♦ No way to tell how long you've been in endless mode after you've died\n\nOverall, the game is free, poorly ported from Mobile as it acts and talks as though you are playing on a mobile device... it still runs 100% smoothly, is fun for about the first 5 to 10 rounds in campaign and then it became really boring and repetitive. Plus you know a game is bad if they call it a Zombie Defense and not have any Zombies in it... Though on another point, the laggyness of moving, the small amount of gold received to upgrade and the unbalanced units start to get to you. Eventually, if you make it to the end of the first playthrough of the campaign, you’ll unlock endless modes. These aren’t even worth unlocking as there is no highscores to compare how well you’ve done even with yourself little own your friends, the world or Steam Users. I guess I’m glad this is free as I’d not recommend this to anyone, not even to play it on a phone/tablet where it should have stayed.\n\nAlso why does this game have soo much copyrighted material in it that it doesn’t have licenses for and yet asks you to pay for micro-transactions? To me this game is one big flop with a law suit waiting to happen.\n\nOn another note, answer me this... Why would anyone pay for a game that you can’t verse others or even have a global highscore? Seems pointless if you can’t show off what you’ve paid for in some way to someone.\n\nFinal Rating: If you are extremely bored, want to laugh at poor development and or cringe at what could have been a good game, then this is for you!","January 30, 2015","false","4.7"," 30 of 37 people (81%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","81","30","37","3","0"

Graphics are beyond awful, animations are slow, clunky and boring (Pikemen just sort of wave the pike around as an 'attack'), most of the art assests are terrible and some are incredibly pixelated, the title says 'zombies' but the game contains only skeletons, there are no keyboard controls with the exception of 'Esc' which exits the game - Though of course this isn't mentioned anywhere.\n\nThe player's character auto-attacks so the player has remarkably little input other than moving forwards and backwards and ordering in new troops - Which itself is very dull as the 'economy' consists of waiting for a few seconds until  a new soldier can be afforded. There are incredibly few sound assets, so the same ones are used over and over again, and they are of terrible quality. The game progression is functional, but lacks anything to commend it.\n\nIn short, this would be an awful game on a mobile device - On a PC it is outright unforgivable.","January 11, 2015","false","0.2"," 22 of 26 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","22","26","0","0"

The Zombies within the game aren't really zombies unless I haven't played the game long enough, they seemed like skeletons.\n\nOverall I rate the game a 5/10, there are small features that give the game potential BUT whilst this happens there are many small flaws that could definitely be worked on.\n\n5/10 for a 'casual' Defense Game.","January 7, 2015","false","0.3"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

Yeah, I typed couple.\n\nOnce you unlock the the "I Win" powerup known as the Boulder, you're set. Really. I guess I don't need to spend my hard-earned money after all! (why would you even pay for this i don't even)\n\nAnyway, just use said boulder at the start of the level, and it'll wreck the "portal" that allows these foul spawns of darkness to flow in. Supposedly. I mean the enemies themselves are clearly coming out of a cave that is behind said portal, but I'm no Gerard Butler! I wasn't there when the spartans came up with their secret weapon, knights clad in medieval-era armor to fight off the Persia-I mean zombies.\n\nMan the 300 franchise did go in a different crazy route OHWAIT THEY DON'T OWN THE RIGHTS IN THE FIRST PLACE. Yet they're charging for it.\n\nThe game cheats by the way. Even with pretty much every upgrade you can think of, good luck surviving the 10 minute challenge unless you have a bazillion boulders. Then just spam that the whole time. Yeah, even if you were brain-addled enough to pay for this, the game wouldn't really get easier anyway.\n\nI guess enjoy it while it lasts? I think it'll get removed from Steam at some point, so keep it installed if you'd like to experience the zombie apocalypse in make-believe Sparta.\n\nSo to recap: Not only did they make a terrible game, they forgot to adapt it to the PC, with leftovers such as "press the touch screen!", their microtransaction system doesn't really give you an edge, and in their first version didn't even work properly, so you couldn't even pay them if you wanted to (so the Pay2Win model fails there too), they are a lawsuit in the making, and they have King Leonidas.

There's still time, but if we wait for too long, the sickness will surely spread to the rest of the store, and our beloved Computer Game Heaven will become Computer Game Hell.\n\nThe hardest part of making this review was to actually get the 5 mins of playtime that Steam demands that you've got to publish a review. I managed to play it for 3 mins, and then I had it in the background, which also "generated" play time. Note that it's enough to play this game for one single minut - if even that - to write an accurate review. The game is so incredibly repetive that you've actually experienced almost everything just by playing one minute.\n\nI know that this originally a mobile game, but I don't see why I would ever play it on a mobile. It's terrible even compared to a lot of mobile games.\n\nSo let me explain why this game is a curse, an abonimation, a plague and any other negative word you can come up with.\nI'm gonna do this in point form, just because...\n\n1.

This means that you can't change whether it should be in windowed or fullscreen mode, and you can't change resolution.\n\n3. As I said/wrote, the gameplay is extremely repetive. You just go back and forward, auto-atttack and sometimes use an ability or upgrade stuff. It's also (almost) entirely mouse-driven. I didn't use the keys for anything, except ESC when I wanted to quit the game.\n\n4. The graphics... *vomits*\n\n5. The sound... *vomits again*\n\n6.

So I tried it. And I still think its bad. The grammar is terrible, the gameplay is boring, and everything has cleave. Which takes away the whole point of the game. In most lane defense type games you send your troops in DIFFERENT lanes and have to use strategy. In the ones with only one lane then you should have a lot of different types of troops so there is some degree of strategy.  This game does neither. The options menu is devoid of anything. You can toggle sound and music and that's it. And they didn't even bind anything to anything. On iOS that would make sense, as it's touch screen. On PC? I have this keyboard full of buttons that could do something, and yet they don't. In short this game is boring, and unimaginitive. Age of War is much better.

To justify my statement I'll point out a few issues I've noticed in the time I played.  I played for just short of an hour but it was all I could stomach and in that time I noticed a few glaring problems.\n\nAesthetic: The first thing that occured to me was that the enemies for the first 10 "waves" had NO Zombies in.  I see TWO total in the advertising screen-shots.  ALL the enemies are differently armoured versions of Skeletons.  The Game also uses the exact same background in every single wave which made me realise that Spartans didn't live in Castles!  But that's enough of the aesthetic gripes.\n\nThe mechanics: NO KEYBOARD CONTROLS!  Everything in this game requires the mouse to click and all the appropriate buttons are at the extreme corners of the screen making moving "Leonidas" around AND using his abilities AND buying your army a complete hastle.  There's also the little problem that you can actually walk THROUGH the enemies but Leonidas can't attack the other way, so there's an irritating moment where you run one way to pick up resources and then you have to run to catch up so you can attack again.\n\nThe Options: Virtually non-existant.  You can turn off Music and Sounds but there are no graphics options (As if you'd need them, this game would probably run on a toaster!).  There's no option for Windowed, it's always in full screen and there are no resolution options AT ALL.  There's also a little thing that happens, if you press "Esc" to get to the "Exit" menu and press "Esc" again, it'll bring up ANOTHER "Exit" menu every time you press it, so if you frantically tap "Esc" to try and skip something it'll bring up a half-dozen menus for you to close.\n\nThe Elephant in the Room: COPYRIGHT!  These developers have NEVER heard of it.  Virtually every aspect of this game has been stolen from somewhere else.  The game itself is a blatant reskin of the Army of Darkness: Defence by Backflip Studios, I recognise most of the skeleton growls and noises from Terraria and the advertising poster is a complete copy of the "300" movie poster and various audio clips from the "300" have been used, obviously without permission from Warner Bros.\n\nWhatever you do, do NOT give these people your money!  DO NOT go for their micro-transactions!  All it will do is fund their enevitable lawsuit when they get slapped (soon, I hope).","January 7, 2015","false","0.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It was a very fun game, I enjoyed it :) . For people who have not played the game yet, it is a pretty simple tower defense game where you have to defend a castle gate from advancing enemies which come through a portal. By defeating enemies, the player is rewarded with gold that can be spent between levels to level up the main character, Leonidas, level up the abilities of Leonidas and level up the gate, towers, and armies. I liked the fact that I could level up lots of things. And the zombies were really fun to fight against. The last achievements were a bit difficult to get. I really enjoyed this game and I recommend it. It's also completely free, the only thing that costs money in it is if you want to buy in game gold for faster upgrades, but I finished it without them so it's really completely free and you have nothing to lose. You'll enjoy at least a few fun hours if you like simple games, tower defense games, or the Spartans :).","May 21, 2015","true","12.9"," 5 of 29 people (17%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","17","5","29","2","0"

That's why EA is loved by so many of us (EA didn't produce this, but they do microtransactions alot). Next, the gameplay is next level, reinventing the industry by storm. Lastly, this game is one of the most skill-based games I have ever seen or played, (can't wait to see it played at Esports level) for example, you can't read the tool tips for skills ingame, which drastically increases the mechanical and memory skills, overall, I think this is a solid 12/10.

Download it before it gets taken down for infringement of all the copyright, turn off auto updates so they can't tweak it to make the microstore worthwhile and play it when you just want something quick and casual.\n\n5/10 -Not great but fun enough for an hour, maybe two.

It's something simple for me to play when I just want to kill some time and don't want to play anything that requires alot of attention. Heck it's more then simple! All you need to do is use the left mouse button and that's it! The attacks happen automatically which lowers mouse spamming, though you'll do alot of it when using the special moves or spawnning help. I only have two real gripes with this game: A Windowed mode would be nice cause, personally, I'm not a fan of playing on fullscreen mode. The other gripe I have is the in-game purchases with real world cash. To me, I was able to buy a good bit of the stuff in the store without resorting to the store. Granted, I never use real-world cash for in-game purchases (I hate playing like that), but seeing how easy it is to purchase most of the in-game items with the coins you collect in game, maybe the devs should remove the Buying X Amount Of Coins for X Amount Of Cash and maybe have the store there to buy cosmetic items that reqiure you to spend actual dollars on. I do still recommend this game to anyone with time to kill and just want something simple to download and play. It doesn't take up alot of hard drive space so there's a plus there!","January 8, 2015","true","0.9"," 2 of 51 people (4%) found this review helpful","4","2","51","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Callomac/recommended/340460/","Callomac","Callomac","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Callomac/","1924 products in account","I am not sure why this game gets so much hate. It is, as others have said, a clone of Army of Darkness Defence (which isn't available on PC), and is a mobile port. The main complaint people have is that It may use assets from other games/movies, but that's for the owner's of those assets to decide. I actually liked the game quite a bit, though it is repetitive, and not very deep. I liked Army of Darkness Defense, and this is basically the same game. And it is free.\n\nThe game is basically a side scrolling action/strategy game. Your hero character has to defend your castle against waves of enemies. In each level you have to balance buying upgrades for your tower (just increased gold production) with buying units to help you defend against the enemy waves. Between levels you can spend earnee gold on upgrades to your hero, units, castle, or spells. The upgrades have a huge effect on how tough you are, until they cap out at level 10. If you die during a level, you keep the gold you earned during that level, but don't get the win bonus. If the levels are too hard, a few tries is usually enough to earn the gold needed to upgrade something and make the level easier. I made it to level 40 with just a couple deaths, but then the game got quite tough. The startegy in the game is in deciding which units to upgrade, and which units to buy (and when to buy them) during each level. It's not real deep, but I quite enjoyed it.\n\nThe game is free to play. You can buy gold in the game with real money, but I can't imagine why you would want or need to. I earned gold plenty fast enough to make it to level 40 without much trouble, though the game started getting pretty tough after that, mainly because I maxed out the stats on my favorite units. I'll have to start diversiying my unit unage more, and play a bit smarter, if I am going to actually beat the game. I plan to play it more and try to beat it. I think there are 60 levels in the game (the top achievement is for beating 60 levels). and at some point you unlock some endless modes, but I haven't unlocked them yet.\n\nMy conclusion: It's a mobile port with repetitive gameplay, but also quite a lot of fun.\n\nOne small grumble - there is no control for sound volume. I could turn the music off, but turning the sound off didn't work.","January 8, 2015","true","4.3"," 3 of 54 people (6%) found this review helpful","6","3","54","0","1"

It rips off other games in its genre without messing up what makes them fun to play, unlike Dungeon of the Endless.\n\nI can critique the stolen art assests, ripped off music or the god awful translation all I want but the bottom line is this, you have to pay to get your game on steam even if your game is free. Clearly enough people are spending money within the games cash shop to allow this game to not only continue to exist but have even made it this far in the first place.\nThis game isn't at fault, you are if you are spending money in its cash shop.\nAnd you will, won't you, you filthy casual!\n\nYou start out as all these games do, extremely powerful. You lead Leonidas ripped from the movie 300 complete with ripped soundbytes against a mindless zerg army of SKELETONS (not a zombie in sight, by the way) and as all these types of games go you click to send out your units who will march to the other end of the screen mindlessly until they are dead or you destroy the enemy portal. Game over occours when you lose your portal.\n\nAs usual with these kind of games you will rapidly start fighting against armies you have no chance against but if you need a little help...That's right, just open your wallet, thats a good goy!\nAs far as games go I really hate to admit it but I have played worse than this.\n\nThe game is typical Tower Defense fanfare. You need to not let your tower get smashed while trying to kill the enemy. You have the usual array of tanky swordsmen, weakling archers who attack from a safe distance, pikemen who oddly hit hard but are as squishy as archers, calvary who are tanky as swordsmen but move fast and hit twice as hard and so on and so forth, balance is a bit of an issue.\n\nThe enemy army progresses faster than you do coming at you both with absurd numbers and stronger units than you have access too but your ace in the hole is Leonidas whom has access to spells and abilities that can turn a fight to your advantage...If he has enough mana to do so. Which surprisingly, he often does despite the cash shop selling mana potions.\n\nOn that note the cash shop is there and the game is quite 'challenging' (read: enemy swarm) but I made it pretty far just fine without ever feeling like I hit the infamous "cash wall*" so despite the really poor presentation the game is playable and as far as tower defense games go, this game offers nothing new but at the same time it offers a good experience (for what it is) despite being freemium.\n\n*a point in the game that is impossibe to progress past without grinding or spending cash money\n\nJoin Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needs\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews","January 6, 2015","true","5.1"," 26 of 260 people (10%) found this review helpful","10","26","260","0","0"
