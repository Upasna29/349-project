I thought i would give it a go as i used to quite like snooker.\nGlad i did as it's a very fun and polished little game. It is very easy to pick up and play for someone like me that knows the rules of snooker and have played it a bit but am also a pretty rubbish player:)\nThere are lots of tournaments to enter and credits to be won. You can then spend them on upgrades, different cues, auto-chalk and the like. The AI is pretty good, doesn't cheat and does make mistakes. Obviously it gets better the further you get in a tourny but the difficutly is nicely curved.\nThe graphics are good as are the sound effects. A special mention goes to the crowd. They ohh and ahhh when you miss and pot a difficult shot you'll be met with a cheer. You'll even hear them cry 'go on my son' and cough. And too much noise will be met with a shhh from the ref.\n\nIf you like snooker even a bit you will enjoy this game. It's addictive and fun. I recommend picking it up on sale at least. Oh and it has pool too.","June 8, 2014","true","22.2"," 54 of 65 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","54","65","0","4"

The AI has no concept of shot selection either - in one example, the computer opponent had potted a red and ended up in the jaws of the middle pocket, completely unable to see pink and black. He them promptly nominated black (despite having an easy blue he could drop in to the opposite middle) and proceeded to play the cue ball directly into the jaw of the middle pocket, sending it careering around the table and missing everything. This happened 3 times in a row, at which point I was awarded the frame. Laughably bad.\n\nMichaela Tabb, bless her heart. She's a good referee and a likable character on the Snooker and Pool circuit, but there's no visual representation of her in-game at all; she's been reduced to a disembodied voice with about as much emotion in her tone as GLaDOS in Portal. In some instances, the game doesn't even get the scores right - on more than one occasion, I've potted a red, followed by a pink (for a break of 7), only for the game to proudly announce that I'm on a break of 6. The only thing stopping poor Michaela from turning in her grave is that she isn't actually dead.\n\nSending the cue-ball in-off is a common occurrence, but one that seemingly happens at random, completely irrespective of how careful or otherwise you're playing. There is no consistency with shot power, with a 100% power shot sending the cue ball all the way around the table twice, but a 40% power shot is rarely enough to even pot the black off its spot.\n\nAnimations of the crowd clapping are horribly and obviously looped, the player character is never seen and has no character model, so you can forget about character customisation aside from the name, and the opposing player is only ever seen sat down at the side of the table while you make your break. Obviously it was too much to ask to animate a model of someone walking around a snooker table and playing a shot.\n\nIf you want a good snooker game on the PC, avoid this and buy Virtual Pool 4, which has a fantastic snooker game mode.","May 9, 2015","false","28.7"," 28 of 31 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","28","31","2","2"

Over the past few years I've found my enjoyment from online game iSnooker, but the high price and lack of improvements in that game have meant I've given up on it forever. So, having given International Snooker a couple of long sessions, where does it stand on the scale? Unfortunately, a far, far way from the top.\n\nThe interface for thisg ame is just poor beyond words. You can only cycle through frames, for example, by clicking on the field through all the options and if you go past the option yuo want, you have to click all the way through again to get to where you want. An option to just cycle up AND down would have been an obvious choice here. The menus are like this for everything and quickly become frustrating. Furthermore, most game modes are locked from the beginning and can only be unlocked by winning tournaments, so if you're keen to play pool more than snooker, you're going to have to play a lot of snooker for the privilege.\n\nThe gameplay itself does not fare much better. The camera options are limited to overhead and table level, which is pretty standard, but during a shot you have no control and the AI picks the most awkward angles to show the shots from. Pots that would be impossible in real life - and would indeed not even be attempted by the top pros - can be pulled off with ease here whilst the AI play is erratic at best. Black off the spot? Not if a thin cut pink to the green pocket that offers worse position for the next red is there for the taking. Of course that doesn't matter, as an equally outrageous red will then be pulled off the AI, who will then miss a simple black off the spot in what is a real Jekyll and Hyde display. Perhaps the pink up to baulk was the right shot after all?\n\nThe whole thing just feels like a huge step backwards from the games that have come before it. This is tedious, processional snooker at its most basic and uninspiring, and a game I simply can't find any reason to recommend to anyone.","August 20, 2014","false","2.0"," 25 of 35 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","25","35","2","0"

But there a few things to note. First off you are probably going to want to leave the aiming guides turned on. This isn't cheating, it just compensates for the lack of depth perception that is inherent in virtual pool games, at least until there is a version that uses the oculus. If you stick to playing in first person it gives a fairly realistic feel and balance to the game. If you turn them off then you end up playing nearly every shot from the overhead camera view which makes if feel like an 8-bit arcade game. Also lining up the shots in the overhead view without the guides is so frustrating that you'll find yourself moving your head to strange angles and spending a few minutes on every shot to try and find the right line, only to miss by an inch or two anyway. Changing to the overhead view at all could be considered cheating but it is the only way to get a overview of the layout since you can't walk around the table while playing, something that I found lacking. There are also shots where the pool cue completely obstructs the view while in first person, which is odd since a little tranparency would have been an easy fix here. Changing to the overhead view is a must in this case.\n\nTo play you set the desired spin, cue angle and power level before clicking on a button to fire the shot. A mouse driven cue and power action is sorely missed here. Coupled with the guides it takes nearly all of the interactive feel of the game away. However, since spin, power and cue ball placement are so important in the game of snooker it still has its merits as a tactical game or training aid.\n\nAs mentioned in other reviews, the AI is inconsitent because they will play poorly for half a game and then trot out a break of 50 or more at the end. I also feel guilty when snookering the opponent since in many cases they will miss, at least in the early stages of a tournament, and it is so easy to force them to replay the shot and win the frame by default after the third miss. They simply don't change the shot they attempted the first time.\n\nI'd recommend the game to anyone with a passion for snooker but I'd be raving about the game if these points were addressed. As it stands I'll just have to repeat that it is a good game with a fair price and great graphics.","December 15, 2014","true","12.1"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

There is no tutorial to hold your hand here, much to my regret. That having been said, the 'difficulty' of this game is considerably higher than that of Pool Nation [edit: corrected by markie].\n\nI won't bother going over the rules for Snooker (if you're seeing this, you have internet) but will comment that the interface in International Snooker allows for a great deal of precision. You also get options for 9-ball and 8-Ball. The practice mode is helpful for getting the initial gameplay down as well. My only gripe here, which is NOT the game's fault, is Snooker's pace-- the game moves a lot slower than 9-Ball.\n\nAll in all, this is a fair game... but if you aren't playing it Specifically For Snooker then Pool Nation is the better buy for a number of reasons.

It most certainly isn't the most fun snooker/pool/billiards game I've ever played.\n\nSnooker games, by default, are always a little bit slow and can be a little boring at times but there are many ways to speed things up considerably and/or create a little more immersion than just looking at a cue and a bunch of balls for the entirety of the game.\n\nSome of those things could be (none of these are implemented in this game but have been in other, earlier games in the same genre):\n\nImmersion\n- Showing the players during, but at least before they start the match. They get introduced, wave at the crowd, receive a bit of applause and so forth.\n- Showing the players after winning a frame or match: are they affected by that respotted black game?\n- Getting a maximum break in a tournament. In real life, you'll see players crying, getting congratulations from everybody including the opponent, receiving paychecks and what not. In this game, you'll get a message once the frame finishes: "You made a maximum break. Brag about it on Facebook". That's it.\n- The thrill of winning a tournament. Surely, a bit more than looking at a rotating cup is not too much to ask?\n\nBut, since most of its predecessors did not have any immersion like that either, maybe this game will make up for it in the fluid gameplay? Because with fluid, exiting gameplay you'd still have a solid billiards game. Unfortunately, no:\n\n- When playing against the AI, your opponent will have some sort of "I'm going to make a 26 break now" mindset. So what he'll do is make 7 shots in a row, some of them near impossible because his shot selection can be awful at times. Then he'll miss a really simple shot, probably because he reached the quota he was looking for. Not something you'd expect from "the most realistic Snooker game" if you ask me.\n- The game should find the ball I most likely will try to pot next. Instead, it will default to some awkwardly placed ball on the cushion, forcing you to do way too much manually.\n- Which brings me to the next point: it's too hard to aim. The mouse is too sensitive, and there's no "fine tune aim" button.\n- Instead, to fine tune you'll need to adjust the camera. And adjusting the camera will need a click on the camera icon. Why are no shortcut keys implemented? Why not make use of the middle of right mouse button? That is just plain lazy. It's like they never even played their own game.\n\nSo because of various reasons, taking a shot will take way too long. Resulting in a very tedious exercise, a single frame will take you a long time. Then take into account that to win a single tournament, you'll need to win a best of 3 games, then two best of 5 games, then a best of 7 game, and last but not least a best of 9 game. Now, after several hours of tedious play you get to claim your reward: the visual of a spinning cup. Rock! Just 11 more tournaments of exactly the same to go! However, I am almost certain most people will not even reach the point of winning a single tournament.\n\nThere are some good things about the game, like the stuff you can buy with upgrade points (different chalk to get more spin on the ball, different cues to be able to hit harder etc) but to get to these rewards you'll need to grind endlessly.\n\nSince this is the only Snooker game on Steam, I'll probably end up playing it some more but I cannot recommend it to anyone.\nInstead, look for Pool Nation. It's just pool but literally everything has been done better in that game.\n","October 21, 2014","false","6.2"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","2"

It involves colored balls of various points and the object is to have the most points at the end, not to sink the last ball. If you're used to International Pool, this game might be a bit of a rude awakening since mistakes are far more costly, but if you're a Snooker fan or willing to learn how to play this game can be an enjoyable experience. The presentation is very beautiful and the physics are realistic, all the way down to chalking cues.\n\nIt should be noted that International Snooker has more than just Snooker. After completing your first tournament you can easily unlock 8-Ball, UK 8-Ball and 9-Ball modes to play with which gives you more modes and ways to play with than Pool Nation. Speaking of Pool Nation, a Snooker DLC is said to be in the works for that game, but if you can't wait for that, this game is most definitely worth picking up.","June 13, 2014","true","12.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

It's fun, but not without it's flaws.  I had to forfeit a match after scratching on a shot where the cue ball would not return to the table, so the game could proceed.   In this game if you have not played it, you earn credits to upgrade your cue, get different couloured chalk, etc.   I spent my credits on the auto-chalk feature, where the computer is supposed to chalk your cue before each shot.   I started failing on a lot of shots, and attributed the problem to not manually chalking my cue, even though | had this feature.\n\nThe ability to fine tune your shot would be enhanced if you could use a key stroke to fine tune the angle, rather than just adjusting the mouse.   Sometimes it's two or three minutes to get where you want to position the cue.\n\nLastly, this is an individual game, I am vain enough that | don't want anyone messing with my statistics.   It would have been nice if they could have added a feature where you could create other players, for friends to try the game.   You cannot lower the amount of frames played if you play 8 or 9 ball, every time you tap the button the frame count goes up.\n\nIt's fun, but I am glad I only paid $1.39.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/WskOsc/recommended/299500/","WskOsc","WskOsc","http://steamcommunity.com/id/WskOsc/","1276 products in account","The following review is taken from Whiskey Reviews (http://wskosc.blogspot.co.uk).\n\nInfo:\nPlatform: PC\nRelease Date: 11 January 2013\nDeveloper: Big Head Games\nPublisher: KISS ltd\nWhere to get it: Steam\nPrice: Around £9.99\n\nSnooker is one of those great British passtimes that's perhaps not as well appreciated as its more fun-loving cousin Pool. Snooker is a game of thinking two moves ahead, calculating angles and ball travel and executing the perfect shot to ensure you stay in the lead over your equally cunning opponent. It's kind of like if chess had big red balls and a stick.\n\nInternational Snooker is all of those things and none of those things. It's like someone handed the task of creating a Snooker simulator to a bunch of aliens that don't understand what makes the sport great, or what makes a game good for that matter. I can't bring myself to hate the game, for every glaring flaw in every single aspect of the game I still can't get angry at it. It feels more like a dog with no legs that's bitten you, you should get angry but look at its adorable eyes, it's trying so hard despite everything wrong.\nActually no, ♥♥♥♥ that. Today we're going to rip into International Snooker for the piece of ♥♥♥♥ that it is.\n\n\nRight from the moment you boot up the game you're greeted by ugly menu screens and an options menu that doesn't respond to anything but the left click. Pausing the game with the escape key requires you to click one of the menu options to do anything rather than the standard of hitting escape to continue.\nThe options are sparse and I'm not even sure anything other than the resolution options did anything but playing in anything less than maximum resolution resulted in the dull grey boxes looking like Leatherface's razor blades and about as appealing.\nGetting into a match doesn't make the UI any better either. There's no analogue controls other than turning your aim left and right and everything is accomplished through clicking buttons and moving sliders around. There's a slider for shot power, a circular slider for where to hit the ball, another slider for cue angle and a button that you have to press every couple of shots to manually chalk your cue. It sounds fine in theory but the dull little lifeless swish sound you have to endure without any animation whatsoever every time you click it makes you acutely aware that a second of your life has just ticked away and you'll never get it back.\nThe lack of analogue interaction has sucked all the soul out of playing. Clicking the big white circle that's supposed to represent the cue ball is just cold and impersonal in an age of analogue controllers and mice. Setting the power with a slider rather than actually making a shooting motion with the mouse or an analogue stick to set the power organically feels like you've got some kind of perfect shot cheat mode activated, especially if you have the shot guide turned on to show what directions the balls will go.\n\nIt's not just the UI that's bad, there are so many other problems with the presentation.\nPretty much everyone can picture the up-close texture of baize, the way it kind of has little lines in and manages to look both fluffy and smooth at the same time. Imagine the wonderful texture of it against your hand as you support the cue for a critical shot. Hold that image in your mind's eye, then chuck it out and imagine the look of soggy corrugated cardboard, the kind of cheap ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cardboard that's practically see-through. International Snooker's tables look like they've been topped with a thin coating of Soylent Green.\nEqually offensive is the announcer. A soft female voice of indeterminate Scottish or Irish descent that sounds like they've overdosed on valium and are reading out numbers while waiting for death. You know you're onto a winner with your announcer when the players can hear their equal parts desperation for a paycheck and boredom at reading a script of numbers. Listening to the announcer read our your score after every shot is like staring into the abyss of soul crushing depression, or living in Glasgow.\nOn a lighter tone the audience at least seems to have a bit of sass. Despite looking like a bunch of papier mache abominations they show a surprising amount of personality; remaining stoically silent while I scored 60 points shot after shot until at last a single member of the crowd had the audacity to clap. If the world of International Snooker were a real place I'm sure the clapee had been dragged off and quietly suffocated with Jim Davidson's ball sack. This would be fine and well if the developers hadn't gone out of their way to make sure the player feels like a ♥♥♥♥ by having the audience go wild when the AI pots a single red ball from an inch away.\n\nI've already talked a lot about the graphics and sound so I'll keep this brief. This is a game where the carpets have a more detailed texture than the cue and a sandblasted ♥♥♥ cheek could produce a more convincing reflection than the balls. The texture of which is just a flat, matte colour that makes it look like the balls are sliding around rather than rolling.\nNot chalking your cue every couple of shots results in an outright offensive sound effect that's like the suspension of a Robin Reliant giving way to the most depressing dogging session in recorded history in addition to your shot being less accurate and powerful. There's audio that indicates the chalk is wearing off but just like the rest it's so depressing and uninteresting that it tends to get lost in the big sucking pit of crappiness.\n\nOverall International Snooker is a functional simulation of the game but not a good one. It's graphically passable but it's the kind of game you give to someone when you want to drive them into a spiral of depression, alcoholism, self destructive tendencies and finally a crippling, fatal drug addiction culminating in getting shanked in a Pool hall by Shady Joe because they tried to hustle him for money to feed their coke habit.\nIt's like an anti-snooker PSA in game form. It destroys any love for the sport you may have while eroding your will to live with every frame.\n\nScore: 2 out of 10 Samaritans volunteers have been called by International Snooker players.","August 26, 2014","false","2.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The menus are a mess, and the tables lack any sort of subtle control. I should not have to dig super deep into my cueball and slam into it just to get draw, but according to this game there is no such animal as a two-inch screwback at low pace. The nine-ball and eight-ball are terrible, the tables feel so bizarre and floaty that they cease to be any fun. I'm not particularly opposed to the AI pulling off ridiculous shots constantly, because with the medium it is equally as easy to pull off superhero shots yourself, but there is no real interesting game here - especially when compared to its off-Steam contemporaries like Virtual Pool 4 or the WSC Real series. This isn't an awful game, and it is miles better than the dreadful Total Pool on Steam, but it's also not really great and if you're looking for a good pool game, there are better options.","February 9, 2015","false","12.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Every option such as number frames you can only move forwards, there is no way to go backwards when you select things. Also, the arrow keys do not work whatsoever on the menus. I'm very disappointed by this game and I'm glad I got it in a bundle. To select a set of 1 game instead of 3 I had to click like 50 times to get through EACH FRAME OPTION, it goes up really high and there's no way to click back. The interface is a dog, there's no real good tutorial to teach you how to play snooker...\n\nThen we get to playing the game: The graphics are an absolute joke. It looks like something from 14 years ago thanks to its tablet heritage. The pool playing controls are also abysmal and just scream 'tablet' at you. However, it seems bad even for a tablet. It's a clunky mess trying to line up shots and shoot. It doesn't feel natural, you just select a power and press the button that I guess meant shoot. Everything is clunky about this game. The sounds just don't do it for me either. It's a just a confusing mess of a game with a bad interface,\n\n\nIf you want a better snooker game: Get Virtual Pool 3. It is $9.95 rather than the astounding $12.99 It also looks a bit better and it doesn't lock away regular pool and other good features that should be available from the start and it also has snooker too.\n\nSure virtual pool 3 is from 2000 and you can pay more and get the latest version, but if you're in the market on a budget, VP3 controls better and very intuitive, it looks about the same, it plays better and it has more options than this game does and at $3 cheaper you'd be a fool to purchase this game. I would also recommend Virtual Pool 4, but that game is more expensive and I decided to suggest VP3 because of how close the prices are. Just skip this one, these positive reviews have obviously never played a pool/snooker game on a computer before.","August 17, 2014","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
