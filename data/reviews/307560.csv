"http://steamcommunity.com/id/OPbetterDeliver86/recommended/307560/","OPbetterDeliver86","Vintage Radish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/OPbetterDeliver86/","558 products in account","I cannot recommend this game.  I will preface this review by stating that I could not get more than 30 minutes into it.  But what I did see in my time with this game is horrible enough to make me want to willingly walk away from this $5 purchase so as to not also waste more time than I already have.\n\nGameplay -  Clunky and unresponsive, you have to fight the UI.  There is no confirmation on your target if the enemies are bunched together, and the game provides no above head HP bar to your enemies for quick assessment of unit vitality.  Also the game play and movement are a chore, you get two actions per turn, one being a move and one an action, or two movements if you do not feel like taking an action.  the problem comes with the fact that turning your character is not included in movement and you must spend a second movement (thus ending your chance to attack) just to turn your character towards your enemy.   This is frustrating because it makes positioning and strategy not intuitive at all.\n\nGame speed - REDICULOUSLY SLOW.  This further compounds your problems of the UI and Movement because every action takes a long time and AI decisions take a long time. (10-15 seconds per unit).\n\nCombat Maps - Bland and very claustrophobic. I guess the claustrophobic aspect is a good thing considering how moving your character is such a pain in the ♥♥♥.\n\nStory - Seems to be written by a child who enjoys Adventure Time since they try to reference it at least twice in the first 10 minutes.   I couldnt stomach this game for more than 30min.  At $5 a little more effort should be put in.\n\n\nVisuals - The art itself is ok, but there is little movement in the sprites, it makes the whole game feel wooden and unalive.\n\nConclusion -  I cannot see anyone truly liking this game unless they are hard up for a Turn-based RPG and have no other choice.  I cannot recommend this game.","July 2, 2014","false","0.4"," 84 of 108 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","84","108","0","4"

I figure, it's got to be better than what the other guys wrote who spent 30 minutes in the game, right?\n\nLast things first, this is a decent casual turn-based strategy game with break-sized battles, and I don't regret getting this on the current "75% off" sale.\n\nFirst off, this game has language settings for english, spanish, brazilian portugese and pirate - the latter is workable and fits the theme of the game well. Also, it's not lying when it boasts low minimum specs. To test it out, I dusted off my 8-year-old machine, and it works without a hitch; it's only a 141 MB download, so it is really quick to set up.\n\nI mentioned you get 20 levels (plus random encounters) of small-arena turn-based strategic combat. At first you only get your brawlers (and a 5x5 playing field), but level 6 opens up archers, and wizards and healers come into the game at level 9 (you're up to 10x10 by level 10). The difficulty's pretty forgiving, and so far I've had no opportunity to set the difficulty level (I guess I could just select weaker units, or try to beat the game from start to finish without replaying levels), but for people who are newer to this genre the size of the battles and the difficulty will be just right.\n\nAs a "seasoned pro" in this genre, what attracts me is the silliness in the characters I'm playing; the battle system is decent, and the interface is slightly clunky, but workable once you have figured out that the fighter portraits have a) the damage display integrated as dark shadows, and b) tell you about everyone's special moves once you click on the portrait. So, yes, casual, I wasn't agonizing over strategy and don't expect I will be: I get to select up to 5 units, have a slightly wacky battle (for example, one enemy brawler *is* armed with a fish) (and you do get to select one of the enemy team for your side after each battle) that last a few minutes, and that's that.\n\nFor a bargain game, that's all I need. Recommended.\n\n------\n\nNotes:\n\nThe HP of your team can be qickly assessed by looking at the unit portraits in the bottom corners (click on them to see details and special moves) - a good solution since the status effect are already above the units' heads.\n\nYou can do two actions per unit per turn, but some of them have cooldowns (standard attack has 1 turn, so you get 1 attack per turn). Having to budget one action point for changing the direction a unit is facing is a tactical challenge -- you can move sideways and avoid it, and you can use the fact that the enemy has to turn as well to creep up on him from two sides. This is good!\n\nAI was 10-15 seconds per turn at most on my slow machine, and it is slowed down mostly so you can see what is happening on the battlefield.\n\nCombat maps are mostly square grids with some obstacles.\n\nThe visuals aren't much to look at, but I like the character designs. Story is neglible, but I wasn't buying this game for that - get Scott  Lynch's novels if you want to read excellent pirate fiction!","October 20, 2014","true","4.7"," 29 of 35 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","29","35","0","0"

I liked it.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/YDzTwNADmjQ\n\nThe presentation of the game is good. I liked how the characters looked looked and moved.\n\nAs you can see you move units on a grid similar to a chess board. Sort of like in chess each piece moves a certain way. After each level you can add a fallen enemy to your team roster for use in future battles. Each character in your team can level up by gaining experience from each battle.\n\nI played games like X-Com a lot. I like carefully making my moves and that sort of thing. This is that sort of strategy game. It is turn based. You can only have a limited capacity in your pool of characters so you basically have to take care of which class of characters you keep and commit to leveling up. Which I think is a cool mechanic. I also like the fact that you could tailor your team to a variety of different styles. You could have a team full of tanky melee dudes or ranged units or a mix and so on.\n\nSo yes I really liked the game so far. But from what I could tell I got around two thirds to half way through the world (to the extent that I could see that it existed) in the short time that I played. Hopefully the games not that short. Still it's a pretty good price.\n\nClick here for more let’s play videos =)","July 3, 2014","true","1.2"," 19 of 39 people (49%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","49","19","39","0","2"
