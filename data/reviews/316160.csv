This fourth chapter really felt rushed. Some characters felt rushed (I can't complain about Mark and Archie though, I liked'em). THE ENDING felt like someone was really in a hurry, the "I left the stove on" kind of hurry. The story starts a bit slow, it catches up in the middle and drops like a sack of potatoes at the end.\nLook at the maps: NY, Istanbul, Rome. They all have at least 4/5 location shapes each, but you'll visit only 2/3 per map. It's like some locations were scrapped because of time/budget constraints and they didn't bother to change the maps design. You can't even skip dialogues.\nControls are meh, you'll get stuck often when running. Do yourself a favour and remap the directional keys to WASD.\n\nThis game could have been better D:","June 30, 2015","false","22.3"," 38 of 41 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","38","41","3","0"

Great game, interesting story. The controlls are a little bit irritating but I think they did a good job following on from number 3 and continuing broken sword in 3D. In fact I think this one is better then number 3. The game throws your straight into the action and keeps up a good thrilling pace throughout. The only frustration I have is that the mouse does not always indicate a spot you can interact with, like a lader. Also without a tutorial some people can become confused about all the actions you can perform and get stuck, for instance right clicking and selecting a certain action to be able to proceed. However, once you have got used to these small issues the game is a very rewarding experience and another great chapter in the broken sword series. The voice acting is as always top notch. I highly recommend this game.","November 4, 2014","true","0.9"," 48 of 63 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","48","63","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pointnclickster/recommended/316160/","pointnclickster","Pointnclickster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pointnclickster/","315 products in account","When I saw that this game received mixed reviews, I still kept my hopes high. After all, Broken Sword 3 got mixed reviews, and I enjoyed it, despite being trampled by boxes ;).  Then I played it. I will say this: I'm glad I played it. I'm a Broken Sword fan; therefore, I must play the whole series. If you are a Broken Sword fan, you probably should play it. It doesn't get everything wrong, it just doesn't get enough right. I feel that Broken Sword 3 was much stronger in terms of story and graphics. Anyhow, lets get to the positives of this game before I load you with the negatives.\n\nFirst of all, the characters are still great. George Stobbart is still wonderful. We have the same voice actor, and his delivery is great. We get to see some "guest star" characters from previous Broken Sword games, which I always enjoy. There are a few new characters that are amusing, and well done all around. Also (slight spoiler, but good grief she's on the cover), we have a new heroine! Her name Anna Marie and I personally wish she wasn't there because Nico Collard is the best. However, she is there, and she does a good job at keeping you guessing about character loyalties, overrall game plot, etc. I love the sountrack. There are portions that sound like the regular Broken Sword standard soundtrack (which is great), and then there are the special portions. There is a stage in the game where Nico is in Phoenix, Arizona. Yeah...more on that later. While she is there, there is a great guitar soundtrack that really enhances the atmosphere. There is a spy soundtrack in a section where George is doing a covert operation. Very cool. Also, the controls are much better. I didn't like how BS3 only used the keyboard. Here, you use both mouse and keyboard, pointing where you want to go or look at with mouse and hold control to run. So the positives are the characters, the music, and the script. Now the negatives.\n\nFirst of all, the story is horrible. For me, it boarders on heresy. In each BS game, we are dealing with an ancient artifact or technology that will bring about the end of the world. This time around, the ancient artifact is The Ark of the Covenant. Now, if your mind jumped to Indiana Jones and Raiders of the Lost Ark...you would be on the right track. (Spoiler!) (Spoiler!) George Stobbart is our Indiana Jones, the "good guys" are the Mafia, and the Nazis are played by...high officials in The Catholic Church. Nico Collard and Anna Marie take turns being Marion.  If this plot doesn't sound absurd, I don't know what does. High officials in the Catholic Church want to use the Ark of the Covenant and capture either Anna Marie or Nico to use their body as a sacrifice and/or vessel for the Angel of Death to inhabit, so said angel can destroy all those that don't believe in the one true faith .  Horrible isn't it? The game really doesn't look finished either. There are instances where you look on a large area map, and there are indentations in the map that make you think that you will go to said place once the story opens up to that area. Some of the places show up, and some don't. Seriously, the look and feel of this game is like Nico's hair: messy and unfinished. The ending is incredibly rushed and depressing. The ending sequence throws logic out the window, since all the characters you helped in the game somehow find the secret entrance and come to your aid, and it's never explained how. Apparently its easy to find the secret chambers in the Vatican. You know how you had so many places to visit in the first three games, not to mention hidden temples and stuff? Even in Broken Sword 3? Well, here you get to start in NY, go to Syria, then Phoenix, Arizona, then lastly, a small section of Rome including supposed hidden offices of The Vatican. Thats it. Four. There are no cut scenes. The game just puts widescreen bars into view, which lets you know this is a cut scene, with no change in graphics. I'm not a stickler on graphics, but they should be at least on par with the previous 3D title. This takes a step backwards. Now the character gripe. While Anna Marie is not a pointless character, Broken Sword has always been about George and Nico. Nico doesn't show up till halfway through the game. She is a side character in her own game series, which ticks me off. I'm sorry if the negatives seem to be disjointed. To sum it up: The story is ridiculous, the game looks unfinished and ends rather sadly (trust me when I say that it was not necessary).\n\nSo should you buy it? If you are a BS fan, I think you should still play it. If the storyline strikes you with  the "its so bad its funny" vibe, or if you don't think it a ridiculous premice, then you should play it. The script works well within the plot. For all my complaints, I'm glad I played it. It would have annoyed me if I hadn't. Also, I got this game on sale. Knowing what I know now, I'm really glad I did. This is definitely the weakest game in the series. I hope for a better time with Broken Sword 5: The Serpent's Curse.","January 22","false","30.7"," 26 of 31 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","26","31","0","3"

Well... yes... and no.\n\nThis is definitely the worst of all series. But it is still quite interesting and atmospheric.\n\nThe one thing, that massively lets thie game down is its puzzles. You would think, that difficult puzzles in a game, dedicated to puzzle-solving is a good thing. And you would be 100% right.\n\nBut in this game, puzzles can be hard to slove not due to their intended complexity, but due to them being illogical, due to the unclear goals that should be achieved, lack of information or downright stupidity.\n\nSometimes the most unobvious actions need to be completed, to progress with the story. Like showing one guy an object, which you found much earlier in the game and which has no connection whatsoever to this particular guy - not even a hint that it should be shown to anyone. And this is just one example of many - I could go on all night, but don't want to post spoilers.\n\nLet's just say, that in previous three games, I got hopelesly stuck and needed to use walkthrough only once. That's ONCE in THREE games. In this game, I am about half way through and already had to google the solutions to quests about 5 times. And they not even difficult quests - just one tiny extra bit of information would make them fun and enjoyable to solve. But the game does not give you this info and you're getting stuck - going back and forth between locations, talking to everyone, clicking on everything and getting p****d off - because you still can't find the solution.\n\nAlso - the game feels unfinished and/or unpolished. There are random locations on the map, that you never able to unlock and travel to and random objects in the world, that are there for no reason. They don't give you info, they don't help you solve puzzles, they not even there for laughs (like some objects in previous titles) - they are just there, so your protagonist can approach... let's say - book on a table, and say in loud monotonous voice - "It's the book"... Wow - thanks, Captain Obvious! I would have never guessed, if you had not told me... So yeah - in comparison to other titles in the series, this game sucks harder, than any German actress I've ever seen.\n\nWhy do I still recommend it then? Well - because it's the Broken Sword game and I am a bit of a fan.\n\nAlso because:\n\n- The atmosphere is still there. Alike Broken Sword 3 - it's in 3D, so world does feel a bit empty, but somehow it still manages to be quite charming.\n\n- George, Nico and some of the old characters return, bringing back the memories.\n\n- The usual dark/ridiculous sence of humour is still there.\n\n- Story isn't that bad.\n\n- Those quests that have any logic to them are still quite interesting to solve.\n\nThat about sums it up.\n\nSo... In general, the verdict is as follows:\n\nIf you are fan of the Broken Sword, then by all means get this game for your collection (wait for sale). And if you are not, you are much better off playing the first two games, becoming a fan and only then getting Broken Swords 3 and 4 (wait for big sale).\n\nIt's not bad a deal if you're following the story from the beginning and spend 2-3 bucks on this one.","July 16, 2015","true","17.9"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","15","15","0","0"

If you are a Broken Sword fan, you should definitely try this one, especially if you liked BS3.\n\nGraphics/Atmosphere: The Angel of Death continues to use the 3D perspective first established in BS3, but it looks much better. With anti-aliasing turned up, some scenes look almost photo-realistic (except for the lower quality character models). As a result, you really feel like you are in the story.\n\nStory: Like any Broken Sword game, there are some parts that are less believable or even boring. Overall though, it was pretty good. I liked how it tied together plot elements from the previous games. The ending left a lot to be desired however.\n\nPuzzles: Maybe I'm just impatient after playing almost nothing but Broken Sword in the past 2 weeks, but I felt like the puzzles were really hard. There were only a handful of major puzzles that I solved all by myself, for the rest I had to use a walkthrough. A couple in particular were really hard because they were logic puzzles, and after looking at a walkthrough I'm not so sure their logic makes sense.\n\nOverall, this is another good addition to the series and is worth playing. It's long, looks really nice, and is full of surprises. So get ready to see what kind of crazy situations George and Nico find themselves in this time.","December 25, 2014","true","13.7"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

The controls were annoying, some of the puzzles didn't make that much sense, not in the good "they're really hard" way but in a "how does that even work?" way, and I had to look up how to solve some of them online (the first time I've ever had to do that for a BS game).\n\nIt definitely lacks the humor of the other games and as far as I can tell there is no way to skip dialogue which can get very annoying when having to repeat parts of the game or if you choose the same topic again by accident (in previous games topics would disappear once they were done with unless you still needed them, in BS4 some topics would stay even when they weren't necessary).\n\nThe game was at least longer than I though it was going to be, some of the puzzles were pretty good, the storyline is okay, and we get to go to some new places and meet the typical Broken Sword cast of strange characters.

Something in the general atmosphere reminds the first two games, something else just don't.\n\nIt could be better with italian dubbing and Steam achievements.\nEnding completely lacks of impact.","September 21, 2015","true","21.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Hunted by Mafia, you uncover a plot by an order of the Vatican to employ the power of the lost Ark of the Testament in order to fashion a weapon that will cleanse the planet from the "unbelievers". The game is 3D, better made than the previous one, graphics are nice and in general it's a good game. I recommend it to those who like to proceed to the Broken Sword story.","August 30, 2015","true","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/justicepirate/recommended/316160/","justicepirate","Justice Pirate","http://steamcommunity.com/id/justicepirate/","56 products in account","George gets hired by a blonde white woman named Anna Maria who seems to just say "Okay" at everything George wants (very different from Nico in that way).  She says her father's manuscript leads to a treasure and she needed some help.  Of course George is always willing to find a way out of challenges.  Some old characters show up in this of course as well as some great new characters (like Mark who was hilarious to me).  This was much much better than Broken Sword 3! Thank you so much for not doing a million crate movements and having much better controls!  There seemed to be not as many challenging puzzles though but I like that there were at least a few in the end sequence.  The storyline was good in this. Sad ending though in a way! Also this game lasted longer to play (for me at least) than the other three Broken Sword games.","July 15, 2015","true","13.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
