Her Story is a throwback to the old FMV games that were made back in the 90s, only this time it isn't ♥♥♥♥, it's actually surprisingly great. The purpose is to try and find out - by going through archive footage of numerous police interviews with a woman that took place two decades earlier - what happened to her missing husband. This is done through keyword searching, so it's best to play this with a pen and paper handy as a video will throw up another clue or word that could be vital in your investigation.\n\nAs an exercise in non-linear storytelling Her Story is incredibly well written and a huge amount of thought has clearly gone into not just the dialogue and plotting, but also into the length of the videos. Some of them can be as short as 3-4 seconds and at first viewing seem absolutely redundant. As you delve further into the archives, however, they can take on a whole new meaning. The actress who plays the subject of these interviews deserves huge credit for her work here, her performance only truly reveals its brilliance the further you progress and you begin to notice her intonation, mannerisms and overall demeanour are all absolutely perfect.\n\nIf you're after something truly different, interesting and original then look no further. Her Story is a little gem of a game. Recommended.","June 24, 2015","true","1.5"," 678 of 817 people (83%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","83","678","817","28","13"

You are told nothing other than how to operate the software needed to access these videos, and then left alone to attempt to crawl through the archive.\n\nHer Story doesn’t lend itself well to trailers or quick descriptions. It isn’t flashy nor does it immediately show its brilliance, but that subtlety is an integral part of why it manages to do so much with so little. The low rent aesthetic provides a texture – aged video footage, a faux 90’s desktop, dated clothing – and then drapes it over the narrative to fully pull you back in time as you attempt to put the pieces of the mystery together.\n\nHow Her Story looks though, or even what it has to say to a degree, isn’t why it’s so fascinating. To be sure developer Sam Barlow does an incredible job setting the tone through familiar, nostalgic imagery, smartly opting to omit authenticity where it isn’t needed while still nailing the feel of the 90’s. It’s all remarkably well-considered, but where Her Story pushes games forward is in how it approaches narrative as nonlinear and undefined.\n\nBecause of the limitations of your in game computer, you can only ever access five videos at once, using the search box to scrub through video transcripts for keywords. What this means in practice is you have to search out every bit of the narrative for yourself, being locked out of broad searches so as to require you to actually think like a detective and put the puzzle pieces together for yourself. Her Story is the first game I’ve played where I actually felt as if I was the one solving the case, following a trail of breadcrumbs I had to seek out and which often didn’t lead in a straight line from beginning to end, requiring I go back and dig up old clues to find a new lead.\n\nI became exceptionally diligent in making sure to check up on every name, every address; any random detail that had the potential to lead me to a breakthrough. Her Story demands a lot from the player in order to see and understand everything hidden inside it, but the depth of its narrative and the intricacy in which it’s woven together rewards those who put more time into learning its secrets. Her Story puts a lot of trust in the player to follow through on their end of the bargain and not cheat their way to a resolution, but it backs this up with such an engaging plot (delivered entirely through a masterful, demanding performance by Viva Seifert) that anyone who doesn’t give it the attention it deserves is only cheating themselves in the end.\n\nHer Story doesn’t look like much, nor is it easy to do it justice through words alone, but it’s nevertheless a game that’s going to be talked about for years by anyone who takes the time to look below the surface. It breaks entirely new ground for narratives in games, and is perhaps the biggest proof that FMV has a place in games beyond basic comedy. It’s a very difficult game to talk about in any capacity without ruining what makes it so great, but it all the same demands discussing and is a game I see creating ripples through the industry for a very long time to come.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","July 2, 2015","true","4.2"," 293 of 367 people (80%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","80","293","367","10","15"

This is the creator of silent hill shattered memories and aisle.\n\nYou watch interviews filmed in 1994 between a police detective and a woman. Her husband was murdered and it's up to you to figure out what happend and how. Explore the police database for videos and puzzle the story together.\n\nI recommend that you play the game in window mode and have your computer notepad ready, because you are most likely going to write down a bunch of keywords. If you wanna play it in fullscreen you can also have pen & paper nearby.\n\nEvery time you come across a keyword that the woman says, like a name or a place, you use that as a search term to find more video clues.\n\nIn a FMV game like this it is of course important to have talented actors/actresses to make the story believable. Her story only have 1  actress and her name is Viva Seifert. She does a great job performing in over 200 videos here.\n\nSome people will absolutely make the argument that this is not a "game". I don't really care what you think it is, it's a great experience nonetheless. I love detective games, and this one is as real as it gets.\n\nOnce you have completed the game there's even some secret achievement, a minigame and some hidden videos to explore. It's not a very long game, you can compete it within 2-4 hours, but if you wanna go for all the achievements and see every video you will have a few hours more.\n\nI value the content rather then the lenght of a game, I actually think its refreshing to play a short game that I can complete in one sitting sometimes. I bought Her Story on sale cheap, and it was easily worth the money. I would have no problem even paying full price for this game, it's really that good in my opinion.\n\nWhen you play a lot of games like I do, It's rare to find something so different as Her Story. I'm looking forward to similar games in the future. I recommend this game to basically everyone, especially those into thriller/crime/FMV/detective games.","January 7","true","13.1"," 161 of 210 people (77%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","77","161","210","6","8"

The "mystery" exists only because of the arbitrary restriction imposed by the database--you have to find clips by searching rather than simply browsing them in chronological order.  Eventually the game will cue you when it feels you have watched enough of the clips to grasp the entire story. For me this was after a little more than an hour, though I got the gist of the story after about 30 minutes or so.\n\nThis is not a detective game, it's an exercise in fractured narrative.  I'm not sure why so many reviewers have pointed out a need for pen and paper, it makes as much sense as watching something like Eternal Sunshine with pen and paper. Narrative games are fine, but the story in this one is quite absurd and many of the clips are poorly acted/written/just nonsensical (e.g. the song, so "on the nose" and completely inappropriate given the context). I hit on the main twist about 15 minutes in and spent the next hour expecting a counter-twist because the initial twist was so ridiculous.\n\nOver all it's entertaining until you realize there's actually nothing to it, and it won't last you more than 2 hours.","June 25, 2015","false","1.4"," 703 of 1,026 people (69%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","69","703","1","18","21"

She's not a gamer in any way, shape or form, but she loves mysteries and stories, so she was game, and we both enjoyed the time immensely.\n\nSome tips below, but no spoilers. BE SURE to read number (1) if you plan to buy the game.\n\n1. Be very very careful in the "Settings" box. There's a button in there that says"Delete Session Data".  You might *think* like I did that this will clear out the clips you've added to your "user session" with the "Add to Session" button that shows up on each clip, but it does much more. It resets your entire game. With no warning! Ugh. Don't press this button unless you really want the equivalent of "New Game" with no opportunity to restore your progress. You lose all tags you've added to videos, and the state of each video goes back to unwatched.\n\n2. I know of no way to remove clips from the "user session" section once they've been added.\n\n3. When you search, the videos are returned in chronological order. But when you "add to session" they are stored in the order you added them, and you can't rearrange them later. This fact, coupled with (2) makes the "add to session" useful only if you want to be lured eventually to the button of death that I describe in (1). Really bad oversight on the part of the developer, but the story makes up for it, and I'm still overwhelmingly positive about the overall game experience because the story is so good.\n\n4. The DB Checker is pretty helpful - have a look at it early and you might figure out a way to tag your videos so that later, once you've uncovered most of them, you can watch them in chronological order. My system made use of (3) and made for an enjoyable replay of all the videos that we'd uncovered. I put post-it notes on my screen bordering the DB checker so I could more easily track rows and columns in order to tag for later chronological viewing.\n\n5. Your search results won't show all matches, but rather only the first five. If there are more, there will be messaging below the search results saying that. I didn't notice this for quite awhile. By adding more search terms you can narrow the results and possibly see other videos beyond the first five, if that makes sense.\n\n6. There's a message in the DB checker that makes it sound like more videos are available somewhere else ("one volume missing.") This had me intrigued for the longest time until I reread the readme files (I think) and realized that the other volume probably contained footage of the interviewering constables and their questions. That's my theory anyhow. I never did find any other "volume", and the walkthrough I watched later didn't mention anything about it.\n\nEnjoy!","May 26","true","20.5"," 47 of 49 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","47","49","2","1"

Why?\n1) It's not a game it's an experience.  For reasons of brevity, I don't want to get into what makes a "game" but you could easily replicate the "gameplay" in a youtube or google's video search, there's no "gamey" factors at play here.\nSo what if it's not a game, as long as it's a great experience?  This brings me to my next point\n2) Experience is extemely easy to derail.  I think this game was meant to be played by listening extremely closely to the introductory clips and following them stepwise to a conclusion.  If you proceed instead to search for words related to the opening topic you will get to critical clips extemely quickly and in my case in a sequence that ruins much of the suspense of the other reveals.  You might say that I did this to myself, which is fair, but given that a main selling point is emergent gameplay, it disappointing how not playing it "right" can rapidly undermine the experence.\n3) The game drags on pointlessly after finding the main events.  I'm pretty sure progress is measured by hitting key clips, but the ones which are considered important seem almost arbitarty.  I think I finally finished the game on a search for "fennel" after doing exhaustive name searches on terciary characters to open up more clips.\n\nLike many of the recent "emergant art games" if you experience it exactly in the way the creator had in mind you are likely to enjoy it, unfortuantly this contridicts the not only the idea of emergent games, but the idea of art itself.\n\nMaybe it's not fair to expect much when breaking the design paradigm of the game, but emergent gameplay is based on the idea that the game is at it's best when the gamers are pushing the boundries of the system and operating outside the vision of the developers, the non-linar art games are attempting to push the boundries of gaming, but ironicaly frequently fall flat when the players give the game boundries the slightest push.\n\nI can't recommend "Her Story" as either a great game or a great expereince, the only greatness it has lies in it's novelty which professional reviewers have lauded, but if you want novelty so much that your willing to compromise both the gameplay and the expereince, I recommend that you try to find it outside of a game.","July 23, 2015","false","1.7"," 443 of 681 people (65%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","65","443","681","14","9"

It is safe to say at this point that if you plan on picking up Her Story, I would highly suggest you avoid any discussion or forums threads where the game could possibly end up being discussed because there is a good chance you will probably end up spoiling it for yourself. If you are an armchair detective who relishes unraveling crime stories such as this one then you have been suitably warned!\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=483899193\nHer Story opens in the English town of Portsmouth and takes place entirely on a desktop computer as you trawl through a series of video interviews pertaining to a crime that was committed many years before. Her Story gives you very little to work with initially as you are given no reason whatsoever as to who you are and why you are interrogating these archives. Booting into the game for the first time the first clue that the game supplies you with is the keyword "Murder" which upon being entered into the archive database search reveals a series of short clips pertaining to the murder of a missing man named Simon Smith and the woman being interrogated, who we soon find out is the murdered mans wife.\n\nWhat starts out a simple murder mystery to unravel the "why" and if not the "why" then the "who" soon evolves into something far more complex made even more intriguing by the way in which the game hands you bits and pieces of information. Her Story consists of a series of interviews that take place over a period of time that have each been spliced and segregated into smaller clips then cataloged via the use of certain keywords within the archive database so you won't be able to access any of these videos in any sort of chronological order. It is also important to note that the database search will only ever return no more than five video clips so it will often be the case that you will need to refine your search criteria if you want to get the remaining videos returned for viewing. The delivery of this type of fractured narrative actually works in the games favor because it keeps many of Her Story's secrets deeply hidden until you finally have enough information to unlock the one video that ties certain threads together. Since most players won't be using precisely the same set of keywords at exactly the same given time means that most will uncover the secret at the heart of Her Story in a multitude of different ways.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=484286597\nBy the time I had unraveled the mystery around the death of the local town glazier (which took roughly just over 5 hrs) I was sitting with 7 full A4 pages of keywords that I had used to search with. The last time I did this kind of note taking while playing a game was way back in the late eighties and early nineties where jotting down your thoughts was absolutely necessary if you had any hope of completing the complex adventures of the day pushed out by Sierra or LucasArts.\n\nWhile Her Story is not what one could easily term a traditional game since there is not much to it other than watching video clips and listening out for clues that will enable further searches and hopefully help you uncover more of the mystery, doesn't make it any less entertaining than the running or gunning of it featured in other games. The central mystery here is so strong that you will want to continue pushing forward in an attempt to unravel all the pieces of evidence presented to you via each video clip so that you can finally understand what it is that your are viewing. It also helps that the central character at the heart of this is portrayed convincingly by actress Viva Seifert who is able to switch from manic to depressive at the drop of a hat and effortlessly so.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=483899440\nHer Story is unlike any game I have ever played before and honestly made me feel like I was a true detective at the end of it. It's a totally captivating thriller told in a unique way that unravels differently for each that play it and for those of you that often search out for unique and different gaming experiences should be placed right at the top of your wishlist or better yet grabbed from the Steam store right now. I won't be one bit surprised to see this game pop up on the end of the year "best of" lists since it is really that good!\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","July 19, 2015","true","5.6"," 222 of 335 people (66%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","66","222","335","18","14"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somnivore/recommended/368370/","somnivore","Chewable C++","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somnivore/","2644 products in account","As a fan of the film Memento and the game Gone Home, I have a certain bias towards exploration of perception, memory, and non-linear discovery. If you disliked those titles, then chances are you won't appreciate Her Story and you can feel free to disregard the rest of this review.\n\nThe "gameplay" consists mainly of using an artificially constrained search system to find video clips from a series of police interviews with a woman (played by British athlete and musician Viva Seifert). The implicit goal is to uncover the story / most of the clips, or at least the important ones.\n\nMy initial impression upon realizing that there is no apparent gameplay other than searching for clips by keyword was... "doh, is that it?" However, the story and the excellent acting by Viva Seifert quickly drew me in and compelled me to find out the rest.\n\nClips are indexed by transcript words, so you can search either by words or names you hear in clips already seen, or by whatever relevant words (or phrases) you can think of. As such, the video clip archive is a sort of graph connected by the keywords and you can follow the graph edges or blindly attempt to jump to other parts of the graph.\n\nThus what we have here is an interactive, non-linear experience of uncovering a complex, intriguing story (sufficiently qualifying a "game" by my definition). The non-linear aspect refers to the order in which every player might view the clips - this can of course impact the nature and quality of the experience. However, in my opinion, even if the clips were viewed simply in chronological order, the story is still intriguing enough to stand on its own.\n\nThe writing is brilliant, and far more intricate than it might appear at first. Even now, after considerable reflection, and even after having posted this review (yes, this paragraph I edited it in shortly afterward), I am still poring over analyses.\n\nThe story alone is a worthwhile watch. But the FMV archive presentation is a brilliant interactive storytelling experiment and the combination elevates Her Story to, in my opinion, possibly one of the most noteworthy games in history, doing something that has not been done before quite like this, or, in my opinion, quite so effectively. Her Story deserves the long list of accolades it's received.\n\n______________________________________________________Some clips are very hard to discover via keyword search, and this acts as a sort of challenge element to the game. If you're actually going for this, (or, in general) chances are you'll need to take quite a few notes. However, there are ways to make this easier or bypass it completely, for those less inclined to take on the challenge:\n\nTo make it easier: after the end sequence (for which not all clips are required), you are given some useful codes: admin_random and admin_unlock these codes allow for lookup of a random clip and increase the search result limit from 5 to 15 respectively\n\nAlthough, I would only recommend doing this first making an effort to play the game as intended, there is a way to view all clips in chronological order: search BLANK, then override the BLANK tag with something else. Repeat until you've seen all the clips. Or you can just look up a chronological compilation on youtube if you don't care about the completionist achievements. (but, again, I recommend actually playing the game first)\n______________________________________________________\nWhy is Her Story's presentation formula so effective?\n\nConsider a typical, linear story presentation. A good story will captivate you and have you guessing at least sometimes (especially mystery type stories). But presenting the material the way Her Story does, out of order and interactively further accentuates that feeling of engagement, stimulating you at every point to analyze the material, judge, make connections, extrapolate, make guesses.\n\nAs mundane as an FMV clip show may sound, this kind of presentation can be remarkably effective at engaging the mind of the audience. It is intrisically a more active and mentally demanding experience. But aside from that formula itself, the material, the script, the story, the acting is cleverly tailored in its complexity and ambiguity to maximize audience engagement, yielding what is likely to be an unforgettable experience.\n______________________________________________________\nAfter you're done playing (seriously! only after! not before!), I recommend also reading this thorough analysis by fellow game creator Adrian Chmielarz of Vanishing of Ethan Carter, etc: https://medium.com/@adrianchm/deciphering-her-story-b4544a75a7b2\n______________________________________________________\nBEWARE: may not work on OSX!

Those games would play out stories in a linear fashion based on some choices that you made in a choose your own adventure format. Then real life actors would act out the scenes of the story as if watching a television show, or movie. There were actually some well known actors in some of these games even if the stories and writing were incredibly cheesy even for the time. 'Her Story' uses these FMVs with live action video just like these old games do, but it doesn't follow a linear path, nor does it have you choosing the adventure based upon choices. Instead you are able to view all the stories and mysteries of the narrative by hitting points along the time line in a totally random fashion. Making it an interesting and fun way to piece together the mystery.\n\nWhen you first boot up the game you find yourself sitting at on old fashioned police computer's desktop. It appears like you are using something along the lines of Windows 3.1, or Windows 95. It is exactly like using a computer desktop so it feels like using a computer playing this game. On the screen in front of you is a police archives search engine with the word "murder" typed into the search box. Upon clicking the "search" button you are presented with several videos of what looks to be an interrogation film from a suspect interview, which we find out immediately that it is. This woman is being questioned about a murder. Specifically the murder of her husband. Now where do we go? We have 4-5 videos here we can watch and now we are on our own. We are tasked with investigating this story ourselves to find out everything.\n\nSo how does this work? Just as you found the word "murder" typed into the search box at the start, you figure out that to find out more about this story you need to search other terms in that box. Based on the videos you watch you pick up clues like names, or other meaningful words, then search them to find more videos. Also, like anyone who may be questioning a murder suspect you think of things you would normally ask them as well that you may not have even seen in the videos  such as the location of "the body". Every time you search a term, or phrase a new set of videos will pop up for you to view. They will be from random dates from the 7 or so interview sessions the woman was brought in for questioning. Each search term and phrase is something that was in the transcript from these interviews. So basically that first search of "murder" popped up every video in which the term was used. The game doesn't make it that easy though to find all the videos. You can't simply search "the" for instance and have 200 videos show up. It limits you to only seeing 5 of however many have that term, or phrase so you must either expand on the phrase to eliminate videos, or search another one to end up with those other videos. You can unlock more options after "finishing" the game to help make finding 100% of the videos easier.\n\nIt sounds simple, and it really is, but the story being woven through the randomly watched videos becomes a very fascinating mystery. Not just about the murder case you seem to be looking for information on, but there are many secrets that are uncovered through clever searching into the archives of these video interviews. Things that first seemed to be quite straight-forward end up being something else entirely. You begin to question the reality of what you have learned thus far, and you start to consider many alternate theories as to what is going on, who this woman is, and what she may be lying about. In fact, most players begin to start scrawling notes on pieces of paper so that they can remember all the things that they want to search for next. They want to find a time line, or even just want to connect some dots, but if this game gets you interested I can almost guarantee you that you will take out a piece of paper and start taking notes while you play.\n\nI very much suggest that you DO NOT read about this game, or its story before playing it. There are many secrets that can be spoiled by doing so, and it will hurt the fun of having those internal debates with yourself that everyone carries to the forums after they have completed the game fully. It is much more fun, and fascinating to try and figure out what you think is going on yourself, and maybe even create your own theories as you play than to have a few handed to you by someone else before you get the chance.\n\nI found 'Her Story' to be a great way to tell a story. Not just the format of giving you small pieces of it at a time through videos, but also due to the disjointed time line you watch it in. Everything is learned in such a way that you will be pulling a handful of jigsaw puzzle pieces out of a hat randomly without having the picture on the box to draw reference from. Only when you have pulled a large portion of these pieces out of the hat can you begin to sort them and put them together in a manner that shows you what the picture is supposed to look like. It asks you to ponder on what you have seen and allows your imagination to work out some theories while you play, which I found to be incredibly rewarding.\n\nI would recommend this game to all adventure fans of both point and click adventures and Visual Novels. Obviously anyone that has enjoyed FMV games in the past must grab this immediately as well since many reviewers actually claim it is the best one of these ever made. I would say that fans of detective stories and mysteries will find this format appealing too. If you like to use clues to solve problems and mysteries you should enjoy this. This game will take you about 3 hours if you speed through it and don't bother trying to discover all the mysteries and unlock all the videos. For someone that wants to find all the depths of the story, unlock 100% of the videos present, it will take you 5-6 hours most likely, and could take more if you take your sweet time. There are achievements and 3 trading card drops. Getting 100% in all Achievements is fairly simple, but will require that 100% videos found and it will take you 5 hours most likely to go through.","July 6, 2015","true","8.0"," 72 of 108 people (67%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","67","72","108","8","5"

I honestly have a fondness for some of them, even though they are mostly cheesy. The thing is, I think the FMV games back then kinda saw themselves for what they were and mostly took a sort of tounge in cheek approach.\n\nHer Story, however, takes itself very seriously. Now, here is part of the problem. An FMV game is not really much of a "game." You can barely interact with them because video is linear. It has a beginning, a middle, and an end. You can mix it up a bit (the few rooms that randomized in Dragon's Lair, for instance) but for all intents and purposes you're on a straight path (Sewer Shark). Her Story tries mixing it up by giving you random pieces of video that you can view, in no real order, as you try to piece together a woman's story regarding a crime. I don't really want to get into spoiling that part.\n\nNow, the video is linear obviously, but again, that's not how the game works. It's as if you're using a database that pulls up a few seconds of video using keywords.\n\nSo, by allowing you to see any piece of the video when you put in a certain term is an utter failure. As another reviewer had said, there is no real "ending" to this "game." I, like them, was about 15 mins in when I got what would be "the big reveal" or what would have actually ended the police interview. Something had popped up on the screen a few mins earlier and after some audio/video clues and the "big reveal" video, I click it. Credits roll, then the main screen.\n\nI just sat there for a moment, confused, then hit contine and spent time getting every video bit to get an ending. I did and well, I just sat there looking at a computer screen. So I quit feeling as if I'd wasted $5 and 4.5 hours of my life.\n\nI wanted to like it. Although I think it would work better were it a short indie film, or a YouTube video. And I'd have had more fun with it if it were. The fact that you can "beat it" in 15-20 mins, but not really know that there's no point in going back and wasting anymore time with it since there's no ending or much resolution.\n\nI'll give an "A" for effort but don't buy this. Grab some popcorn, watch a playthrough on YouTube, have more fun and save yourself $6.","July 5, 2015","false","4.5"," 102 of 160 people (64%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","64","102","160","4","5"

I bought it because it's been hyped by winning yesterday a lot of mentions and prizes at the game awards, it was on sale for 3,50€ so I guess it was worth giving it a shot.\n\nthe 70% of the game mechanics is about sorting video clips in a clipboard to make sense of a story told in a thousand tiny little clips of several interviews in a police precinct, cut so short for no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ reason at all. and yet there are no tools at all for sorting the clips out together to be played all at once in the right chronological order... you can just SWAP them one by one! Swap! Why would anybody want to swap them? I just wanted to PLACE them IN BETWEEN other clips but guess what? you can't.\n\nthe community has been asking the developer to give them a simple function for removing the clips from the sidebar, and after FIVE months from his promise to include it in the game no updates are in sight and the programmer put up some excuse about the game getting hyped a lot so he hadn't much time at all to work on it. So... the game is going great and still you hadn't time to even polish it a bit?? what an unprofessional behavior.\n\nanyway, back to the game, I've found the story teenage-y, there was nothing about crime solving at all or being a detective, you just have to guess keywords in a search engine (which is also limited to only the top five results! more artificial difficulty) and then put the clips of these police interviews altogether to understand what's going on. Too bad there's nobody interviewing her, too bad she's talking about her life with details of no importance at all to the case - she's even playing SONGS ON A GUITAR in a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ police precinct while being interrogated about a MURDER! That really put me out of the atmosphere, even more of her babbling about her drama-queen life, complete with a lot of unnecessary details about what's she likes to eat, what's her husband likes to do, how he wears his glassess...  because yeah, I'm being interrogated for murder, I'd surely talk about petty things like Bob Dylan songs and glasses and stuff.\n\nReally, if you want to know more about the game, just go on youtube and find a let's play with all the clips in order. There's really nothing else here. This game might have been good for a Free To Play (check out Emily is Away for a good Free To Play similar to this one) or maybe for 1 buck, but 6€? Even 3,50€ on sale it's too much, I'd say 1 or 2€ tops is its right value.\n\nSo don't believe the hype and stay away from it, unless you really are looking for carpal tunnel injury trying to get all those clips together.","December 4, 2015","false","2.0"," 156 of 262 people (60%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","60","156","262","10","2"

The woman who is their solitary subject is the only source of testimony available, and the challenge of assembling something which satisfactorily resembles truth while questioning her veracity and motives is deeply compelling.  Multiple thematic symbols and threads gently hint towards one conclusion or another depending upon your subjective predispositions, but your interpretation is one that will remain open—as well as uniquely yours, since no other player shared the same process in reaching it.\n\nActress Viva Seifert carries the entire game on her shoulders.  Her performance never feels cinematic but rather believably human, full of false starts and fidgets that vitally color her words.  She is presented through a wonderfully interlaced and dusty recreation of VHS tapes' look—and sound, as well, with the dull tocking of a wall clock audible behind the poor acoustics of the recording, which render subtitles invaluable, even to someone like me who generally abhors them.  All of this aesthetic design takes place within a classic '90s desktop that perfectly establishes the context needed to let you feel like a modern-day true-crime historian.\n\nThe occasional bits of music that play over the ambient noise of the fluorescent ceiling lights gloriously reflected off the screen create a warm—if melancholy—tone that puts me in mind of Gone Home, a very different vibe than might be expected of a murder investigation; it went a long way towards getting me in the frame of mind necessary for empathetically thinking about these characters' lives.  Flashes of facial reflection on the surface of the simulated computer monitor did the rest as they prompted me to wonder about my own role and the personal meaning that this mystery might hold.\n\nSome have complained about the archive's limitation of displaying only five search results at a time, but I would argue that this is the essential obstacle which sparks the player's interaction; without it, these records would be laid bare and the puzzle would lose the novel structure that makes it so intriguing.  My one objection to the interface is that the videos saved for reference are too difficult to organize.  Swapping them around would not be too terrible in itself if only there was a way to prune clips that are no longer needed; as it is, the collection only ever grows and so eventually becomes cumbersome.*\n\nHowever, this small issue is hardly a blemish on the game's accomplishment.  Her Story is very special, and I am gratified by the critical attention it has quickly received; it is already clear that it will be a lasting influence on game designers.  Players who enjoy the game and yearn for more would do well to search out Christine Love's free title Digital: A Love Story, of which I was reminded in more ways than one, as well as Barlow's classic work of interactive fiction, Aisle.\n\n\n\n*Update: The ability to delete videos that have been saved to the user session is being added to the game.","June 28, 2015","true","10.8"," 71 of 120 people (59%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","59","71","120","5","0"

It's like that because Sam Barlow wanted to tell a mystery in a fragmented manner with a "throwback" feel, and there's nothing wrong with that idea, but the implementation falls flat. There are ~270 videos in a police station's computer database, with each video being an answer to a question asked of murder suspect Hannah. There are 7 different police interviews from 7 different days. The only way to find any of these 270 video segments is to search for a word Hannah speaks in it, as the police questions are not present nor searchable, and the video fragments are completely unsorted. For each search you make, no matter how many results you get, you can only view the first chronological 5.\n\nThe segments are not tagged with a time, date, the name of the suspect, the case number, what the crime is, or anything else you would expect to find associated with video evidence in a police database. The videos themselves are timestamped with a date, but that information is only useful to you visually, so you can establish when in each interview that particular answer was given, as well as during which interview. Each of the ~270 video fragments is tagged with "BLANK" and you can helpfully insert your own tags when viewing the clips, as the police evidently did not do their jobs either when splitting up these clips or in naming the system which houses them "LOGIC." The more dedicated players will wind up tagging the minutes and dates themselves, as this will be the only reliable way to find clips you've stumbled upon previously when trying to piece together the contents of each interview.\n\nYou are only able to view the first 5 chronological search results at a time. You can search "mirror" and receive 11 results, view those first 5, and have no way other than luck when searching for another word to access those last 6. This restriction is made extra frustrating because below the search results, there is a "User Session" where you can store and view clips for later, in any order you want. It can store an infinite amount of videos. If the reason for limiting the amount of viewable search results was supposed to be due to system limitations, it would make more sense to limit the User Session and not the search results, especially because there is no possible way to view the videos in chronological order, or by date, or by any other out-of-the-box method.\n\n... It's hard enough to accept any system from any year would be set up like that, so to discover the search limit to be completely artificial is exceptionally lazy writing, to the point of being insulting.\n\n...\n\nAll of this would be easier to overlook and be seen as an inconvenience if the plot both on its own and within the storytelling mechanics were worth it, which they are not.\n\n**PLOT/WRITING** (SPOILERS)The first and last paragraphs are in spoiler tags so those who want to read the Gameplay and Conclusion sections only don't accidentally get spoiled.\n\nIt's not clear whether Hannah and Eve are one person with multiple personality disorder, or actually twins - there is some debate on this right now, with both sides making good points. But the way this is explained, as well as the themes encapsulated by it, is overwrought to the point where you can say the writing was intended to be satirical. Nothing is subtle, and everything is shoved in your face to the point of absurdity.\n\nMirrors, reflections, and things associated with them, such as palindromes, are mentioned constantly. They are not just used to bolster the game's themes or plot or give little hints and nice touches you might notice after playing a while, they are mentioned frequently, and you are hammered with the very notion that they exist. I suspect even players who don't aim to get every video clip and spend less than two hours with the game will reach a point where they'll feel tired of hearing about them. It's such a great coincidence that Hannah's husband, Simon, is a glazier, and how wonderful that somebody so obsessed with mirrors/reflections is married to somebody who can make one. This does get used as the catalyst for the murder, and had Hannah/Eve not mentioned the concept of mirrors and reflections to a degree where you wonder if the police are prompting her to talk about them, this would be more thematically effective. A cracked minigame in the recycling bin could be a nice touch to give an idea of the era of the system and could serve as a neat diversion, but instead it's just something to highlight the "reflections" theme - even an easter egg can't escape it.\n\nIt would be really interesting to be able to see the police questions in any manner, even as a post-game extra, because for the police to keep calling Hannah back for interviews when she constantly goes on tangents and rambles about things with no particular importance is strange, and I'd love to know what they're asking to prompt the nonsensical answers. Yes, she's a suspect, but she can't stay on track. I've gotten 75% of the clips, so maybe there's a point where you can see her being redirected, but nothing I've seen so far indicates this happens.\n\n...I do think there are times when an actor/actress can't do anything if the script they're given is bad enough, and I'd argue this is certainly the case here - not to say she does a spectacular job, but the blame goes deeper.\n\nRight now, there seems to be no clear consensus as to whether Hannah/Eve are two people or one - I only briefly glanced at some discussions. Not only do I not care enough about the story to find out which is correct, but if it turns out there's not enough in-game information to discern it, I also don't care. None of the three outcomes (it's one person, two people, or we don't know) would make the story any more interesting or add any value to the game.\n\n**END SPOILERS**\n**CONCLUSION**\nI can understand why people might like Her Story, as there are some positives to it, and if you can look past its flaws enough it will be a fun, fairly-priced diversion. Except for the way the LOGIC system functions (or doesn't), the interface is nice for what it's supposed to represent, and the ability to turn off the glare is appreciated. I've seen some say the experience works very well when playing with someone else so you can bounce ideas, but to me that'd just be testing the patience of two people instead of one.\n\nLooking the review over, it seems like I'm just nitpicking small elements, but this was not meant to be all-encompassing. Would it not bloat this already too-long review and I wasn't sick of writing about it, I could mention the incomprehensibly poor functionality of the "User Session," irregularities with how the police treated her and investigated the case (to the extent we have that information), and a few other things. What I describe are symptoms of the much bigger problems. I hope this inspires more games to use FMV, because I'd love to play a good murder mystery FMV told in a fragmented way, but with internally consistent and non-frustrating gameplay - this one is a poorly written mess, marred by awful and lazy design.","June 27, 2015","false","3.8"," 94 of 164 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","94","164","0","0"

I think it in one way shows the main issue with the format and why it died: for a game of any reasonable length to fit in a reasonable amount of space the quality of the video displayed has to be awful. The longer the game, the worse the problem becomes. This game, however, hangs a nice lampshade on that problem by having the videos be from cassette recordings that were filmed in the 90s and giving the screen a CRT monitor distortion. I applaud the creativity for getting around that.\n\nThe problem, sadly, is that the gameplay is minimal to the point that I am embarrassed at how long it took me to figure out how the game was played...mostly because the game has so little content that I didn't realized I'd already started playing. You search for words from the police recordings and then watch the videos that contain those words. As you go through the videos you slowly put the story together until the game quite literally asks if you've had enough and simply ends. I felt like this would have worked really well as part of a larger game, but as it stands this game seems to take all of the very most dull aspects of detective work and tried to say that's a game. You are sitting at a desk reviewing testimony that's been put into a database that essentially turned the clips into a difficult to navigate puzzle for no obvious reason other than because the actress was the only person involved in the creation of this game.\n\nUltimately that was probably the biggest flaw, because without any other actors involved the story was forced to devolve into something that even a soap opera would roll its eyes at. Twin sisters separated at birth by a corrupt midwife are sharing one life a la The Prestige. Good stories show rather than tell, this one tells in excruciating detail and tries to trick you into thinking the story is more well thought out by chopping it into small clips and making you search for the pieces.\n\nTL;DR: I don't think this game does FMV games justice. The acting is reasonable, but story is not particularly interesting due to the limited cast of only one person and the minimal interaction the player has with anything. It could have been something interesting, but ended up being pretty dull.\n\n:edit: added spoiler warning and moved TL;DR to the bottom.","June 25, 2015","false","1.4"," 198 of 356 people (56%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","56","198","356","11","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/murderbits/recommended/368370/","murderbits","murderbits","http://steamcommunity.com/id/murderbits/","2796 products in account","The amount of praise and number of awards Her Story received compelled me to give it a try, so I eagerly sat down to the game with a pen and pad of paper. Everyone I'd heard talk about it stressed the importance of keeping notes.\n\nThe game exists as a simulated Windows 3.1 desktop with various sound effects and image filters giving you that mid 1990s computer vibe. That part is done well. Actually, that part is the best part of Her Story.\n\nThe gameplay consists of watching a 90 minute interrogation video, split up into almost 300 individual clips that are each a few seconds long. You consume these videos randomly, as you enter a word into the search field and it returns up to five videos which contain that word in their transcript.\n\nI'm okay with "experience" games. Or "Interactive fiction". However, Her Story is really pushing this concept, in that there is no interactivity to this fiction (you are choosing which clips to watch in what order, but you're not making any choices) and the "experience" is . . . well, that of watching a youtube video, basically. I like your Dear Esthers and your 9.03Ms and your Dinner Dates and your TRAUMAs and your Thirty Flights of Lovings, but . . . Her Story is *really* pushing it. Kind of like that kid in school who responds to the teacher's demand for a "two page essay" by writing his with a 24pt font.\n\nAnyway, I watched the five default videos that were on the screen when I started the game. Two of the videos contained names in them. I did a search on one of those names. Then a search on the other. After watching fewer than fifteen videos (twelve, actually), I wrote down what I thought the story was about and the two possible conclusions I felt were likely to be reached. On a hunch that I was correct, I went to google and did a quick search to discover that my conclusions were what the rest of the internet had arrived at.\n\nThat's it. That's literally it.\n\nThere are no other elements to Her Story. You watch short clips of a 90 minute interrogation until you don't want to watch any more of them and then you turn the game off. I do get the impression that I was supposed to find the story more challenging, though, and that I was supposed to furiously keep track of notes and keywords as I unraveled the story for hours upon hours, but it was really so clear after about two minutes worth of footage that I felt it was a better investment of my time to check if I had reached the right conclusions or not before spending more time at it. And I had.\n\nThis game seems to have a specific thing it is trying to be and it is that very well. It isn't broken or anything. It just isn't something I can recommend. There's not much to it and (having later gone back and watched the entire boring 90 minutes of interrogation on youtube), the story itself is just pretty . . . well, unoriginal. And not compelling. If this is what the life of a police detective is like, I'd imagine there would be more suicides in the profession.\n\nAlso, there seems to be a lot of contention over which of the two possibilities is "true" and the developer has hinted that there is one ultimate truth - but he's never going to reveal it. Personally, I'd say the title of the game does it for him.\n\nUltimately, my task is to say whether I recommend this game or not. I'm supposed to review whether I liked it and would encourage anyone else to play it. I'm not supposed to review whether it is or isn't broken or whether it is or isn't what it sets out to be. Just whether I would go to a friend and say "man, you gotta play this game". And, to that end, I have to say that I would not. I would be open to something along these same lines and this same format, but with a more compelling story in the future, but . . . this specific attempt . . . just did not do it for me. The only thing this game *is* is a story and not one part of the story or the characters maintained even a glimmer of interest for me.\n\nThe only reason I could really recommend this game is because it is novel. It's unlike most other things, right now. That, alone, doesn't seem like an adequate reason for me tell someone they need to spend five or six bucks to watch a chopped-up video, though.","January 1","false","1.4"," 21 of 31 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","21","31","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/babal/recommended/368370/","babal","Baal","http://steamcommunity.com/id/babal/","220 products in account","TL;DR:  If you've got a few bucks burning a hole in your pocket and an hour or two you're looking to waste, then I'd say buy this "game."  If you have better things to do with your time, or would rather enjoy a starbucks, then I'd say look elsewhere.\n\n\nThe plot:  You are given limited access to a police database where you are able to view interviews of a suspect surrounding a murder.  As you go further into the "game" you discover why and who;  Who you are, who the suspect is and why you even care.\n\nGame play:  This "game" falls short of even the minimalist idea of interactive fiction, and is more of like a video novel.  You are given a series of videos to watch.  These videos are interviews of a witness to a murder.  As you watch the videos you can tag them with key words that you can then search for.  Those key words may bring up more videos  that you can watch and reference for additional searches.  There is a limit on the number of videos are are able to pull up. so while one key word should have brought up a certain video, you weren't able to view it (due to the limit) but are able to view it after searching for a different keyword.  Eventually you watch enough videos to figure out the plot behind the murder. That is the extent of this "game."\n\nPros:  This was an interesting movie to be involved in.  The actress is actually very good.\n\nIf you want to have an idea of what it is like to be a detective, or how to interview someone that is involved in a crime, this is more or less exactly how it should be done (the suspect does all the talking).  Very realistic.  A good, if not short, experience.\n\nCons:  I figured out the 'plot twist' about 45 minutes into the game.  I played it for nearly 2 hours just to go through the steps.  The ending was very disapointting...because there is no ending.  There is no conclusion.  At some point an instant message pops up from some person who asks if you've figure everything out.  If you say yes, it tells you to meet them for some coffee and you can talk about it.  You close out the program and it takes you to the title screen.\n\nConclusion:  This could have been a really cool detective game, if her story was just the opening to get you used to the game, if they had multiple cases that were cold cases that you would go back through, draw up a conclusion for prosecution, I could have really gotten into it.  As it stands, this game feels like I paid for a demo, and it was very anti-climatic in my opinion.\n\nI have mixed feelings about this game.  On the one hand I want to give it a thumbs up, because it's a refreshing, entertaining story that accomplished what I think it set out to do, on the other hand, I wouldn't have purchsed this game if I knew that there was zero replay value and it lasted me only two hours (and that's me really stretching it out.  I could have been done in 45 mins).  It just ended up being a letdown.  It's one of those purchases where the phrase "If I knew then what I know now" applies, but on the other hand, I wouldn't have known if I hadn't purchased.  It all comes down to just how curios you are or how little self control you have.\n\n\n","August 3, 2015","false","2.4"," 93 of 164 people (57%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","57","93","164","3","0"

The story and narrative are, imho, pretty great and manage to stay enthralling even as you necessarily uncover them out of chronological order. There's lots to watch and you'll be faced with mature themes, sordid stories, false leads or simply useless bits of info.The fact you only hear answers without the starting questions means you'll have to think about what you're watching to make full sense of it: more reasoning'll obviously be needed for you to find out leads and decide if and how they fit in the investigation. It's difficult to remember every possible keyword so taking notes'll help you remember what to search for and, for some, it might be a great external tool to organize leads and try to understand what happened.\n\nI have to admit that, at times, watching useless videos can get dull: of course they're there to make sure things don't become too easy but watching her answering how she wants her coffee each day isn't exactly fun. Depending on how good you are at guesswork and/ or your luck you might also find yourself stuck without knowing what keywords to use: other times you might have an hunch on what happened but find it hard to come up with the right word to find the video you're looking for. As a whole the system works though and I had no problem in finding enough leads to be given the option to exit the database and finish the game.\n\nHer Story'll sit well with fans of the detective genre as the basic gameplay found here is all about looking for clues and making sense of what you find, there's also a good story here for those that value narrative over gameplay: if you are in the target audience the game will be a rewarding and original experience, one I thoroughly enjoyed.\n","April 18","true","3.6"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

It reminds me quite a bit of Analogue: A Hate Story, in that it focuses on digging through an old computer database, trying to piece together the big picture from scraps and snippets of stories (though obviously they have very different subject matter, and Her Story uses live-action video instead of text). Part of the challenge is testing out your Google-fu skills and trying to figure out what search terms will uncover new videos. Then, even when you have most of the videos uncovered, you still have to try to piece together what you think happened.\n\nIf you're interested in unique, narrative-driven games, you should definitely give it a try.

I discovered this game via one of  MrNinjaSquirrel's reviews. His review was promising and I was interested so I spared the dime to try this game. It has been sitting in my library for a couple of months, then I realized that I had it. I decided to spare the afternoon, ended on sparing a whole day and a half.\n\nAt the start of the game, you find yourself facing an old computer with the data base of some video interviews by the same woman and told nothing else. You are only given the information that the whole video footages are destroyed due to an old fire - you read this from an old notepad file on the desktop - and you have to use the data base of cropped video pieces to learn furthermore. It seems that within a week's period in 1994 summer, a woman gave separate interviews to the police about a case. Who is she? What is her case? Why is she so damn important to you anyhow? What is Her Story?\n\nYou watch and LISTEN to the videos - I'm serious, listening is half of the game - , try and catch some key words, search them in the data base to reveal some more videos. Interviews are recorded as fragmented pieces with time stamps, so you can observe which one comes first. The tricky part is that your program is capable of displaying only the first five entry in the data base for each searched word. You have to find alternative word choices to reveal all videos to gather enough information about the gist of what's going on.\n\nI have to warn beforehand: this game is for the patient and the story driven only. In the sense of game mechanics, all you do is type some words on a search bar and watch videos as they appear based on the search term. If you decide to organize the videos on a linear timeline to try and understand the unfolding of events, good luck. I tried, and successfully managed - and fed my OCD to its limits meanwhile. The resulting story was a total mind blown!\n\nLittle nuances, body language and word choices of the woman, fragmented tales gathered together to make a whole adds up to a genuinely award worthy game! The actress Viva Seifert's performance alone makes Her Story an experience to remember. It would possibly be self-explanatory to mention the name Sam Barlow also. He is the writer and director of our marvelous interactive story, also known for games such as Silent Hill: Origins and Silent Hill: Shattered Memories.\n\nIf I were to write any more about this game, I could not possibly restrain myself from revealing some kind of plot point and wreck your future experience with the game. I suggest you to pick a friend to accompany you while you play this, who should be equally patient as you. Deducing theories and guessing the truth behind all these fragments was my favorite part. So basic, yet also so satisfying.","August 21, 2015","true","9.2"," 31 of 52 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","31","52","0","1"

But don't expect something in style of Dear Esther or similar games, this time it's something absolutely different and unique for current indie game scene. You get an access to the old police computer, where are videos from interviews with... her. Yes, her, I mean that awesome actress you can see all over the screenshots. And she's suspected of murdering her husband.\n\nI think this is the first time I've been playing an FMV game but I've been enjoying it a lot. Game itself doesn't offer any typical challenge, it's up to you in what order you'll see the interview videos and when you'll decide that you know enough - but those who would be interested in complete story, will spend more time for sure, I'd say about 4 hours (and I'm not counting the time discussing speculations about details of the story on forum afterwards).\n\nIn the end, I had a desk full of papers with my written thoughts about her interviews (small spoiler: she will be contradicting herself sometimes) and I still wasn't sure about all the things she said but already had watched all the videos. The script is written and acted awesomely, you will feel like everything was real. If you are interested in this (new) way of gaming experience, definitely buy and play it, you won't regret it.\n\nPros:- Great acting. Viva Seifert played her role awesomely.\n- Her story is more complex than it may seem on first look. You'll get drawn into the game to understand everything.\n- New videos are accessed by keywords. You have to think about logical links of the whole story to access more videos, it's not just a primitive slideshow of videos.\n- Cool retro design. Including the old CRT monitor graphic filter, that you actually can turn off if you don't like it.\n- Steam achievements. Also achievement hunters might be happy that you will get there 100% pretty easily.\n\nCons:- Arranging some clips that are splitted into more smaller videos felt inconvenient, but I believe that could be also part of the retro design.\n\n\nFor more reviews, join Samurai Vader's Point of View group and follow my curator page, I'm always happy to see feedback about my reviews.","January 9","true","7.5"," 24 of 39 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","24","39","0","0"

Progressing in this manner you can get the gist of what's going on in about twenty minutes. And once you figure out the basic idea of the story, it's not clear why you should bother continuing.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/recommended/368370/","Humanure","Belphegore","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/","1598 products in account","Her Story is an interactive FMV game where you take on the role of an (initially) unknown person who is sifting through video footage at a police station. Throughout the duration of the game, you sift through a little over 300 video clips of several interviews from 1994 of a British woman named Hannah, who is overly obsessed with fairy tales. By the end of the clips, the player will have a full understanding of what event had transpired, and also who they are within the game.\n\nI'll admit, the main selling point of this title for me was the fact that it was made by Sam Barlow. I'm a huge Silent Hill fan, although Shattered Memories is far from my favorite. Unfortunately, Her Story does not live up to even a fraction of the hype that has surrounded it since its release date in 2015, nor has it lived up to the potential of Sam Barlow. The title is little more than a glorified movie on Steam, masked as an FMV game. "But Belphegore, it's full motion video you idiot!" you may say, and I get that; I've played my share of FMV games, emphasis on the word game. Her Story barely qualifies as an FMV game, and the content that you acquire for the price is not justified.\n\nYou will begin Her Story with no direction on where to go or how to play. Basically, you will type "keywords" into a search bar to load up videos of the several interviews that are present. The title limits you to only having access to 5 videos at a time, so you must either delete or modify the keywords in order to filter them out of a certain search term. However, this only true gameplay element is voided by the fact that you can access every single video in the database by using the keyword "blank", and it's easy to figure this out early on. Once you're done watching every single video clip, which range anywhere from 1 second in length to 2 and a half minutes, the game is over.\n\nYes, so once you've watched the whole movie within the game, the game itself is over. There's no piecing together evidence to try and convict this woman of murder, there's nothing else at all. The "add to session" feature, which will add clips of your choosing to a timeline of events bar, is completely useless and unnecessary; it's only there to try and make the player feel like they have something to accomplish when they actually don't. This game is being marketed as a "detective" game, but you do not even play as a detective; nor are you solving any crimes or mystery! A good half, or maybe even more, of the video clips are useless, even in terms of building a character-audience relationship.\n\nThe more I think about it, the more I honestly feel like I was scammed by Her Story. I paid for a detective game, not a glorified movie with a search box that will give you every single video off of one keyword. The title literally has no point whatsoever, other than making it to the end of the clips; to which the entire plot is ultimately revealed with a slight twist. I will give the title this, though, the main actress does a fantastic job. That is the only positive thing that I can take from Her Story. Beware the hype and positive reviews, purchase now if you want a 2 hour movie.\n\nRating: 1.5/5.0 - It's bad.Belphegore's Hell House Reviews (Group)","February 14","false","2.5"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","0"

All cleverness started coming out as pretension, all nice details turned to filler,  and further foreshadowing felt like it was being tossed at your face.\n\nI just think the game is too long and too unnecesarily obtuse to survive as an interesting experience, once the mistery is sorted out.","July 30, 2015","false","4.2"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","14","22","0","0"

The player cannot hear the questions, but can type search keywords, as all videos are full text indexed. The interface is pretty limiting and deliberately made to look like some archive software from that era. Up to 5 results per search terms can be accessed and you can keep bookmarks but can’t delete them. You can also add your own keywords.\n\nWatching the clips tells a non-linear story, and the ability to understand it depends directly on the search term the player comes up with. The story gradually becomes clearer the more videos you watch, but even if you manage to watch all of them there’s more than one possible interpretation. If you’re looking for chewed up ending, you’re not going to get it here, but there is closure (or at least that’s how it felt to me).\n\nThe game is great for “over-the-shoulder co-op”, where two or more people consult about the story, try to think together about new search terms and exchange theories about what happened. Needless to say, only one person needs to actually type the keywords. It’s also advisable to write down findings and revisit the more hard to interpret clips with these additional findings in mind.\n\nThe game may not sound so interesting and the screenshots sure aren’t appealing, but the interesting story and the great acting by Viva Seifert turn it into something very unique and captivating. Highly recommended.\n\n\nNote: I did not play this game for 20 hours. Steam continues to count also when a game is minimized. The typical game times for this game (according to HowLongToBeat[howlongtobeat.com] are between 3 to 6 hours. If you want to find every possible clip, you're likely to surpass these times, but not hit double digit hours.","August 25, 2015","true","20.2"," 26 of 45 people (58%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","58","26","45","3","0"

It was nagging at me that I could not understand this game at first, and I wanted to know exactly what you are supposed to do in this damn game. I begin looking through the search engine and watching clips again wondering what was going on, and by chance I had discovered a huge revelation about the game that completely turned Her Story on it's head.\n\nIt was surprising to see my innate assumptions about this murder case get blown out of the water, and even then it just continued to slap around my unfounded conclusions as to what was actually going on. The games plot has serpentine twists that remind of me of the early works of M. Night Shyamalan film. I found my self going back to my personal video archive to cross reference new footage, and then finding even more revealing tidbits helping me piece together the entire narrative of the story.\n\nThe closest analogy I can compare as to what kind of gameplay experience Her Story contains would be that of taking a 1000 piece puzzle, opening the box, and dumping the pieces on your table. Digging through each piece until you find the ones that connect, and the connecting the chunks of information you have, all the while looking at each piece for every minute detail. You can not rely on merely observing the same patterns over and over. You have to pay attention to whats being said, certain details and clues, the appearance of the subject, the times and dates of the videos, everything. I definately think keeping a pad and paper is a requirement for this game, because once you start digging deep into this game you will need it.\n\nWhenever you engage in something, you have a preconceived notion of how something will work; there is always a structure and a expectation of how to interact with that structure. Her Story tears this expectation down not only in how you experience the content, but how you engage with the structure of Her Story as a video game. The game does not hold your hand and lead you on a linear path to understand how the story gets from point A to point B. Other than a couple of readme.txts placed inside of the game. it does not really tell you what you are doing, or why you are doing it in  the first place. The game does not time you, the game does not grade, the game does not give you a score or tell you what you have accomplished. The game does not give an elicit definition of the challenges and roadblocks that will set before you. Only when you have researched and observed enough significant videos to give you a understanding of what exactly happened during the murder of the man named Simon will the game nudge you into giving you an answer, and once that happens you will know exactly what Her Story is.\n\nOne of the criticisms I have seen is "Her Story is not a game! It's just a bunch of FMV clips!". I have noticed people who say this have put only an hour or less into Her Story. As much as I don't like being dismissive of people's personal opinions I have to say it...their opinion does not matter. They have not put in enough time to understand what this game is. It is definately a game. It will challenge you, it will make you think, and most of all, you will have fun. Considering it accomplished all of these parameters for myself, along with a sense of personal satisifaction for getting to my own personal conclusion and closure of the game, I have to say this is a very good game.\n\nPositives-\n\n-Enthralling Story\n-Immersive Experience\n-Ambiguous Nature of game leads to satisfying investigating\n-Wonderful perfomance by Viva Seifert\n-Tense and atmospheric\n-Engaging and entertaining plot twists\n-Incredibly detailed in its clues and hints\n\nNegatives-\n\n-Does not immediately grab attention\n-must be focused and pay attention at all times\n-Ending may not be satisfactory for some people\n-Not for everyone, will have a niche audience\n-It's ambiguous nature and lack of solid instruction\nmay confuse and turn people off\n-requires a solid investment in the story which some people\nmay not have\n\nI can completely understand why some people may not be into this type of game. It definately can be out of a lot of peoples comfort zones, but those who do 'get it' have be come rabid fans of this game, discussing theories and plot points feverishly. I would highly recommend this game if you are into FMV games, investigative police work, murder mysteries, and early M.

The game itself takes the form of wrestling with dated software and its extremely limited ability to present disorganized, decontextualized short clips of video ranging from about 3 to 90 seconds. They're at least transcribed so word searches will check against the transcripts, but without meaningful tags, organization by chronology or subject, or any way to easily remove red herrings from your painfully limited search results. So the real "game" of Her Story is understanding your interviews, putting them into context, seizing on hints for further search terms, and coming up with your own.\n\nBut there's a problem. This is a game that lives and dies by its deliberately hobbled search mechanics, but a glaring oversight by the developers makes it possible to power through everything in chronological order without ever scratching your noggin. And it's a trick simple enough that I thought of it within the first few minutes. You have to consciously avoid using it if you want the story to unravel in roughly the direction the developers intended.\n\nOne last warning: This isn't some classic detective whodunnit. There's some mystery and ambiguity to it all, but the real object is to find out "what happened here," not to collar the bad guy. And if the Steam forums are any indiciation, any idiot can come to a conclusion about what happened, even if it's not backed by evidence or even basic common sense. With no moment of truth, no public accusation, and no grand reveal, Joe Dumbass's "a dragon did it at the behest of the Freemasons" theory gets treated just as valid as your well-reasoned, evidence-backed analysis.\n\nAll that said, Her Story tells a pretty good tale with some wonderful acting, and it's a delightful experience to have the oldschool frustration of computer research become a set of game mechanics. Pick it up on a sale.","July 17, 2015","true","3.9"," 15 of 25 people (60%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","60","15","25","3","0"

What starts out as something that seems quite simple, turns into anything but.\n\nWhoever the single actor was, she did a damn fine job.

Stay off the forums until you have finsihed the game/formed your own opinions.\n\nThe amazing thing is, that while this is a top-notch experience, they actually managed to sneak in a good amount of actual game elements.

This way you can put it easier in order and even assign it a positional number.\n\nNow, I guess the idea is that you hear about new keywords in the clips, and then you search on with them so you get the complete interrogation. But that's not how it works.\nAfter bruting for 5 hours I noticed a major flaw there with which you can just cheat through the game really (I'll mention that one at the bottom again).\n\nThe Story itself\nStorytelling is good and it probably wouldn't work too well if you just watched it in chronological order. But even then it would still be a good story.\nThe issue is, the storytelling doesn't work at all if you spoiler ahead by accident really because you find a clip which is set on the last day.\n\nSo really, it doesn't work either way.\n\nNow, your best bet in my opinion is to not play the game at all. The gameplay is crap anyway, it's just a time waster at best. Just watch a longplay on Youtube instead.\nOR - there's a flaw in the game that let's you get the clips in chronological order easily. Just reset the whole thing, search for blank. That gives you the first 5 clips because that's the default keyword.\nChange that keywords to 1,2,3,4,5 - search for blank again. Keep on going with 6,7,8 - you get the idea.\n\nBottom line. Nice story, ♥♥♥♥ game. They ♥♥♥♥ed it up big time.\nThe game could work, I'm convinced.

On their own, each component would not be as compelling. Sitting at a virtual computer from the 90's typing search keywords into a database might recall school research trips to the library. The videos themselves, the meat of this game, would lose some of their sense of mystery and nearly all of our personal investment in them if we were allowed to view them all at once in sequence. However, in pairing these two, this game created something new; something that made me feel more like a detective than any game, show or book has before.\n\nUnlike the game's structure, the story told within the videos is far from simple. Without spoilers, the things this woman talked about in these police interviews kept me interested and engaged. Who was this woman and how did she view the events that led her to where she was? As I pieced things together, sometimes new information would come to light that made me rethink what I thought I knew. Enough care and detail was put into these videos to make them seem real, like I was getting a peek into one woman's life.\n\nNone of this would have worked without good writing, acting and production of these videos. Various industry publications have nominated and given awards to Her Story for these aspects. How the interviews are divided also deserves credit. You never learn too much from a single video, but usually you get enough to trigger new ideas for keyword searches. Some of these divisions do get frustratingly short, though, making them difficult to discover and not very informative. They're realistic from a police interview perspective, but this realism comes at a cost to the gameplay that I don't think is worth it.\n\nToward the end of the game the pace begins to sputter as the number of unwatched videos grows small. No longer did I feel like a skillful detective picking up on details and then using them to uncover new information. Instead, I eventually felt like I was grasping at straws, hoping to get lucky. This may very well only be a problem for completionists like me that don't like to use guides if they can help it. I strongly suggest that you play the game until the pace at which you are finding new footage begins to bother you and then go find a guide for 100% completion. There are some videos that only have one spoken word in them that I'm fairly confident I NEVER would have found without help.","May 12","true","8.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

Full Motion Videos in games aren't exactly a new thing, but the gameplay mechanic of this is.\n\nYou watch through interrogation clips of a british woman and try to piece the puzzle together in your head. You can use search function to bring up the clips, you type in a word and every video with that word comes up. But you only have acces to five at a time, so to narrow the search results you need to add another word. And of course these clips wont tell the story in chronological order so here is where the puzzle part comes.\n\nI might have been too hyped about this game from the disussions and reviews so the ending didn't quite feel satisfying enough. I also didn't get the story as a full on my first playthrough, so that might have affected my feelings about the game too. But I did go back to find all the videos. And liked the story overall.\n\nIt's hard job for an actor to be the whole focus of the camera all the time, people pick up everything you do and say. Viva Seifert did good job on her perfomance. Also the the look of these old videos added to the authenticity and mood.\n\nI can't really recommend this game to everyone. If you are looking for more traditional game, this might not be for you. But if you are tired of all the shooting, platforming, min-maxing and want a fresh take on what videogames can be, you should try it!\n\n[Score: 74]","July 7, 2015","true","4.6"," 15 of 27 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","15","27","0","0"

A lot of so called "unique" games have a few features that set them apart from your usual AAA or Indie game but I've never ran into something quite like this.\n\nIt's extremely difficult. I was playing this side by side with my girlfriend and we found almost all of the clips except for a few that required quotations. I can really appreciate a game that is hard by nature, not hard because of a hidden trick or cheap "gameplay".\n\nThe story (her story, ahahaha, kill me) is engrossing and you won't want to stop searching & playing, if this is your kind of experience.\n\nThe music is great, it really builds a sense of dread and it seemed like certain bits of music would play after specific discoveries. I think this was my favorite part of the game, it really pushes the severity of what happened in the game.\n\nPlenty of people have said that the acting is bad but I don't think it is, I really believe the acting is superb and was supposed to be unbelievable, you're speaking and watching someone who is obviously hiding something. That's something that is lost on a lot of people who play this.\n\nCons:\n\nIt's not really a game, at all. If this is a game, then Ask Jeeves was a game where I never got any achievements. I feel robbed by Jeeves.\n\nThere's no clear ending.\n\nIf there was ever a game that's "not for everyone", this would definitely be it. I may love it but I completely understand why a lot of people wouldn't. Those people aren't wrong either just because I adored it, it's just not their cup of tea, if you will.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThere's been a lot of back and forth, with a lot of vitriol, about how Her Story isn't a video game and people must have been paid for their reviews but that is not the case here. The gaming community has had to deal with so many "games" that are just terrible experiences lately, like Gone Home and a few others. This isn't in that category, there is no motive behind this game and no commentary, besides that someone has been murdered and it's up to you to piece the story together.\n\nHonest to god, I really, really, really loved this game. I wish this was in episodic chapters, as there would be more material and "stories" to discover. As someone who plays your usual shooters, beat-em-ups and even JRPG's, I went into this game thinking I might hate it but the complete opposite happened. I will go on record saying this is the most unique video game I've ever played and most importantly, one of the most entertaining. I received this game as a gift from a good friend and all I can say to him is thank you for it, I won't be forgetting Her Story for a long time.\n\n\n\nScore: 9 out of 10","January 18","true","4.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

These 7 interviews detail the background of the candidate's missing husband. Viva Seifert, the interviewee, won numerous awards for her superb acting in this game, helping it become one of the most popular indie games in the summer of 2015. Even though I don't have many hours logged into this game on Steam, I have previously completed it with a friend.\n\nGameplay\nWith nothing much to start with, you first bootup the police video database and begin to watch a few seemingly non-interconnected clips, sporatically taken within the seven different interviews. Your job is to type in keywords discovered throughout your investigation in order to pull up other unseen clips. Some of these keywords are fairly obvious, such as: Hospital, Husband, etc., yet others are extremely obscure (the final keyword). A database tracker helps you visualize which/how many clips you have seen, and if you are getting close to the final tapes (in chronological order).\n\nInterface\nThroughout gameplay, there will be an active session of 5 or so clips, and if there are more than 5 clips for a search result, you must view some of them in order to have access to the rest. A very helpful feature is that notes can be added for each clip. This really helps if you leave and want to pick the game back up down the line. The depth in this game is magnificent, yet the UI can still use a lot of work. Other than that, this unique story is truly a masterpiece.\n\n==== Shortcut ====I would not advise using this method to play the game, yet if you have beaten the game and want to view every tape, this method shown below will help you do that in chronological order.\n\nEvery clip's note has the word BLANK written inside of it as a default setting. If you search for BLANK, the database will continue to pull up every video you have not seen. This method only works if you add a note (i.e. a number) to the video you just watched, so that it will no longer come up as a result.\n\n==== Score ====\nGreat\n- 9/10","May 31","true","0.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nofault/recommended/368370/","nofault","Daddy's Little Girl","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nofault/","50 products in account","Allow me to start off this brief review by establishing one fact: this game is brilliant. Part of this brilliance is that it isn't a traditional sort of game, but rather an entry in the recently emerging genre of 'narrative games'. I went into this game knowing absolutely nothing, and I believe this is possibly the best way to experience it, so I will avoid spoiling that to anyone who might actually be reading this.\n\nIt is important to know that you're in front of a computer throughout the entire game; investigating a murder case by watching over 200 (short) video clips segments of seven interviews, all of the same woman (the victim's wife). That's about it. To find particular clips you must search key words. Depending on the word you type into the game, a list of videos may show up, each a short segment of one of the interviews with the deceased's wife. To understand what happened, you must watch the clips, listen out for other key words (usually names or objects) and then search for those as well. In the end, all the pieces come together and this intriguing tale makes sense.\n\nThis is a fantastic detective game which completely stands out tall from other games with a similar premise.\n\nHighly recommended.","July 27, 2015","true","7.5"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

XD\nThe game presents itself in a very minimalist form: you directly see the desktop of a "windows 95-like" computer and a search engine window you should use to search and play clips from the police database. These clips are all related to a Murder and show small sequences of a girl under interrogation and you have to understand what really happened.\n\n+++Pros+++- The story. It's so intriguing the fact that you have to reconstruct the events from these short clips. It may sound simple and boring but I can assure you that the totally random way you may find clips make the experience very complicated, contradictory, difficult and deep at the same time. I came up with few theories often contradicting each other so I had to keep searching to understand the truth. And towards the end When you think you understand the story, everything loses importance with a couple of lines, kind of revealing a very small detail giving the whole story and situation a new unexpected perspective and with an important context.\n- The Gameplay. It's really simple: you have a search engine where you can write words thinking of tags or even part of speech. This makes the game a virtually unique experience for every individual, because when you see a clip you might think of a word or a clue or a name or a sentence to search for, while someone else could think of something else, hence the search engine will show different clips to different people. This makes the game addictive because you don't want to know more: you NEED to know more as the clips' order is not chronological, and you can hear everything and its opposite. Very innovative and intriguing.\n- Soundtrack. It's not really outstanding, but it is a really nice background during the "search engine" sessions ( it stops when you play a clip)\n- The "environment". It's funny how simple things give the game a little depth. You have some files on the desktop... And there's even the Recycle Bin too... With a couple of files deleted...\n- Reflection. You'll notice sometimes your own reflection on the screen in different ways: light neon flickering, Police lights with syrens. I admit I almost jumped off the chair the first time I saw it... I was somehow scared of a kind of horror turning, or something else... XD\n\n---Cons---- You're pretty much on your own. I must say it took me less than a minute to understand how it works but I admit it made me feel kind of... alone. You're simply thrown to the desktop and search engine and you're there. There's no dialogue with nobody else, nothing to do but search and play clips.\n- You don't have a system to put aside various clips to build back, piece by piece, the interviews as whole like a puzzle, maybe to see them from the beginning to the end. And this is somehow odd because that would really help a lot.\n- Gameplay. Yes, because there's a simpe (and lame ) trick to find and view all the clips in chronological order. And besides that you migh run out of interest if you believe you get what happened. You might be wrong and there will be no explanation or epilogue, just those "couple of lines" I've mentioned before revealing another imortant information but that's all. You might even have totally misunderstood the truth and you're gone. That's supposed to motivate you to keep on searching, maybe even all the clips, maybe in chronological order, but that doesn't seem a good way to set a game, where the story is the true essence. If the heart of the game lies in the story you MUST make sure the player ends the game with the awareness of AT LEAST the key events. But that's not assured as the conclusion script seems generated by the number of clips visualized, not by the Visualization of Important clips. I've solved this by viewing 100% of the clips, and by viewing the entire last day interview in chronological order.","January 19","true","4.1"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","8","14","0","0"

There is little to no hand holding, you're basically sat down infront of a computer with an email that says "here have fun investigating" and some rough Read-Me instructions.

I imagine if you were a Detective or an Investigative Reporter this is exactly what it would be like.\n\nIf you aren't interested in stories and want to go shoot someone in the head, this game is not for you. If you want someone to laugh at you from dark corners and then jump scare you, this game is not that either. Basically you've never played this game before.

I can't go into further detail cause that would spoil the entire game.\n\nThe game is made in the style of the classic FMV games. The entire style is very 90s and even the computer you use runs on the classic Windows operating system.\n\nGameplay is very simple. You are using an Police operating system to watch videos to gather pieces of the story. You have a search bar where you can input words and search for videos. There's also a flash game you can try out on the side. The gameplay is very simple and easy to get used to.\n\nAudio design is great. From the computer starting up and the nice soundtrack, to the very impressive audio design in the videos. Overall the audio design and the soundtrack are very impressive.\n\nGame is kind of short. The game is around 4 hours if you watch every video. There's not much replay value whatsoever. Overall this game is pretty much a one playthrough type game.\n\nThe game works perfectly, no bugs whatsoever. The only issue I could find is the steam overlay not working correctly.\n\nHer Story is an incredible experience. Every detective story or adventure game fan has to play this game no matter what.

The videos were taped in 1994, and they were digitised, transcribed and made searchable so that it would be easy to find specific parts of the interviews that could be relevant in court. However, the footage of the detective’s questions have been lost so there are only about 270 short clips of the woman’s responses. The clips are not accessible in a straightforward manner, but they are at least searchable so you can type in a keyword to get the clips where that keyword is mentioned. Sadly, only the first five hits for each keyword can be retrieved. From this you will try to figure out what actually happened in June 1994.\n\nFrom this description it is clear that Her Story is an unusual game. There is no other gameplay involved than typing keywords and watching videoclips, but it really works! It is not a straightforward story that is coming through the grainy taped videos, and I really wanted to know more about what happened. After finishing the game in a satisfactoily manner (actually watching all clips) I realised that I had spent more than four hours watching 90 minutes of photage of one woman responding to questions while enjoying it. This could only be possible through the excellent acting, and it may be the first time I think of excellent acting in a computer game. Well done Sam Barlow (creator) and Viva Seifert (the woman).\n\nThere an important flaw in the game idea of Her Story: it is certainly possible for a player to use certain keywords by chance and immediately receive crucial information about the case. Luckily for me, I seem to be very much into the other direction with watching almost all clips before getting a reasonable idea about the events. There is thus no guarantee that the order in which a player may see the clips makes sense from a narrative point of view. In addition there is absolutely no replayability value in a game of this type, but I think my experience from playing the game was so good that these flaws do not matter for me. I had four great hours!","January 15","true","4.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The story is doled out piece by piece through mostly cryptic video clips and lets you interpret things on your own as the picture gets more and more clear and cohesive.  The actress, Viva Seifert, does an admirable job with only a few extremely minor performance missteps that ultimately do not take you out of the moment.  The silly "ghost-like imagery" that pops up every now and then is unnecessary and distracting, but I understand the creators may have felt it necessary to keep the UI from being too static.\n\nI do wish the game had a "goal" to it, like a "whodunit" kind of mystery, but that just may be my desire for familiarity and nostalgia talking.  I had a great time piecing together the story and getting to know the character(s), which is the point of the experience.\n\nWhen it's all said and done, whether people enjoy the game or not, it will be looked back on as an innovative leap forward for the interactive narrative genre and is something everyone should at least be aware of.","January 16","true","4.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

There are two major twists to be found, and there's a lot of psychological drama. The actress performs quite well, and the story works even if it's a bit too far reaching at times. However, if you suspend your disbelief just enough (no, there's nothing paranormal about it, not like that) it does deal with some interesting themes.\n\nThere's not a lot of gameplay to speak of, as you can see.

Knowing how it ends (although a big plus is the 'opened ending', leaving you free for interpretation: basically, there're two theories and both have their point) makes you wanna run and cry into a pillow, because you already know all the secrets.

I found this an incredible breath of fresh air after decades of "hint" buttons superfluous story that may as well be ignored.\n\nThis title, with such minimalist pseudo-gameplay has, in my opinion, been the first to chart new territory of storytelling in an interactive medium since Spec Ops: The Line and Telltale's The Walking Dead, both back in 2012.

You're looking at a series of grainy videos from years past, recalling bad haircuts and embarrassing fashion choices. And her? She might be looking at being accused as an accessory to the murder of Simon Smith. Perhaps it's not so bad for you, in balance.\n\nSam Barlow's Her Story is a classic mystery game that subverts the 'choose your own story' genre for the Google generation (which my parents have caught up to now so perhaps I might even have them try this one out). Using a series of search words and phrases, you sift through a database of police interview videos captured many a year ago of one suspect: the titular 'her' in Her Story. Each video has been fully transcribed (in the background) so if a word is contained within it, it will show up in your search results. But it's not as easy as Googling, I mean typing in, 'murder' and 'suspect' and hoping to narrow down the field posthaste. Each video is loaded with a tantalising mixture of nebulous emotion, hard facts and delicious red herrings. The more you watch, the closer you get to the truth, or sometimes you find yourself going off on tangents on a hunch. There were a few times when I though I'd had it, only to discover a contradiction (which made me yell "Objection!" at the screen a few times) which required me to rethink my line of thought. This is amplified by the fact that the interviews take place over several days. The sense of time is palpable: the interviewee isn't in the same mindset every day so what you get out of her varies beautifully. It's worth mentioning that the acting by Viva Seifert is wonderful and makes the experience emotive and involving: there are times when she draws you into her confidence with throwaway lines and cheeky grins, and at times, she's in your face, telling you to go copulate with yourself. More colourfully, of course.\n\nPut on your best gumshoes, grow out that stubble (ladies included) and don a trench, as to you prepare to lose yourself to Her Story.\n\n\n\n","May 23","true","4.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

While it may not be for everyone, I found this game unequivocally immersive when compared to just about any game I've ever played, with a splendid and thought provoking story to boot. In this review I'll go through this games format, immersion factor, story, and some closing thoughts. It will be spoiler free, despite how much I want to share my personal opinions on what happened in this story.\n\nFormat While it may seem like a strange thing to do a bit on, this game has a format/display that I've never seen in a game before. I don't claim to have played every game ever made, but I'm pretty sure that it is because it has never been done. The main jist of this is that there are several videos  that you must find to gain knowledge on Her Story's- well, story. What do I mean by find? Well, the majority of your time in Her Story will be spent searching terms in a search bar. If the word/statements you feed into the system that contains the videos is said in the clips, those videos will show up. However, only 5 will show up at a time, so you can't just search "the" and get half of the clips. While many claim this to be a very boring and tedious system, I for one, loved this aspect because it plays to the-\n\nImmersion This game really makes you feel like a detective. In a very literal sense, because you actually have to speculate, pay attention to detail, and put up with a bit of frustration when you can't figure something out. Not many games do anything even remotely similar because most dev's are afraid that if they don't wave a shiny object in front of you at all times, you'll get bored and leave. This is what I've gathered to be the main criticism of this game, it can get dull if you aren't smart enough to figure stuff out or haven't created a system to try to document words you should search and terms you already have searched and thus have no reason to waste time researching them. I made a system of writing down notes (there is a space provided on each individual video clip), adding them to a viewed in session bar (provided in game) and then systematically going through each clip, marking them as used after using all the terms spoken in that clip. Again, not for all, but if you believe that tedious work can immerse you if done properly by rewarding it with valuable in game progress, you should have no problem.\n\nStory The driving factor of this game was by far the narrative. Each video watched gives you a minuscule part of the story, but enough to make you ask questions and want to pursue the ever growing list of leads on search terms. As a very brief explanation of the story, you are a person in a police database containing videos on a murder case that occurred in 1994. Every word spoken is by one woman, who has a whole lot to say about the whole situation. Gradually, focus will shift from the murder to what the game is really about- Her Story, which the murder is just a fraction of. It should be said that this story is eloquently crafted, and ends in a very satisfying way as long as you've derived some understanding of what the story is trying to tell you. As a hint, I'll let you know that lots of the narrative's details along with its ending is not set in stone, as it's left to the players interpretation, based on what they find the most believable and satisfying.\n\nFinal Thoughts All in all, this game took me close to 12 hours to complete. I'd say that depending on how you play, anywhere from 5-15 hours could be extracted from Her Story. This is due to player freedom and the ability to beat the game when only having found 50% of the videos, however I found them all before making the decision to end it. Get to 50% completion and you'll know what I mean by that. For the cost (I spent close to $3 on sale) it was one of the best bang for my buck purchases I've ever made. I'd absolutely recommend this game if you think it's design and structure won't bother you, whether it's on sale or not. If you are persistent and organized you'll be able to find all of the video clips. Out of the 200-300 clips I was only not able to find 6 without external assistance. Finding some of the final clips is satisfying and hard fought, but I got to the point where I couldn't find anything after near an hour, and it was then that I decided to search the web for some search terms I had neglected to notice or find reason to search. All in all, I'd say this game is completely worth your time and money if you are not fazed by the confusing layout.\n\nPersonal Rating: 9/10","February 20","true","11.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

There's something really riveting about realizing that certain words are coming up repeatedly, and the longer you delve into the statements, the more you become aware of just how much work had to have gone into scripting the dialogue for this game so that each video would branch into the others in a semi-planned manner. Each time you find a new video, there's this great little sense of accomplishment, and the video itself is the reward. The interface is brilliantly appropriate and simple, and although there's an option to save clips for future reference, I personally find just writing keywords down on a notepad is easier. Her Story has a lot of twists and turns as you piece it together, and those moments where your entire view on the situation changes are really difficult to pull off in any narrative, so I have a lot of respect for this game. Definitely worth the purchase, especially if you like mysteries or language puzzles.","January 8","true","6.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Her story invaded my personal time. This doesn't usually happen but I have to love which ever game does it to me. "The Tetris Effect" as they call it but a bit deeper. Like when you're waiting for the next episode of whatever you watch to come out and you form a little fantheory about it. It quickly becomes your expectation, a void being filled in an entirely separate universe from what will eventually be canon.\n\nBut where's the "game" part. That's not a question, I'm not asking it. It's a demand from kids who don't yet understand that all games are created. Her Story is one of those games where you are forced to create your own game, and I say forced only as that's how I feel at night when I'm trying to sleep and I can't help try to figure out exactly what happened with Hannah that night. And that other night... god, what about Saturday? That drive to Glasgow... her daughter?

At least, that's what my Steam stats show for playing and completing Her Story - a genuine surprise amongst overwhelming freeplay embarassments and clickfest messes.\n\n4.2 hours. It started simply enough - a recommendation on Kotaku, a follow-up search showing generally positive reviews. A brand new laptop. A desire to play a bit away from my usual console comfort. A fond remembrance of FMV titles from when I first started gaming, ranging from the Mad Dog McCree laser games in the arcades to my beloved The 7th Guest and Tex Murphy. Finally a decision to purchase. $5.99. Reasonable.\n\n4.2 hours. Hmm. That comes out to more than a buck an hour. But is that a fair assessment? There is a reason I don't go to the movies anymore - I can wait for all but the biggest to come to Blu Ray or HBO. A movie could average $5 per hour, and I'm not willing to pay that. Recently, with titles like Dragon Age Inquisition and The Witcher 3, the cost per hour is supremely lower for an amazingly outstanding experience, in the 50 cent or lower range. That is amazing. But again, with Her Story, is that fair?\n\nLook. It all comes down to enjoyment. And boy did I have that in spades. From the ancient 80s interface to the surprisingly lack of frustration given the minimalist instructions and direction. It just all made sense. It just worked. It was really, simply fun.\n\nCan you imagine what would happen if the actress, Viva Seifert, wasn't able to pull this off? It's a one woman show (he says with a knowing wink) and she addresses the challenges exceedingly well. I catch myself here, desperately wanting to discuss futher but knowing to spoil the tale here is to spoil the entire game. And there simply isn't enough time. We only have\n\n4.2 hours. Completed everything except the odd 2-player game thrown in as a...what? An example of previous programming achievements? A toss back to that same era? Would a cop really have a two player game like that on a crime database computer? Again - 2 player? (Psst. There's an achievement tied to this game. Seriously. Only thing I didn't finish.)\n\nSo do I recommend this? Yes. It won't be for everyone. It requires a bit of patience, a bit of deduction, a bit of appreciation for the old, the retro knowingly popping its head up brilliantly. It requires some suspension of disbelief, and more maturity than many may have, regardless of age. It's not deep, not really. And the trick is a single-ride pony - heck, the game said I was done much earlier than I was ready for. But with that said, yes, I still recommend this. I enjoyed it. The ride was refreshingly clean, the mind trip left a conundrum for longer than it should have been, second and third-guessing continued and I loved that as well. Give it a try. It won't take long.\n\n4.2 hours.\n\nGive or take.","August 1, 2015","true","4.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/grizwalter/recommended/368370/","grizwalter","tomatoes.dll","http://steamcommunity.com/id/grizwalter/","345 products in account","I rarely take time out to review games, usually because I figure nobody truly cares about my opinion in such matters, but more importantly because if I enjoy a game enough to want to praise it, I'm too busy playing to take the time to write.\n\nHer Story is the ultimate exception.\n\nFirst and foremost, let it be disclosed that I have not yet finished the game; I do not need to in order to feel confident in this opinion of the game. (For the record as well, I am not sure how exactly one will know when they've "won" the game, but that is for me to find out, and I excitedly tread forward to that end!)\n\nThere is no need to describe the game, I'm sure, as anyone can find that either in other player reviews, or those online by the "pros." What I can say is that a game called Cloud Chamber came out last year, and while flawed in many ways, was a very new and interesting experience. If any reader is unfamiliar with that game, I suggest you take a look. At the time, I remember hoping more of the same would come in the world of gaming, where absorbing information, storytelling on the grandest of levels, but with mystery beneath the hood would evolve; nothing gives me the same sensation as trying to solve a puzzle as actors play the roles. In Cloud Chamber, the roles are played superbly, by the numerous characters of the story, and an excellent story it is.\n\nHer Story has been the first answer to my hope that more of the same would come, and also improve the formula.\n\nHer Story is one of the most basic of games; it simplified everything Cloud Chamber did, yet made it more accessible. The player has more command over discovery--over the pace of the game--and observation is less passive, and more active from moment to moment.\n\nThe actress who plays as the sole "character" is outstanding, and players will likely develop a love/hate relationship, for reasons hard to describe without a spoiler, so I leave it to the readers to test that emotion themselves.\n\nEvery game I've ever played has a flaw, and quite often more than one, but frankly, Her Story has absolutely only one I can identify at this time. That flaw is in the use of what is called a "Session." This feature is, basically, useless in its current form. With that said, the developer has assured the community already that this particular feature will be changed to suit the purpose it should, which is organizing parts of an investigation, rather than just lumping everything into one long chain of things you either add or do not add to a "Session."\n\nIn order to enjoy Her Story, there are simply two requirements:\nYou'd better be ready to do a lot of tagging/organizing of information.\n\nYou'd better have a notepad to write down keywords in order to advance the investigation.\nIf both of those things are within your grasp, this is an absolute must play game!\n\n10/10 would barely do it justice. I hope more and more of this type of game evolve over the next few years. The last time I made that wish, Her Story showed up in my Library. I can not wait to see if I might be so lucky again!\n\nGrab this one!","August 1, 2015","true","5.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

Personally, while I see both sides, I definitely think that Her Story is something special.  The plotline can get frustrating because not all the details are revealed and you have to fill in the blanks as best you can with your own theories, but that's what I love about it.  I love that I felt like I needed a pen and paper to write out a timeline of events in the order in which I believe they took place, and then talk to someone else and realize that they came to a radically different conclusion.  It's only a few hours long, and finding the last few bits of story in the database can get really frustrating, but overall, I highly recommend it.","April 9","true","3.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xtechnetia/recommended/368370/","xtechnetia","» ∞ TDM xtechnetia","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xtechnetia/","71 products in account","Her Story is a game of playing detective: searching through random clips of a woman (played by Viva Seifert) being interrogated in an attempt to gradually piece together the full picture of what has occurred, and why.\n\nConceptually, it's interesting, and the game tries to make the experience as authentic as possible, giving you a Windows 3.1-esque interface with which to search the database with. If it's a good concept you're looking for, Her Story certainly has it - but I feel that the execution falters on a couple of levels.\n\nOn the gameplay level, the restriction to five videos per search gets rather annoying, especially when new keywords aren't always easy to come up with. It seems like a necessity, to avoid trivializing the game (you'll realize this if you think to input a blank search, which returns all videos), but it doesn't improve the experience any.\n\nBut more significantly, on the story level, the game feels a tad unsatisfying.\n\nI won't say too much even behind spoiler tags, but essentially, what the precise state of affairs is with regards to the interrogated woman, is never confirmed. Instead, after viewing enough clips, you receive a "call" asking if you're done; answering yes is your game ending, with a single, final revelation about the player character.\n\nHer Story is a game based on a concept and a story about a woman's life. If that overrides the questionable execution - both story and gameplay wise - then you'll like this game. For me, it didn't quite make it.","July 27, 2015","false","1.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/geoluz/recommended/368370/","geoluz","GeoLuz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/geoluz/","180 products in account","Her Story is such a unique game, quite unlike any game I have played in my life. This is an indie game developed by Sam Barlow and it is a detective game that is about the interrogation of a British woman suspected in the murder of her husband. It is a murder mystery that began in 1994 and is divided into many brief video clips. The woman’s interrogation/interview is divided into videos stored in the police database. You see what looks like a desktop interface from Windows 95 and the South East Constabulary logo.\n\nYour objective is to enter keywords to find video clips stored in the database to get an idea of the circumstances surrounding the death of her husband, Simon. The game begins with you entering the keyword ‘murder’. The keyword ‘murder’ leads you to a number of video clips to get you started on how to get acquainted with the police station’s search bar and how to get acquainted with the crime story. What is fun about entering keywords to obtain video clips of this female suspect is that it is so nonlinear that you can experience the story in different ways. Therefore, every player’s experience with the narrative will be different. Players will play FMVs in so many different possible orders. An entered keyword can bring up a video relating to the beginning, middle, or end of the narrative. You will learn about the different events in the woman’s life and the people who interacted with her prior to her husband’s death.\n\nWhat is amazing about the fragmented structure of the game is that each video is intriguing and made me want to find out more about her answers. Some videos feel like I need to find out more about her in a previous video that I had not played whereas other videos made me like I need to figure out the best keywords to bring up subsequent video clips to find new revelations and possible twists in this mystery. So, it feels like a jigsaw puzzle that you are trying to put together by putting videos together using creative keywords that you can figure out by watching and paying careful attention to videos you have already uncovered. The interface allows you to store video clips you have watched for possible later viewing again. Just when you think you figured this woman out, you feel like there are twists and turns in subsequent videos that make you feel differently about her. At one point, I felt some sympathy towards her in a series of videos, but in the next series I was highly suspicious of her because of the way she behaved in the videos. I later felt like she was delusional when answering some questions. So, I had mixed feelings about her as I was trying to put together this jigsaw puzzle of videos. There is a database checker app installed in the desktop that keeps track of how many videos you have found. This database checker shows green colors for the videos you have already watched and red for videos you have not yet watched.\n\nEntering keywords feels simple at the very beginning. However, the keywords get trickier as you will have to enter multiple keywords since the murder mystery seems to deepen as you progress through the story. I actually ended up writing hundreds of keywords on paper for future reference so that I can enter them to bring up more videos. Multiple keywords include word combinations relating to places, names, and times of the day. This game made me like a real detective trying to break the murder case wide open. However, some players may become frustrated as they get deeper into the narrative because of the greater need for word combinations in order to find the video clips they have not yet found.\n\nThe video clips appear to be recorded on VHS, which is a sign of the times back in the 1990s. The woman portraying the main character, Viva Seifert renders a superb performance, with her British accent being credible and brilliant. For a game with FMVs focused on one person and does not change screens, there is a lot of emotion and excellent sound design. I was left wishing that I could hear the questions from the detective since I was not able to listen to them. It is quite strange that a murder suspect would enter the interrogation room with a guitar and play a song in front of the detective.\n\nIf you feel like taking a break from the game, you can indulge yourself by clicking on the rubbish bin desktop app to play an Othello-like game, Mirror Tiles. There is an achievement called score draw that requires you to end the game in a draw, which is quite hard to do and requires lots of practice.\n\nI played a detective game titled L.A. Noire, a detective crime drama story that was very well done. However, I found Her Story to be more unique as a detective crime drama since it felt more realistic and emotional. This game has the drama of classic crime drama TV shows without all the shooting you are used to seeing on TV. Her Story is as interactive a detective story as any that I have ever played as you have control over what pieces of the story you will watch and in any order. I highly recommend Her Story to anyone, no matter what their favorite game genre is.\n\nMy Score: 9/10\n","July 19, 2015","true","9.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

The story of Her Story only works if the actress is believable and the acceptance of your mysterious blonde identity plugging away at an outdated computer. Viva Seifert is astounding and I tried my very best to uncover all that I could about her life. Accepting and utilizing the search function as best as possible is its own obstacle. The challenge is player created as there is no end game. Search terms come five at a time from keywords the actress uses or your own guesses and interests in her life.\n\nMy time with Her Story was extremely enjoyable until I hit a wall in my leads, searches, and patience. I used the game-given option to leave satisfied and the credits rolled. Afterwards, I went for all achievements and quickly quit the game. As I said, the second that you remove yourself from the story and play this as a game to complete to the end, it loses all interest and the remaining clips become an achievement trudge. Even though I hit a wall, I have to recommend this for how interesting and memorable this brief FMV clip searcher and watcher is.

It is nice to see some games that take chances and are confident enough to pull off a game like this. For me certain aspects remind me of Tex Murphy (One of the only good fmv games back in the day) and the old Police Quest games. While not quite as much gameplay as those other games, the vibe and atmosphere is there, along with a good performance by the leading lady. It might not have the level of depth or different gameplay mechanics as some of those other games, but it still is very enjoyable.\n\nSome might cry that this is not really a game and what not, but for me it is very much a game and a wonderful, unique and engrossing experience. I hope we get many more of these types of games in the future. Yes you sit at a computer and search for videos, but it is so much more than that. You really feel like someone who is going back to do some research of some old murder mystery. At times I wasn't sure if she was guilty or if she was innocent, being truthful or lying, that really says alot about the acting done by the main character in this.\n\nYou have to listen in this game and pay attention, put on your detective cap as you watch, listen and search for things on this computer that might help you. For the games price it is a must try, especially if you like mystery or muder mystery,etc..  Did you hear her mention someone new? Type that name into the computer to see any other videos recorded with that word used in it. Get in that chair, turn on this old computer from the mid 90s and get to work Detective!\n\nOn one side this game is unlike anything we have really ever had, but on the flip side it reminds me a ton of things I liked in the past (Tex Murphy, Twin Peaks, Police Quest, detective shows,etc..). Excited to see where the developers go next with this, I hope this is the start of a series or the first a large collection of smaller games. Maybe with a new murder mystery each time? Add in some more variety in gameplay and the possibilities are endless.\n\nFor 6$ this is a flippin' steal this has been one of the better, more interesting and unique games I have played so far this year. What it lacks in variety of gameplay it more than makes up for (and then some) with wonderful acting, great atmosphere and a sense that this is something special that is hopefullly spawn many more devs to take chances.

Recommended if you like to piece a story together from clues. Contains no action or overt puzzles, and very little interactivity - but the intriguing narrative, competent acting, and general sense of mystery are strong enough to create an enjoyable experience for curious and open-minded players.\n\n"Her Story" is an experimental game in which you explore a murder case from 20 years before. The game gives you a database of 270 short video clips that show the victim's wife during several interviews at the police station. Gameplay consists solely of entering search terms into that database, and watching the clips that the search resulted in, which will give you ideas for further search terms. There is no (obvious) way to see the clips in chronological order, and you only see the wife's replies to the detective's questions. You never see or hear the detective. Your task is to understand what happened those 20 years ago, and why.\n\nI found the story well-designed and interesting to explore - it provides a good amount of detail, you learn a bit about other characters and their backgrounds, and there are several revelations that kept me engaged and gave me a sense of progression. The non-linear presentation enhances the mystery (by never giving you complete information) and fosters immersion (by letting you feel like a detective exploring a set of data). The non-linearity also makes it possible to discover some very revealing bits early on, but the story is complex enough to not give all of its secrets away easily.\n\nThe acting of Viva Seifert is spot-on. This is not immediately obvious because her role doesn't give her many opportunities to show off - most of the time, she is supposed to play a realistic British middle-aged woman in a rather formal situation. But after closing the game, I realized that I had just watched the same single person talking monologues for 90+ minutes, without me ever getting tired of it, and without her ever giving me the impression that the scene was rehearsed. That's pretty impressive.\n\nThe game is quite short. All the clips combined amount to 95 minutes of footage, and you probably only need to watch one third of that to get the gist of the story. My own rather thorough playthrough took 2 hours, and then I spent two more for finding all the clips and getting one rather obscure achievement. It seems possible to "finish" the game in 45 minutes while understanding most (but not all) of the story. The game has no replay value, actually it defies the concept of replayability entirely. You cannot 'restart' a game that consists solely of collecting static information and piecing it together in your mind, though you can of course go back and look for more info, as long as you haven't seen all the clips already.\n\nThe game is heralded as being very innovative, probably more so than it actually deserves. "Dear Esther" experimented with non-linear storytelling 3 years earlier (though "Her Story" does it much better). "Tesla Effect" proved one year earlier that FMV has a place in modern gaming, and had much higher production values for its clips. "Cloud Chamber" already used FMV in an "explorable database" setting that was, due to the integration of social gameplay, considerably more innovative than its plain implementation in "Her Story". The main achievement of "Her Story", I think, is to condense the benefits of FMV into a minimalistic setting that allows for shooting 95 minutes of footage, and telling an intricate story, while still keeping the production cost low. Another potential achievement is that the game might be very appealing to people who aren't gamers already, but enjoy watching detective stories; it seems suitable for introducing TV watchers to the gaming hobby by adding a bit of interactivity to an experience they are already familiar with. The game does not require any gamer skills, they only need to observe, listen, and enter terms in a search box.\n\n"Her Story" has gathered considerable praise in the media, and consequentially some customer backlash. It's the usual controversy around an experimental game that gets hyped up to a mainstream audience, which may have different expectations about games. On metacritic, the game currently has a critics' score of 85, and a user score of less than 60, and the Steam forums sport several of the usual "this isn't even a game" complaint threads. I think that this particular complaint is silly - it reminds me of old people trying to tell me 30 years ago that Rock music wasn't music just because it didn't have the instruments or melodies they liked. But I can understand why "Her Story" may disappoint players who focus their gaming on action, overt puzzles, or traditional means of interactivity. If your enjoyment of a game depends on the presence of these things, then I don't recommend "Her Story" to you. However, if you appreciate a well-crafted narrative and good acting, and enjoy unraveling a "detective story"-type mystery by observing clues, then the game is definitely worth a try. In that case, give it a shot, it's not expensive. :)\n","December 9, 2015","true","4.2"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

I was very satisfied and pleased with my experience.\n\nIf you like full-motion video (FMV) and detective work, then you will enjoy this game. Note, however, that the game is very short, and can be finished in ~1-2 hours, depending on how quick you are (and whether or not you want to complete the video database). I really hope that more games like this are released, as the execution and presentation was very well-done.\n\nThe aesthetics are great because of the short FMV clips you can watch and listen to - the presentation of the computer interface is reminiscent of old-school IBM's, adding to the immersion of being a "detective" during pre-internet days. The background music is simple but nice, complimenting the relaxed gameplay and overall pace. The quality of the FMV clips is high, with good acting by the single story character (you only see and hear one person). I enjoyed the well-written story, however, one interesting (and unavoidable) possibility is you getting the story in an odd order because of the nature of the gameplay (which will be explained later in the review).\n\nControls are simple and will mostly involve you clicking the mouse and typing search keywords (as well as tags/notes to yourself). The tutorial is presented as a readme file on the desktop and explains how to play very clearly. The "goal" of the game removes any learning curve because you are free to play at your own pace and can quit whenever you are satisfied with what you have pieced together. It is highly recommended that you have at least an average understanding of the English language to fully appreciate the game.\n\nGameplay consists of you using different search keywords (and strings) to call up police interview videos, allowing you to construct the full story of a crime. For example, you can type in "knife" or "last night" and see if any hits come up. All of the interviews are transcribed, so any word that is said in a video clip (ranges from a few seconds to several minutes) can be matched. Initially, however, you are locked to the first 15 videos found, so generic words like "if" or "because" will make it difficult for you to view specific clips. There is an indicator to help you keep track of videos that are new, and you can save clips into your own playlist (I am unsure how to remove or reorder them). You can also tag videos to help you remember details - I tagged "critical" videos and tried to group videos together to help find common themes (like frequently-occurring events or names).\n\nWhile you play, a database program will assist you in keeping track of how many videos you have watched from the total pool (there are a lot). There is also a mini-game you can play in the Recycle Bin, as well as a clock program. For achievement hunters, the mini-game and database (watch every video in the pool) ones are the most difficult to get. If you do not care about achievements, you can beat the game well within 2 hours, even if you are watching most of the videos. Replayability is very low because you will already know the story of the game if you revisit it. I plan to get some friends to try it and watch their thought processes during the journey (especially my gf, who is working to become a police officer).\n\nOverall, the story and gameplay are extremely fun and interesting. This game, however, is not for everyone, and action-oriented gamers may find it to be boring. Depending on how you interpret the videos and what keywords you use to search, you may end up piecing together different parts of the story than someone else. For example, in my first 10 minutes of gameplay, I actually found a "critical" video that gave massive clues to the story (and ending), but I glossed it over because I did not have enough supplementary information to realize how important that clip was. Furthermore, I gave myself a red herring because I found a handful of videos that made me predict (incorrectly) the outcome of the story. Admittedly, I preferred my prediction over the true story, but it was still very well-written. I implore you all to try to watch as many of the videos as you can.\n\nThe game does not really “tell” you whether or not you got the story correct – in fact, you can quit whenever you want, and will even be asked if you understand what happened (picking “yes” exits the game) – and I feel like this was a great design choice because it leaves the responsibility on the player and his/her own interpretation of things. That being said, the game’s story is not overly difficult to puzzle together, so most people will be able to decipher everything within an hour or two. The journey to the ending is a fun and exciting one.\n\nIn conclusion, Her Story is a fantastic, albeit short, game that asks you to piece together an engaging story with many twists and turns, delivered in a refreshing way. Anyone interested in FMV and detective-based gameplay will surely enjoy this.\n\nHighly recommend!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews\n\nMy Website[theroguereviews.com]","September 2, 2015","true","5.3"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

I feel too often video game players are so quick to elevate game stories just because they're so often looked down on and that causes some exaggeration. It was a good story with some flaws. Telling a story completely through one-sided dialogue has its limits for how invested I become. The big reveal of the story is hardly original and borders on being a trope. Plus, it felt like I came to understand the main truth a little too quickly and easily. Some red herrings or other characters might have prolonged the mystery.\n\nThat said, there was a lot of skill in having the various parts relate to each other and tie in thematically. As I was going over the files a second time, I could see how certain phrases and events reveals a slice into the truth. This web was artfully woven in its completeness and cohesion.\n\nThe acting was well done for the most part but it really seemed like there should have been more emotion present at times, especially when certain people's fate becomes clear. The dialogue was well done overall but at times felt like it was trying a little too hard to be natural. Still, a good performance by the actress.\n\nThere truly is not much of a game. You simply query for words and unlock videos and watch them. The fun is understanding the mystery and the layers of that mystery. It would have been nice if there were documents or pictures that you could have viewed as well, to give a fuller experience (and it could have provided some misdirection to keep the mystery going).\n\nWhile the database query system is a bit of a conceit, it does make it so that players will have much different experiences based on what they view and when they view it. I definitely appreciate that. Of course, there really is not much replayability, especially if you've viewed all the videos.\n\nIt was a relatively easy game to get 100% achievements on, which is nice.

It's not a bad game and not a great one either. The idea behind is neat and the story is good. You don't need to use your brain to play it, since every keyword for searching the database can just be a random word out of a random video. It's not easy to unlock every single video (though there are tricks for that, which I used, because it's boring to just make guesses) but you don't need to anyway. I had the solution at around 30% of the the overall playtime and only continued playing to get the achievements.

Her Story is a mystery game, but is not linier as are most story games, including most mysteries.  In this game you are given guest access to a police interview recording data base for a cold case from the 1990's and absolutely nothing more. All the video files have full transcripts, and to search for files on a given topic you enter the word you believe might help you in your investigation, and it will return all videos which have that word in it... with one problem. Your pass to the police data base is a guest pass, and therefore if your search word was over inclusive you might get 112 hits, but will only be able to view the first 5. Therefore search terms  such as "it" or "was" won't be very useful whereas if you have reason to believe that she might have needed a gizmoidaphods you can enter that word and it will display all the clips containing that word, and since it is a less common word the results will likely be more manageable (in fact since it is a made up word I just now created, the results are likely to be null which is even more useless. But hopefully you get the point).\n\nThe game is short, but absolutely unique in concept and design. The story takes many twists and turns and harbours many surprises made all that more interesting by they are revealed to you out of order. It takes a really keen mind to take all the bits of evidence, put them in order, and come to an unasalable conclusion.\n\nThe game mirrors reality in one key way. It never tells you if you came to the right or wrong conclusion. As would be the case with any reasonable inspector whose sense of his own abilities are not over-inflated in such a case, there will always be that little nagging voice saying, I'm pretty sure I got it right, but what if there's something I missed or misunderstood? Thre's a lot at stake. Maybe I should sneek back and have another look at the evidence...\n\nMaybe this game has more replay value than I first thought.\n\nMy game budget became dramatcally smaller late last year, and my sense of a game's value has changed drastically as a result. Even though this game is short, I count it as having been worth every penny of its price, and even if life had do-overs I'd keep this game without reservation.\n\n10/10\n@@@@@ rosettes\n***** stars","July 3, 2015","true","36.6"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","11","21","0","5"

His wife, Hannah, approaches the police for help. It's clear that not all is right with her. It's up to you to find out what happened using only a collection of video clips from police archives. It's a simple premise that opens the door for rich storytelling.\n\nThis is a game by Sam Barlow, the man responsible for Silent Hill: Shattered Memories, a game acclaimed for its dynamic storytelling. Her Story, while obviously smaller in scale, manages to live up to the same standard.\n\nThe entire game is spent searching for video clips by inputting keywords into the archive. There's some guesswork and some puzzle solving involved, but not much else. This may be too simplistic for some, but for the purposes of telling an intruiging story, that's really all that's required. Viva Seifert's performance as Hannah is exemplary, the script is expertly written, and the plot's many twists and turns will keep you interested to find out more. And when you do finally find out the truth about Hannah, you will be at once disturbed and sympathetic. This is a hard feat to do, but Sam Barlow has managed this perfectly.\n\nThis is a game for people who love a good story. Nothing more, and nothing less. Suffice to say, if you need explosions on your screen every few seconds in order to be happy playing a video game, this game is not for you.\n\nAnother thing to note is that this game is not very long. I managed to reach the end in a few hours. Getting all of the achievements takes quite a bit longer, but either way, you're still getting your money's worth.\n\nAll in all, I am amazed at what an indie developer, armed with only a small budget and determination, can accomplish.\n\nHighly recommended.","July 5, 2015","true","10.9"," 13 of 25 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","13","25","0","0"

Either they lack an  active component at all, or it's completely disjointed from the story and we get the notorious 'lugoscababib discobiscuits'. Then there are games that get the narrative thing right and give the venue for engagement without falling into constraints of traditional game mechanics like Papers, Please, Gone Home (though I know it's too passive for some people) or MLA parts of Talos Principle. I was happy to discover that Her Story belongs to the second category.  It is surprisingly engrossing for something has the player watch a police interrogation pieced into hundreds video clips, which is the only storytelling medium this game employs. Players have  no significant role in the story (not explicitly at any rate) and yet, thanks to non-linearity added by the interactive dimension, what could have been just just above avarage short film if shown from beginning to end, is a truly great detective/mystery game.\n85/100","June 26, 2015","true","13.2"," 15 of 29 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","15","29","0","0"

I can see how some people might get bored because other than hunting down keywords, you are essentially just watching videos.\n\nHowever, if you like puzzles and crime mysteries its worth it to give this game a shot. I went through pages of notes listening to the story, drawing conclusions and loved the way the story is presented to you in a shuffled matter where you are slowly piecing together the truth in your head.\n\nCons:\nCan be a little tedious. I eventually stopped using the tag system at all and just took notes of keywords as if I was listening to the interviews myself and it helped speed up the process. This eventually turned into flow charts of different ideas. Flow charts are definately not something many gamers look forward to.\n\nIts possible to get to the conclusion of the plot while bypassing all the filler. Then, to see the end of the game, you have to go back and find all that filler through keywords you might have missed. Trying to follow the story by using keywords that go with the flow of the story might help to prevent this.\n\nPros:\n\nBelieve it or not, it's realistic. I actually had to organize police interviews for my local PD one summer and, funny enough, this was extremely similar for writing out reports.\n\nGreat story. If you like shows like Law and Order and other crime dramas, you would probably like the way this unfolds. Its dark, unsettling, and creepy.\n\nGood acting.

Short clips are made in a way of either revealing tiny bits of the story or sending you down the wrong path.\n\nIn Her Story I have found precisely the unrepeatable experience I look for in video games.

I can see how some people might get bored because other than hunting down keywords, you are essentially just watching videos.\n\nHowever, if you like puzzles and crime mysteries its worth it to give this game a shot. I went through pages of notes listening to the story, drawing conclusions and loved the way the story is presented to you in a shuffled matter where you are slowly piecing together the truth in your head.\n\nCons:\nCan be a little tedious. I eventually stopped using the tag system at all and just took notes of keywords as if I was listening to the interviews myself and it helped speed up the process. This eventually turned into flow charts of different ideas. Flow charts are definately not something many gamers look forward to.\n\nIts possible to get to the conclusion of the plot while bypassing all the filler. Then, to see the end of the game, you have to go back and find all that filler through keywords you might have missed. Trying to follow the story by using keywords that go with the flow of the story might help to prevent this.\n\nPros:\n\nBelieve it or not, it's realistic. I actually had to organize police interviews for my local PD one summer and, funny enough, this was extremely similar for writing out reports.\n\nGreat story. If you like shows like Law and Order and other crime dramas, you would probably like the way this unfolds. Its dark, unsettling, and creepy.\n\nGood acting. Even though you are essentially looking at one actor the entire time she still keeps it dynamic and interesting\n\nIn conclusion, this game would be a good fit if you have a personality type that is patient and logical with a knack for getting to the truth of the matter.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/overvulture/recommended/368370/","overvulture","Menacing Tentacles","http://steamcommunity.com/id/overvulture/","583 products in account","You can't really even mention this title anywhere without being bombarded by arguments that it's "not a real game", as if that actually matters. It's systematically downvoted and 0-bombed and trolled pretty much anywhere it's discussed and reviewed. I'm certain this review will end up getting a handful of automatic thumbs down from people who hate that this kind of thing even exists and want to fight against... whatever it is that it represents. As if this game being made and being successful means that every developer in the world is going to drop everything to try to imitate it. I don't get that line of thinking.\n\nReally, who cares? Whether it's a proper game or not, it's a unique experience that's highly experimental and plays with interactivity in a new way. It's not entirely successful in what it sets out to achieve, but it's interesting and it's cheap. I might agree with the notion that it's a bit overhyped. This wasn't really game of the year material for me so much as it was a fun diversion that was fun to unravel, with a cool idea on how to interact with a story. But I don't regret spending time with it, and I'm glad that we live in an era of gaming where developers can try new things that are worth talking about and debating.\n\nDon't take this one as the bold new face of indie gaming, because it's not. It's a story, most of all. One that you might get wrapped up in, or you might not. I love working out a mystery, so I did. The central mechanic works very well if you don't try to break it. That is, if you mostly follow the story as you discover pieces of it, searching keywords related to things you just discovered, or trying to fill in the gaps as things come into view. I've heard of plenty of people "breaking" the game by accidentally stumbling onto big revelations by guessing key words rather than following the trail of clues, but that doesn't mean you ruined iit. The big twists hidden away still leave a lot of holes in the story when you find them, and if all goes well, you'll feel a definite sense of the whole picture coming into focus as you explore the database.\n\nThe really cool thing it does, one that I thought worked well, is let the player define their own victory. It's easy to discover the biggest twist early on without meaning to, but even once you know it there are a lot of other details to fill in. While playing, I went from a fuzzy sense of what happened to a more defined picture, and without viewing 100% of the clips, I eventually found I could explain every little detail. Things clicked into place and I felt like I "won", even though the game didn't tell me that. Evoking a sense of personal victory without actually telling the player that they beat the game is just really clever, and is what makes this worth playing yourself rather than just watching someone else on youtube or whatever.\n\nIt's a good conversation piece, as well. The "ending", such as it is, can be interpreted in two different ways, so even once you've put together the overall story, it's worth searching for evidence towards one side or the other. I can see it as a good game to play with someone else, or to share experiences with afterwards. I liked what it did, and got a satisfying amount of entertainment out of it, and you might too if you're not hung up on the whole "not a game" thing.","February 12","true","5.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It is not so much a game as an experience. You, slowly, piece together a story through a series of video clips stored in an achieved database. You use search terms to bring up results of which only five are accessible. Having watched more clips you refine your search and over time piece together a compelling story.\n\nWhat makes Her Story interesting is the moments of understanding as you unravel another layer of the story. It is both satisfying and perplexing as each reveal creates more questions.\n\nThe acting is decent and nuanced enough for you to spot things you missed on you initial run through. The writing is good as well; the final jigsaw picture interesting and intriguing. However the genius of Her Story is in the design. The achievement of structuring the writing so that it allows the narrative to develop in a satisfying and engaging way while also accommodating the multiple search paths thousands of different players is incredible. The unique design is worth the cost as it is a singular experience.\n\nDefinitely recommended.","January 5","true","5.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I'll probably need to play something more melodramatic next. Anyway, unrelated to that statement, I enjoyed playing Her Story. Her Story is a game where you're at a computer and have access to a somewhat restrictive database of videos. All of these videos are fragments of on tape interviews that were conducted with a young woman who sometimes acts very shy and meek...then other times very playful and cynical... and the more keywords you plug into the search, the more videos and pieces of the story you get until you find out everything. The young woman does an excellent job acting and the game will certainly keep you working until you get the whole story (CHEAT OPTIONS: or you could just search "BLANK" and watch every video, if you're that lazy). Overall, I'd say it's worth a playthrough. There isn't any replay value and, as I've said so many times before, you could probably find bigger, deeper games on STEAM for the same price, but you're in the mood for a mystery or a puzzle(ish) adventure game, check it out!","July 26, 2015","true","6.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

It's systematically downvoted and 0-bombed and trolled pretty much anywhere it's discussed and reviewed. I'm certain this review will end up getting a handful of automatic thumbs down from people who hate that this kind of thing even exists and want to fight against... whatever it is that it represents. As if this game being made and being successful means that every developer in the world is going to drop everything to try to imitate it. I don't get that line of thinking.\n\nReally, who cares? Whether it's a proper game or not, it's a unique experience that's highly experimental and plays with interactivity in a new way. It's not entirely successful in what it sets out to achieve, but it's interesting and it's cheap. I might agree with the notion that it's a bit overhyped. This wasn't really game of the year material for me so much as it was a fun diversion that was fun to unravel, with a cool idea on how to interact with a story. But I don't regret spending time with it, and I'm glad that we live in an era of gaming where developers can try new things that are worth talking about and debating.\n\nDon't take this one as the bold new face of indie gaming, because it's not. It's a story, most of all. One that you might get wrapped up in, or you might not. I love working out a mystery, so I did. The central mechanic works very well if you don't try to break it. That is, if you mostly follow the story as you discover pieces of it, searching keywords related to things you just discovered, or trying to fill in the gaps as things come into view. I've heard of plenty of people "breaking" the game by accidentally stumbling onto big revelations by guessing key words rather than following the trail of clues, but that doesn't mean you ruined iit. The big twists hidden away still leave a lot of holes in the story when you find them, and if all goes well, you'll feel a definite sense of the whole picture coming into focus as you explore the database.\n\nThe really cool thing it does, one that I thought worked well, is let the player define their own victory. It's easy to discover the biggest twist early on without meaning to, but even once you know it there are a lot of other details to fill in. While playing, I went from a fuzzy sense of what happened to a more defined picture, and without viewing 100% of the clips, I eventually found I could explain every little detail. Things clicked into place and I felt like I "won", even though the game didn't tell me that. Evoking a sense of personal victory without actually telling the player that they beat the game is just really clever, and is what makes this worth playing yourself rather than just watching someone else on youtube or whatever.\n\nIt's a good conversation piece, as well. The "ending", such as it is, can be interpreted in two different ways, so even once you've put together the overall story, it's worth searching for evidence towards one side or the other. I can see it as a good game to play with someone else, or to share experiences with afterwards. I liked what it did, and got a satisfying amount of entertainment out of it, and you might too if you're not hung up on the whole "not a game" thing.","February 12","true","5.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The number of pieces and how they fit together is fixed. Not a detective game (see below). The game does not seem to have an (obvious) agenda.\n\nThe game is based on a simple mechanic. The game is akin to a jigsaw puzzle, where the pieces consist of video tape recordings of several interviews. Each piece is associated with a date, and certain words. By searching for the words, you get a list of up to five pieces that you can choose from.\n\nThe game is not a detective game, because all you have is the recordings. You don't have any hard information, and you cannot compare the statements made to any facts or other surrounding information.\n\nBy finding the right words, it appears possible to draw every single piece of the puzzle from the stack. In other words, the   'truth' of the game is fixed, and independent of player choice. For this reason, I consider the game a somewhat missed opportunity.\n\n[mild spoiler below]\n\nThe game has a theme of mirroring, reflections, and watching (back), which I really enjoyed. I would've liked to see this themed explored more radically. Instead of a single set of pieces, the game could adjust what pieces would be available to the player based on the search terms selected. This would make the search history into a network of association, that would reflect on the player, rather than the subject in the videos. Instead of trying to fit the jigsaw together, we would have a player building a map of their own associations. A reflective surface for the player to see.\n\nSuch a  mechanic could lead to some very interesting discussions with other players after the playthru, as they would have different experiences, and different ideas about who dunnit and why (the game may actually have this property, this is an early review).\n\nI recommend the game to people who enjoy listening rather than talking.","June 25, 2015","true","16.1"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

I hated Dear Esther and didn't much care for The Vanishing of Ethan Carter. On the other hand, I adored Gone Home. For me, the story had better be damn good (which DE and TVoEC were not) and the game mechanics should either be fluid (not true in DE) or worth the trouble (not true in TVoEC).\n\nHer Story is fluid and simple, but built around an intriguing premise: Figure out what the heck is going on, based on the interviews with this woman after her husband goes missing. It's confusing and sometimes frustrating, but ultimately worth it. The story is thoughtful and satisfying, and the gameplay is very very basic.\n\nThis last part is very important. As Brian Upton explained on a recent episode of the podcast The Dork Forest, figuring out a complicated game is a kind of story decoding in itself. As a result, piecing together a complicated story at the same time is aggravating, because "it's hard to play two games at once".\n\nHer Story does a superb job of dodging this trap by making the gameplay as simple as possible. The focus is entirely on the story, as it should be, and the game is much better for it.\n\nMy one complaint is the unsatisfying finish. I can't explain without giving spoilers, but suffice it to say that I wanted something a little more concrete and/or rewarding when I got done. (I felt the same way when I finished MYST.)\n\nMaybe this is just an unfair expectation from standard video game structures, but as Brent Knowles (lead designer for Dragon Age: Origins) said: "When I invest a hundred hours into a game, I need to walk away feeling like a hero." (The corollary for me is that when I invest three hours into a game, I need to walk away feeling satisfied.)\n\nStill, I recommend this strongly, and proclaim it to be a rare example of unusual game mechanics combined with intriguing story done right.","June 25, 2015","true","3.5"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

You are sitting at an old computer with a search program that access a series of recorded interviews. All of them are of her and you become a detective, trying to piece together her story from this short video segments.\n\nThe trick is that you can't access these in order. They are sorted by keywords. This makes the game feel something like the great text adventure games of old. From the segments you watch you have to figure out what you want to search for next. So in this case everyone's game will play out differently.\n\nWhile I got to an ending of sorts after a couple of hours, I know there are a lot of segments I haven't seen. I plan on spending more time with the game, refining my investigative technique, and therefore seeing much of what I've missed. One thing in particular is nagging at the back of my mind that I particularly want to reach a resolution on.\n\nIf you only want to play games with a lot of action, you probably already know Her Story isn't for you.

It is not so much a game as an experience. You, slowly, piece together a story through a series of video clips stored in an achieved database. You use search terms to bring up results of which only five are accessible. Having watched more clips you refine your search and over time piece together a compelling story.\n\nWhat makes Her Story interesting is the moments of understanding as you unravel another layer of the story. It is both satisfying and perplexing as each reveal creates more questions.\n\nThe acting is decent and nuanced enough for you to spot things you missed on you initial run through. The writing is good as well; the final jigsaw picture interesting and intriguing. However the genius of Her Story is in the design. The achievement of structuring the writing so that it allows the narrative to develop in a satisfying and engaging way while also accommodating the multiple search paths thousands of different players is incredible. The unique design is worth the cost as it is a singular experience.\n\nDefinitely recommended.","January 5","true","5.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I believe that the most powerful aspect of this game is that you're constantly psychoanalysing her and trying to figure out some information that you're deliberately not given.

Will prove you wrong if you think FMV games couldn't ever be good. Check out 5 seconds of playthrough if unsure.\nNOTE: Story isn't written in this review as game is reliant on mysterious plot.\n\nFor those unfamiliar, FMV stands for full motion video where you are playing a game that is based primarily/largely on the usage of pre-recorded video clips. Though it is no longer a frequented genre in video gaming, during the 90s, FMV games on CDs would often lead me into the darkened halls of many a thrilling Sherlockian mystery adventure. Unfortunately the majority of FMV games were downright awful. Pre-recorded videos with a small quantity of scenes by actual actors caused the a gaming experience to feel boxed in. Astoundingly, Her Story does the exact opposite while still being as classically FMV as FMV games go. It displays FMV like a shield of pride with the added old school touches being tasteful to a tee. As the game is "turned on", the screen whirring into action like any early 90s PC would, making the familiar creaking and croaking, players are introduced to their in-game desktop. The thick 90s computer monitor flares a little and in its reflection can be seen the old tube shaped fluorescent lamps that were common fixtures in most public buildings back then, flickering and popping from time to time. It is like playing a game in the past without the annoying performance issues. The glare on screen where you can see a better reflection towards the end made me jump a little here and there. It is fabulous as a "moodsetter" like many of the other suppositious yet important details that worked towards the game's impressive little plot. In addition to the other details, the background music between searches where players are looking at the desktop felt like a good touch and appropriate in terms of guiding players (reacts to clips/progress etc). There is such an abundance of both subsidiary and essential detail in this game that I'd be happy with the mere nostalgia prompting ambiance. It is an added bonus, which isn't too recurrent in indie games these days where there is a deficiency in either style or story, that makes Her Story such a good FMV. It differs because players can feel as if they are in control as every person works towards the ending down a differing path depending on how they decide to investigate which is conducted solely by which searches are brought up how and when. The secret to any game that lacks the variety and freedom of choice by "genre default", is to give the player as much control as possible within the walls of that rigid reality. Within the uncomplicated, search - watch - find clues - check Db repertoire, players are given room to stretch and investigate on their own. The mastery is in the details so it is crucial to pay attention. Everything is told methodically and the acting that seems off in places makes much more sense once you piece the evidence and videos together. You are the "detective".\n\nThis superlative story told through proficient acting by the talented Viva Seifert (also musician/former British gymnast) weaves a surprisingly thick plot into a very lugubrious tale and the eerie horrors of the truth become more evident the more you unveil. The "wifey killed him" synopsis we are inclined to linger on in theory is not as discernible in-game as you'd imagine and it'll keep you guessing and alarm you at several progression points. It'll make your thoughts run wild but mostly you'll be wrong with those assumptions until you get the whole picture, as in as close to 100% off the clips as you can. The short clips have a role in that you're piecing together a very large puzzle. The splintered pieces of a total 7 interviews leaving you with 271 videos spanning between mere seconds to a couple of minutes will feel jumbled up so receiving the story in abstruse titbits as such makes you feel like your own little Jessica Fletcher and adds to the anticipation of piecing everything together. If possible I imagine it would be a fun "couch co-op" game for an afternoon in with a friend/SO taking notes and guessing the story together (plot contains mature content).\n\nOther interesting things:\n- Doesn't stop running while you do other things so you can open up your notepad and type there if you'd rather that over pen and paper\n- Search history is helpful. Anti-Glare Filter is a nice touch. Yellow subtitles are very British.\n- The odd title is actually fittingly chosen\n- Database Checker on your desktop screen will display the overall progress you make, creating a timeline for your discoveries so investigation will be smoother\n- Each keyword brings up 5 clips at most (excluding default keyword*). Keep a list of words that stick out in clips and if you get too stuck, use default keyword to bring up whole Db\n\n*Default keyword: BLANK Using the default is not optimal. Uncovering new snippets in turn revealing new clues/plots urging you to solve the case yourself is most of the fun.\n\nTIP: All clips found will have the default keyword in its details. I assigned a number for every new top she wore. Examples: BLANK5, BLANK1 etc... An easier method is just deleting the whole keyword for each clip watched, never to return. ;)\n\nThough the sweet yet unnerving finale didn't feel as inspired, the wrap up was still nicely done. People who are new to FMV games may find it harder to get into, but it has a good depth of story to tell for the short game (3-4 hrs) that it is and I recommend it to people who enjoy a good tale. Chances are it's either going to feel like something new and interesting or old school and nostalgic.\n\nBought game on dev's site: $4.99 (Steam key + DRM free version).","June 27, 2015","true","3.9"," 29 of 59 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","29","59","0","9"

Starting with a little and working your way up. The problem is in it's execution. Once you know the end of the story, everything else is just details.\n\nI think if they'd figured out some way to lock the content... perhaps unlocking interviews 2 at a time or something, would give you more progression, extend the gameplay, and leave the twist endings for the end.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/idiobrando/recommended/368370/","idiobrando","I DIO!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/idiobrando/","517 products in account","I have a soft spot for the multimedia and FMV PC adventure games of the early and mid-nineties. Many were just sh*t with bad gameplay and/or were trying way too hard to be movies instead of being confident in the medium itself (I mean did you ever see Ripper's cast? Christopher Walken, Burgess Meredith, Paul Giamatti, etc., it really wanted to be  a Hollywood movie badly) But despite their sheer flaws a good number tried to push the envelope to make games something more than just seeing numbers go up. They were weird as hell like Bad Day at the Midway, Phantasmagoria 2, and The Dark Eye, and some were way ahead of their time such as MODE (Go look up supergreatfriend’s LP of it on YouTube, it’s a great LP for a great game) or just overall good like Tex Murphy and Gabriel Knight 2. Even if they sucked they tended to be creative and by the turn of the 2000’s that oddball spark kind of died. Her Story is the spiritual successor to those games, a creative game that pushes what a game could do in a new direction, but without any of its predecessors’ flaws.\n\nHer Story, is created by Sam Barlow, the writer of Silent Hill Shattered Memories. I love the Silent Hill games  and I played SM when it first came out, it stands as easily rivaling the original trilogy in several ways in my eyes and, in retrospect, it also trail blazed the modern style of adventure games which led to games like Walking Dead, Life is Strange, and Kentucky Route Zero, which I all love. So I thought it would be a safe bet to preorder this game and boy was I not mistaken.\n\nHer Story is a game dripping with atmosphere, the game’s UI is an old Windows 95 era computer complete with screen glare. You play the role of an investigator searching the police’s archives on a murder in 1994 of a man and the ensuing interviews with his widowed wife. The interview videos are all cut up into small clips and you have to use the archive search to type in keywords to find clips. Because of this you pick up bits of the story one piece at a time, listening to what the woman says for anything possibly notable. This is enthralling and it also insures that not everyone will go through the game the same way. The writing is really great considering how it’s told and how tricky it must be to make sure everything is consistent. Unlike many of her FMV actor predecessors, the actress who plays the woman does a really good job, one that you will appreciate more when you dig deeper into the game. It wouldn’t be nearly as good if it were just some video game avatar instead of a real person.\n\nOverall Her Story is another shining star in how do quality video game narratives and it should rightfully become a classic. Anyone who has interest in this should buy it this instant, the asking price is pretty much a steal. More games should take inspiration from this game.","June 24, 2015","true","3.9"," 13 of 27 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","13","27","0","0"

You do this by searching for key words, which will then pop up new, unwatched videos.  The more videos you watch, the more clues you get as to what to search for, but also as to what happened in the story.\n\nThe videos are not in any order, although each one does have a date and a time stamp, so it is possible to piece them together chronologically if you wish.\n\nThere are well over 200 videos in all.  The beauty of this game is that no person will play it exactly the same way as anyone else.  Each person will watch the videos in a different order, but ultimately will get a clear picture as to what happened so long as they find enough videos and think about what they've learned.\n\nI can't stress enough the brilliance of this game design.  Sam Barlow really set the bar high for what a thinking man's game can be.  Once you start to learn some of the twists in the plot you'll be glued to the screen, trying to unearth that next video that will shed more light on what's going on.\n\nTo top it all off, there are a couple of different theories on what the story is actually about, it's up to you as the player to decide for yourself which one is actually true.\n\nViva Seiffert, the actress, is amazing, and the music is perfect.

The gameplay is entirely focused around the use of a search engine to enable the player to watch videos (in full FMV glory). There is no real way to lose, nor is there any clear objective. Instead, the player is left to figure out what is happening on their own, with only their keyboard and a database of videos. The story is entirely non-linear, and allows the player to chart their own path through the narrative. You watch a clip, you form an opinion. You watch another clip, and that previous opinion is completely changed. The path I found through the story involved plenty of twists and turns, shattering my preconcieved notions, and ultimately creating a memorable experience. Your path could be a linear telling (though it would be very unlikely) or it could be nonlinear string of nonsequiters. Forming the plot is the experience, so make sure you avoid spoilers, though do know that the story is well-written and captivating. It will probably leave lingering questions, and that's ok.\n\nBesides the story itself, The acting by Viva Seifert is great, and not just for an FMV game. The aesthetic is simple, but effective, emulating a late 90's, early 2000's computer. The sparse soundtrack is effective when it plays, and as effective when it doesn't. If you are looking for a unique, intriguing, and effective use of experimental storytelling in gaming, then look no further. Her Story is more than worth the $6 asking price, and should be played by anyone with an open mind.","June 25, 2015","true","3.8"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","1"

You are not given a pretext for why or how you should proceed. You are driven by your own curiosity. The game presents you with a few starter clips, from which your investigation can head in any direction you wish. The way this proceeds is via tags or keywords.\n\nEvery clip (which are all quite short, mostly <1 minute) is tagged with several keywords related to what is being said in that clip. For every keyword that you search, you will be presented with all clips that contain that keyword, with the caveat that you'd only get access to five clips (seemingly, the ones most relevant to that keyword). You never hear the questions that are given to the individual, only her answers. This is an interesting form of story exploration as you have to infer the line of questioning from the context.\n\nThe way you choose to search the database will greatly change your experience. You might figure out the mystery early on, or you might only understand the story after a lot of investigation. It was very entertaining to get these snippets out of context and chronological order and having to tie it all together in my head. Despite the way that the story was presented, I never found it really frustrating as some other games that have done this form of storytelling before. I guess it had to do with the good writing, and the trimmed up story... almost all what is said is relevant and doesn't feel like fluff. Props to the actor who did a convincing job saying these all these lines to the camera, it must not have been easy! Finding the right keywords to use was entertaining and had a puzzle-like feel to it. You have to be attentive and jot down keywords that might be relevant while listening and then try to search for them. It was very satisfying to see how one seemingly innocuous keyword opened up a series of relevation to me. It will be a different experience to everyone who plays it! I suggest playing in one sitting to keep things fresh in your mind (or, you can add clips of interest to a playlist of sorts for easy access later).

Adventure games and RPG games interests me the most because of its stories. Her Story is one of those games with a good story to tell. A woman is interviewed seven times by the police about her husband and we play as someone who is searching through an old database of these videos. For people who likes their game to be more fast paced, this is definitely not for them. The gameplay only revolves around typing key words to find videos of this woman's interview. Since we will be typing the key word ourselves, the videos will be shown at random regardless of chronology based on the key word we enter. We will form the story ourselves by making sense of all the videos (of which there are literally hundreds) and connecting the story in our heads. This game works best if you keep a pen and paper next to you to write all the possible key words to try. The experience is very nice and a throwback to old school adventure games.\n\nThe feeling of playing this game reminded me of playing Gone Home and Analogue a Hate Story/Hate Plus, especially Analogue a Hate Story and its sequel. In Analogue you're also required to read all of the text in an abandoned spaceship. The feeling of watching a story unfold is also reminiscent of Gone Home. The twist of Her Story is not that surprising and you'll probably figure it out within the first one or two hours of playing, but that is not the point. Watching the story unfolds and piercing together all the clues is what makes this game. The acting of the actress is also really really good. In summary, this is a good game with a good story and a unique way of playing that I really really liked. The story and twist is not as good as Analogue a Hate Story, but overall Her Story is worth your time, especially since it didn't take very long to finish.","June 26, 2015","true","3.2"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

Your task is to uncover the truth by searching for keywords and getting results from the computer's automatic transcription. YouTube should really adopt that tech as the transcription is spot on.\n\nThe game doesn't explain much more than this. By watching the clips, you uncover pieces of the story and find more keywords to try, like names of people or words that you think she used elsewhere. Search results are limited by 5 at a time, so you're forced to narrow searches down in some cases. This limited and unstructured stream of information makes for an unconventional experience.

The premisse is fairly simple; you have access to an old computer loaded with small videoclips taken from 7 different interrogations related to a murder in the mid 90's. Unfortunately, they are not catalogued properly, and to find them, you have to search for keywords. What you'll find, are these videos of a woman being questioned, and ultimately its up to you to make up your own mind on what transpired.\n\nThe game isn't so much about following the proceedings and using evidence to affect the narrative, but rather experience these interrogations in a fragmented state - and piece them together in your own mind to form a coherent narrative.\n\nSuch as it is, the story is dark, creepy, tragic and JUST vague enough to leave me questioning my own interpretation - even after having watched all the clips, both in and out of order. If you can look past the lack of "traditional" gameplay, the experience is a brilliant example of what makes this artform unique.\n\nHer Story has a strong vision, a superbly talented actress, a powerful narrative, and joins the ranks of indie-games like "Papers, Please", "The Stanley Parable" and "Gone Home" in revitalizing a business that is entirely too hung up on flashy graphics and power-fantasies. I won't deny that I enjoy the occational AAA-game, but games like this prove that there are developers out there who are constantly pushing the envelope on what a "videogame" is and can be.","August 16, 2015","true","3.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheGameTutor/recommended/368370/","TheGameTutor","TheGameTutor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheGameTutor/","3112 products in account","Her story is an indie game from Sam Barlow the designer for Silent Hill Shattered memories and sees you navigate an old computer database trying to find out information on an old murder case from 1994. The database is a mess and without the ability to view the whole interview you must instead search for clips by searching for words that appear in the transcripts.\n\nFor example if choosing a term such as "Speeding" or "witness" appears in the transcript of one or more clips in the database, they are shown to you for viewing. You can only see 5 clips at a time so this encourages you to search for more obscure terms as you try and unravel the mystery of the murder of Simon and the interview of his wife.\n\nWhat really drew me in to the game was how well it really made me feel like I was doing genuine detective work. There is no tutorial or guidance you are merely looking at a computer terminal knowing you need to solve the case of a murder. Not for years have I used a scrap of paper to write down notes as I progressed through the game and this approach to “Her Story” was fantastically nostalgic.\n\nThe game relies on you as a player’s interest to drive the narrative forward. Even though I am a notorious “cut scene skipper” I was so engrossed in the world of the game at no point did I skip any of the sequences. Had this game appeared on the SEGA CD 20 years ago this would have been a killer app we would still be talking about today.\n\nThe time setting of the game is perfect. The dubious operating system with references to pop culture from time such as Amstrad computers, “You’ve been Framed” and Ceefax. 1994 is also a time that many of this game’s target audience will remember but that is not to say that younger gamers will lose all points of reference. The video clips have been perfectly designed to look old. I spoke to Sam at a press event a few months ago and he told me how making the clips (that were filmed on a HD camera) look like ♥♥♥♥♥♥ VHS from the 90s was one of the harder tasks.\n\nThe game is not perfect however. It took me about an hour and a half to solve the murder and probably another hour to find most of the spares clips. There is also a very obvious cheat you can do in order to make the game show you everything without trying although I did not pick up on this until after the end credits. My biggest issue however was the game’s apparent lack of a real ending. At a certain point when the game feels you have seen enough to piece together the story a very out of place MSN style chat menu appears that simply asks you “Do you know what happened?” At this point you do not have to actually explain anything you simply say “yes” and the game ends. I would have defiantly preferred something a little more interactive and satisfying that essentially a popup menu asking me if I had had enough.\n\nHer Story is something different and a game that I would 100% recommend to any fan of detective dramas or anyone looking for something a bit unusual. Her Story is the best FMV game ever made and one that you should definitely add to your collection.\n\nFor our video review of the game please check out the link below: http://www.thegametutor.co.uk/videos/game-tutor-grades/150627_game-tutor-grades-her-story","June 27, 2015","true","3.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Well, no. It is a game. And shut the ♥♥♥♥ up.\n\nIt is a game because the mechanics aren't what make it, the actual murder mystery is what makes it. Your goal is to unravel the mystery, or more likely, come up with a minimal half-baked theory that could be a solution as to what is going on. And that's the big part of Her Story - all those searches will paint a broad, weird picture of things I will not care to spoil for you. Let's just say that once you decide where to go after the 'murder' keyword, you're gonna be trapped in a ♥♥♥♥ing maze. A maze where there's a lot of weird fairy tale ♥♥♥♥ going on.\n\nThe proto-vaporwave look of the game is important because the game needs to separate you from the things that are going on. The grainy Windows 95 ugliness and the warped VHS-to-digital transfers of video really aid in the immersion, putting you right there in the seat of that crime database, ready to do some super-sleuthing. Hell, even the search engine is archaic, because it won't give you more than five entries at a time. That's where you gotta put on your thinking cap and figure out how to narrow your search to get what you want. Or you could, like I did, type in random swear words and get an achievement for it.\n\nI can't say anything reliably about the bigger topics that the game wants me to explore, but I liked how I simultaneously felt lost and yet still in some kind of control in the game. The game's narrative is very non-linear and is largely powered by whatever keywords you pick that sound interesting, and by either accident or design, you'll either come to how the murder was done, what the murder was about, who the interviewee (played by Viva Seifert) is, or even what happened in certain cases. You'll find out some things and other things will be completely in the dark. The thing is, the game still manages to lead you to where the necessary facts of the case are just through topics brought up in the discussions, and that's how I played - jumping from one topic to another depending on what was brought up.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/polly_s_hate/recommended/368370/","polly_s_hate","Polly","http://steamcommunity.com/id/polly_s_hate/","407 products in account","Her Story is a fascinating take on interactive fiction.  It's an ambitious concept that doesn't directly involve the player or their choices like most pieces of interactive fiction.  Her Story takes place a number of years after the events have already occurred and presumably resolved themselves, and it's merely the player's job to suss out in their own mind what did or didn't happen, and then discuss that with others. There's no real "win" state and you leave when you're satisfied. Only you can decide when you're truly satisfied.\n\nYou pick away at Her Story's narrative in a non-linear fashion by searching key words in a database and then watching clips of an interrogation that directly reference what you're searching for.  Clips are very rarely found in the order in which they occur, so you must continue refining your searches to continue a line of thought most of the time. It's a bit of a word puzzle and language is the only thing that matters.\n\nThe only clues you're given are the testimony of the interviewee, and the questions being asked by the detective are intentionally omitted, leaving only her answers to go by. Is she telling the truth? Is she blowing smoke? Again, that's for you to decide.\n\nThe system does come with some kinks. Each search can only return a maximum of five results at a time, requiring you to refine or repeat searches with slight differences.  This limitation adds a bit to the "word puzzle" idea, but can also make the game feel clunky and padded at times.  There's no real easy way to re-watch clips other than searching for a specific term again. There's a visual database that keeps track of clips you've seen, but this would have served more purpose if you could use it to re-watch clips.  It feels like a bit of an oversight or missed opportunity.\n\nDespite its flaws, it's hard not to admire Her Story for what it's doing and how well it does it.  The acting, framing, and story are all very well done and there is a rewarding feeling of rolling around the testimonies in your head and creating the narrative yourself.  It's not something that's gonna be for everybody, and the execution could have been just a little more streamlined, but other than that, it's definitely something worth looking at.","July 22, 2015","true","6.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I see far too many comparisons for two games that aren't even similar in gameplay, let alone in story and message.\n\nThere is no ulterior, SJW injected message in Her Story - it's solving a mystery and listening to the recordings of a woman while she is being interviewed about the disappearance of her husband. Somehow, to the joy of the flesh and the masses of the many, taking the pieces of the puzzle and putting them together to find the answer isn't a videogame. What is a videogame? What is a Sonic? What is love? Baby don't hurt me, don't hurt me, no more.\n\nBut most importantly - what the hell is Portal then?\n\nI will draw that comparison due to the major similarity I find in this game and the beloved Valve title - you solve a puzzle and progress the story. This game doesn't hold your hand whatsoever and it's easy to goof up the order of events, but all in all it's a solid game that involves you piecing together bits of information together to figure out just what happened to Simon. Also, British Accents. That is important to note.\n\nThis game isn't Gone Home, so pull your knickers out of your ♥♥♥♥♥hole and realize that just because a game is called "Her Story" doesn't make it Sarkeesian praise bait and also realize that a puzzle is, by definition, piecing information you perceive together to solve something. If this isn't a game, then Portal isn't a game. You can't have both here.\n\nThis game isn't badly acted in the slightest either, but that's just my take on it. The lady did an excellent job at it.\n\nNow, to get to the heart of the matter - this is a damn good game. It has a certain atmosphere to it that can be outright creepy at times, but it doesn't feel like it's trying for horror at all. The gameplay is simple on the surface - you're given a search engine on an old computer that allows you to pull up videos from an archive of interviews with a murder suspect. However, it ends up being much more than just that whenever you scratch the surface and see just what the game is all about, but I'll expand on that sentiment later. The computer itself is really made with a lot of care - you have fluorescent lights reflecting off of the monitor (that can be disabled if it bothers you) and even little games on the computer itself. It has a fully functional recycle bin and everything, and I want to point out and praise the amount of detail put into that.\n\nYou watch videos and you listen to what the lady has to say. However, taking everything she says at face value will result in some confusion on your end, so analyzing her body movements and tone is a must. It also helps to compare and contrast other statements she has made by taking down notes, which this game will let you do on the descriptions of the videos themselves. I personally recommend good ol' fashioned pen and paper though - it's not only more effective, but it feels more authentic. Point being, though, looking into her words and what she has to say is a must for progression and if you don't like analyzing that kind of thing then this game likely isn't for you. It doesn't really hold your hand in that regard.\n\nThat's all I can really say about it, honestly - you just watch videos and analyze her words, tone, body language, and compare and contrast that with what she has said previously in regards to a subject. The actress had to carry a lot of weight in making this game enjoyable, seeing how her performance could easily make or break it, and I feel she did an excellent job at doing so.\n\nI have a big gripe, though - when you go to search something in the archive search engine, it limits you to the first five results that feature what you searched for. That ended up feeling like an arbitrary way of making the game more difficult and extending gameplay time more than anything. I see no reason why it shouldn't pop up every result featuring that word, honestly.\n\nAll in all, though, if you like puzzle games that don't hold your hand while simultaneously allowing you to piece it together at your own pace or a good atmospheric thrillride that makes you think, I'd put this as something I can definitely recommend for the pricetag of $5.99. Don't listen to the people who don't call this a game, because this is just as much of a game as any other game that has puzzle solving as its primary mechanic.","August 11, 2015","true","1.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

Murder.\n\nThe results of this search (a handful of video clips) are already waiting for your attention.\nAfter watching these initial clips you will have discovered that the woman being questioned is a possible suspect in a murder investigation.\n\nBeyond that anything I write here regarding the jigsaw of a narrative would almost certainly spoil your experience but I can say that you’re about to start a uniquely intriguing journey of discovery with a mind twisting story that will likely stay with you long after you’ve turned off your PC\n\n\nThe Truth Is Out There\n\nThe simple “meta-search” game mechanic used to track down the video fragments is surprisingly effective.\nYou’ll watch a clip and if the suspect mentions something that sounds interesting you can dig a little deeper by tapping a relevant word or two into the search bar.\nEach fresh search will hopefully bring up further unwatched video clips which will give you ideas for key words to search for next.\nEvery new clip you find will fill in another fragment of “her story”\n\nThis search engine treasure hunt creates an unexpected and welcome sense of anticipation with every keyword you enter and for the most part it works extremely well.\n\nThere’s always a chance that you’ll uncover a video clip unintentionally which might reveal an important nugget of information before you’re ready to hear it, but this is a non linier journey of discovery, all the video clips are time stamped and if you do stumble upon something unexpected it’ll just provide another opportunity for fresh keywords and  another topic to explore.\nBack peddling to unveil the narrative which led to an unexpected revelation can be just as fun.\n\nThis kind of unexpected early reveal of a pivotal clip isn’t too much of an issue.\nWhilst there are no “closed doors” with regards to the searches you can perform, you simply won’t know which words will bring up these “key moment” clips until you’ve spent some time listening to the interviewees recounting of events.\n\nOf course you could always just throw random words at the search engine and see what comes up but by taking this maverick investigative approach you’ll undoubtedly lose out on the sense of accomplishment achieved when you follow a trail of keywords to discover a pivotal piece of footage.\n\n\nI Want To Believe\n\nThe delivery of the narrative through these video clips is superbly implemented.\nThe detectives’ questions are never played on the clips, only the answers given.\nThe whole experience is just you, the search engine and the woman sitting at a table looking back at you whilst answering questions you’ll never hear.\n\nI’m not sure how much of the dialogue is scripted and how much is adlib but the fact that it flows so naturally is a testament to both Sam Barlow and Viva Seifert (the creator and the actress respectively).\nThe responses never feel stilted or overly dramatised; they’re engrossing, subtle and always feel “real”.\n\n\nWalking Alone\n\nThis believability can’t only be attributed to the quality of the script but also to the excellent performance given by Ms Seifert.\nAn FMV game with only one actor is a brave game to make, a poor performance could destroy the dialogue no matter how well written it is, but combine some great writing with an outstanding delivery and you’ve got something special.\n\nViva Seiferts deep and layered performance gives life to the sometimes engaging, sometimes enigmatic character looking back at you as you watch the clips.\nThe fact that the whole recollection of events is delivered solely through this character creates a sense of intimacy which makes “her story” all the more haunting to hear.\n\n\nBasket Case\n\nAfter a few hours you’ll have watched enough clips to come to your own conclusions regarding events and be warned, you do have to come to your own conclusions.\nThere’s no right or wrong interpretation to the things you’ll hear through the course of the game (at least none that Sam Barlow is giving away.)\nHer story is just that, “Her Story”, whether you believe a word of what the woman said during the interview or not is up to you, but by the end you will have formed your own opinion, and yes, this game does have an end, just not the end you’re expecting.\n\n\nIn The End\n\nAt its core, Her Story is a long video monologue which has been spliced into hundreds of short clips, clips which you need to discover and then make sense of chronologically, but that bare bones description doesn't do the game justice at all.\nThis is an intimate...

This pretty much points to the primary flaw in Her Story, as the actual story being told by the videos is best viewed sequentially, but the interface of the game makes it so that viewing the videos sequentially is extremely unlikely.\n\nHannah is the main character of Her Story, and indeed, the only one who shows up in the videos. The central conceit of the game is that Hannah was a murder suspect in 1994, and the protagonist is going through an old police database, wherein the videos are sorted by keywords in their transcripts. This sounds like a clever idea, but in practice, it doesn’t really work very well at all; beyond being very confusing, it suffers from the fact that it is entirely possible to search for the wrong keyword and end up stumbling across the game’s central twist five minutes in.\n\nUnsurprisingly, I did exactly this by simply searching for the most innocuous of the names I had come across first (for the record, it was the name of one of Hannah’s childhood friends). This resulted in me happening across a video which spoiled the game’s central plot twist, and consequently I spent the rest of the game trying to piece together everything else in the hopes of finding another twist, and then failing to find one.\n\nThe net result of the search interface is that you are likely to watch lots of garbage scenes, with odd scenes which are really important thrown in between them. Some of the videos are nothing more than Hannah saying “no”, while others are minute-long monologues explaining crucial plot or character details.\n\nWorst of all, if you actually watch the videos in order, they follow the standard variances of a plot; the rise and fall of action as the police officers piece things together before Hannah finally explains exactly what is going on in the final interview. As a movie, it makes sense.\n\nBut as a video game, it makes no sense at all.\n\nIt has other flaws as well – as a murder mystery game, one would think that little details would be pretty important, but as it turns out, the people who made the videos didn’t actually pay much attention to time constraints. On many occaisions, something happens – such as a character changing clothing, or taking a polygraph – which ignores the necessary setup time, with the videos happening too close together in time. At first, I had assumed that these little mistakes was related to the plot twist, but eventually I realized it was simple laziness on the part of the game creators.\n\nIf the plot was actually viewed in order, it might be passable, though the awkward interface of the game still would make it annoying. And if parts had been locked off until you had figured some stuff out, it might have worked. But as-is, the thing is kind of a mess, and while the central idea wasn’t a bad one, the UI and erratic pacing as a result of it being made into a “game” (which it really isn’t any more than searching for stuff on YouTube is a “game”) makes it hard to really get into it properly. It is possible to spoil the entire plot of the game within five minutes, and a lot of the videos end up feeling a lot like filler, especially when viewed out of context.","January 17","false","6.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dravvad/recommended/368370/","Dravvad","Dravvad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dravvad/","218 products in account","First off, this "game" is not a game. Just as there are popular story-based games that are just called "walking simulators," this one is simply just thinking and repeatedly typing phrases to watch something over and over.\n\nDoes that mean the game is necessarily bad? No. But it's not something amazing I would say that must be played. It is simply unique because I do not think I have seen something like it before, or at least not in the same style when it comes to FMV games from years ago.\n\nThere really is nothing to say in terms of general review material. I cannot say much on graphics, sound, or gameplay. The graphics are an old computer screen showing FMVs. The sound is generic computer noises and the woman talking. The gameplay is clicking videos and searching for them with words to solve a murder mystery.\n\nI enjoyed it for what it was, simply because it is new (and simultaneously nostalgic). Some videos are interesting and even pretty creepy, while there are many very short videos that are filled with fluff. I just wish they hadn't separated videos so much like that. It wasn't really necessary to have THAT many videos when a lot do not have much useful information. I understand not all videos should give main story points, or else that is pointless. But having many videos with a single word was also pointless.\n\nBut really, the biggest flaw of this game is how easy it is to get a grasp on the story. Within just over 30 minutes, I already found some videos that basically gave me the general idea of what to expect to find in the rest of the story. And less than an hour or so after that, I had found all of the most important videos, really.\n\nI wrote things down as I went along and by the end of the game I had utilized 130+ search terms or phrases to find 100% of the videos. But I had come up with some phrases that led to the most important videos within the first 25 phrases that I had come up with, and by the 40th phrase, I had found the one which signified the possible "endpoint" for the game. But instead, I purposefully didn't watch videos with terms that I thought were most important, because I thought it would end the game and destroy my progress.\n\nI found out eventually that it didn't, so I ended the game, then just continued and found the rest of the videos because I was being a completionist, and not because I was that excited to look for more videos. In fact, the majority of the last videos I found (like the last 25-35% of the videos I found) were mostly boring and had no story to them.\n\nIn the end, I liked the game, but don't think it's a masterpiece by any means. So, if you aren't genuinely interested in the whole idea of trying to search for and watch videos in a disjointed manner to piece together an alright (but nothing too great) story, then do not bother. But if it intrigues you, give it a whirl.","December 5, 2015","true","5.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

A full-motion video (FMV) game, Her Story consists of watching a series of seven police interviews of the same woman in what appears to be a murder investigation. You are given no contextual information and must piece together what is going on to uncover the whole story. The catch is that these video interviews have become fragmented on an old database and are only viewable in segments between a couple seconds to a minute in length. Using clues from the viewable clips and their audio transcripts, you must search the video database using words or phrases you suspect will appear in  the missing video fragments.\n\nThis fragmented approach to storytelling leads to a delightful journey of confusion and discovery, as you jump back and forth in a timeline of events and must use your wits and careful observation to discover what is really going on. The game does not hold your hand or explain the story in any way - it is up to you to uncover the great plot twists and revelations that Her Story has to offer. The sole actor playing the woman being interviewed does a great job at delivering some well-written lines; the game never came across as being corny or lame.\n\nThere are, however, a few issues with the game. The game does not account for a game-ruining exploit that allows the player to easily uncover all the missing video clips. I also experienced several crashes while launching the game in OSX and some of the achievements failed to unlock the first time through. However, these crashes did not corrupt my game progress and the remaining achievements unlocked after a (brief) second playthrough. The game’s short runtime (2-3 hours) and lack of mechanical depth might also be a turn-off for some players.\n\nThat being said, I found Her Story to be well worth the $6 I paid for it. It’s rare for a game to force you to think the way that Her Story does and the result is an enjoyable afternoon of confusion, theorizing, revelation, and reflection. If you’re into good stories, mysteries, and short, memorable experiences, Her Story is well worth your time. Bring a friend to bounce ideas off of, and don’t forget a pen and a piece of paper!","August 18, 2015","true","3.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It can not be review in traditional way. First thing to say is that there are minimum of ingame controls. You type a word (or more words) in database search. After you searched it you will get videos where the word (or words) was spoken. You watch these videos and write down names, places, things or whatever you want to search next. You gradually reveals the story, associate connection. Because in database all seven interrogations are scrappy you must connect it on paper or in your head. This outside-game interactivity is what makes this game really special and different.

Pretty decent, but short (I beat it in @90minutes and even at that, I thought it was getting a little long in the tooth in the last 10).  I don't particularly mind that myself. $3 is about the same I'd pay for the two days it takes me to get a redbox back.\n\nIn this game, you have access to a video database in a police station from the 90s and you're trying to piece together what happened in a murder.  You don't really win or lose and there's not much conflict, you just try to piece together what happened by watching videos you reference using clues from other videos to retrieve them. It's better than it sounds. It's actually pretty fun for the first hour, and ok for the last half hour.\n\nGood game to pick up on sale, don't know if I would've paid retail for it.\n-----\n\nWell that said, it's worthy of a mention that the developers are either wildly ignorant of gaming history or liars. Despite billing itself as startingly original, first of its kind, etc,daring design, etc, etc, and critics saying the same thing, there's an entire adventure game subgenre that plays like this, except with generally better mechanics and more interactivity e.g. Missing: Since January.\n\nThere are also the more recent ARGs (Alternate Reality Games). I know I play more games than every streamer, most people and nearly every critic, but it's absurd that people think the devs did anything particularly original. This is something that's been done before, lots (which isn't to say this is all that bad, quite the contrary). This is an ARG Lite.\n\nIt's a decent game, but it's only an hour and a  half and has a weak narrative arc and less interactivity than a good ARG. Good ARGs also involve a community, which tends to make it more exciting and social.\n\nBuy on sale.","November 28, 2015","true","0.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

All of the gameplay is summarized as follows; search keywords from live-action video scripts, watch said videos, keep going until the game thinks you’ve watched enough videos. From the collection of videos both cryptic and vague to the poignant and verbose, Her Story hands you the pieces of a story of love, murder and insanity.\n\nMost beautifully, I should say, is the addition of an ‘unreliable narrator’ to such an unexplored genre that is, interactive media. You search these videos by keyword, so most of the time they’re out of order or worse: Completely non-sequitur without its missing context. What appears to be a video of the protagonist (there’s just the one) confessing or slipping on her well-constructed alibi could just be a small piece of something bigger or just a small moment of stress-induced insanity. Is she crazy? Is she just shaken up? The duality of this character slowly weaving  itself together in front of you is also the only one  giving you credible information on the murder you, as the player, are trying to solve.\n\nWhere this game really shines is in its use of Engine and GUI. I’m guilty of groaning when I saw the unity logo pop-up at the beginning of the game. While a strong advocate for Unity and user-friendly game engines, I have to admit that my standards dropped a bit in expectations for a game that probably wasn’t going to be as lengthy or beautiful as I hoped. Within seconds, Her Story assured me my time would not be wasted. The GUI/UI background is that of an old tube-monitor from the mid 90’s. A functional and UI that contains a program that runs and feels like a copycat of Windows 95’. As a game dev that’s had to make a similar project, I feel greatly outclassed by the simplicity and credibility of Sam Barlow’s work on the user interface. It’s amazing. If you’re a student in game design or just making user interfaces, I strongly recommend you buy this game at cover price.\nThe ending left me hollow, sad, pensive and guilty. Without spoiling anything, it’s definitely worth playing this to the end. I understand that these “artsy games” don’t gel with everyone. But to those looking for an unparalleled look into the marriage between two ironclad mediums.

The more skeptical reader might say this is to take advantage of Steam’s new refund policy, but I think it is because this game is essentially an interactive version of the time-honoured tradition of British detective shows such as Foyle’s War and Midsomer Murders, although obviously much lower budget. Where the thrill of those programmes comes from guessing the true story of the murder, the viewer has no real input on the story. Here, developer Sam Barlow has successfully thought of a way to involve the player in Her Story’s plot-unravelling, without it being too apparent that they are still playing a heavily scripted video game: for the most part, the only interaction you get (typing) gives the player the freedom to type anything they wish. It might not be the most exciting game around, but for less than a fiver this yarn is worth trying.\n\nPlay it for: The shock of discovering the story’s big twists\n\nPro: Breaks new ground in game storytelling, or at least not that seen for many years\n\nCon: Can sometimes seem to drag on and lose your interest\n\n7/10","July 2, 2015","true","3.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's literally just a bunch of video files that you access in a GUI. A game is meant to be played to some degree. It shouldn't be just watching enough video files until the game is convinced you've finished it and solved the mystery of the whole thing. I hate this movie and that's really what it is. Just because you use FMV in your game doesn't mean that the game should be almost only FMV. Even FMV games in the 90's had the common decency to be actual games that have a significant playable element to it. The whole game is just search the videos, watch the videos, and the game is complete after watching enough short videos. This may seem obvious to most people but a game is supposed to have gameplay in it and this is almost entirely devoid of gameplay.

Dont read if you dont want this incredibly amazing game ruined by my revalations.\n\nThis is a story about identical twin girls, one is a prude, the other is a ho that had an STD. They both like one dude named simon. simon does glass work and makes mirrors and ♥♥♥♥♥. The prude twin, hannah, likes simon and gets married to him and she gets pregnant. The other twin with a cliche tattoo, Eve, is mad that her sister is now different than her since they had some weird twin-creepy-do-everything-the-same-and-together pact and all that. So eve gets jealous and tries to get knocked up, but it doesnt happen. Meanwhile hannah loses the baby and is now infertile, so in a depression and drunk,.. simon randomly meets eve after a concert she played music in. He like-a-da-resemblance if you know what I mean, one thing leads to another, bam, now EVE is knocked up by simon, but see simon doesnt know shes her twin sister, this foolio just thinks she looks EXACTLY like hannah. So, Hannah finds out about her sisters pregnancy and wants eve to move in with simon and her (which is in THEIR dead parents house with some attic dollhouse playroom they kept.. just to add another creep factor) and its then that simon realizes OH NO, I IMPREGNATED HER SISTERRRWRWRWR! After that, on the sisters' birthday since they share the same day, simon makes two mirrors for each one, but really wants to be with Eve the beezy B, and Hannah just aint having it, so basically she throws a fit, breaks eve's mirror, and in a jealous rage, she wildly, uncontrollably, tantrum-throwingly slashes simons throat with a shard of glass from the mirror. In the end, They think theyre smart enough to fool ol' detective gumshoes and he basically finds out whats going on and that theyve been switching places between interrogation sessions. Unfortunately by the 7th interview, Hannah has made her boring escape in their crappy chevy cavalier (or maybe it was simons work van) and eve takes the blame for the murder (but she tries to play that "oh but you dont have a murder weapon so I cant be charged EVEN THOUGH I just told you exactly what happened" card and it doesnt work because the 1st regional court #302 at Portsmouth's combined court centre in England convicts her @$$ for a life sentence in a maximum security facility. Bye felicia! (also shoutout to orange is the new black) and THEN with a double twist, the person youre playing as is actually the grown up baby that eve had who has been digging into these video archives all along!\n\n\nGet ready for HER STORY 2! Where Hannah reappears 10 years later after getting caught in a mcdonalds restaurant two towns away when police arrive from a report of theft. She was recognized and identified by Ronald himself. Unfortunately as for the theft.. the Hamburglar escapes but she doesnt.\n\n11/10 would put my ears through torture again!","June 5","false","9.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

Watch video clips, search for others using keywords, try to figure out what happened, but was I trying to build a murder case or prove an alibi or what? I wasn't sure. The first few clips the game give you don't offer much to go on, but did give the victim's name so I tried that, but you only get the first five clips the word was used in so it didn't offer much. I got the name of a hotel and its staff and still didn't get much from any of those. But a couple of times our interviewee mentioned an argument so I searched for that and when it still didn't offer much I thought sideways and tried "fight".\n\nAnd it was in there that I got something to search for that made me go from kind of disengaged by the way I wasn't getting anywhere to getting drawn down the rabbit hole. I quickly lost interest in actually solving the murder in favor of hunting down all the details I could about the story I'd just gotten the first glimpse of. This did eventually lead me to finding out what happened, but as a side effect of the story I was actually chasing rather than because I was purposely searching for it at that point.\n\nIronically even though I quickly stopped caring about the actual mystery the game starts out presenting to us it worked as a mystery game more strongly for me than many that keep you focused on their cases from end to end. I was really thinking about what different clips might be implying and trying to come up with keywords related to my guesses to see if they were right instead of just sorting through a pile of evidence for whatever seemed right to select.\n\nIt's not a perfect game, I suspect that it would be possible for someone not even trying to game the system to stumble onto the answer to the murder really quickly without ever getting into the deeper story and feel like the game wasn't worth their time, but if you do dig away with it you get a fascinating and unsettling story.\n\nAlso, I'd just like to take a second to praise Viva Seifert's performance. So many of the old FMV games this one took a cue from just have terrible acting even if the games themselves are solid, and this is one where having a bad actress would have outright ruined the game since it revolves around paying close attention to her. But Ms. Seifert really just sold it here, I could really believe that I was watching a real woman being interviewed.","July 28, 2015","true","3.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

About partway through the game you are able to be completed if you choose.  Of course that isn't something I would do, but it's possible.  I found all but 17 video files for a while and it wasn't until I found a nice way to organize the videos that I was able to finally finish all the videos.

It's very unique in that way.\n\nI honestly hope people get inspiration from this game and want to make something like it.

This seems to be one of those games that is getting a lot of  positive feedback about but will likely not live up to expectations for many. Much of the feedback I suspect is because of the games uniqueness versus its actual gameplay.\n\nI think of this game as a movie that will last about 2 hours and cost less than the cost of a ticket. If you have a girlfriend/boyfriend who doesn't play many videogames, this may be a fun thing you could do if they are someone who enjoys a little mystery. The story is good in that its clear enough you'll have any idea of what happened but not exactly be sure; its open to enough interpretation that each may see things differently.","July 23, 2015","true","2.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There is very limited interaction in this "game".  It's really more of an experimental piece of work, and you do not play detective in any kind of way that you might expect. There is no solution, and you will be forced to see credits roll without feeling like you solved much of anything.\n\nAlso realize at the time of this review, there is a "delete" command in the menu that is misleading and you should NOT use it unless you want to restart the game.  I will go so far as to say that the game will let you keep playing past the end if you choose to do so. I warn you that if you get to a point where you are spending four, fix, six, or more hours trying to get the last pieces or an end game, you have exhausted what the experience is worth.\n\nIf you are curious to see what the creator did well, and you know you aren't getting a puzzle game or much of an interactive experience at all, it is well worth a look.  Be aware that there is only one screen to work with in the game and some flaws in the initial setup that will leave you feeling confused, like the design decisions were arbitrary and contrived. However, if you are willing to see what one writer and one actress can do to your impression of FMV in a crime story, you should try it. Don't look on YouTube and don't read the discussion boards, or you will see something that will take away from the only satisfying discoveries you can make in this experience.","December 30, 2015","true","9.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You're not told anything. You're just presented with an old early 2000's computer, a bunch of archived footage from an interview with some lady and a couple of readme files. You have no idea what it's about, what the story is, who the woman is or anything. You're just thrown into the ocean without a life raft and have to work out how to survive.\n\nAt first, the game is intriguing. You click through videos of an interview with some lady as she talks about Simon and other various topics. You're trying to work out a mystery that you don't even know exists. But you keep clicking, listening to clips of the interview and trying to piece together in your mind what's happening. It's confusing but you keep going, because you're dying to understand what the hell is going on.\n\nYet at the same time this is where Her Story, in my opinion, fails.\n\nYou see, while it is genuinely interesting and engrossing, over time Her Story begins to become more and more convoluted as the pieces of the clues start to disappear. Although you'll work out what is going on fairly early into the game, the further you investigate, the less you understand. Clues become thinner, context begins to disappear and confusion takes over your mind completely, causing a feeling of frustration as you seemingly hit a brick wall.\n\nThe thing is however, and without giving away anything, you're not really supposed to know what's going on. It's almost like a cruel game played on you by the developer. If you ever wanted to know how detectives must often feel, it's probably something like this. At some point in the game you are promoted to end the story and let the credits roll, but this gives no closure to the game what so ever. The game just decides you've seen enough clips to piece together the story but to be honest, by this point I knew as little as I did when I first booted up the game. You do however unlock a code that allows you to search for random clips, in the hopes of finding one you haven't already seen. But\nyou never really get closure in Her Story, just a sense of utter confusion that eats away at you for hours on end.\n\nBy the time you finish the game completely you'll begin to wonder if you really do understand Her Story. But the truth is that her story is so open ended you'll never truly understand.\n\nAs long as you go into the game not expecting closure, you'll enjoy Her Story. But know what you're getting yourself into.","December 31, 2015","true","6.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Also, the "helpful note" about using inverted commas is totally bogus; it's only used to unlock eight single-word videos, and useless outside that), but it's still a very worthwhile purchase.\n\nJust a final word of advice: make sure you have a pen and a few pieces of scratch paper when you play.

But when it got so many good reviews, I just had to check it out for myself. And I'm very glad to have been corrected.\n\nRight away the game did not seem that special. The three initial clips were only 12 seconds long and they gave the impression it was just a regular murder drama. But oh boy, dig in a little more and soon enough you get completly hooked in the story.\n\nThe gist of the game is about finding clip fragments of multiple interrogation recordings that took place in the span of a few weeks and piece together the story.\nYou do so by inputting keywords in a search. The first keyword "MURDER" and the 3 resulting clips are a freebie and from there you have to find the rest based on what the woman in the video says. So for example, whenever she mentions places, people and objects it's a good idea to search with it.\nThe game helps you out by allowing you to bookmark videos, tag them and shows when you have seen it or not.\nIt's basically one big unconventional logical puzzle.\n\nHowever, the main appeal of the game are the stories (yes, multiple) that unfold. It doesn't take long for you to realise there is something not quite right with the woman in the video and after you dig a bit further, things takes a surprising turn. With your curiosity piqued you start uncovering more and more, going down the rabbit hole so to speak. While hardly a believable story, its a highly interesting one.\n\nThere are 7 recording sessions and the last recording reveals all the key aspects of the story and are the ones you need to find to reveal everything, while others focus on certain details and insights. So just when you thought you had figured it out a clip fragment could disprove everything.\nYou get a graphical feedback whenever you uncover important information and when you have gathered enough you can "finish" the game and then BAM! Major twist right in your face you could never seen coming aside from one small almost hidden clue.\n\nThe game does not have a "feminist agenda" like some people are saying. And it does deserve to be called a game, because you its more than just watching videos as you have to put some work into unlocking then.\n\nThe game is very short however and has not much replay value once you got all the achievements, so I'm unsure I would recommend it at full price. I got it at half-price and do not regret it. But a must buy for fans of story-driven games who can value a good story full of twists and turns.\n\nI really hope to see more of games like this until, hopefully without being driven into the ground like what happens everytime a new genre gets popular.\n\nPros:\n- Good narrative\n- Interesting concept\n- Good story\n- Quirky interface\n\nCons:\n- Somewhat short\n- Low replay value\n- Not for everyone","June 28, 2015","true","4.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Watch video clips, search for others using keywords, try to figure out what happened, but was I trying to build a murder case or prove an alibi or what? I wasn't sure. The first few clips the game give you don't offer much to go on, but did give the victim's name so I tried that, but you only get the first five clips the word was used in so it didn't offer much. I got the name of a hotel and its staff and still didn't get much from any of those. But a couple of times our interviewee mentioned an argument so I searched for that and when it still didn't offer much I thought sideways and tried "fight".\n\nAnd it was in there that I got something to search for that made me go from kind of disengaged by the way I wasn't getting anywhere to getting drawn down the rabbit hole. I quickly lost interest in actually solving the murder in favor of hunting down all the details I could about the story I'd just gotten the first glimpse of. This did eventually lead me to finding out what happened, but as a side effect of the story I was actually chasing rather than because I was purposely searching for it at that point.\n\nIronically even though I quickly stopped caring about the actual mystery the game starts out presenting to us it worked as a mystery game more strongly for me than many that keep you focused on their cases from end to end. I was really thinking about what different clips might be implying and trying to come up with keywords related to my guesses to see if they were right instead of just sorting through a pile of evidence for whatever seemed right to select.\n\nIt's not a perfect game, I suspect that it would be possible for someone not even trying to game the system to stumble onto the answer to the murder really quickly without ever getting into the deeper story and feel like the game wasn't worth their time, but if you do dig away with it you get a fascinating and unsettling story.\n\nAlso, I'd just like to take a second to praise Viva Seifert's performance. So many of the old FMV games this one took a cue from just have terrible acting even if the games themselves are solid, and this is one where having a bad actress would have outright ruined the game since it revolves around paying close attention to her. But Ms. Seifert really just sold it here, I could really believe that I was watching a real woman being interviewed.","July 28, 2015","true","3.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The core conceit is that you are able to watch individual answers to questions in a series of police interviews, but you don't get to see the questions, and you don't get to watch them in order. Instead, you search for keywords and can watch only the first 5 matching videos. This means that in spite of static content and a static plot, there is a huge amount of exploration and player choice. Unless you're very completionist, you'll see a subtly different set of videos than anyone else who plays this game. That, combined with the varied order in which you could see crucial clips and get "Aha!" moments, deeply colors your perceptions of the story and the motivations and morality of the characters in it.\n\nI would recommend this game for the novelty alone, it's the only FMV game I've seen that really makes the medium work well.

Styled like the browsing of an archive of records in a similar vein to "Analogue: A Hate Story," it's worth a look for anyone who wants to sit down and puzzle out a story.\n\nNot going to spoil much, as it defeats the point, but I will criticize by saying that there are too many "filler" videos. Videos where the interviewee just talks about her coffee or tea or repeats something she's just said. They would be a bit more seamless in a linear narrative but something like this which lets the player pick up the remnants in the aftermath of the actual events and try to piece together what happened, it does get a bit annoying to try to guess at the one word that is unique to a certain clip and then be rewarded only with redundant information. "Analogue" managed to avoid that kind of stuff for the most part so I feel this really has no excuse.

Just got the 100% completion on it. I highly recommend this game if you like puzzles and story-heavy games. The non-linear story means that you need to pay attention to what is going on, and WHEN it went on.\n\nWhat this game does well:\n- The actor. Since gameplay is searching for and watching videos, she has to sell the story. And she does it well. In fact, after certain plot points were revealed to me, I really liked going back to review old videos and piece together things I may have missed at the beginning.\n- The videos themselves. The videos really do look like they were recorded in the 90s. The subtitles are those dark yellow ones you used to see on TV back in the day, too. The videos remind me of the days when games had FMVs, like The 7th Guest.\n- The computer. Aside from the database, you can interact with everything else on the computer desktop.  There's glare on the computer screen (and other assorted graphics that I won't discuss) that really make you feel like you're looking at the screen itself, not just the desktop. You can turn that glare off if you'd like, but imo it loses some of the immersion that way.\n- The music! Oh, it gave me chills in places. After certain videos, different music will play. It startled me at first, but I think that in a game where interactivity is limited, anything extra to engage the player does a world of difference.\n- The story. I don't want to give any spoilers, and of course the nature of the game means that some players will figure it out more quickly than others. By the first hour in the game, I had gotten the major pieces figured oaut. I guess it took getting around half of the videos unlocked. Getting 75% was pretty easy too, but I started running into dead ends after that. I will say that after a certain point, the game alerts you that you've found enough information to consider the game "finished", and at that point you can trigger an ending sequence and credits. (If you go back to play later, your completion rate is still there.)\n- It's not pretentious. There are a lot of art games that disregard "traditional" gameplay and sometimes that can alienate players. There is no fail state in this game. There is a score in that the game tracks your completion rate, and there is a win/completion state.

You're given limited access to a police database that contains lots of short video clips (varying in length from 5 seconds to nearly 3 minutes) of a woman being interviewed by the police. The authentic appearance and audio of the videos are just as spot-on as the CRT monitor.\n\nYou begin by typing search terms into the search field. If that word is spoken in any of the videos, those videos will display as your search results. You then watch the videos – thankfully an eye icon is displayed on any video that you have not viewed – and listen/read the subtitles. As you watch more videos, you gain ideas for more search terms, which gives you access to more videos, and so on.\n\nMy immediate reaction when finishing: Holy s--t, this game! It's so good! It grabbed very quickly, and sunk its hooks further in the more I played, due to me continuing to receive what I can imagine are dopamine hits in my brain as I slowly unravel and realize things.\n\nObviously, I'm avoiding spoilers, but I can't recommend this innovative game enough. Maybe it's the "high" that I'm still on because I just finished it, but Her Story currently has a very good chance of my personal GOTY. It's that good, that innovative, that gripping, and that impactful.","June 24, 2015","true","5.9"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Larto/recommended/368370/","Larto","Larto","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Larto/","300 products in account","I've got mixed feelings about this game.\nThe way the story was told was indeed very cool and innovative, and I can see this general concept being used for much larger stories and games. And the story itself was also pretty well-written and was really interesting to unravel. The acting was pretty cool, and the more of the story you understand, the more you notice little things that slowly start to make way more sense.\nSo if you're open for something new, this is going to make you pretty happy. It has this "not actually a game"-vibe, similar to "Gone Home" or the likes, and the gameplay is kept to a minimum, but still, I did feel involved and it did feel I'm not just watching a show, I was really actively piecing together a story.\n\nI'm a little unhappy about how short and simple it all seems when you're done. When I read all the reviews about people going "oooooooh I'm gonna need pen and paper for this one!" I got pretty excited for something really complex, but once you're through, you could sum it up in about 3 sentences.\nAlso, it has absolutely no replay value, but that's a given with story-focussed games like this one.\n\nSo in general, I'm relatively happy with this game, and would say it was worth the 5€ for the general experience, but it was an even shorter experience than it had to be, really. This whole concept and piecing-together mechanic could make up for pretty big games and complex stories, and that is what I would really love to see.","June 27, 2015","true","4.1"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

So it was a no-brainer for me to buy "Her Story" the second I heard about it. And what can I say? Sam just doesn't disappoint.\n\n"Her Story" really gives you the feeling of browsing through police files on an old computer from way back when. The reflection of the CRT monitor looks authentic, as well as the desktop and the interface, of course. The story that's being told might not be the most elaborate one, but the way it is presented and the way you're hunting for all of the clips makes it a unique experience.\n\nIt took me about 3½ hours to complete the game with 12 of the 13 achievements and right now I feel like I got to know 'Her' quite well and yet there's still stuff that leaves me puzzled.

The gameplay mechanic admittedly loses some of its effect during the course of the game as the pace of the hunt for clues starts to slow down when previous videos show up more and more in the results. I didn't know what to expect of the ending but there really was nothing else to the game outside of the core gameplay, not even a cutscene or decision. I wouldn't say the "lackluster" ending ruined it, but there was some disappointment; after all, it took me quite a while to build a holistic picture of the story. The game has quite an eerie score and effects, which made the experience all the more intense (don't get me wrong, it's a very slow paced game).\n\nOverall, the setting seems to promise more than it actually delivers but this version of the game already deserves praise for simply nailing the genre, which is damn near impossible apparently. On a scale of 0-10, I am inclined to give it a 7.5, which means that for its low price, it's worth the purchase. It's great to have these interesting low specs indie games available on Steam (speaking as a console gamer) since my laptop is definitely of the very low end performance-wise (=this one had no hiccups other than the occasional loss of audio, which surprised me since there were no associated graphical "symptoms").","July 1, 2015","true","3.7"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

Trying to focus solely on only the investigation probably takes away from the experience, because that's hunting for clues. With the set up of the search bar, you have a very nice overlooked element that no one is going to go through the game similarly because you have the freedom to ask anything pertinent to the case. Unfortunately, with that said, some people catch onto key words more quickly than others, offsetting the balance of hours of searching. That breaks the illusion of being in the game, which atmosphere is a good part of keeping you entralled. The supposed twist is not original, but I can forgive it because it's executed well, both by writer and actress, and only once you know enough about the woman, you do see the multiple layers of the story. As it turns out, the woman seems to hog all the spotlight while the reason why she is being questioned takes a seat beside her, which could be another point that detours less story-focused players.\n\nIt took me about 3 hours to earn the ending, but I pushed forward, wanting to learn everything I could. Keeping a pen and paper handy was good, because especially in the beginning, you have many things to search for, so it's certainly handy to keep around, but if not, there are tags you can add to the video, in case you don't have any lying around. I greatly enjoyed this and thought it earned it's money's worth. I am satisfied that it fulfilled my “$1 per hour of game play” rule and the great story Sam Barlow penned for all of us. Viva Seifert, who played the woman, did a very good job conveying the frustration, tiredness and solemn tone.\n\nI frankly think it's a good buy, because I've have very few games give me a similar experience, making me so excited to hunt down the truth and every facet of detail to 'Her Story'. For $6, I might give it a pass for the great content, but if you can get it on sale or, like me, you try to get every achievement, it's a nice addition to your game library.","June 26, 2015","true","5.4"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

It's a detective game, where you sit at a search prompt. Each term returns up to five (short) video clips, and you have to jump from one to another, making notes and piecing together what happened.

It's quite short (took me under 3 hours), but I think the price reflects that fairly.\n\nReminds me a bit of Gone Home, but faster paced: with no need to wander around, you can experience the story fragments quicker, and the video segments are well acted.

Instead, you figure out stories from video fragments.  It is a hybrid of media, somewhere between a book and TV with game elements.  I feel it worked very well.\n\nThe game is short, but that is to its benefit as this is something you will want to play in one sitting.  If you take a break you will may lose some of the various threads of the story you were keeping track of (even if you were taking notes on paper).\n\nThere is an option to turn off a lot of the "old CRT" effects but the game loses atmosphere that way; still if you find it distracting the option is there.\n\nA minimalist game that relies a lot on the player's imagination and thought, this is a good mystery.  The story clips work well independantly, and even if you finish it you may not have seen all the clips so doing another playthrough or continuing on after solving (the game does allow you to continue after  you've solved it) will net you more story.","June 24, 2015","true","2.5"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

The only other game I can really compare it to is Analogue: A Hate Story--except Her Story uses video instead of text logs, and you have only your own search strings to guide you through the database.\n\nThe story is well-written and haunting, and told in a completely unique way. The game's themes and questions are closely interwoven with your path through the database, even with the most innocuous aspects of the computer interface itself. It's hard to stop mulling over the missing gaps in the interviews and in Hannah's story that will never be filled. The game's fragmented and disordered narrative keeps you from ever getting a sense of completeness, even as you start to piece together the heart of the mystery.\n\nThe subtly flickering screen and the pacing of discovering revelations about the story all make this the perfect game to play alone in the dark. Staying up to solve this mystery with my husband late at night, I still got persistent chills.\n\nMy only complaint about the game is that the mechanisms controlling your paths through the database can, inevitably, be detected with time. You become tempted to game the system if you can. Then, the first time you finish the game, there's information in the credits that will help you find the remaining available videos. But gathering the last missing pieces this way felt much less exciting.\n\nHowever, I think that was the whole point--that tantalizing block of videos we didn't manage to access until finishing the game didn't actually reveal anything else about the story. The only information we have is all here. You'll just remain haunted by it long after closing the game: mulling over your remaining questions, trying to piece together the answers.","June 27, 2015","true","8.1"," 29 of 61 people (48%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","48","29","61","2","1"

I saw the title, never heard of it before but seeing as i had nothing else to do i started to watch it. I turned it off after 5 minutes. I heard the youtuber describe the concept, i went and checked the reviews on steam and just bought it. The concept to me was awesome and from hearing about it for 5 minutes i realised it could be easil spoiled and i knew i wanted to experience this game for myself.\n\nHer Storyis a really really great game. I've not seen anything like it before. If you have any interest in murder mysteries, shows based around detectives and their cases you'll love this game. You're not told anything about the case you're just thrown this database containing a bunch of clips of this woman and it's up to you to first of all piece together what the case is and then to solve it. What i found made it such a unique experience is that there is no way you can play it without a pen in hand and to be constantly taking notes on things you hear or things that dont sit right with you. I ended having a big board full of character details, timelines, keywords to search for and theories and ideas i had about the case. Never before has a game involved me so much outside of the computer screen.\n\nPros:\n-Unique gameplay\n-Involves you outside of the actual game itself\n-Makes you come up with theories about the case without ever acknowleding what happens so its up to you when you think you've cracked it\n-Complex story (at least what i think the story is) that is left to you to fabricate\n-Makes you feel like a badass detective if you make some form of a breakthrough\n-Very simple mechanics, you wont waste any time trying to get the hang of things\n\nCons:\n-It was slightly annoying never being able to hear what the interviewer asked, only the womans responses\n-Some clips seem to be broken down into very short pointless sentences\n-Can't see any replayability value\nTo be perfectly honest it's tough to come up with many cons. Even with the ones i've chosen, i'm not completely happy with them it's really me nit picking with them. The reason i can't  come up with anymore cons is that i've nothing to compare it to, nothing that done it better or had one mechanic that really helped in playing the game.\n\nConclusion:\nI love this game. Its unique and involves the player way more than any other game i've played. While other games are left to interpretation this whole game is open to interpretation. Whether you find that a bit annoying is completely up to you. Personally i love it. You go through the game coming up with whatever theories you can conjure up that you might think are solid but the next minute can seem ridiculous. Its a great game and definately worth the small price tag. It makes you feel like a proper detective, especially if you get a big notice board and write out everything your thinking.\n\nGreat game, really the biggest problem i have is that i cant see how you might replay it, but some games are just like that i guess\n\n9/10","June 28, 2015","true","3.5"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

(Indie game developers are well-known for being flush with cash, of course).\n\nThis sounded too good to be true, because I like  Her Story,  and I also like money. So naturally I thought I'd get in on this opportunity for a quick profit:\n\nHER STORY IS GOOD AND NOT BAD. IT HAS AN ACTRESS WHO DOES ACTING WELL, AND A STORY ABOUT A MURDER THAT IS GOOD (THE STORY I MEAN, NOT THE MURDER). 10/10 I LIKE VIDEO GAMES LIKE HER STORY.\n\n(PLEASE SEND CHECK FOR $5 to NOT-SO-SERIOUS SAM, DM FOR ADDY THX)\n\nOh and I'll toss in this part for free:  Her Story  is original, creepy, and yes, a damn good  game.   Basically you try to reconstruct an elaborate murder mystery by piecing together out-of-sequence clips from a series of interrogation videos. Gameplay consists of entering in keywords to try and dig up further video clips that reveal more of the story (and often cause you to re-evaluate what you  thought  you knew before). There's an ending of sorts, but no definitive answer to the murder mystery.\n\nI recommend playing it over pizza and adult beverages with a group of friends. Some of you will pick up on clues that the others miss, and you'll be able to bounce ideas off one another re: what's going on and what story avenues to explore.  I did this one night with some friends who don't normally play games, and they asked to come back over the next night and finish it because they were so hooked.\n\nIn short  Her Story  is a damn fine, one-of-a-kind video game, and I'd recommend it highly even if I weren't expecting to become filthy rich off of doing so. (And a final, serious note for the sarcasm-challenged: Yes, I meant all of the good things I said about this game.

In the end, I did get my closure by googling and reading the opinion of other people.","June 29, 2015","true","2.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I will explain later)\n\nLet me start off with, YES, this is a game. "But this game doesn't have failure states. so it's not a game, hurpa derp!"... Sigh, I expect to see these comments being flung my way like a monkey thowing ****. This way of thinking really gets on my nerves. But enough of my personal opinion, let me explain why this game is so good... And why it will make you want to smash your face with a hammer at the same time. Sound good? Awesome, read on.\n\nTHE GOOD:\nWithout giving away any spoilers, which is damn ****ing hard btw, "Her Story" is as it sounds. You are SOMEONE at a police station, looking at old video footage of a women whos husband was murdered, being interviewed at multiple dates. The videos are split up into 271 videos, around 2 - nearly 3 mins long.\n\nThe actor(ess) is absolutely fantastic. There are no "cringe" moments, it actually sometimes feels real. She does an impeccable job.\n\nThe graphical style of this game is fantastic. The videos seem authentic, like they were fiilmed in the 90's. The ambient noises and screen flicker just adds to the experience. It's great.\n\nOh, and the price. It's cheap.\n\nTHE BAD:\nOh man, this game is great but for **** sake dev... SERIOUSLY? I have to manually sort all 271 videos if I want to watch them consecutively? Am I missing something here? Are you trying to make ME commit a murder? Jokes aside, if you really want to take in and REALLY understand the story... IMHO, you need to have watched all 271 videos back to back. The problem is, you need to add these videos to your user session, and sort them out youself. It's terrible. See my play time? Yeah, about 50% of that was me trying to SORT OUT THE DAMN ****ING VIDEOS IN ORDER!!!!!\n\nI have experienced some crashing now and again. It usually happens on exit but has happened while sorting out the videos, with which i lose progress. Annoying but happened rarely.\n\nOnto my last gripe. The "BLANK" exploit (maybe it isn't an exploit, but **** it). Now, I got to 18 videos left by my self, untill I just had to look online for help because I was out of ideas. That's when I saw what seemed like the most ridiculous exploit ever. You see, each video allows you to add custom tags. Well, each new video you view, its default tag is "BLANK". Yep, you guessed it! All you have to type in is "BLANK" and all unseen videos will pop up. WHY DOES THIS EXIST AND WHY HASN'T IT BEEN FIXED?!\n\nRESULT:\nHer story brings something new to MY table. I enjoyed it a lot a. But this is all this review (and all reviews on here) are. They are just the reviewers opinion. Now Steam's refund policy is in place, take the risk. You may like it. Give it a chance!\n\nThe story, awesome art style and cool gameplay - minus the lacklusting user session sorting features, brings me to give it an...\n\n8/10 (Would of been 9/10 but no user session video sorting is just too much to let off)","July 5, 2015","true","23.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingsigy/recommended/368370/","kingsigy","KingSigy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingsigy/","526 products in account","Visual Novels have always had a problem connecting with gamers in the west. Since they rely mostly on storytelling and limited interaction, developers have shyed away from crafting them in fear that gamers won't buy their title. Indie developers don't really have this fear, as their games are lower budget and typically cater to a hungry niche.\n\nHer Story sort of fits that mold, but does actually offer a tiny bit of gameplay. By placing the player in the shoes of a detective, you go through clips of some women talking about a supposed murder that has happened. You can't initially tell anything that happened, but listening closely and picking up on repeating themes helps you piece together the puzzle.\n\nAs a detective, you go through a database in a faux Windows 3.1 desktop to search for clips. You type keywords into a box and specific videos will come up. You can save them to a timeline, or simply give them new tags for quick access. It feels authentic, even if it is all a simulation.\n\nWhat is, without a doubt, perfect is the acting. Viva Seifert is wonderful in this game. She plays her role exceptionally well. Nothing ever sounds forced or hammy and her emotional distress can be read perfectly. Seeing as how she is the only human you'll ever see, her delivery had to be great to captivate you.\n\nWhile the story does get a bit strange, it never feels out of the realm of possibility. Better still, this is basically a more interactive crime drama. If you truly like CSI or NCIS, you'd be right at home with Her Story. Since you spend a lot of time watching clips, it ends up feeling like a serialized broadcast instead of a true video game.\n\nI suppose gamers looking for something with more hands-on activities will be disappointed, but I believe the narrative structure far outweighs what lack of traditional gameplay there is. I'm all for a solid story, so I never really had a problem with this.\n\nThe price is also perfect for what this game provides. Where a lot of visual novels fail is in asking someone to part with $20-40 just to experience. Her Story may be a one and done type of media, but at least it is priced less than a movie ticket.\n\nIt has a better plotline and acting than most modern films, too. So, honestly, you can't really go wrong. It's solid, novel and very well made. Even the little nostalgic flares don't distract. I'd say take the plunge and see the magic for yourself.\n\n7.5/10","July 5, 2015","true","3.0"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Very short, and it's just a bunch of clips where you try to figure out what happened.\nAnd as for what happened (NO spoilers), It isn't all that great of a story. Like it's pretty boring.\nThe "gameplay" is clicking on videos and finding new videos by searching for more with keywords you pick up from other videos. It isn't fun.\nIf you really want to solve a somewhat interesting murder mystery and watch a woman say things for like 2 hours, I guess you'd enjoy it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/the_stranger_/recommended/368370/","the_stranger_","The_Stranger_","http://steamcommunity.com/id/the_stranger_/","292 products in account","I had a lot of fun with Her Story.\n\nThe whole idea is to watch clips of a woman's interactions with detectives during multiple sessions of questioning.  I don't want to get into the story because it's an easy thing to ruin unless you go in without any knowledge about what they are investigating, but it's very interesting.  You are going to watch these clips out of order, so everything comes together at different times and things said before will become something else with more context after another clip.\n\nThe game play is very simple.  You're screen is that of an old computer with an outdated OS.  A couple .txt files give you an idea where to start.  You must use keywords to not only sift through the videos but to actually find them on the drive.  An example would be to use the word 'the'.  You would expect that to be a good start.  It is, but don't think that's going to be some sort of shortcut.  You only get the top 5 results for each search.  That could be tedious if not for the brilliant dialog that constantly gives you clues as to what new keywords you should research.  I used a notepad and wrote every keyword I'd like to look into down, which kept the ball rolling.\n\nGraphics are not AAA by any means, but they are unique to this era of gaming.  The Full Motion Video almost like that a modern day Sega CD game would be.  The music and sound effects add to the creepy atmosphere without imposing.\n\nAnd this is not a horror game, but it will feel that way as you dig deeper.  When you come to realize the what you are watching, things really snowball.  Not 'scarey' but chilling.  The ending is very brief and sudden, but it works to further impact how the game has made you feel to that point.\n\nI recommend this game to people that want a short, interesting experience without all the pretension BS that a lot of indie games try to push onto you.","June 26, 2015","true","3.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

A woman is interviewed seven times by the police. Search the video database and explore hundreds of authentic clips to discover her story in this groundbreaking narrative game.”\n\nThrown straight in at the deep end the game wants you to learn yourself how to play and we kind of like that. Of course we didn’t at first check the Readme doc, i mean who does?\n\nWe are going to have to keep this one very short because it’ll be way to easy to give clues, hints and spoilers to the story if we don’t.\n\nGameplayYou are on the hunt through the L.O.G.I.C. database for answers and clues to her story, the story of the women in the videos and what has happened to bring her to the interviews.\n\nTop Tip #1 - Pay close attention to not only what she is saying but everything you can see within each video clip.\n\nStyleIt’s styled to feel as if your looking at a PC monitor from the 90s with it’s Rounded Glare and all the UI within the game is feels like a classic OS.\n\nMini-GameWe took an early break from the main game when we discovered you can play Othello by checking the trash. It wasn’t for long though as we wanted to get right back into the story we were uncovering.\n\nTop Tip #2 - Play in a windowed mode and open Notepad next to the game. Trust us you’ll need it whilst you listen to all the clues and try to understand who all the characters are. We had hundreds of words and phrases by the time we finished the game. It made it a lot easy and probably one of the reasons we solved the whole puzzle.\n\nActressBrilliant performance from Viva Seifert, she really sells the persona in the videos and makes the unraveling of the story very engrossing. So much so we couldn’t stop playing till we discovered the true secrets hiding within the interview clips.\n\nRead In Full on the Blog[www.dabs.com]","September 28, 2015","true","4.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Your only tool is the archive of clips from a woman's seven 1994 police interviews. You'll be at a loss at first, since the clips are arranged by keywords, not by time, so you only get tiny glimpses at contradictory statements that hardly give you a hint at who did what to whom and why. But slowly, clip by clip, keyword by keyword (sometimes because you're on a deductive binge, sometimes out of good ol' blind guessing) you'll start connecting the dots.\nThere's a lot of drama behind this seemingly cut-and-dry case, and depending on the way you start piecing things together there might be a twist or two waiting for you. Do keep in mind that the actual challenge that the game poses isn't discovering every clip (though you can do that if you want), but actually piecing the story together in your mind. This isn't like the Phoenix Wright games, where half the time you had absolutely no idea what was going on and you just threw evidence wildly at a witness hoping the game would solve the mystery for you. In Her Story, the challenge is completely personal. When the story finally 'clicks', it will be your achievement, not the game's. So, at least in that respect, the "Detective" label fits.\n\nSo, to sum up:\n\n+ An immersive, engrossing story that'll keep you hooked for a few hours and probably stay with you for a while after you're done\n+ Even though in theory you could luck yourself into the major reveals within your first few minutes, uncovering the story still feels more fulfilling than most solve-the-case type games\n+ Excellent acting. The lead actress really carries the game. This is how all FMVs should be done.\n\n- The way the "program" works can be frustrating. It's plausible since it imitates a crappy mid-90s data retrieval software, but it still feels kinda clunky.\n- Not a lot of replay value if you're thorough enough on your first run\n- Relatively short","December 2, 2015","true","5.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

You are an investigator trying to piece together what happened based on video fragments from police interviews. The game's sole mechanic is a database which you use by searching for words said in over 200 video clips. How you interpret the story is up to you and "the truth" turns out to be not as simple as it seems when several twists emerge. The narrative is presented in a completely non-linear fashion (although you can attempt to put the videos in chronological order) and it doesn't have a clear-cut ending. If a straightforward story is what you want then you may not find it here.

You're not judged to have succeeded or failed, whatever your response, and that's not really the point of this game. You're free to draw your own conclusions, based on the facts you've revealed; the fun in the game comes from the way it unfolds itself to you, and it does this very well indeed.\n\nIf you get bored, you can always play the reversi-like mirror game hidden in the recycle bin.\n\nI played this through twice; the first time I played it as intended, and the second time I cheated somewhat to be able to view all the videos in-game.

So if you don't think the price is worth about 2 hours, then wait for a sale, but if you like immersive stories then you won't be dissapointed!\n\nThe acting is really good in my opinion and the way that you unravel the story is very unique. Everyone will takle it differently and they will uncover aspects at different times, it means that each persons experience is solely their own.\n\nI do wish this game were longer, personally. Not the same story because I think that the amount on that one was enough. I just love the idea of going through old interview tapes to uncover a mystery! If another game like this is made, having a bunch of cases would make this even better.\n\nIf you are a person who loves these games which tell a story in a new and interesting way then you should pick this up!

Yes, I knew it was a murder/suspense type of game where you watch videos to find out clues. Yes, I knew that it would probably take a while to complete. However, while the videos started off pretty much repeating one another, after a few minutes they got interesting. There were plot twists and events that took me by surprise, so that surprised me, since I'm the type of person to guess the plot line before I even get any major clues. I don't want to say much, in case I spoil something for those who haven't played it yet, but I definetely reccomend it to those who have spare time on their hands and those who are patient, for you will most likely need it.

It can even be argued Gone Home is more of a game than Her Story.  You interact with an emulated desktop and type words into a search toolbar to access interrogation videos in an evidence database.\n\nHowever, the storytelling method is beyond compelling.  You stumble upon facts and details out of order, but the struggle to flesh out the meat and potatoes of the plot due to the nature of the system in place will keep you searching for every single video.\n\nIf you manage to get every video "unlocked" in under two hours, I implore you to not troll the refund system and hang on to it.  The dev deserves to be compensated for such an intriguing platform, and this is yet another title I wish I had thought of doing first because the novelty is really fresh.\n\nSidenote:  it gets annoying at times, but do not disable the screen glare.

If you're into your detective games,FMV games or just up for something new; please pick up Her Story; you won't regret it.\n\nProps also goes to Viva Seifert for being the real crutch for the game, if her performace was not as strong as it is, this game would literally fall apart. So thank goodness for that. I want more of this. GIMME MORE!!!!!","June 26, 2015","true","4.6"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","29","2","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xemplate/recommended/368370/","xemplate","xemplate","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xemplate/","63 products in account","This is a game made for Serial-bingers and anyone who has ever sacrificed a night to Wikipedia's Search Term Gods bouncing from one search term to another. That is literally the only mechanic in the game. Being limited to the first 5 entries is sometimes frustrating, but it's also the game's way of preventing you from just cheesing common terms, so I can't begrudge it too much. Besides, the difficulty means that finally stumbling upon a "hidden" video will fill you with unbearably satisfied smugness.\n\nSomething to know going into this game is that you'll probably conclude or discover the "twist"/"solution" very early. That, however, is largely inconsequential; this game isn't a who dunnit, or even a how dunnit: it's a why dunnit. This is a game not just about truth, but context. While I understand why some people were dissatisfied, I think it's quite an enjoyable detective game for those interested in teasing out motive over means.\n\nThough you'll be asked to accept an absurd premise (I think my literal response was "lol wut") the game saves itself by absolutely committing to it. It commits to this fantastic situation with such vigor that you're willing to swallow this huge impossibility to savor the thousand tiny truths. That's because, at its heart, this is a fairy tale wrapped in the trappings of true crime.  Stories, especially fairy tales, are a motif that arise many times.\n\nFrom a narrative standpoint this game is fascinating. There's only one storyline, but the way it's uncovered will be unique to the player and what train of thought they choose to follow. While the starting clips do provide the groundwork, the game actually avoids putting you on rails. Clips contextualize and re-contextualize other comments or actions, and you may find yourself going back to the same ones several times once you know what you're looking for. There are actually a number of smaller things you can choose to track or ignore that aren't really "relevant" to anything but feeding your own aspirations of cleverness. Personally my aspirations never turn down a meal, so I got a lot of mileage out of it. There are multiple layers and, both frustratingly and gratifyingly, questions that are never answered.\n\nWhile I did enjoy the search-term mechanic, filling in the Database Checker does become a bit of a grind-quest at the end.  However, if you complete the game once you are given something to help with this, so if you're a completionist you do have recourse besides taking a hammer to your laptop.\n\nI'd be lying if I said there wasn't one section that made me want to put my fist through the screen, and it's tied directly to the search mechanic. By the end of 6 hours or so I'd hit a stretch of 10 files or so that seemed completely inaccessible, forever taunting me with their forbidden promises. I finally used the end-game tool to find them, and without wishing to spoil the rationale behind their inaccessibility was absolutely infuriating. Logical, but infuriating.\n\n\nTL;DR: Some fiddly annoyances related to the mechanic, but a genuinely interesting method of storytelling and an engaging experience for anyone who likes the feeling of accomplishment that comes from research and detail. Best (and plausibly) done in one sitting, and does not require 100% completion to feel satisfying. Interesting story, but don't wait for the inevitable Youtube videos splicing together the interviews in chronological order -- the experience of personal discovery really is what makes it exceptional.\n\nAnd seriously, guys, it's like $6.00. I've spent more than that on a drink, and Her Story didn't serve me a glass half full of ice.","June 27, 2015","true","6.4"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

These interviews are broken into 271 segments, ranging anywhere from 1 second to 2 minutes in length. You access these interviews by searching a police database. However, not all of the 271 segments are accessible at once - you can only access them by searching the database for keywords. This leads to a unique storytelling experience, told piece by piece as you discover new keywords to search from every video. Piecing the story together is one of the most satisfying experiences I have had in a video game, and I won't spoil it by going into any more detail here.\n\nHer Story is worth playing if you enjoyed the podcast Serial, the show The Jinx, detective/crime stories generally, and are interested in trying a new form of video game storytelling. It should only take 2-3 hours to complete, though the experience will stay with you long after you finish the game, and is definitely worth the $6 admission price.\n\nRecommended.","June 28, 2015","true","3.7"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

So he made this game.\n\n\nIt is a non linear detective murder mystery in which you try to understand a case that lies 20 years in the past.\nYour tool of investigation is a computer with a database of tapes, FMV clips of an actress interviewed by the police.\nAll are a couple of seconds long and indexed (and searcheable) by keywords and phrases.\nSo if our mysterious lady said the word "murder" in one of the tapes and you type it into your searchfield, you'll find up to 5 videos in which she said that word. You can look for the word "the" and get 5 hits, this is a bit weird to me but in the end it can be helpful if you're stuck or out of keywords to search for.\nAfter a couple of minutes I was starting to write down notes via pen and paper and found myself already pretty deep in the mystery.\nAnd that is how you play the whole game.\n\n\nThe actress Viva Seifert delivers a great and deep performance. Sometimes you watch a clip and think: 'Hmm, this is weird...', and 2 hours later, with new information at hand, you realize that the thing you thought was weird now totally makes sense. It's just an odd experience, and I liked that.\nLet's be honest, the human brain wants to order and structure everything it gets it's "hands" on and that's exactly what makes the game apealing.\nThat and that little bit of voyeurism we all have inside us and can safely endulge in here.\n\nThe games big quality (nonlinearity) can also be it's downfall: If you're searching for certain words that might spoil the whole mystery for you in the first 20 minutes you won't get as much out of the rest of the clips.\nI knew a little too much for my own good in the first half an hour, I feel. But it was still fun until the end.\nHow do you end a game like this, I asked myself. Well, pretty organic, mostly like you played it.\nIt all works in a way and I enjoyed it but it has it's flaws and it's probably not for everyone.\n\nThe writing and the acting made it work for me and even if I'm not super happy with the final conclusion I had concerning the case, the way of getting there was really fun!\n\n\n\nHey, I did a video.

There are a few points you should be aware of:\n\n1) You don't need to watch all of the clips (I did watch all of them, so I am sure of that :) ) to finish the game.\n2) You probably cannot access all of the clips by keywords (some clips contain only  the word "yes" or "no" and with the 5 video limit you won't be able to reach them). I had to cheat (you'll learn how when you finish the game) to view them.\n3) Don't expect a message like "Congratulations, you have solved the case!" There isn't a case to solve, you are just watching old videos.\n4) I don't see any replayability value at all.

The acting is great, the directing good. The story leans a little heavily on symbolism and the premise seems a little far fetched, but it totally works. The way the story is paced while still allowing you total freedom to access any clips in any order (IF you know what questions to ask) is nothing short of brilliant. I elaborated a bit on the design here[www.goldenkronehotel.com].\n\nAnyway, I think something is fundamentally broken when Steam shows 30% of the negative reviews (out of only 13) on the front page, but only a single positive review is promoted (out of 343 of them). Some of the negative reviewers promoted clearly haven't even beaten the game. Ugh.","June 27, 2015","true","10.8"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

I do enjoy unusual concepts so this is partly where the thumbs up comes from but I do feel that it could have had a far better second layer between you the player (in the real world) and the actress on screen - I won't elucidate on this aspect for fear of revealing anytrhing abotu the gameplay etc.\nThe actress was pretty good, and did a good job of delivering the lines though I didn't feel she was actually engaging in one half of a conversation, more like those one-sided phone calls that film starts make where they're not actually talking to anyone.\nI will say that I got bored quite quickly and simply got clever with my word searches and got several acheivements without actually knowing why or how - so it's a very tentative thumbs up (though even as I typ e this last bit i could almost as easily given it a thumbs down).\nScrub that - it get's a thumbs down (but it was a close call)","June 3","false","1.1"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

Totally recommened.\n\nThe game gets immediately intriguing in the first few minutes when you start it. And the story expands and gradually reveals itself as you keep on searching and browsing each clip.\nThe progress of finishing the game is like resolving a jigsaw puzzle. Finding each piece of the puzzle and putting it in the right place can be very much rewarding.\nI haven't gone through 100% yet but I can tell what the picture is about. I actually used a pen and a piece of paper to jot things down. I have to say I haven't been so intrigued since L.A. Noire and To the Moon. : P\nAnd I actually googled and learned tap code.\n\nIgnorant buyers beware. This is an indie game.\nSure the game might not be best plotted, and the acting could be better, but I believe it should be enjoyed well enough. It gives an experience and it lasts long.\n\nThe reflection of myself on the monitor screen scared the ♥♥♥♥ out of me.\n\nMight update this review sometime later.\n\nps: a useful tip - during each video clip, you can click the mouse to reveal the progress bar and rewind/fastforward the video as you wish by dragging it. Just for the people who are not too bright like me : P\npps: Delete Session Date will erase your search history AND totally restart your game from the beginning. So it's simply a reset button.

The story is compelling, well written and well acted, and the atmosphere evoked by the subject and the interface is second to none.\n\nSome parts of the game are clunky, obscure and frustrating - but I'd argue this adds to the experience. Your tools are imperfect, just like your eventual understanding of what happened and why. You're struggling to dredge up a fragmentary story which is obscured by the interview format, the complex relationships between characters and the inability to sequentially access clips. This is important - you're never going to be 100% certain. You only need to prove to yourself that you made your best effort to understand the stories, actions and motivations of people you only really know from a set of 20 year old video clips.\n\nPlay for as long as you like but your mind will be turning over what you learned - or what you thought you learned - for a long time afterwards.

Don't worry, the FMV aspect of this game works really well, it's totally not cheesy and the actress in the game does a fairly decent job selling her performance. After you complete this game, it's hard to imagine Her Story not being a FMV game, I'm not sure it would have worked any other way. Her Story was made independently by Sam Barlow, who was previously the writer and designer of both Silent Hill Origins and Silent Hill Shattered Memories. This game, if you can even call it a game, shares a lot of the interesting ideas and creativity found in those Silent Hill titles\n\nThe premise of Her Story is that you are digging through a corrupted database of video interviews from a murder case in the early nineties. The database has been corrupted and fragmented, so you can't watch the interview clips in chronological order, but each video clip has been completely text transcribed, so you can search each clip by any word that occurs in the clip. So for instance, if you search "murder", all of the video clips that contain the word "murder" are returned to you. The other catch is that you can only see the first 5 results that are returned to you, so you'll quickly learn to be clever with your searches.\n\nThe story opens up pretty quickly, giving you some names of important characters or important events to search, but the interesting thing here is that the story is presented totally non-linearly. Somehow though, through that I'm sure was many hours of playtesting and clever organization of what words occur in what clips, the story seems to unfold in just the right way, even if you watch the clips out of order. There's many cool twists and turns in the plot and figuring out whodunnit, how they did it and why they did it is really interesting and rewarding. There's no central gameplay mechanics here, only tracking the mystery in your head and coming up with terms to search then watching the video clips. So if you're looking for a gamey game, Her Story probably won't be your thing. But if you like a clever murder mystery presented in an unconventional fashion, you should totally check this game out\n\nI really enjoyed Her Story, it was one of those experiences that keeps you thinking about it long after it's over. The story and its twists are clever and I enjoyed the unconventional presentation. If searching and watching video clips doesn't sound fun to you, you may want to steer clear of Her Story. But if you can let yourself get engrossed in the story and sorting out its mysteries, you'll have a fun time with this game\n\nFor more reviews, check out http://whatisjamesplaying.blogspot.com/","August 17, 2015","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This unusual title was created by Sam Barlow (who also created Silent Hill: Shattered Memories), a veteran of the game design world and mastermind of suspense and beautifully told stories.\n\nThroughout the game, your objective is to discover what happened to Simon Smith, Hannah Smith’s (a protagonist’s) husband. The player is presented with a police database full of video clips, none of which are in order though I don’t think this actually has any bearing on whether or not you complete the game successfully.\n\nRead my full review at: http://www.pcgamergirl.com/2015/review-her-story/","November 4, 2015","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a captivating story that stems from brilliant writing and unconventional gameplay. It's gaming as a medium for storytelling at its finest.\n\nThe moment I started Her Story and was presented with a simulated PC desktop, complete with the flourescent glare of ceiling lights on the screen, I felt a strange mixture of comfortable familiarity and foreboding. Maybe it's an odd comparison, but I felt the same way when I started Papers, Please, another indie gem that skirts convention and turns the seemingly mundane into the immensely interesting. Who would have thought that doing paperwork and researching video footage could be so damn entertaining?\n\nHer Story's writer/director, Sam Barlow, worked as lead designer and writer on Silent Hill: Origins and Silent Hill: Shattered Memories as well as the pioneering one-move indie gem Aisle. Her Story feels slightly like all of the above in its conceptualization and innovativeness, but for me it made more of an impact. This game is Barlow's magnum opus, despite its humble length and presentation. It's a case of beauty in simplicity, and I look forward to more from Barlow. I'm hoping he takes Her Story's concept and format and builds upon them, creating something even more masterful, because the potential definitely exists.\n\nFor me, a good indication that any piece of entertainment has been worthwhile is when it stays with me for a long time. For that reason, I like to give things a chance to simmer in my mind for at least a few days before forming a solid opinion. It's been that long since I played Her Story, and not only am I still thinking about it daily, but I also want to tell everyone I can to play it. So, play it.","November 11, 2015","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/paolojcruz/recommended/368370/","paolojcruz","Guattari Lynx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/paolojcruz/","136 products in account","The Good: The process of gathering the interview snippets and piecing the various narrative threads together has been my favorite gaming experience of the year, so far. Granted, there are very few ludic restraints here, so it really does feel  more like interactive fiction than a game. But honestly, when the whole thing feels so compelling, that seems like a petty concern.\n\nA lot of the credit goes to actress Viva Seifert. Her nuanced performances made the gimmicky testimonal format into a viable medium for the disjointed crime narrative.\n\nThe Bad: If the actual plot were in a different format -- say a prose story or a feature-length movie -- it would be a boilerplate crime thriller. The more psychological elements would feel like hackneyed cliches. Thankfully, the medium not only hides these flaws, but turns them into a source of potential mindf*ckery and player speculation.\n\nThe Ugly: After my first near-complete playthrough, I may have spent/lost/wasted as much time researching fan theories as I did actually playing the game. There's proverbial wheat out there, for sure, but you have to sift through a lot of chaff to find it.\n\nOf course, none of that is really the dev's fault. And it can only help strengthen the game's value as a cultural product.","November 7, 2015","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You are the daughter who was born as you are called that when you end the interview in my playthrough of the game.
