"http://steamcommunity.com/id/snuffyboots/recommended/313160/","snuffyboots","snuffyboots","http://steamcommunity.com/id/snuffyboots/","36 products in account","Okay, so obviously I've played this game a ridiculous amount of time.  I can be a little obsessive about getting a game going JUST RIGHT so that I can build my empire.  That having been said, I still have not explored all of the facets of the game as of yet.  Now I have not played the previous versions of this game, so I didn't really know what to expect with it, and I have to say that my girlfriend made fun of me for days after purchasing and playing this game.\n\nHere is what makes it so awesome:\nYou have a unique opportunity to build your own empire with the farming equipment and shifting markets.  Yes, you're running a farm.  Doesn't sound all that interesting, does it?  Well, playing it on a computer removes all of the icky-est parts of owning your own farm, and the fast settings allow you to harvest every day (about every 21 game hours, actually), which means that if you are savvy with the way you start, you can really build your business.\n\nThe game allows you to pick different ways to play the game, including how much involvement you want to have in the game.  There are some crops, like wheat, barley, or canola, that require very little micromanaging on your part.  See, this game allows you two options, depending on the task you are undertaking... you can either run the machine yourself (which takes some dexterity, believe you me!) or you can hire a worker to do it for you.  I made the mistake on my first go-round of trying to run the harvester myself.  Anyway, on crops like the ones I mentioned, the only thing you really need to do is run the tractor that gets the grain from the harvester (with a trailer) and drop it off either in your silo for storage or sell it directly to the highest buyer.\n\nIf you want to make more money, there are other things you can produce, such as Bio Gas.  This is what I like to call the money making machine.  I won't go into details here, since I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but do the research and you will soon have all the money you need to fund whatever your chosen task is.  The point is, that you have to spend your time and energy running the darned tractor around dumping into the buckets (this takes HOURS).  So if you want to really spend time on your game and work at it, you certainly have the opportunity to thrive.\n\nThe game is beautifully crafted, and the machinery is very realistic (but what do I know, I work in an office, right?).  As other people have mentioned before, crash simulation is almost non-existant.  Frankly, that's the way I like it.  If I'm stupid enough to accidentally flip my tractor over and it somehow magically rights itself with all of its contents still in tact?  I'm a happy camper.  Again, all of the icky stuff has been removed.  The game itself though, and the two worlds that it comes with, have beautiful graphics (I'm running on the highest settings, though) and the ambient sound is realistic but repetative.  Personally I wish they would put a volume bar in that could go at increments of 5 instead of 10, but I'm being picky.\nTo be fair, here's a list of cons for the game:\nThis game will take over your life.  No, seriously.  If you are committed to playing this game and getting to the 5 million marker, you need to put in some serious time.  It starts SLOW.  So slow you think you're going to slit your wrists for spending your first 3 or 4 hours just to successfully figure out how to complete your harvest and reseed a new one.  You will make mistakes.  You will buy the wrong equipment.  You will want to restart your game at least 3 times.  If you buy this game and commit to it, you're going to put in at least 12 hours exploring the mechanics of the game, and still you'll learn new things about how the machinery works and you'll wish you had known 50 GAME HOURS AGO.  Ah well.  Such is life.  Keep dumping those silage buckets.\n\nAs I sort of hinted at in the previous point, the tutorial is woefully lacking in information.  And the tutorial will still seem completely overwhelming.  There is SO MUCH to the game mechanics of this game to learn, and one of the biggest and most important tools is your tablet, which can be accessed using your "i" key.  I don't honestly remember them mentioning this in the tutorial once, and your tablet is crutial to running your farm.  It will show you where your machinery is, how far along in the harvest your crops are, how much crops are selling for, what the projected weather will be (because it really does matter!) and many other things that you will need to know.  How they could have left this out (or again, maybe I missed it) I couldn't possibly tell you.  I was looking up game guides for this and came across mention of it, and once again my game was reborn.\n\nThe sun doesn't set.  Well, the sun doesn't TRAVEL, rather.  It stays in one position in the sky for the entire day and simply simulates the coloring of a sunrise and sunset by just dimming itself.  I don't know why, but this really bothers me, although I can understand why it wouldn't have been high on the game developers' priority list.  The rest of the details seem so well thought that I figured this would be a given.\n\nWhen the game speeds up, the machinery doesn't.  Now this may seem normal to some people, but I also have a healthy love for The Sims 4, and I'm used to having everything speed up when I speed up time.  It means that while you can speed up the harvest time of planted crops, or force the hour to turn over to see the new crop prices on your tablet, you can't make your machines work your field any darned faster than they can physically do it.  This means that you might even have time to get up and make yourself a sandwich while your cultivator and seeder work your field.  Personally, I knit while my machines are on autopilot.  But that's just another reason why this game is great for me.  Impatient people though, them not so much.\n\nThere's no action to this game at all.  This really should be a given to anyone who spends more than 30 seconds looking at the specs of this game, but I'm sure that some people are displeased that this game is so tranquil.  Personally, I like it, but the game is monotonous--intentionally so.  A lot of people would find this game tedious.  It is.  I love it.  Deal with it.\n\nSo as I said, I haven't yet explored every facet of this game.  I have yet to farm corn to get corn, usually I just farm for silage.  I have yet to try cutting down trees, or having cattle or sheep.  Also potatoes.  I'm not sure I'm gonna try doing potatoes.  But regardless, I have yet to be bored with this game, not enough to eventually come back again.  So far the DLC has been reasonable (although I haven't used much of the IT Runner pack at all, really) and the game has been a pleasure.  I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a game that they can relax into after a long day.  Do I want to be a farmer in real life?  Not a chance.  Do I enjoy playing a simulated farm game?  You bet your a$$ I do.\n\nOh, and one more thing.  Eventually my girlfriend stopped making fun of me.\n\n\nJK\n\n^Just Kidding (she still totally makes fun of me)","May 8, 2015","true","834.2"," 768 of 797 people (96%) found this review helpful 243 people found this review funny","96","768","797","243","21"

I just cant stop playing it.  Think this game is all about combines and cultivators?  I did.  I thought "why would i want to play a game about farming?  that's stupid."  I cannot accurately explain how in depth this game actually is.\n\nHarvesting crops is only 1/3 of this game.  Hell, probably even less.  You can literally play this game and never once harvest a crop and still make millions.\n\nForrestry is very lucrative, even on Hard difficulty.\nSilage (fermented grass/chaff) making is extremely profitable, almost game-breakingly so.\nIf you do like the large combines (All hail the CR 10.90) and running large farmlands, there is plenty to do with grains/root vegetables, the latter of which will consume ALL your time.\nAlso, there are passive ways to make money as well. You can buy objects like solar panels to generate you small profits per hour, or eventually buy wind turbines to generate much larger profits.  As well as semi-active income sources, like animals.  Chickens take zero maintenance, just collect the eggs and sell them.   Sheep require grass for food, to generate wool, and a forklift to transport the wool pallets to sell for a larger profit.  Cows take a significant larger time/effort/money investment to run at high efficiencies, but can make you lots of money.\n\nLast thing I'll say is that the mods for this game are absolutely wonderful.  Anything the devs left out has been crafted by the modding communities.  There's a mod for pretty much any application you need.  Have a trailer that can't attach to your Quad-Trac tractor you just dropped 350K on?  There's a simple mod for that!\n\nI started typing this with the intent of making only one paragraph about it, but I am really a supporter of this game.  It's extremely well done and for the pricetag, there's not much better.\n\nI knocked it before i tried it because farming sounds soooo boring.  I coulnd't be happier that I gave in and bought it.\n","September 10, 2015","true","817.3"," 486 of 502 people (97%) found this review helpful 134 people found this review funny","97","486","502","134","16"

I laughed when i saw it pop up that he was playing Farming Simulator.. I mean what kind of fun could you possibly have playing on a farm.  Then I went to visit him and I tried it.  I bought it and my life has vanished.  I think I had a girlfriend once, but I can't remember.  Got to plough that field, need a BIG harvester, that'll make the game so much easier, but wait, that new Sower will cut the time I spend sowing my fields from 2 hours to 30 minutes... NEEDS it, but wait.... and so it goes.\n\nSeriously I work from home so this game is aboslutely perfect for me, I can work and plough at the same time, harvest and then get back to doing some work.  It's not like an FPS or something where I have to finish a zone before I can safely leave things and work for an hour or 2.  God bless Farming Simulator.

For some reason, everything seemed a bit sharper and better looking lately.  Which made Bob happy.  But many of his favorite tools had vanished from the market, which made Bob unhappy.  Surely they would return to the market later, but he'd probably have to pay for the access.  "The Man" was always stickin it to Bob like that.  Because that's "The Man"'s job.\n\nBob looked over his combine.  It was dirty, but there was no damage to it, but that was expected.  There was never any damage.  He'd taken to jumping his tractor off cliffs and humming Dixie.  Maybe he'd get a horn set up for it.\n\nBob's life was never exciting.  There were no aliens, commie invasions to fight off, or Godzilla vs Mothra battles in the north 40.  But that's okay.  Bob drove tractors.  He liked driving tractors and combines and loaders in giant circles and squares and quadrilaterals and stuff.  And that's what's important in life.  That, and sneaking off with the chickens' eggs to make some extra cash.  It helped that he'd clubbed that dang rooster over the head every time he heard it.  It finally seemed to shut up, or at least turn the volume down.\n\nThe south field was already planted, so Bob hopped into yet another tractor and hooked up a sprayer.  Setting the brand spankin new cruise control to its only value - cruise, he activated the spray and drove his first pass over the field.  Coming to the end of the field, he shut off the sprayer.  The cruise control immediately sensed the shutoff and floored the accelerator.  Bob whipped the tractor around as fast as he could and the cruise slowed a bit through the turn.  But when he straightened out, the cruise shifted into warp 7.  The inertial dampeners failed and Bob was crushed against the back seat of his machine, accelerating out of control.  As his ribs cracked and he lost consciousness, his last thoughts were of how poorly the English language could express his dislike of the new cruise control.  At least the tractor wouldn't be damaged.\n","October 31, 2014","true","723.5"," 1,080 of 1,216 people (89%) found this review helpful 1,243 people found this review funny","89","080","1","243","49"

Seriously it is like, the game was already awesome. And then they sprayed some awesome fertilizer on it and increased their yield by a full 30%! Yeah I went there! Deal with it.\n\nSome highlights of awesome I discovered while playing this morning:\nThe new Bjornholm map is excellent. I nice replacement to the old FS13 default\nThey also included the newer 'Merican map for those of us who love huge tracks of land (if you know what I mean)\nAfter cultivating one field, your tractor is so muddy you can't even recognize the brand anymore!  Still looking for an ingame car wash, cause while mud is fun, I can't tell which tractor is which lol.  Still I count this as a huge positive.\nYou leave tire tracks EVERYWHERE. Like, you can follow your path that you just bushwacked through your neighbor's backyard to the grainery since it leaves massive wheel scars as you blast through his barbque hauling a sowing machine at 35 km/h.\nThe new equipment on the Bjornholm map is fun.  Been working my way through the lesser tractors so far and while there are some familiar comfort-foods in there (looking at you Lindner Geotrack) it is still fun to experiment with some of the new stuff.\nWhen you start performing a task like cultivating, plowing, or sowing, for the first time you can actually feel the tractor throttle up and "groan" under the stress of tearing a device through the earth. It is such a satisfying addition to the game.  Before the tractor would just slowly throttle up to max speed and drive on. This time around you can sense the raw power the machine is belching out to perform the task. Well done Giant's Software for nailing that!  You have perfected the sim world even more.\nDid I mention collectable coins yet?   Same concept as horseshoes.\nI have not started the forestry path yet, But the concept alone intrigues me hard.\nLastly, and this is a huge ++++  ....  you can finally hire someone to spray the fields.

The game takes place in various locations across America and Europe. The goal of the game is to farm (surprisingly!), look after livestock and grow crops to sell. This is the seventh game in the Farming Simulator series releasing in May 2015.\n\n2015 version of this game brings some new features, such as washable vehicles, 41 brands which work out to about 140 individual pieces of equipment.  The game has two game modes, career and multiplayer; this review will be based solely on the single player career mode. You start out in the career mode with a very outdated farm, and you are tasked with expanding and improving machinery and farm buildings to make more money.  The main way you do this is by growing crops and selling them. The tutorial at the start of the game does a very good job of explaining all of the controls and how you plant, grow, and farm crops. Once you are in the world, you are free to do what you want, wherever you want on your farm. You can invest money you make into new crops, additional fields, or equipment. Later in the game you can also add some livestock to your farm but you have to look after them as well as doing the other jobs. On top of the general up keep of your farm, you can also complete missions too, which are randomly generated, and normally come with some form of timescale on as well. Your rewards for completing the missions are usually money plus bonuses, depending on how quickly you finished it.\n\nEven though I was playing on 4k resolution, the environment still looks fairly poor. The machinery does seem to have slightly better graphics though, with some crisp textures. All of the machineries animations are down to a tee though; allowing you to see all moving parts.  This version of the game can also be modded though, with plenty of graphical mods available out there; you can increase the fidelity if you wish.\n\nThe game does have a very good tutorial, but the game still has a fairly high learning curve if you want to do really well. I had to read tutorials, guides, and help files in order to progress at points to help me build an optimal farm. This is by no means a bad thing though; the level of detail that this game has is quite impressive, and anyone who is looking to get immersed into a game, probably will enjoy the variety of options on offer here.\n\nWhilst the game does not have an “end” to it; you can basically play it as long as you desire; I have been playing 21 hours so far, and feel as if I have got my worth out of it. There is a high level of replay-ability, but you could very well just have one farm and keep improving it on a single save.\n\nI only ran into one major technical problem, and that was if you are playing the game on a resolution which is not native to your windows resolution, the mouse cursor’s alignment will be off, but this was resolved by entering windows mode, and re-entering full screen mode. I would have liked the options to rebind a few keys, and also a bit of an extra graphics menu. The mouse sensitivity really needs to be cranked all the way up in game also, as it is horrendously slow.\n\nI went into this game with no prior knowledge of the series, no knowledge of farming at all, and felt I came out of the experience with at least a basic understanding on what goes on at a farm. The game is pretty slow paced and people who have little patience for this type of pacing will probably be better off staying away, but for someone who is looking to learn something new and have some fun doing it, you will definitely get some enjoyment out of Farming Simulator 15. The game’s full price is £19, 99 – given that I have played the game for 21 hours, I can’t complain too much, but I did purchase it whilst on sale and feel I have got a bit of a bargain now.  The sale price of £7, 99 is definitely worth considering if you are on the fence about this genre of game.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

Giants has really grown up in the past few years and matured the game from obscure niche title, to commercial success complete with all the hype that go along with a new release.\n\nSo what's new compared to FS2013? If I had to describe it one word, REALISM. For starters the graphics and physics engine has been majorly overhauled and they've done a great job with. It runs like a dream, smooth as butter and isn't a huge hardware pig so it's well optimized. The screenshots really don't do it justice but there is a plethora of details added to the game, some very subtle and others not so subtle.\n\nGraphics and lighting are just better. The new tractor physics are really improved. Underpowered machines now really struggle uphill when pulling heavy loads and in some cases will stall or the wheels will just spin. Crash physics aren't so great but I overlook this because the game isn't about crashing. Everything in the gameworld is more detailed:\n\n1. Machines now get dirty and muddy over time and really grungy looking.\n2. The machines can now be powerwashed and also get washed during a rainstorm.\n3. Machines leave dust trails and tracks on the ground where you've driven.\n4. Little bits of cottonwood and allergens floating around in the air.\n5. All new and improved particle effects and animations from the chopped straw coming out the back of the harvesters.\n6. New particle effects and animations when unloading/loading grain.\n7. New realistic looking animations for churning soil when plowing or cultivating fields.\n8. All new animations for crop harvesting. Instead of the crops just disappearing when driving the harvester like in FS2013, they're actually animated now and get pulled into the header and swept to the center to the pickup shoot just like IRL.\n9. The drivers in the cab now turn the wheel when turning instead of having static arms/hands.\n10. Mirrors in the equipment now work and you can see behind you.\n11. Vehicle speed can now be fine tuned to your liking in 1mph/kph increments to better match harvester speeds.\n12. An in game semi transparent map overlay of the gameworld can be pulled up now while you drive with most of the major locations labeled so you don't have to refer to an external map.\n13. Sprayers and fertilizers can now be hired out. Woohoo!!!!\n\nI won't list them all but there are many others. The biggest thing added in terms of mechanics is the addition of forestry and logging. You can now engage in the planting, cutting and chipping of trees and selling them to the lumber mill or wood burning plant for big profit along with a nice selection of wood cutting and processing equipment and implements.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DJDostoevsky/recommended/313160/","DJDostoevsky","DJ Dostoevsky","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DJDostoevsky/","778 products in account","So I'm having a blast with the game so far.  The improvements over FS13 are pretty dramatic in a lot of areas.  The vehicle modeling is vastly improved, showing far more detail and complexity in various areas.  The cabins now have fully-functioning side mirrors and all the dashboard dials are fully animated.  Combined with the new lighting engine, the collection of vehicles and equipment are far more gorgeous than they have any right to be in a mere Sim title.\n\nOn the downside, the environments look largely the same as FS13.  You can notice sharper texture work all around (buildings, stone walls, etc.) but harvest-ready wheat, canola, corn, etc. seems carried over from the last game.  The biggest offender is the draw distance, which hasn't changed much.  I know it can be difficult to render natural environments with expansive, flat planes that stretch on forever, but the graphical fill-in render distance feels way too short.\n\nIt's not all bad on the environmental front.  There's been numerous upgrades as well.  Vehicles leave tire tracks behind them and kick up dust.  Harvesting fruit is now fully animated (instead of simply disappearing when collected, it's now cut-down and pulled through the rotating header blades).  Similarly, treated soil is now animated when plowed and cultivated, showing churning dirt under the blades instead of a simple texture swap in FS13.  Vehicles now get muddy with prolonged use.  A handy high-pressure sprayer allows you to manually wash them off.  I do think the dirt accumulation happens way too fast though.  I like effect, but your equipment can get completely covered in mere minutes.  I'll be looking forward to a mod that stretches out dirt accumulation over a longer period.\n\nAs advertised the physics engine has undergone a full overhaul.  Vehicles now have weight to them.  You can feel it when you're pulling heavier equipment and your speed pulls back when riding up inclines.  Equipment is now power-rated, meaning low-rpm tractors can not pull larger loads as there's a minimum threshold they must meet.   Overall, the machinery feels heavier and more substantive, like they stick to the ground vs. flying off on the slightest whim in FS13.  There's also been an upgrade in the audio dept. as engine sounds are deeper and more guttural, adding to the sense of authenticity.\n\nSide missions are handled more intelligently in the new game.  Instead of having them pop up at pre-set intervals, you instead travel job boards located around the map and pick from a list of job opportunities.  You still have lawn-mowing and pallet delivery missions, but they've also added 'great demand' requests for various grains.  Picking when and what you want to do makes you feel more in control of collecting extra coin when needed.\n\nSo all in all I'm really enjoying my time with Farming Simulator 15.  It's just as Zen & relaxing as ever, only this time out if feels entirely Bigger, Better, & More Bad-♥♥♥.  The game feels like it's come into its own and is finally in the Big Leagues.  It's met all my "upgrade expectations" that were set in motion during the initial media rollout and info dump regarding new graphics and physics engines.  Honesty, when standing FS13 and FS15 side by side, I can't help but think about the all-around qualitative leap from Euro Truck Simulator to Euro Truck Simulator 2.  ETS2 was a breakout hit for SCS Software that had enough crossover appeal to even help legitimize the oft-stigmatized Mundane Vehicle Simulator (tm.) genre with the masses.  I'm now wondering if it's FS15's turn to make a similar leap in awareness and appreciation.  Seeing it sit at #1 on the Steam Top Sellers chart every day since release has been a positive nod in that direction.\n\nSide note: Been playing for over 7 hours and I haven't even touched the new Logging feature set, so I have no feedback in that regard.  I've never been into money-cheat mods, opting instead to build my empire up from the ground floor, adding to my fleet piece by incremental piece.  I'll get there in due time.  I'm in no hurry.","November 2, 2014","true","172.9"," 154 of 169 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","154","169","3","0"

Whilst it is still a little way from being a simulator in the true sense of the word (for example, gears are not fully simulated, tractors do not show real damage, crops grow too fast and its a bit too easy to make money), nevertheless, the positives far outweigh the negatives, and for every weakness, there are many realistic features. It's great fun if you have any interest in farming and you like the productive strategy type game rather than the fast paced shooters. I worked on a farm many years ago, and I played with Britains farm toys as a kid. This game, 40yr later, allows me to own and drive any type of tractor & implement, and farm any crop, & the physics and graphics are easily good enough to bring back the memories of driving the real thing. Giants also give good support, they updated FS2013 regularly, so I hope to see the same improvements and developments in this one;and they offer good (many free) addon mods form time to time.\nIt's also very moddable, so if there is an aspect that lets the game down, it is very likely that someone has added a mod to fix it, or else you can do it yourself. For example, it is not difficult to edit the start machinery and funds, or to change growth rate or values to make the game more difficult, or even to create your own map with a bit of learning.\nStand by to be labelled a farm nerd (similar to trainspotter), but that matters not to me. Excellent game, worth at least 8 out of 10 on release, and expecting that to rise with future patches.  :)","December 29, 2014","true","138.6"," 106 of 116 people (91%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","91","106","116","14","3"

However, if you have any plans of running your own dedicated server, you should reconsider before buying.\n\n"A separate Farming Simulator 15 license is needed for each Dedicated Server. You can't play with the same license key as a client on a server." - Dedicated Server Documentation\n\nThis should be unacceptable from any game developer, as dedicated server support should be a selling point of the game, not a way of leeching money from your playerbase.\n\nThe idea of rentable multiplayer servers is fine, as it is an option for anyone without the resources to host their own. However, requiring that an entirely separate copy of the game be purchased, with the soul purpose of running a dedicated server, NOT playing the game, should not be tolerated. To add to this, Steam does not even support owning two copies of the game, you would either have to buy it through another retailer, or create another Steam account just for the purpose of running a dedicated server.\n\nI am absolutely appalled by the fact this is accepted by the community.\nGames like Minecraft, Terraria, Team Fortress 2, Half Life, Just Cause 2, and an entire list of games providing the means for runing a dedicated server included with the purchase of the game.\n\nMod support will only get you so far when you spit back in the face of the same player base with a policy like this.\n\nAs an end-user, great game. As someone in IT who cares about the direction games are headed, 3/10. Most people with look over this and blow it off because it does not affect them. However, if you play any multiplayer in this game, someone, somewhere has paid extra to allow you to.\n\nThis will be the last game by Giants I will own unless changes are made in the future.","January 30","false","9.9"," 192 of 240 people (80%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","80","192","240","6","6"

It is so buggy and underpowered, it makes one think that these guys have never seen one in action.  Once they grab a log, there is no going back, it is shredded.  Short of turning off the equipment, there is no way to get the log out of it.  In this offering, your main task is to get the log to go INTO it.  Even when it does, there is a very high chance it will be just spit out again.  Actually all trees can get very buggy at times.  Ghost logs, screwed up cuts, ( they are still attached to the main log even though cut off), trees that decide to disobey the laws of physics. ( standing verticle instead of falling over)\n\nAnother issue this game has is BAD and I mean very bad physics.  You can look forward to all your vehicles spinning out for no reason.  Even a tractor going 20 miles and hour will do donuts on you.  Tractors jumping 10 feet in the air on the least bump, total loss of steering unless you are under 10 MPH, and if you over steer an instant jacknife/donut.\n\nSmaller issues are with any vehicle that has an articulating joint.  Constant cameras switching angles while trying to drive these vehicles will give the average person headaches in minutes.  Just bad physics and bad camera useage on these vehicles.\n\nAnother smaller issue is with traction.  Some of these tractors are over 400 HP, and yet they can't climb a 15% grade pullling an empty trailer.  These tractors in real life are able to crawl up 30 and 40 degree slopes, but not here.  It gets annoying fast when a 400 HP tractor powers out going up a hill with nothing attached to it.\n\nIf you are looking for a genuine farming experience with real world physics, and handling.  Skip this one.  It needs alot of love before it reaches that point.\n\nOn the other hand, If you are into eye candy, can live with ridiculous physics, and don't mind the odd bug or two.  By all means, you will not be disappointed.  The world is very beautiful, vehicles and equipment are immaculate, everything is very pleasing to the eye and very well presented.  Prices are a little under what they should be, but that helps get into the high end game a little faster.\n\nLogging can get you cash fast, and with the ability to buy and place your own trees, will mean an ever lasting cash influx to get those high end machines your farm needs to grow.  Buying cows and chickens can also benefit you, but don't get ahead of yourself.  Owning and feeding cows requires alot of equipment and should be saved for later on.  Chickens can get you a bit of cash, but are unreliable as a means of income late game.\n\nthe tractors, for the most part behave as one should expect, but are a bit underpowered and can be hard to control at times.  Understeering/oversteering is always an issue.  But they are still fun to pilot.\n\nThe truth is in the game, farming is one of the most expensive occupations a man can persue and the game reflects that wonderfully.  Think you have 2 million and the world is yours?  Think again, that's a new tractor, combine and header witha  new cart thrown in.  Maybe a piece of land to add to your growing farming empire.  Some of the hirees, are bums, they leave strips all over the field, miss seeding sections, leave strips unplanted.  But as the saying goes, it's hard to get good help.  You get what you pay for.\n\nAll in all, the game is fiarly decent, brought me hours of fun and enjoyment.  Took me back when I grew up on the farm and drove tractors and harvesters just like these.  I guess that's why my view on the physics of the game is a bit demanding.  I have driven this equipment, I know what it does and what it is capable of, and was expecting this game to reflect that.  It does not, not even close.  I was fully looking forward to watching these diesel demons start grunting and pouring out the black coal.  They don't grunt, it's actually more like a soft whimper.\n\nI would suggest that they need to get behind the controls of these monsters and actually experience what they do before tring to put forth a digital representation of these beasts.   To the average city slicker, who doesn't know the difference, it will pass.  For those of us good old boys that grew up driving these metal behemoths, it falls short to the point of stopping playing putting down your mouse and hollering;  "Yo! Earl!, check this out!... I can do 180's in a 40,000 LB tractor at 20 MPH!"  You ever trying spinning a donut in a 20 ton Tractor?  It's bloody impossible!  They are designed to stay stuck to the ground, that's what they do!  Only time I was able to spin one of these bad boys out was on ice. and that was full bore into a turn towing 10 tons of cow dung.  Try it on dirt, and you will not succeed.","November 14, 2014","true","711.5"," 135 of 160 people (84%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","84","135","160","11","8"

I'm not a grind-gamer by nature, so it's a mystery as to why I will sit for hours on end, drinking coffee and grinding away at fields. But sit I do, pot upon pot of coffee, field upon field of wheat, canola, a little corn to fill the bunkers. I can't really classify it as boring. I guess if you have a technical nature like I do you will find the machinery interesting.\nI live in a farm county and never payed much attention to the tractors and such roaming the fields nearby, mainly because I'm not a farmer. But now I notice all of them as I drive by. Passing the local equipment supplier, I find myself thinking "Hey, they have a 10.9 in the yard. I wonder if they have the large header for it. I'd like to climb inside and push buttons." and "why don't they make those manure spreaders larger?"\nLearning, I guess is what draws myself to this.

I mean great!!! The screenshots loot pretty much like the game I think they have touched them up a bit but overall veeery similar. There are tyre tracks, tractors get dirty and have to be cleaned these dont sound like much but its the little things that make a game.\n\nThe physics are actually there!! not only that but so far they are great! when compared to the last game there still pretty average. Your tractor slows down up hill gets tossed about a bit when your plowing to mimick the friction of the dirt and if you are working on a slope you will go down it. Also when loading a trailer you can affect how it is loaded by where you position it relative to the loading device.\n\nOverall a great game so far however there is one bug that annoys me the grabber things that hold onto stuff have no hitbox so you can get stuck on things if you have something attached to it and wrap yourself around a fence but other than that great so far!\n\nIf you want a farming simulator to muck about in then this is the game for you. 8.5/10\n\nWow this was longer than expected heh.","October 30, 2014","true","11.2"," 147 of 186 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","147","186","0","8"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/essa/recommended/313160/","essa","Essa","http://steamcommunity.com/id/essa/","96 products in account","For me, the sweet spot in this game is the slow build of my farm. When I first started, I used a money hack and bought all the best machines, only to get bored of the game within a week. Then I came back to it after some time had passed, found a third party map I really liked, started a new game, and decided that's where I would "settle". Over many in-game months, I went from a few tractors to a full-scale industrial-grade operation. And therein lies the fun for me: slowly upgrading and expanding your vehicle fleet with your hard-earned cash. Going from a dinky little 90 hp tractor to a larger, more efficient 200 hp model...Mmm, bliss.\n\nManaging the farm chores and keeping an eye on the demand for your products is all part of the fun of course, but as a kid, I always wanted a video game that lets you load trucks with loaders, forklifts and excavators. As an adult, I'm overjoyed to be doing that now. While there are no excavators in the vanilla game, nor can you dig up the ground, there are some beautifully detailed excavators available from the modding community. And "excavating" a pile of corn or silage and loading it into a dump truck is a fair enough compromise. (I know there are simulators on the market that allow you to excavate and haul earth, but not a single one has been half as satisfying as this game has been.)\n\nBottom line: this is a simulator, and as such, it's not going to convert high octane gamers. It was designed for people who like the sound and feel of heavy machinery, or the repetitive and relaxing motions of harvesting a large field, or selling a large trailer's worth of goods for an enormous profit. Giants Software knows the audience they're targeting, and does a good job of delivering what that audience wants.\n\nI guess you folks like pros and cons, so here is my list:\n\nPRO\n\n-Tons of vehicles to drive.\n-Lots of ways to make money (if you're patient).\n-Dirt and grime build-up adds to immersion; washing a vehicle can be extremely satisfying.\n-You could ignore the farm aspect and just call this "Logging Simulator". Logging has a steeper learning curve than farming, but is just as fun, with a lot of third party machinery out there to augment what's available in the base game.\n-Very detailed cabs. I play the game almost exclusively in-cab.\n-Functional mirrors.\n-Dozens, if not hundreds of hours of enjoyment possible, if you're into laid back games.\n\nCON\n\n-With the exception of the vehicles, which look exquisite, the graphics are a bit dated.\n-No true digging capabilities yet (though Giants software has suggested that might be coming in future releases).\n-Vehicles do not have gears or shifting (there are mods for that).\n-Vehicles only start up or power down when you enter or exit them (there are mods for that too).\n\nI was on the fence about buying this title. I just wanted to load trucks with heavy machinery, and figured you'd have to work a lot before you'd reach that point. I was right, but what I didn't anticipate was how much I enjoyed getting to that point, and going beyond it.","July 5, 2015","true","286.5"," 69 of 78 people (88%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","88","69","78","7","1"

It involves all the chores of farming but on top of that it involves financial management, crop management, market segmentation, and for those advanced Multiplayers Forestry discipline, Soil Ph calibration, Construction Manufacturing and Mass Production venues.\n\nIf you enjoy relaxing (non stress pressure type of) games, (and having an attention span of more then 5 seconds), or if you hate being on the edge of your seat, gripping for your headsets because oh there are to many demanding games out there that are just simply not creative just mind numbing..... I say if you like to( playe relaxed and chill) then your in the right place.\n\nThis game is a constructive simulation with a flavor of a Sandbox, you are incharge, where you are working towards a productive goal with no pressure like ( omg I need to make this quest in5 hours) and also if willing to share it with your friends or even kids, it is family oriented and realistic.\n\nThe vanilla version of the game is quite limited, however I chose to only to play lately Multiplayer which involves interactions with Human Farmers, builders, drivers with the immersion of Modifications of vehicles, tools or Maps that are 100+ fields with a complex economies, construction and manufacturing industries such as Gold Prospecting, Coal Mining, Salt Quarry, Sand digging, Cement Factories, Cheese factories, Soup, Pizza, beverages and many more which lead to producing materials that you can actually sell and or build buildings with.\n\nIf you want to play a fast (street fighter or couter strike type and squirt 30 minutes a day) this is not for you, this is for the intelligent and enjoyable folks who love the aspect of simulation gaming. This is a game that takes time, strategy and understanding, it also brings in a very low pressure atmosphere which makes it super fun, and you can challange yourself, how ever you want but at your own decision.\n\nHere is my challange:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-5FmNPaUt4\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC7SCIMh884","October 18, 2015","true","183.4"," 45 of 46 people (98%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","98","45","46","4","0"

New graphics of course, and cutting down trees. The best part is being able to cut down trees blocking fields and workers in the equipment. This was the biggest problem for me in FS2013, you can cut trees that tractors are hung up on. The maps are huge, plenty of room to stretch your legs. Also lots of farming fields, you'll never run out.\n\nBugs are the only drawback, there aren't any show stoppers though. Very minor stuff. The physics work much better than FS2013, though is still buggy at times. Bumping a rock for example can (rarely) send your machine across the map. The automated workers at least attempt to fix from getting stuck at the edge of fields. Don't make them too large, also. The missions are given out at job boards. You can set the frequency (mine is set to 2min), and multiple jobs come in. FS2013 put the machines on your screen, was annoying. I keep a cheap tractor at the job board to check missions constantly.\n\nFor whatever reason, a massive bonus of several hundred thousand dollars comes with the farming missions. The payout would be 10,000 ish, and the bonus could be 400,000 dollars.. what? The drawback is these missions may or may not pop up often. Once I got 3 missions at a time, other times I had to wait several days. I expect this to be fixed? who knows, it's the only true way to get money quickly.\n\nThe job board is almost always pallet missions, that is, pickup a pallet and drop off to said location. Those get old very quickly.. Grass cuttng mission is painfully slow until you get both front and back mowers. There is no longer the useless riding mower, also.\n\nAs with FS2013 farming, farming the largest fields with the largest/quickest equipment is the key to success. The tractors are the same, maybe a couple new here or there. But the graphics overall is such a huge improvement. You can wash your equipment for kicks, or if you are really, really bored.\n\nThe starter equipment is much better as well, the very basic tractors go 42mph. No more rust bucket putt putts. They have high maint cost of course, the sooner you get rid of them the better.\n\nOverall, they thought BIGGER with FS2015 as an improvement. There is rarely flat terrain. Everywhere has hills, sometimes road going up very steep terrain. Improperly powered tractors have no chance of pulling trailers up steep hills. The way things are laid out, you are sometimes better off taking the roads. Versus FS2013, you would bee line towards your point, plummeting down the sides of hills.\n\nOther thoughts:\nThe reset button needs some kind of timeout. It's too tempting to reset your tractors and equipment constantly. Maybe a minute or so, nothing silly.\n\nPicking up trees is hard, period. I've spent a good amount of time picking up tree trunks, sometimes it takes several minutes PER log, you need to gather hundreds of them.","November 3, 2014","true","104.7"," 62 of 74 people (84%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","84","62","74","4","0"

I am a logger and I'm going to cut down trees. I first discover a wide variety of farming equipment at my disposal. Harvesters, Combines, Tractors, all beautifully built and glistening in the sunlight. I decide to sell all of them in return for cash to spend on my logging dream.\n\nJournal Entry 2\n\nAfter selling all my equipment, spare one green tractor, I find myself still too broke to buy the Ponnse Processor or Buffalo. I opt for a chainsaw in the hopes that I can at least get things started. Although there is no plow blade for the tractor, I simply purchase a large weight that will attach to the front as my new bumper. I now have a means to cut down trees and a vehicle that can at least push the bits around until I get richer.\n\nJournal Entry 3\n\nI start things off by testing out my new chainsaw on a random tree (assuming that it wouldn't work on all trees). I pull out my husqvarna chainsaw and rev it up with a satisfying growl. To my surprise im able to cut down any of the trees that I see in the area. I pick a large poplar tree and make a precise angle slice in the base, a few moments of teedering and boom down she goes. I now discover that I'm able to buck this tree into as many bits that I want. Seriously I can cut this thing in to 1/10000's if I feel the need. After going Texas chainsaw massacre on the tree for about 15 mins I realize that the mill is on the other side of the map, screw this tree were heading for something closer.\n\nJournal Entry 4\n\nAfter trekking around the vast map full of lush trees, people, houses and breathtaking scenery I find myself at a rail yard. I have 3 points to unload logs, either at the train, the station beside the train or the big watery log pond in front of the mill. Since I only have my tractor as a pushing device I decide to start with the pond. I gracefully fall down trees bucking them up for what seems like hours. I carefully use my tractor as a plow and push the chopped tree bits into the pond gaining me more and more money. Finally after a few hours of hard work I have enough to purchase my Ponsse Processor.\n\nJournal Entry 5\n\nI feel like I've earned this, The purchase feels great, it feels right and im honored to own such a beautifully crafted logging vehicle. I hop in and start it up, It sounds heavy and roars when I lay down the throttle. This is what I've been waiting for, I head back towards the mill. I am now able to grab trees directly from standing and delimb/cut them into whatever lengths I choose. A small LCD screen inside the detailed cockpit tells me my length setup. I start grabbing trees and dragging them over to the pond, While over top of the pond I cut the tree into sections and drop them into the water. Now were making real money, I repeat this process until I again have enough money for my next investment the Ponnse Buffalo.\n\nJournal Entry 6\n\nI have purchased the Buffalo which has a similar build to the Processor but instead it has a big grapple for picking up logs and a bunk for stacking the logs and bringing them back to the mill. Now that I've cut down all the trees close to the mill It will be faster to process piles of lumber in the bush and just haul back double the amount on the buffalo. I have already processed several trees into nice neat piles so I take the buffalo out. While tearing up the side of the mountain to my new cut block I am starting to notice big mud tracks forming on the road and the mud splashes all over my vehicles, now were logging!\n\nJournal Entry 7\n\nI have loaded up my buffalo using it crane arm and grapple on all my pre-cut logs. I now have to carefully sneak back down the hill and get this stuff into the bank. Unfortunately I went a little to fast on one section and clipped a stump of a previously cut tree, this sent half my logs flying out of the bunks and all over the road. I then spent the next 20 mins maneuvering around cleaning up the mess. It pays to take your time.\n\nJournal Entry 8\n\nI have now delivered my logs and understand the process of logging, Its an addictive cycle and yet very relaxing. The repetition that would seemingly bore others to death becomes my salvation for peace. I park my 3 vehicles, grab the pressure washer and start to clean all the mud off in preparation for the next day. I am a now a virtual logger and im proud of it ;)","November 8, 2014","true","919.8"," 62 of 75 people (83%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","83","62","75","7","0"

Hell, I thought it was ♥♥♥♥ before I got it but it is so fun. There's a huge variety of machinery that you can buy, two very nice maps and tons of ways to earn your money. The physics engine is okay, pulling stuff up a hill feels rough at times and I think some tractors or combines slow down too much when pulling stuff up a hill (A 1100 PS Krone combine can't pull 50.000L silage up a ≈10° inclination for example), but after all the feeling when driving a vehicle is pretty okay, it feels similar to Euro Truck Simulator 2 in some aspects.\n\nThe multiplayer is a blast aswell. Everything is more fun with friends, from managing your farm over harvesting your crop to fooling around with a Telehandler. It's great.\n\nI can really recommend this, It might not be everyones cup of tea, so before buying you should probably watch a gameplay video or two but if you like simulators, this is a good game for you.","December 5, 2014","true","43.6"," 49 of 59 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","49","59","3","3"

(Do cows eat grass or is that sheep?)\n\n\nCows Don’t Eat Sheep!\n\nSure, it’s a pleasant break, you come away rested and relaxed but likely still just as ignorant to the workings of the patchwork fields that made up that rural vista you enjoyed so much.\nThis is where Farming Simulator 2015 steps in, with all its clever rural knowledge, its open world countryside to explore and a whole host of those strange “Farming Machines” for you to drive around, best of all, you don’t need to get up at 4am and put on your wellingtons to enjoy it.\n(Although you can... if it makes you happy!)\n\n\nPretty as a Picture\n\nThe Farming Simulator franchise has been around for a while now, each iteration bringing a new open world to explore, new game mechanics and updated visuals.\nI’m happy to say the latest outing doesn’t disappoint.\nThis is by far the most visually impressive Farming Simulator to date, the countryside is lush and colourful, the day and night cycle is suitably impressive and the vehicles are all beautifully modelled.\n(I used to think that if you’d seen one tractor, you’d seen them all – not so!)\n\n\nLet’s Get Physical\n\nPhysics in the game have been updated too, this time around your vehicles will leave deep tire tracks in the mud, ploughing and tilling soil will create troughs and ridges that you don’t want to get stuck in, we’re not talking “Spintires” levels of muddy terrain here, but enough for you to notice its impact, The physics in Farming Simulator 2015 really do help add to the sense of realism when driving around in the world.\n\nAnd what a world it is, you get two maps with the game, one in beautiful Bjornholm which contains a built in tutorial to get started working the land, the other is in wonderful Westbirdge, both maps are well designed and provide equally interesting open worlds to explore.\n\n\nFPS\n\nFor the uninitiated to the franchise, Farming Simulator is exactly what is says on the tin, A simulation of a working farm.\n\nYou start the game with your farmhouse, a few low end tractors, some basic machinery and a couple of fields.\nFrom there you’ll be preparing the soil, planting and harvesting a variety of different crops and either using them yourself as a resource for another farming related activity or more likely loading them onto a trailer, hooking it up to a tractor and driving it to sell at market.\n\nYou can control each vehicle from a third or first person perspective depending on your preference and drive around the open map to your hearts content (or at least until you run out of petrol).\nYou can hop out and walk around freely too. What we have here is an FPS (Farming Person Simulator).\n\n\nBovine Buddies\n\nIn addition to all the ploughing, seed sowing and harvesting of crops, which is much more fun than it sounds, there are several other agriculturally related activities for you try your hand at.\n\nBuying some livestock might be a good way to make some extra money; if you feel the need you could also just hang out with them in their field and watch the sun set (and if you’re the person getting up at 4am with your galoshes on to play farming simulator then I expect you’ll also be the one who feels that particular need.)\n\n\nI’m a Lumberjack and I’m OK\n\nForestry has been introduced officially into this 2015 instalment too, so if you’ve always fancied yourself as a bit of a lumberjack then you can put on your chequered shirt, (not literally, my early rising, welly wearing friend of the cows.) grab your chain saw and go ruin a trees day, no one will stop you, you’ve got a chainsaw!\n\n\nPiggy Bank\n\nSo now you’ve dabbled in all these activities and you’ve got some money saved up, maybe it’s time to expand the business.\nYou could buy another field or two to increase your crop rotation, you could hire some workers so you don’t have to do everything yourself too.\n\nAnother option might be to visit your friendly neighbourhood farming store and invest in some better machinery, your old tractor is having troubling pulling a full trailer up the hill to the silos after all.\n\n\nFarming Financials\n\nThe business tycoon element of the game is surprisingly comprehensive, the prices your produce will fetch at market will fluctuate, if a crop isn’t fetching a fair price you might be able to put it to a better use or store it in a silo and wait for the market to pick back up.\n\nThe locals never run out of odd jobs for you to do either, these missions pay relatively well when you’re just starting out as long as you’ve got the right tools for the job.\n\n\n4X\n\nThat’s farming simulator in a nutshell. You work the land, tend your animals, chop down the trees and try to make some honest money.\nMoney which you can then invest in more land and more animals to make even more money, which you’ll need to pay for the hired help and the extra machinery needed on your growing agricultural estate.\n\nYou “Explore”, “Expand” and “Exploit” the land, just don’t mention “Exterminate”, it worries the cows.\n\n\nEscape to the Country\n\nSo whether you want to enjoy the management side of the game, the free drive option of taking a tractor for a spin GTA style or just want an excuse to get up at the crack of dawn wearing nothing but wellingtons and a chequered shirt to watch the virtual sunrise with your animated cow friends, this game is for you!\nFarming Simulator 2015 is by far the best outing for the franchise and it really is an enjoyable, memorising game to play.\n\nTake a trip to the country, you’ll learn something and its fun!\n\n\n( To view the full review (and others) please take the time to visit http://www.review-well.com/  )","April 25, 2015","true","7.4"," 46 of 57 people (81%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","81","46","57","18","0"

I didn't play it much but though there can be some lagg and when someone joins the game has to sync which makes you unable to do anything for a short time, the multiplayer still can be a lot of fun and I can imagine you could have a lot of fun when you're playing on your own server with people that live nearby (better connection).\n\nOver all I recommend this game if you like simulation and farming, but if you only like games with a lot of action, then I wouldn't recommend buying this game. :)\n\n+ Graphics and physics are improved\n+ Map is (in my opinion) improved\n+ Lots of things to buy like tractors, trucks, tippers, etc.\n+ Lots of mods which are easy to install\n\n- Multiplayer laggs a bit for me and has to sync the game when someone joins\n- Gameplay can be a bit repetitive\n\n8,5/10\n\nHope this helped :)","December 12, 2014","true","28.4"," 39 of 46 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","39","46","0","0"

It's very relaxing, but also feels like my second job.  The addition of forestry does add a new element to the game, which is very easy to amass a fortune early on in the game.  The graphic upgrade is awesome.  The interface feels new and polished.  Ofcourse, there are several bugs at this stage.  The physics could use a little tweaking and the logging station has several issues with the unloading area at the train.  The ability to cut down pesky trees that get hired workers caught up is a nice touch!\n\nPROs - Graphics, Interface, Vehicle/Implement List, Forestry, Updated Challenge System, Dirt/Tire Tracking and FUN!\n\nCONs - Physics Bugs (Forestry Mainly), Easy to Make a Fortune (good/bad?), Manual is Lacking in Description (Big Learning Curve), No Forestry Tutorial and only One New Map.\n\n\nRegardless, if you're reading this...BUY IT!

I would rate this game a strong 6, so giving it a negative rating doesn‘t mean the game is bad, it‘s just lacks many things. Mainly i‘m giving a negative review for lack of effort from developers while making this game.\n\nThe gameplay is the same as in previous game. Except this time there‘s a forestry. Well, i thought so, but you just cut down trees growing on the side of the road and throw them into a pond to receive money. It would be nice to have real forests. The tree cutting physics could be better and more accurate. Sometimes it‘s too difficult to do everything from cutting the tree to throwing it into the pond. Physics are just off a bit. Talking about physics, this game doesn‘t shine in physics department. The tractor handling is very arcadey, the whole game is very arcadey. I want handling and physics to be something like Professional farmer. That game does some things better than Farming simulator, but sadly it‘s too buggy to play and developers abandoned the game and moved on to the next one. Another thing Pro farmer has done better is seasons. In this day and age it would be nice to have such simple feature. Considering the sale numbers this game has, developers should have more than enough money to make this game better.\n\nThis game fails at career...again. Career is simply a sandbox mode without any goals. You‘re the only farmer in the village and companies compete with each other who will pay you the most. It‘s just stupid. The map feels very empty. You don‘t have any control over your company, no management, nothing. You can hire a worker, but he appears when you hire him and disappears when you let him go. Your workers doesn‘t walk around doing things, it‘s like they‘re not existent. At least it's good the game has achievements so they will keep you occupied for some time.\n\nGraphics are slightly better than in 2013. The tractors and equipment now gets dirty after some time. Also they look pretty good. But that‘s it. The environments are terrible. Trees are ugly, they don‘t move, leaves are static, grass is low quality too. The worst is the sky. It‘s so bad it‘s ridiculous. People the game is made in 2014! The whole sky is one and the same flat sky texture which changes color depending on the time of day. There's no real lighting, the clouds are static flat textures and they don‘t move, sun is at the same spot all day, but shadows on the ground are still moving. It‘s really horrible and is unacceptable in this day.\nPlowing, seeding, harvesting is still fun. It‘s repetitive but relaxing, if you had goals in the game it would be much more fun. After hours of doing the same actions it gets boring.\n\nI would recommend this game if you don‘t own the previous one. You‘ll have some fun, but if own FS2013, this game doesn‘t offer anything new or different, it simply lacks improvements.\nI have hope that Cattle&Crops will be a good farming game and it will bring some competition.\n\n\nPros:\n\nGameplay is kinda fun and relaxing\nTractors/equipment models look nice\n\nCons:\n\nOutdated graphics\nForestry lacks depth\nNo proper career mode\nNo management\nToo arcadey","April 26","false","17.2"," 64 of 96 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","64","96","0","8"

Thats it. Nothing more, nothing less. The graphics really are much better. Both in quality as in detail (for example: tracks in the mud and tractors getting dirty). I would have liked it if they added more tycoon/business simulation features, a deeper career mode or more freedom in placing objects. Then it would have felt like a new game, now it feels more like a polished version of 2013/2014.\n\nKnowing that they sold over 2 million copies, i think they could have done more. Overall 7/10. I wouldn't really recommend buying the game if you already own a version of Farming Simulator. It feels too much of a cash cow.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/danny281/recommended/313160/","danny281","Zenonnn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/danny281/","48 products in account","An absolutely fantastic game, visually and gameplay wise. Firstly, some of the pros:\n- Stunning graphics\n- A reasonable amount of realism\n- Very well optimized (can run on even some low end systems)\n- Plenty of different tasks and jobs to do throughout\n- Very moddable\n\nAt the start, you are presented with two of the in game maps, one being Westbridge Hills, and the second one Bjonholm. Both maps have their differences, all dependant on what you're wanting to do. Bjonholm would be more idea for those that want to go off and work within the forestry area. Westbridge Hills on the other hand is more based around animal and field work. Throughout both maps, you can easilly put multiple hours in without even noticing.\n\nThe game has built in Multiplayer support meaning that you can team up with friends and have a blast of a session together. A very stable multiplayer build too, I must add. Within the Multiplayer platform you also have access to run mods on your own in game session. (Multiplayer sessions can be hosted in game, with a maximum capacity of 4 players. A dedicated server can be rented/ hired, which would allow for a 24 hour operation, and you can choose the amount of players you'd like the server open to.)\n\nThe modding community- Now this is where the game really starts to get interesting and exciting for many. This game is massively moddable. In the concept of different tools and machinery such as: Combine Harvesters, Seeders, Plows, Cultivators, etc... The list can go on for minutes. Some of the mods that you can find for this game are visually stunning and perform greatly around the farm. Of course with all mods, some you will find to be slightly buggy, but this is to be expected at times.\n\nPerformance- The game runs super smooth, on both high and low end systems. Configuration for graphics settings could not be made any easier than the way that it is configured in this game. You choose from the default presets that are available: low, high, very high. In order to get the highest render distances and maximum detail you're going to need a fairly good system to run it. But most laptop systems should be capable of running between medium and high profile settings.\n\nOverall, I'd strongly recommend this game to anyone that has an interest to agriculture. It looks great, plays great, and is a heap of fun. Definitely a 10/10 from me.","November 22, 2015","true","044.9"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","15","16","3","1"

I hate to even call it a game.\n\nSure, it can be gamed, by either trying to get the best equipment, become a millionaire, buy all the land in the village, have the best multi-player co-op, ect.

Broken up to the point that they were no longer feasible farms.\n\nSo in a way playing this is like going back to that moment in time where everything, in my eyes, was perfect Americana.\n\nWhy do I play? Because, to me, this isn't really a "game" per se.

They sit there and look ugly doing nothing.\n- Maps are lifeless, best part is waiting for sunrise and sunset to get some eye candy.\n- Poor economy .\n- You are able to drive over crops without damaging them.\n- Balance of manure, fertiliser, slurry out of whack. There is no balance or bonus to the 3 methods.\n- Missions are bland, only 3.

The little details like the machines getting dirty and doing so in a way that looks natural and leaving tyre tracks behind them also add to the immersion. Gameplay is slow (as it would and should be) but the ability to alter it on the fly in several different ways (time compression/plant growth rate/plant wilting rate) compensates that and limits the amount of time looking at a field full of immature wheat.\n\nNow I'm of to Wurzel!","October 31, 2014","true","20.6"," 23 of 32 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","23","32","0","0"

The graphics have improved and things look more realistic. For example, harvesting grain looks like grain and where you position the trailer lets the product build up in that part of the trailer before spreading out. Another example is that you can see the tire tracks on the ground, which is awesome. Another improvement is physics. The last game you could easily flip things over, but in this there is more weight and you can even feel a fully loaded trailer struggling to go up a hill. There are more vehicles, like a semi truck and forestry equipment, and more things to do, like cutting down trees with a chainsaw. You do have two maps to play as well, so there's more possibilities. Of course this game is fully moddable so there's even more trucks, tractors, and equipment to get for the game! I would recommend this game if you like farming sims.

The gameplay is credible. The physics are very much incredible. Although the person who designed the physics lives on the moon it is a rather good game. It is (except forestry) well balanced and enjoyable to a farming enthusiast. If you are willing to buy the game for it's multiplayer. Don't. You have to have friends who are willing to play for a fun multiplayer. The graphics have been improved to a high level from Farming Simulator 2013 and the content with it. The map feels small if you are driving across it at high speed. You'd probably be able to fly where you want to go with the physics. The forestry feature is OK to some extent. Trees never fall the way you want them and sometimes glitch and either fall into the ground or fire off into the stratosphere. (I have had both events occur in 24 hours of gameplay.) If you were to go straight into forestry and ignore the farming aspect of the game it would be a rather short and easy experience as you get 6x the amount of money for 2 hours of forestry than you would for 2 hours of farming. The farming aspect is almost the same as 2013; the same plants to grow, same method but with a couple new harvesters and many new tractors. The livestock feature also seems to be exactly copied over. A couple of the other new features include: tyre tracks that will follow exactly where your vehicle has been and dirt, your tractors may get dirty and grubby, but you are able to wash them with a power washer that costs £4,500. In the options, there aren't many. Although you can reset the key bindings for every key, but by default they are all the same as Farming Simulator 2013's which is a nice touch.\n\nOverall I think it is a good game and I would recommend it. If you ignore the physics and the small map then it is quite a good game. If you are unsure about getting Farming Simulator 15, buy 2013 first as it is cheaper and the only real difference is forestry. Everything else is cosmetic.\n\nSolaR","November 3, 2014","true","128.0"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","16","20","0","0"

It’s fun to drive up here in the Sosnovka marshes. But you know what I like more than tractors? Cows. In fact, I’m a lot more proud of these 50 new hay bales that I had to get an Ursus T-127 to hold until I mix them with the silage and straw. It’s like the billionaire Warren Buffett says, “the more you sow, the more you grow.”\n\nNow maybe you’ve seen my tedder talk where I talk about how I dry and windrow 17 cubic miles of grass every day. You know, I dry and windrow 17 cubic miles of grass every day not to show off, again it's about the cows. In fact, the real reason I keep this Lamborghini Mach 230 VRT here is that it’s a reminder. A reminder that dreams are still possible, because it wasn’t that long ago that I was in a little farmstead across the map driving a tiny little Sampo Rosenlew Comia C6 with only 185 horsepower.

It then becomes a time management issue to make sure you are plowing, sowing and harvesting in succession. If you get too many things going at once you'll end up with dead fields that are worthless.

I like that they added forestry. It adds something fun to do while waiting for crops to grow. Also, physics have been modified and are much more better than FS2013. I like the fact my tractor is rushing while I'm driving up a hill with a full trailer of wheat. Much more interesting than in FS2013 where you could go everywhere at top speed no matter what the tractor was pulling. The game needs alot improvement to be considered a real powerful simulator but Giant made a real step forward. We can feel their motivation to truely improve the game and not just release a new cash "grabber".\n\nAdd to this there is alot of FREE mods to customize the game. Very useful considering some vehicles in game are not always very smartly designed. For example, you can't load the wood trailer with a frond loader cuz trailler is too high. That's just dumb. You can only do it with telehandler. And you can only grab one trunck at time. So it takes incredible amount of time to load the trailer with wood. But some mods were designed to fix that issue and help players being more efficient. So well. I guess there is a mod to fix almost all those annoying "bugs".\n\nSo overall, a game I recommend if you enjoyed FS2013 or just enjoy farming sim. This is the best farming sim I played so far. Just waiting for DLCS to get onsale to get them all! :P Happy farming folks!","August 16, 2015","true","61.8"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","7","7","3","4"

Upgrade to the very best in forest industry and you basicially never have to do anything else, you are set-for-life with money if you are effective enough doing it. Usually what that means is that you chop down the very big trees, pull/lift them to the sawmill, get rewarded big.\n\nAnother problem is that you will figure out that Canola is the most profitable (when it's a wanted product). You can just grow Canola on all your fields, get a trailer and just stock up on it untill the businesses want more money for it, then you can also cash out big.\n\nIn FS13 the hint was to just mow grass with lawnmowers, 11k per mission which could trigger realisticly frequent. In this game that is not the case, that i approve. But instead you can just pump forest industry and then you eliminate most of the entire game's purpose due to just chop down trees.\n\nIn the end me and my friend who played it for 50-60 hours or so figured that you dont have to do anything in the game with farming. Sell your stuff, go strong in forest industry since it will be 100x times more rewarding then ploughing a field, cultivating a field, seeding a field, fertilizing a field > wait > harvest.\n\nIt's a huge shame, economy should be a key in this game, and for me it felt completely unaccurate and non realistic.\n\nI would recommend this game for others, if the economy in this game would be balanced. Since that would then be a cycle like this:\n\nWork hard > put back into your work and time > get rewarded > open up more fields, buy cattle > expand and start from point one > get more rewarded.\n\nNow it's like this\n\nSell tractors, buy forest industry vehicles (for starters, a chainsaw and something heavy to push the trees are enough) > get rewarded faster then cycle one > upgrade to best forest industry vechicles > have plently of cash left > ask yourself "Why would i spend it on farming industry since it's no point doing it now when i got so much money?" > You beaten the game.\n\nI had a good time in this game, but frankly - it's too easy and unbalanced. Hopefully it will become better in the future with FS16-FS17 or so.\n\nAnd yes, me and my friend played it on Hard. Was a piece of a cake.","December 9, 2015","false","55.1"," 42 of 74 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","42","74","0","2"

Big deal.  And then you try it - and I mean give it an honest shot of more than maybe a couple hours.  Next thing you realize is it isn't so much the graphics, which are decent in my opinion, or the equipment, or even the mods.  It becomes a thinking game - how to maximize your harvests, field and equipement management, cash flow, and more importantly - time management.   I find the need to sit back and prioritize what I am doing, and what purchases to make next take more of my concentration than actually working the fields.   Once I have a farm/map in a self sufficient state, usually by owning all of the property and sufficient equipment resources to manage it plus a substantial bank account, I typically call the game "won" and move on to the next map/challenge.\n\nIf you are finding the basic challenge of the game too easy, set a personal challenge such as only using a specific brand, or limiting yourself to a certain size of tractor.  The possibilities here are endless and can breathe new life into a new game.\n\nI have to give all the map and modder community the credit they are due.  Having tried my hand at generating even a simple map, it brings into focus the amount of time, and a certain degree of programming skills, necessary to create and publish these works.  My hat is off to you guys.  While the basic game is very much playable, and for the most part enjoyable, the ease of which additional features, tools, and equipment/tractors can be quickly added is a pleasant change.  Simply drop a zip file in a folder, start the game, and go.\n\nI would highly recommend this game to anyone who just wants to sit back and play at your own pace.  There are no finish lines, no objectives (other than the ones you set yourself), and no adrenaline rushes.  About the only thing you could be accused of is being a 'cereal' killer. ;)\n\nOh, and as for an addiction level, I think my gaming time speaks for itself.\n\nHappy Farming. :)","March 3","true","936.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","6","6","3","2"

They have improved just about everything in the game, from the way improved graphics, to the way easier to use interface makes this a much more relaxed and easy to use experence. If you just wana sit back do alot of mundane stuff, be well rewarded, and learn basic farming, on your time and pace. Then this is a great place to start. This is not COD, the most action you will see is rain. Wana play fast and hard, Look somewhere else. This is a great ZEN type game you can both learn from and just enjoy.

After a long wait, it's finally here. While the basic gameplay remains the same from previous versions, the graphical updates are truly stunning. Dirt shaders, and particle systems are among the game's crowning achivements. The upgraded physics shine as well as now you must carefully match your equipment's power tp the implements. The included maps are very nice although the inclusion of Westbridge Hills from the FS 2013 Titanium Addon is a bit disapointing. The new map Bjornholm is great and features many variations of field size and terrian. The addtion of forestry is a major part of this game's early succsess, although the actual mechanics of forestry are a bit buggy. The equipment is properly massive and very impressive in look and function. Gamers familiar with FS 2013 should be able to jump right in and play without any problems as the basic controls have remained the same. Steering Wheel/Gamepad users should be aware of a bug with key bindings in which ALL functions must be mapped or the game will not load. Overall this is a fantastic upgrade to an already great franchise and should take it's place on the top of the heap of simulation games.","November 1, 2014","true","336.6"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","12","19","0","0"

They still hit everything at the end of the fields.\n-They (the developers) still put stuff at the end of fields for workers to hit. I hoped they would've learned this by now.\n-Cutting logs was a mod in the previous version, so nothing in the game is new. Though logging is slightly improved.\n-Crops growing is not a fluent process just 4-5 different stages (like previous versions) , i was hoping for a fluent grow cycle by now.\n-Washing tractors and such is the same as the growth: just a couple of stages of dirt on the tractors and etc.\n-Crops still clip through tractor.\n-Some Equipment that was present in previous version is not here now.\n-Forestry is annoying with the physics in this game.\n-Physics in this game are still extremely unrealistic at times (Tokyo drift got nothing on some of the tractors in this game).\n-Collisions with vehicles are extremely unrealistic.\n-Night isn't really night. Again same as previous version.\n-Developers are really silent IMO even though there's a large community behind this game.\n-Some bugs that should've been solved with some testing.\n\n\n\nIn short: the game hasn't improved enough to merit a positive review or to recommend it especially if you played the previous versions. You're paying for a game with slightly better graphics and a different HUD.

I was able to retrieve an autosave backup, with only a hour or so lost, however continuing to plant more saplings caused the game to crash and delete the save files again losing a few more hours work.\nConsidering the amount of precious time invested, this to me is unacceptable.\nLosing three hours is the same as losing an entire gaming night.\n\nDespite my love of this game, I can't recommend this game until such an important feature, is fixed, and I personally hope it is fixed soon.","April 28, 2015","true","525.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/s1zzler/recommended/313160/","s1zzler","SizZLeR","http://steamcommunity.com/id/s1zzler/","40 products in account","In short, FS15 is better/improved in every way to any of its predecessors, therefore I recommend the game (overall rating 7/10).\n\n\nPhysics (6/10): They say its a new engine, however it does feel a lot like the old one in many ways, but some major improvements like not so "floaty" objects (tractors still go airborn when driving over small hills at 30 km/h though), solid AI vehicles and the machines actually loosing speed when going uphill and gaining speed going downhill are some VERY good improvements.\n\nIt still has the "bouncy" physics which for some parts doesn't matter but for other parts are downright annoying and makes the game hard to actually play sometimes.\n\nThere're some sort of "magnet" feature that steps in to aid the player in placing things like the scorpion king cutter by the tree so u don't have to be 100% precise with that.\n\nAlso when grinding trunks the same thing happens when u place logs on the conveyer belt and the end of the log comes close to the grinder unit.\n\nSometimes you feel the "magnet" feature works for you, while other times it seems to work straight against you.\n\nDue to the physics engine, log handling is very frustrating at times, somewhere around 50% of the time actually and things like the grinder than tends to bounce the logs all over the place are truly annoying, especially as once the end of a log bounces higher than the grinding unit and back down, the grinder no longer treats it as if its for grinding, it kinda ignores it somehow and the log will just lie there on the moving conveyer belt without being affected by it.\n\n\nControls (5/10): Im using an XBOX One controller via USB and FS15 is prepared for that, it even has some default controller scheme for it that works pretty bad, because none of the machines are controlled like you'd expect them to, for starters, the wheel loader has the arm up/down set in a way so u cant drive and steer while controlling the arm.\n\nIf u reconfigure the controls, then you cant set it up so the controls are correct for all machines and that's due to the way the controls are tied together, so if u set the wheel loader so the right stick controls the arm and bucket (like on a real wheel loader), your controls for cranes will become wrong and vise versa.\n\n\nGameplay (8/10): The machines way of deploying power is way better than in older FS games, so far I haven't experienced the scenario of a smaller tractor being more powerful than a bigger (higher HP) tractor, so now it actually pays to buy the tractor suitable for the given job, instead of just finding that one tractor that does it all better than any other tractor.\n\nThe logging part they added is nice, because it offers you to take a break when you get fed up by the repetitiveness of sowing and harvesting and you also makes so that you can do some logging during harvest so that you wont just sit around watching the hired worker fill up the harvester.\n\nThey also added the "no withering" option so when enabled, your crops wont wither and that makes it possible to actually have several fields and maintain them all without the risk of loosing the crop if not harvested in time.\n\nIn addition, it doesn't force you to attend to those fields until you feel like it.\n\n\nStability (8/10): I find the game to be VERY stable, ive had one crash only so far and that's after the game has been running for days where Ive played up to 8 hrs straight, then paused and tabbed out and used the computer for other purposes.\n\n\nBugs/exploits (6/10): There are bugs obviously and some of them are more annoying than others, but so far I haven't encountered any game breaking bugs.\n\nIn regards of exploits, there're plenty, especially when it comes to logging, but working the exploits soon becomes dull and boring and somehow the money grinding is more giving, though it returns less money in the game, but instead of seeing it as right or wrong ways to play the game, I started to see it as "freedom of choice" to play the game the way you want to play it.\n\nBecause maybe not everyone will enjoy every money grinding part of the game and in order to get some fast starters cash, they might prefer a little exploiting just to earn enough to get them going with what they wanna do and hence, spare them the boredom of doing what don't catch their interest in order to play the game.\n\n\nGraphics (8/10): The graphics are good and consistent, most objects has been completed into fine details and just like when you have a meal, if it looks good, its just a better experience than if it doesn't, even though the taste is the same.\n\n\nConclusion is, that there're plenty of room for improvements, but the game in its current state is very much worth the price.\n\nIts actually one of those games where id be prepared to pay twice the price if the physics were just that more refined so that things like the grinder would work flawlessly.\n\nRegardless, there're many many hours of entertaining gameplay to be had.\n\nEnjoy! :-)","November 7, 2014","true","569.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aandreas/recommended/313160/","Aandreas","Aandreas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aandreas/","28 products in account","I love farming simulator 15 and have played this game since FS2009 came out (back in mid 2008 I think); I play lots of other farming simulator games too, (like the old John-Deere-Farmer and Agricultural-Simulator series); I started playing farming-sim games even before the FS series came out. (In this series there was FS09, FS11, FS13 and now FS15 and I have them all).\n\nThe game survives because of the modding community that surrounds it, you can even get the Giants Software Game Editor, (some people call it the map-editor), where you can design your own maps and stuff like that. My fav of all time was FS11 mainly because I have the most mods for that particular game, (and I still play it from time to time).\n\nI even have some old FS09 maps that I like to delve back into.  If you are a GTA, BF or COD nut like me, I can say that you probably won't like this game, but I am a games geek and I like a change of pace. Most GTA and Cod players will say  this is a boring game, (and I'd agree with them if they don't have the correct mods installed). If you have a few specific mods, the game becomes a strategy game.\n\nNo farmer would spend a $350,000- or more; on a harvester and then have it standing idle. (There is a mod to allow you to play as a services company providing the farms with your machinery and your services to harvest the field).  But by far the best mods to have are (in this order), CoursePlay and the Follow Me Mod. The idea is to create courses to and from fields and more complex courses to empty harvesters to your grain silos, or put manure or slurry onto a field. etc.\n\nInstead of driving every vehicle yourself everytime, 'YOU MANAGE' your farm, by recording and setting up courses to reply when you want. It is just a case of cycling through your vehicles and keeping everything running. (And, that reminds me of another mod you need); You should get the Vehicle Selector mod too, it's called the 'Vehicle Switcher' (Or grouper mod is another). You can hold left CTRL to the press a number on the keyboard to select any vehicle in the 1 to 10 slots - and it can manage up to 40 vehicles. L-CTRL+No. L-Shift+No. R-CTRL+No. R-Shift+No. It beats Tabbing through 40 vehicles!\n\nIf you get really good at playing this game and want a real challenge, then adding the soil-mod will raise the game difficulty! Depending upon for you treat your field, just like a real farmer has to; you will gain more crops (yield), from the crops harvest cycle of the field. It takes more time to play though!\n\nYou can also add more realism by adding the 'Damage the crops mod' which just means if you drive over your crops, you flatten and crush them just like in real life.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/s1zzler/recommended/313160/","s1zzler","SizZLeR","http://steamcommunity.com/id/s1zzler/","40 products in account","In short, FS15 is better/improved in every way to any of its predecessors, therefore I recommend the game (overall rating 7/10).\n\n\nPhysics (6/10): They say its a new engine, however it does feel a lot like the old one in many ways, but some major improvements like not so "floaty" objects (tractors still go airborn when driving over small hills at 30 km/h though), solid AI vehicles and the machines actually loosing speed when going uphill and gaining speed going downhill are some VERY good improvements.\n\nIt still has the "bouncy" physics which for some parts doesn't matter but for other parts are downright annoying and makes the game hard to actually play sometimes.\n\nThere're some sort of "magnet" feature that steps in to aid the player in placing things like the scorpion king cutter by the tree so u don't have to be 100% precise with that.\n\nAlso when grinding trunks the same thing happens when u place logs on the conveyer belt and the end of the log comes close to the grinder unit.\n\nSometimes you feel the "magnet" feature works for you, while other times it seems to work straight against you.\n\nDue to the physics engine, log handling is very frustrating at times, somewhere around 50% of the time actually and things like the grinder than tends to bounce the logs all over the place are truly annoying, especially as once the end of a log bounces higher than the grinding unit and back down, the grinder no longer treats it as if its for grinding, it kinda ignores it somehow and the log will just lie there on the moving conveyer belt without being affected by it.\n\n\nControls (5/10): Im using an XBOX One controller via USB and FS15 is prepared for that, it even has some default controller scheme for it that works pretty bad, because none of the machines are controlled like you'd expect them to, for starters, the wheel loader has the arm up/down set in a way so u cant drive and steer while controlling the arm.\n\nIf u reconfigure the controls, then you cant set it up so the controls are correct for all machines and that's due to the way the controls are tied together, so if u set the wheel loader so the right stick controls the arm and bucket (like on a real wheel loader), your controls for cranes will become wrong and vise versa.\n\n\nGameplay (8/10): The machines way of deploying power is way better than in older FS games, so far I haven't experienced the scenario of a smaller tractor being more powerful than a bigger (higher HP) tractor, so now it actually pays to buy the tractor suitable for the given job, instead of just finding that one tractor that does it all better than any other tractor.\n\nThe logging part they added is nice, because it offers you to take a break when you get fed up by the repetitiveness of sowing and harvesting and you also makes so that you can do some logging during harvest so that you wont just sit around watching the hired worker fill up the harvester.\n\nThey also added the "no withering" option so when enabled, your crops wont wither and that makes it possible to actually have several fields and maintain them all without the risk of loosing the crop if not harvested in time.\n\nIn addition, it doesn't force you to attend to those fields until you feel like it.\n\n\nStability (8/10): I find the game to be VERY stable, ive had one crash only so far and that's after the game has been running for days where Ive played up to 8 hrs straight, then paused and tabbed out and used the computer for other purposes.\n\n\nBugs/exploits (6/10): There are bugs obviously and some of them are more annoying than others, but so far I haven't encountered any game breaking bugs.\n\nIn regards of exploits, there're plenty, especially when it comes to logging, but working the exploits soon becomes dull and boring and somehow the money grinding is more giving, though it returns less money in the game, but instead of seeing it as right or wrong ways to play the game, I started to see it as "freedom of choice" to play the game the way you want to play it.\n\nBecause maybe not everyone will enjoy every money grinding part of the game and in order to get some fast starters cash, they might prefer a little exploiting just to earn enough to get them going with what they wanna do and hence, spare them the boredom of doing what don't catch their interest in order to play the game.\n\n\nGraphics (8/10): The graphics are good and consistent, most objects has been completed into fine details and just like when you have a meal, if it looks good, its just a better experience than if it doesn't, even though the taste is the same.\n\n\nConclusion is, that there're plenty of room for improvements, but the game in its current state is very much worth the price.\n\nIts actually one of those games where id be prepared to pay twice the price if the physics were just that more refined so that things like the grinder would work flawlessly.\n\nRegardless, there're many many hours of entertaining gameplay to be had.\n\nEnjoy! :-)","November 7, 2014","true","569.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aandreas/recommended/313160/","Aandreas","Aandreas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aandreas/","28 products in account","I love farming simulator 15 and have played this game since FS2009 came out (back in mid 2008 I think); I play lots of other farming simulator games too, (like the old John-Deere-Farmer and Agricultural-Simulator series); I started playing farming-sim games even before the FS series came out. (In this series there was FS09, FS11, FS13 and now FS15 and I have them all).\n\nThe game survives because of the modding community that surrounds it, you can even get the Giants Software Game Editor, (some people call it the map-editor), where you can design your own maps and stuff like that. My fav of all time was FS11 mainly because I have the most mods for that particular game, (and I still play it from time to time).\n\nI even have some old FS09 maps that I like to delve back into.  If you are a GTA, BF or COD nut like me, I can say that you probably won't like this game, but I am a games geek and I like a change of pace. Most GTA and Cod players will say  this is a boring game, (and I'd agree with them if they don't have the correct mods installed). If you have a few specific mods, the game becomes a strategy game.\n\nNo farmer would spend a $350,000- or more; on a harvester and then have it standing idle. (There is a mod to allow you to play as a services company providing the farms with your machinery and your services to harvest the field).  But by far the best mods to have are (in this order), CoursePlay and the Follow Me Mod. The idea is to create courses to and from fields and more complex courses to empty harvesters to your grain silos, or put manure or slurry onto a field. etc.\n\nInstead of driving every vehicle yourself everytime, 'YOU MANAGE' your farm, by recording and setting up courses to reply when you want. It is just a case of cycling through your vehicles and keeping everything running. (And, that reminds me of another mod you need); You should get the Vehicle Selector mod too, it's called the 'Vehicle Switcher' (Or grouper mod is another). You can hold left CTRL to the press a number on the keyboard to select any vehicle in the 1 to 10 slots - and it can manage up to 40 vehicles. L-CTRL+No. L-Shift+No. R-CTRL+No. R-Shift+No. It beats Tabbing through 40 vehicles!\n\nIf you get really good at playing this game and want a real challenge, then adding the soil-mod will raise the game difficulty! Depending upon for you treat your field, just like a real farmer has to; you will gain more crops (yield), from the crops harvest cycle of the field. It takes more time to play though!\n\nYou can also add more realism by adding the 'Damage the crops mod' which just means if you drive over your crops, you flatten and crush them just like in real life. I see this fault all the time in 'Let's Play' videos on YT. where virtual farmers are driving on the wrong side of their harvester to empty it. (The wrong side being the side where the crops are still growing).\n\nIf you want to know more, go see my blog.

I got a bit disappointed since it feels more as a DLC then a new game.\nCons:\n- There is only 1 new map since the US map was from the last FS2013 DLC\n- Really bad driving physics\n- The skybox looks like crap (No moving clouds and static night skybox f.ex)\n- No improvement in the grapichs department\n- Cockpitview badly detailed and blurred out\n- A tad to easy to earn money if you go for only logging\n\nPros:\n- Some new equipment\n- Nicely detailed tractors/equipment\n- New stuff to do due to the added logging equipment etc\n- The new Scandinavian map feels bigger\n- Weight counts in when transporting stuff\n- Equipment draw horsepowers from the tractors so a weak tractor cant use f.ex a mower and a trailer to pick it up at the same time. Adds more realism that way.\n- Much better and minimalistic UI :)\n\nAll in all its a perfectly good game for the people who never tried FS2013.\nFor the "veterans" from FS2013 its gonna be a bit disappointed.

Living in the country surrounded by farm land and from a recommendation from a friend I was enticed in to try this.    It's critical you watch a few videos first to get a understanding of what to do.  I did that before buying this.\n\nI've spend over 50 hours in this game. That's quite a lot for me these days.  While on paper simulators and one about farming sounds boring, I found this to be the most rewarding game in recent years for entertainment value.\n\nIf your a solo player like me and want to do one of the bigger maps. You really have to start modding the game so you can harvest and replant a feild in an hours time .\n\nI found it pretty educational as well.  I always wondered why a farm around my way had a massive white tarp with hundreds of tires on top of it. Figured it was used to dry grain.  While driving past it last week I noticed the cover was off and saw dark hay and realized it was Silege, something I didn't know prior to this game.    I can also identify and understand all the farm equipment that drives past my house.\n\nWhile the game is simple in nature there is something very therapeutic about it and fun.\n\nMy only 2 complaints is the size of the equipment later on in the game when you make out well is too taxing with time to manage as a solo player, it can be hard to find the right mode that balances this so it's not too strong and takes the fun of it.\n\nMy other complaint is some actions such as bailing hay, mowing grass, and hauling product does not have a autopilot feature. Doesn't sound like a big deal and it's not starting out.  But when your managing a lot of stuff all your time is invested in performing those same exact actions manually and it's no longer enjoyable because your forced to spend all your time doing it.   If they added that I have no doubt I could pick it up again and keep going.\n\nRecommend this game for sure, had a great time.","June 3","true","53.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

In general, I find that the game is more interesting in multiplayer mode when tasks can be delegated to friends rather than being set in a to-do list and possibly forgotten. After many hours of play, most of the work you do involves driving from place to place and monitoring the (more often than not) hopelessly myopic hired workers. Still, I highly recommend this as a great way to pass time if you are interested in simulators.","May 19, 2015","true","98.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

And there are things to really love about this game, especially the attention to graphical detail.  This is a much 'prettier' game than FS13, no question.\n\nGiven how much time and money they obviously spent on the aesthetics of this game, I'm forced to shake my head on how they managed to so completely screw up the physics, the most fundamental gameplay element.  The trucks slide around corners like they're greased in buttermilk.  The tractors and wagons act like Bambi first walking across the frozen pond behind Thumper. The whole game feels like an extended viewing of Olympic ice dancing and I half expect a French judge to give me a '6' on my routine.\n\nI guess part of the issue is that I came from FS2013 using the More Realistic mod which, combined with the Soil Management Mod, actually caused FS2013 to approach the status of 'simulator'.  But this is just a huge step backward.  I can only beg them to quickly release a patch to both restore the physics to the FS2013 standard or, at the very least, release the Developer specs so that those more intelligent than I can do it themselves.  It's just a travesty that they haven't fixed this yet and I check my steam account every night waiting for them to finally get off their butts and fix this game.  As it stands I won't even let my 7 year old son play it, I just point him toward fs2013.  "The game is still broken and it's not worth the aggravation, son."\n\nWhen the physics is fixed this game has the potential to far exceed the experience of older FS versions (and any other farming simulator).  Right now it feels like a half-baked developer version.","February 20, 2015","false","26.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Power is simulated, for example, your tractor have to be powerful enough to run an implement, and go up hills at the same time.\nPhysics are bit wonky at time, mostly on multiplayer with bad pings.\nYou also need some discipline to not put all the game settings on easy, fast growth, and make time go forward, otherwise you can just use passive to make the game run for 50 years and have enough money for everything.\n\nSo, if you aren't too much into simulators, or don't like farming that much, this game will probably be a 6/10 for you, and you should wait for a sale to check it out. If you are into simulator, and into farming, then this will easily be a 9/10 for you.

Simlation? Yeah...that's cool.\n\nWell I have enjoyed this version. I have only played 2013 before, and I didn't play it for very long. This version is much better, it's nice to have the polished look beause when you get a new tractor it's more "baddass".\n\nThe new forestry is fun at first, but it's not very practicle. You have to load the trees, haul them and unload them to sell them. It's fun if you are playing multiplayer, drunk, and laughing at how bad you suck at it. Even if I mastered loading logs I don't see it as a practicle way to make money in the game.\n\nI find it fun to organize my farm and make sure I try everything. I'm not a fan of the time it takes to get money initially, so I recommend easy mode to start. Play that for a bit, but I'll be honest--I cheated and gave myself 5 million dollars and the game was a lot more fun from there. Normally I'm against cheating, but the game opens up when you have options on what to do.\n\nRecommend, it has consumed two weekends.

Having said that, I want to say that it is somewhat of a let down. I have played this game from the very first one and it keeps getting better but I was expecting more. The new grafics aren't good enoght to make a differance. Some, like the fence around the chicken area is just plain bad. The one thing they added that I really wanted was rearveiw mirrors that actually reflect what is behind you, but all you can see is the ground and there is no way to adjust them. They added new equipment but there is a lot less of it now. I don't even want to get started about the new PDA screen (I don't know what else to call it). But it sucks.\nOne thing I was hopeing they would fix was the information screen that pops up across your screen while your trying to drive. But with this new thing it's even worse.\n\nAll in all, it's still the great game it was but not what I was hopeing it would be. I will keep playing and hope for some great updates and mods.

I have logged 60 hours in this game already (albiet, I left the game afk but not paused from about 6pm to 3pm the next day accidentally).\n\nThe logging is a little bit broken when it comes to prices. You can buy Fir trees (huge trees that the scorpionking can actually harvest) for $7,000, and place them (like the wind turbines, bee hives etc) right next to the logging depot. You bring your scorpion king over there, rip the whole tree from the ground, and drag it (not even bothering to limb or section it) and kabam you get ~$80,000 for it. SImply spend that on 11 more trees and presto infinite money without modifying the save.\n\nOther than that the only complaint I have is that the NPC cars are immovable. As in you can hit them at 50 MPH and they dont budge. (I always loved picking them up and tossing them into the river in FS2011) For something really funny, buy the Semi-Truck and the Low Loader trailer. Open the back ramp, and back the trailer up to a NPC car like you are going to load it in. Back as far as you can, so the ramp is wedged under the car. Press 'X' to fold up the ramp, and it will lift the whole truck into the air like it has massive hydrolics. If you press 'X' over and over carefully, then press 'Q' at the perfect time, you can throw your Semi-Truck pretty far.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I love this game. I never bought FS13, and this game is several orders of magnitude better than  FS2011","November 9, 2014","true","148.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you enjoyed playing the older farming simulators and got tired of the tractors falling over all the time, and all the parts on the tractor that should move but didnt. If you couldnt stand how trees got in your way when planting. You will love this new simulator, like first off when you drive the tractors you can feel and see how they react to the ground, and how they do get overloaded and slid down hills when the wagon is too heavy. When you drive it leaves tracks and the rain and dust dosnt come in the cab. When you unload grain in to a wagon is fills according to how the grain is falling. The combines are completly redone and you dont start out with some turd, you get a quality combine. When you do get your wagon full you will notice hills are not your friend lol. The wood cutting is briliant and they took their time, you notice it in the game. All in all if you want to have some fun and share mods with your friends then i highly recomend this gam to every farming simulator lover.","November 1, 2014","true","151.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Simlation? Yeah...that's cool.\n\nWell I have enjoyed this version. I have only played 2013 before, and I didn't play it for very long. This version is much better, it's nice to have the polished look beause when you get a new tractor it's more "baddass".\n\nThe new forestry is fun at first, but it's not very practicle. You have to load the trees, haul them and unload them to sell them. It's fun if you are playing multiplayer, drunk, and laughing at how bad you suck at it. Even if I mastered loading logs I don't see it as a practicle way to make money in the game.\n\nI find it fun to organize my farm and make sure I try everything. I'm not a fan of the time it takes to get money initially, so I recommend easy mode to start. Play that for a bit, but I'll be honest--I cheated and gave myself 5 million dollars and the game was a lot more fun from there. Normally I'm against cheating, but the game opens up when you have options on what to do.\n\nRecommend, it has consumed two weekends.

Having said that, I want to say that it is somewhat of a let down. I have played this game from the very first one and it keeps getting better but I was expecting more. The new grafics aren't good enoght to make a differance. Some, like the fence around the chicken area is just plain bad. The one thing they added that I really wanted was rearveiw mirrors that actually reflect what is behind you, but all you can see is the ground and there is no way to adjust them. They added new equipment but there is a lot less of it now. I don't even want to get started about the new PDA screen (I don't know what else to call it). But it sucks.\nOne thing I was hopeing they would fix was the information screen that pops up across your screen while your trying to drive. But with this new thing it's even worse.\n\nAll in all, it's still the great game it was but not what I was hopeing it would be. I will keep playing and hope for some great updates and mods.

Qualification, included.\n\nThe title "Farming Simulator" is correct as it is a very nice, beautiful recreation of using various pieces of farming equipment. What it is not, is a "Farm Simulator", designed to simulate actually running a farm. There is a complete abcense of any risk in this game. While you vehicles require an arbitrary daily upkeep amount, your tractor cannot break down at a vital moment just before harvest. Running at full speed off a cliff or into another vehicles has no effect or repercussions. There are no competing farms to undercut you or try to drive you out of business or market crashes that leave you with tons of surplus you cannot sell without taking a hit and everything can sit in your silos for years without decay. Where are the insect infestations that can ruin your crops or tornados or freak storms that can destroy parts of your farm? Why do you start the game with nice equipment and a 'complete farm' out of the gate? Why not one barn and build your structures as you go. And what point are the structures? They don't protect your equipment from rain or rust? No one steals your equipment as I have left it sitting in the middle of town for days.\n\nI could go on and on but you get the point. It is a very pretty, mechanically solid rendition of what it is like to run around using various pieces of farm equipment but other than driving stuff to a dumper and watching a single screen for price fluctuations there is very little depth to the game. I know players will say, well that is what mods are for... no. Players should not be made responsible for fleshing out elements that really should have been in the title to begin with in order to qualify to really be called a simulator. Is it a bad game, not at all. But it really should be understood it is a game with no real risk, just keep playing and eventually everyone will own the entire map and 'win'.","April 8, 2015","true","38.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is not s first person shooter, nor a racing game I think the fastest Truck will do  maybe 100. The tractors even less. if you are looking for a game that is as exciting as watching grass grows this is it. The modding community is one of the best there is at least a new map from them every week,\nThe Software company does patch it pretty often most of the time they do fix things, The game can be as tame as you like or as bizarre as you can take from having 20 different crops and 4 differnt animals to raise plus milking over 1000 cows. to farming 20 acres and picking up 10 eggs.\nI play to relax, like I said you don't get big prizes for completing a crop you learn to play the game better. I am looking at busting maybe 5000 hours before the next edition.\nBig plus the physics have been taken care of except for the forestry part but it is coming along well. yes I like that part of the game too.\nThe one wierd part is that you get to buy wind generators and yes you can just plant those and sit back and watch the money roll in .....but what kind of fun is that.\nI would like to make sure that the modders do get the thanks they deserve Great Job everyone that has put out even the little ones!","February 5","true","172.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I saw FS13 and thought, "what a stupid game. It's just trying to get downloads" (*cough* Garbage truck simualtor *cough*). I then saw squirrels video on the game and it actually looked really good! I bought it for $26 and I could of never been any happier.\n\nPros:\nGraphics are a huge improvement over 2013\nNew equipment\nSupport for Logitech G27\nRidiculously easy to add mods!\n\nCons:\nI wish the driving mechanics were slightly better.\n\nOverall if you see this game on any sort of sale, get your credit cards out! It's not really worth the 32.99 because this game goes on sale often. It's definitely a worthy upgrade from FS13 if you got some cash burning a hole in your pocket","December 28, 2014","true","40.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is by far, the most exciting simulator I have ever played. I grow tired some days of the chaos of first person shooters and just want to kick back, relax, and have fun playing a game, at the pace I want to play it. If you have days where you feel the same, I highly recommend you try Farm Simulator 2015. Many improvements over FS 2013, especially with the "hired workers". The graphics will "blow your mind". From tire tracks and dust from the tractors, to wheat blowing gently in the wind. Furthermore, there is a large community of "mod" makers and a ton of mods one can download to enhance the simulator even further. You can even go as far as creating your own map via the Giants Editor. When you download the game for the first time, make sure you update your graphics card as this simulation uses a "state of the art" graphics engine.

My addiction started back in 2012 when 2013 came out. I purchased it, and then I had gotten to 198 hours before 15 came out. I loved 2013 so much, but 15 really was a big improvement with logging. The graphics and overall performance of the game is excellent, and it runs perefect on most mid range laptops/desktops. I personally like the ability of modding the game with modded maps, tractors, implements, semis, trailers, tillage, soil mods, texture mods, plant mods, etc., created by other people. The modding is the best part, in my opinion.\n\nAnother thing I really like is multiplayer. I would like to put out that I've met 3 friends and have continued to play with them. Believe it or not, I have connected with them on other forms of social media (Facebook). Another one of them actually has my mobile number, and we text regularly. :) It just makes me happy because where I live, no one listens to me and I don't really have ANY friends. So when I'm not at school, I can come home and get on my computer and play/connect with my friends that I don't have where I live. This just shows the power of this game and how it has changed my life. I actually loved the previous version so much that I preordered 15, and also have purchased the Gold expansion recently only because it was on the Christmas sale, and I had left over money after another purchase.\n\nIf you read all that or not, it doesn't matter much. No matter what I will ALWAYS recommend this game to any patient person who is willing to wait for things. I would mostly recommend to any fellow farmers out there.\n\nThis is my full review of Farming Simulator 15 the game for PC by GIANTS. If this inspires you to purchase this game, I'm very happy about that. PLEASE support GIANTS for what a great game they have created. Their game changed my every day life. It just might change yours too. :)","December 30, 2015","true","507.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have never worked on a farm, raised chickens or a cow.  I think I only wore overalls when I was a kid and my parents dressed me.  Needless to say that farming or simulator games aren't normally my flavor of game.  It seems most people who wrote reviews of this game have similar stories, just bought it to check it out when it was on sale.  I can't seem to stop playing this game though.  My two young boys LOVE watching all the farming equipment move around and watching grain spit out of a harvester.\n\nGame includes items that I have no idea what they do and some research had to be done on my part to figure out whats going on.  The tutorial is good in that it briefly shows you how to use the machines, which is good.  But when you hit the store, its hard to plan out what to buy.  I noticed that some equipment doesn't work with some tractors.  To harvest corn vs. wheat, you may need a different combine front attachment.  Lets just say that this game is super in-depth and its easy to work the equipment, but difficult to know the specific equipement does and plan out what you want to plant in what field.  Do you plant only one crop in many fields? Or to play the market and sell only when the sell price is high and therefore have to plant multi crops in multi fields?\n\nSince I don't have any other sim type games to compare or experience in farming I can't really give a numbered rating but I will say that its for sure worth the money.  Its fun to sit back and watch the money roll in and buy some awesome looking tractors to make your job easier.","December 24, 2015","true","79.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I don't care. This game is inexplicably...FUN. Sure, it has room for improvement. The limitation to the amount of crop types is kinda meh. Maybe I want to grow lettuce or pineapple or pumpkins or (the list goes on and on). It's extremely easy to cheat (edit saved game in your fav text editor, win). The physics can sometimes be frustrating. Some game elements aren't explained at all and left for the user to try to figure out. This would be fine if those things were intuitive but they're not. Oh, and operating various lifts and boom tools can leave you wanting to throw your PC OR Mac out the window. And despite all this, the product is still FUN. It's not great. It's not that epic. You're limited to what you can do with it. But again, once you get beyond your first little field and start to branch out, you have a feeling of self worth and satisfaction that many of today's games don't provide.","December 22, 2015","true","157.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Think they could have put more into the addons like cargo gets strapped on to the trailer when driving like you would do in real life to, it is a simulator. And for the metal that is flexible specialy on cranes on the lumber machine or trailers a bit disapoiting.\n\nbut for the good part you can chose what you like to farm and harvest and so.","December 13, 2015","true","40.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/feydk/recommended/313160/","feydk","feydk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/feydk/","37 products in account","I had no idea farming could be so much fun.\n\nTry to pitch this game to someone who doesn't know what it is about: Yeah, so you mount a sower on your tractor, drive to the field and sow it, then you drive back, unmount the sower, mount a fertilizer and drive back to the field to fertilize it. Then you speed up the game and wait 5 minutes until the crops has grown. Then you get in your harvester and start harvesting, but you also have to bring a tractor with a tipper, so you can unload the crops. When the entire field has been harvested, you must cultivate the field first, and then you start over.\n\nI just realized how boring that sounds. But that's the funny thing about this game; it sounds SO boring and bland, but in reality it is surprisingly fun. I don't know why. The youtubers I've watched playing the game also don't know why. It just is.\n\nBut.. once you've passed the 10-20 hour mark and start making real progress, have to manage multiple fields and do your best to come up with the most efficient flow, you start to get a little frustrated by the lack of automation in the game. Basically you have one option and one option only: when you have aligned your machine with the field, you can "hire worker" to get the stuff done. That's fine and works as intended, for the most part..\nBut the workers are pretty stupid. They get stuck very easily, and you won't notice until you happen to tab into the worker's machine, only to discover that the entire proces has been halted for 30 minutes because he ran into a tree while he was turning, and apparently he hasn't heard of this thing called "to reverse". HUGE con: The game does not give you any feedback on workers AT ALL, so you have to constantly tab through all your stuff to make sure everything is running smoothly. You also can't make workers do "passive" stuff, like wait for a harvester to get full and then drive up to it with a tipper, or tell them to unload crops from the silo and drive it off to a sell point. In other words, once you have a handful of fields, you'll be quite busy monitoring the progress, giving work orders, driving equipment from one field to another, helping stuck workers get unstuck and so on. And that's where the tediousness kicks in and the fun factor starts to decline.\n\nThe extreme lack of automation drives most people to use mods, or, well, one mod in particular, called Courseplay. Obviously this is a review of the vanilla game, so I will just say this: while Courseplay does offer a lot more automation features, it is very far from perfect. Courseplay will have you curse at the screen repeatedly, because the AI is basically still extremely poor. Even though you can make workers do more things, especially the "passive" stuff, you still have to sort out stuck workers all. the. time. So don't expect any wonders, only a little help. And more frustration.\n\nSaid frustration is the reason why I've stopped playing this game now. But it took 76 hours before I reached that point, and it was great fun until then. I consider that pretty good value for money.","February 9, 2015","true","75.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Now that I have made the move to PC I can finally improve things that were lacking in this game on console. The game overall is just really fun and accurate to real life. Playing this game solely with dlcs and the base contents, I feel that giants should have created some bigger vehicles for some of the tasks at hand. The dlcs were great but as people always say, "bigger is better" and that's my only complaint. Maybe in the future they will add bigger better vehicles and implements.

Probably very slow paced in single player but with some clueless teammates, it's a lot more fun than it may appear.\n\nRecommended because it's a good simulator with an absolute load of machines you never knew existed and plenty of things to try and do. Above all, it's actually fun. Maybe not as good as Euro Truck Simulator 2, but both aim at a very small target and hit it beautifully.\n\nEDIT\nIt doesn't have a very good tutorial. New players get confused about how to do some of the basic things such as switch between vehicles or how to work their new farm. That's pretty essential for the game that is first and foremost about farming. The few tutorials show several stages of crop production but leave a lot unexplained.\n\nPacing of the game is a bit slow unless timewarp is used. Even then the game fall into the trap of making life miserably difficult early on, only to make it easier and easier as the player progresses. Basically, as you earn more money, you can invest in better machinery that can increase yield and work more of the land, which means as you become more succesful, there is less and less to do except organise your hired hands.\n\nTo break up the monotony, there is much to experiment with and learn. Some very specialised machinery exists and since it's pricey, it will offer something to spend money on. Then there is tending to animals or growing more complicated crops. The nice thing is that all of this can be attempted at the player's own initiative. You're never forced to do anything you don't like.\n\nMoving the lawns or cutting down trees is more removed from working fields and is implemented very well. Forestry equipment alone is simulated very well.\n\nIt takes time to derive pleasure from this Farming Simulator, but the fun is definitely there. You'll have to work and figure out what to do with your initially limited cash flow in order to explore all the branches available. When it all falls into place, it feels quite nice.\n\nNow multiplayer is something else. Teamwork really speeds things up and is a great source of both comedy and confusion. Oh and the innuendo potential is enormous with all the ploughing and seed and log jams. The only downside to multiplayer is that it's not very easy to get enough friends at the same time, and it is a bit time consuming but when it happens it's a lot of fun.","January 1","true","37.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Think they could have put more into the addons like cargo gets strapped on to the trailer when driving like you would do in real life to, it is a simulator.

I feel like they got the basic mechanics correct and polished it. They didnt get over-ambitious and then blow it like so many game developers do. It reminds me of how Blizzard operates. Simple design, simple ruleset. Build out from a solid foundation. That being said I feel like the UI in this current version is a step backward and there wasnt much operational progress. The major difference in 15 over 13 is the addition of Forrestry operations. In general however there are many aspects of the game to explore such as animal husbandry, jobs and missions and the afore mentioned forrestry.\n\nThere are many aspects of this game i'd like to see improved. The UI is not entirely terrible but far from ideal. Detail is pretty low and viewing distance could be better. AI could definately be upgraded however what it does do it does well.\n\nAs I mentioned before the game feels right. There are a few little gotchas. Nothing i'd really call bugs. Sometimes there is weirdness with the physics engine but generally it works quite well.\n\nWatching something boring but not boring enough to stop watching? Farming Simulator is excellent mental wood putty.","February 26","true","308.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So I parted with my cash and took a step into the world of FS2015.\n\nIt is just sublime, the machinery models and animations are spot on, and the earning curve for cash allows you to slowly build up a nice suite of machines.  Managing multiple helpers around the map doing tasks whilst trying to keep the crops growing and finding new ways to earn cash actually becomes quite hectic.\n\nAs a negative, a little more info about crop growing, improving yields etc would be useful.... but hey.. that's what the community is for.\n\nFS2015 works brilliantly with a controller and once you get your head around the multiple button combo system for functions it enhances the vehicle handling.... and you can even drift tractors.... ish!\n\nIt is one of the best sand box sims I have played, and I hope the developers keeping pushing what they can do with the subsequent releases.","January 31, 2015","true","30.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Now that I have made the move to PC I can finally improve things that were lacking in this game on console. The game overall is just really fun and accurate to real life. Playing this game solely with dlcs and the base contents, I feel that giants should have created some bigger vehicles for some of the tasks at hand. The dlcs were great but as people always say, "bigger is better" and that's my only complaint. Maybe in the future they will add bigger better vehicles and implements.

It should be the most boring game in the world.\n\nThe hours I have spent following rows of straw pulling the tedder. Or Running the first few widths of headland so that the non-too-bright hired worker doesn't run the combine through a hedge. I should be smashing my face against the keyboard to relieve the tedium.\n\nBut FS2015 draws you in with it's strangely relaxing gameplay. The daily running of your farm machinery, of which there is a vast array to choose from (when you have earned the money to buy it) is every bit as involving as levelling your character in other more visceral games. The minutiae of farm management will become an obsession, such as the ratio of chaff/hay to use for the best silage mix, or whether to take that load of canola (which is oilseed ♥♥♥♥ to those in my neck of the woods) straight to the market for sale or keep it in storage until the demand goes up.\n\nI have essentially spent 100+ hours driving a tractor around fields at approximately 14mph, yet I have been utterly immersed and enthralled for the entire time - and only just now is my farm turning a profit enough so I can start to invest in some real meaty machinery (£400k for a new harvester anyone..?)\n\nWhich brings me to a very important aspect of this game; the modding community, which is thriving and huge. On top of the two standard maps (and an extra one with the expansion), there are a bunch of fantastic farms to download and play. Two to make a note of if you do end up buying this: Chellington and Coldborough - both of which evoke the beautifully quaint English countryside that was such a big part of my own rural youth. On top of this there are literally hundreds of tractors and associated implements to download. FS2015 often seems like one massive advert for New Holland, but machinery from brands that didn't make it to the offical game, like Massey Ferguson, John Deere and Ford, have been lovingly modelled and programmed by talented folks in the community, plus a load of useful little add-ons like the ability to tell one tractor to follow another - which doesn't seem like much but is actually worth it's weight in gold when you can have a baler tag behind you as you windrow a field of straw. Baling to be fair is one of the more laborious activities..! In summary, as much as any other game I can think of, the modding community make this game the great experience it is.\n\nOver the years I've heard people talk about this series of games many times and thought it would never be the game for me, after all there is no story as such, no guns, no real quests or missions and no endgame to speak of, other than earning enough money to get your hands on the more exciting heavy machinery. I only bought FS2015 on a whim because it was on sale and I am so glad I did.\n\nSo if you are on the fence about this and are looking for a complete change from the usual procession of samey shooters and rpg's, give it a try...\n\nGet this game..! And GET ORF MY LAND..!","January 1","true","720.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Well you're wrong this game has given me many weeks worth of fun, from the forestry to the simple growth of conola and then selling it to get more equipment. This game has to be rated 10/10 and it's worth a buy if you and your friends like a long and hard grind yet fun with the multiplayer aspect, note you can change the grow speed which makes the grind bit go away. I never looked for glitches so I myself never found any, Personally I would love it if they made the house useable and I know its pointless but it would be fun to have a cook what you grow system to! Then you could also have sleep fatigue, lifestyle needs and so on.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/feydk/recommended/313160/","feydk","feydk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/feydk/","37 products in account","I had no idea farming could be so much fun.\n\nTry to pitch this game to someone who doesn't know what it is about: Yeah, so you mount a sower on your tractor, drive to the field and sow it, then you drive back, unmount the sower, mount a fertilizer and drive back to the field to fertilize it. Then you speed up the game and wait 5 minutes until the crops has grown. Then you get in your harvester and start harvesting, but you also have to bring a tractor with a tipper, so you can unload the crops. When the entire field has been harvested, you must cultivate the field first, and then you start over.\n\nI just realized how boring that sounds. But that's the funny thing about this game; it sounds SO boring and bland, but in reality it is surprisingly fun. I don't know why. The youtubers I've watched playing the game also don't know why. It just is.\n\nBut.. once you've passed the 10-20 hour mark and start making real progress, have to manage multiple fields and do your best to come up with the most efficient flow, you start to get a little frustrated by the lack of automation in the game. Basically you have one option and one option only: when you have aligned your machine with the field, you can "hire worker" to get the stuff done. That's fine and works as intended, for the most part..\nBut the workers are pretty stupid. They get stuck very easily, and you won't notice until you happen to tab into the worker's machine, only to discover that the entire proces has been halted for 30 minutes because he ran into a tree while he was turning, and apparently he hasn't heard of this thing called "to reverse". HUGE con: The game does not give you any feedback on workers AT ALL, so you have to constantly tab through all your stuff to make sure everything is running smoothly. You also can't make workers do "passive" stuff, like wait for a harvester to get full and then drive up to it with a tipper, or tell them to unload crops from the silo and drive it off to a sell point. In other words, once you have a handful of fields, you'll be quite busy monitoring the progress, giving work orders, driving equipment from one field to another, helping stuck workers get unstuck and so on. And that's where the tediousness kicks in and the fun factor starts to decline.\n\nThe extreme lack of automation drives most people to use mods, or, well, one mod in particular, called Courseplay. Obviously this is a review of the vanilla game, so I will just say this: while Courseplay does offer a lot more automation features, it is very far from perfect. Courseplay will have you curse at the screen repeatedly, because the AI is basically still extremely poor. Even though you can make workers do more things, especially the "passive" stuff, you still have to sort out stuck workers all. the. time. So don't expect any wonders, only a little help. And more frustration.\n\nSaid frustration is the reason why I've stopped playing this game now. But it took 76 hours before I reached that point, and it was great fun until then. I consider that pretty good value for money.","February 9, 2015","true","75.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

With multiple game save options, each farm can be tailored-made with many creative possibilities. One farm I've built from the groundup has been designed a grain farm, another livestock and yet another the economy is designed around lumberjack with some grain and livestock on the side. Multiplayer servers have been solid, not to mention the fun of farming with others.  Utilizing the option of placeable objects can enhance your economy or dominate it. Mods are available, I love my monster truck and have spent time jumping off mountains and hills with it while waiting for my crops to grow. My friends and I have even had truck races when we was just too plum tired to farm after a hard nights work. The hours go by fast playing this one, so if you take the plunge, be prepared to be forced to logoff and go to bed when you really dont want to. Expansions are available and more to come.

In some ways it is a simple game. It is about micro management. Investing your money to make more money with your various farming incomes. 2 things really bothered me about the game. When you work a field you can hire a worker/bot to do the driving. The bot turns around outside the limits of the field which is not big deal unless other stuff is in the way. Also they have roads go by with bot cars so your farming bot gets stuck in the bot cars that go by. If there is an obstacle in the way the bot farmer will get stuck on that. If you want to do the driving that is fine but it takes time. I like having many things going at the same time but keeping them all going became a hassle.\nThe second bummer was the time speed up you can use. It is good to have but the day and night cycle stay the same so you spend half the game farming in the dark which was no fun for me.\nThey really needed to improve the path finding in this game so the bots don't just all pile up somewhere.\nIf you like a management game this one you might like. It is a bit of a time waster also if you like that.\nThe farming is European so there is no John Deere farm equipment. There are a lot of cool mods out there so you can have any thing you want but I was unable to make it work with the Steam version. The mods showed up in the menu but not in the game. Must want you to micro pay for those.","June 4","false","20.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Power is simulated, for example, your tractor have to be powerful enough to run an implement, and go up hills at the same time.\nPhysics are bit wonky at time, mostly on multiplayer with bad pings.\nYou also need some discipline to not put all the game settings on easy, fast growth, and make time go forward, otherwise you can just use passive to make the game run for 50 years and have enough money for everything.\n\nSo, if you aren't too much into simulators, or don't like farming that much, this game will probably be a 6/10 for you, and you should wait for a sale to check it out. If you are into simulator, and into farming, then this will easily be a 9/10 for you.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/infestedchris/recommended/313160/","infestedchris","infestedchris","http://steamcommunity.com/id/infestedchris/","95 products in account","I would only recomend this game if you have NOT played the 2013 version of Farming Simulator. If you have not played FS2013, then I highly recomend buything this game. Do you need to buy 2013 to play FS15... no. And do not buy 2013 thinking you are going to have 2 completely different games, because you're not.\n\nNow with the negative part of this review. This is just my pet peves since I played the crap out of Farming Simulator 2013. And this is my personal opinion on the FS15 things that disappointed me.\n\nSame stuff from 2013. Nothing really has chaged. You start with 2 new maps. The graphics are updated a bit, and they added some cool visuals like dirt collecting on tires and the tractors get dirty too.\n\nThis game is copy and pasted of all the farming equipment from 2013. Same plows, seeders, cultivators, tractors, and so on. I did not see any new tractors. They are the same ones from 2013. The new stuff I noticed is with the harvestors and the attachments, it seemed like they added a few more bigger and wider cutters for the harvestor. The only thing new is the logging equipment. (which I hear is a buggy at the this time).\n\nThe menu is still the same. Got to change the graphics and settings before jumpping in the game. You can't change graphics in the middle of playing. There is bad screen tearing, which of course from the 2013 version had the same thing. This is where you have to go into the files of the game and modify the .txt file and change the vsync. Why they don't add that option in the menu, beats me. Game runs choppy on mid system like mine, but I play on max, and I get smooth game play, but sometimes when day and night cycles run on fast speeds, the shadows can chug the game.\n\nFrom playing the 2013 version, I felt like I played this game before. There was no effort into making an actual economy. Each vendor does the same thing from 2013. Some vendors will buy your crops much higher then everyone else no matter what, until someone else is doing a spike buy that is only temparary. These spikes pop up and tell you who is buying what item for higher premium. This is how the game is suppose to be played. Fill your silos with as much of every crop. Wait for the high demand of a certain item, then SELL SELL!. But here is the dumbest part of the game. You can farm 1 single item in the game that sells for way more money then any crop.\n\nSilage. It never spikes, but it never drops in price like the other crops. You get one flat rate for silage, and the game sets you up with enough money to buy everything you need to farm it too. The game gives you almost 200,000$ worth of crops in the silo's ready to sell. (That's on easy mode) on harder difficulty they buy the crops are a much lower rate then on easy. But this does not make the game harder. This only makes the game slower.\n\nYou can farm how ever you want and still make money. But Silage is still way more profitable then crops. It almost defeats the purpose of the game, since it's called "Farming Simulator" not Silage simulator lol. But that is if you are trying to max profits the fastest way. If you want you can buy all the land spots and have so many tractors and hired workers all working in unison.\n\nI have not tried the logging equipment as of yet. I will update this review (if I can) and tell you what I think. But on the forums it pretty much is buggy and there are clipping issues with the logs and the log grabbers. I am sure it will get patched soon.\n\nFinal conclusion. If you have bought 2013, there is really no need to play Farming Sim 15. It's the same game, doing the same thing just on a different map. There are a few new goodies, and the graphics are updated. But you feel like you are not buying a new game.\n\nIf you have not played 2013. Dude, buy this game then. Seriously. Only 30$ and it's hours and hours of fun.\n\nIf the creators would make a construction sim that would be so awesome. The one thing this game does right is the bull dozer and forklift mechanics are spot on. The controls feel good, and it feels good to control the forklift and load pallets on a flat bed. The game does have clipping issues when stacking these things on the flat bed. But it does a fantastic job with the controls of these machines. I really wish they would add more forklifts, and more bulldozers and cranes and all kinds of things. I wish you would get deliveries for chicken feed, and actually have to unload the trucks with the forklift and store it in your barn. That is why I like doing the sheep farming. Love loading pallets of wool and taking a full flat bed stacked so high to the vendor and seeing so much cash go in my bank.\n\nAnyway thanks for reading this long review.","November 3, 2014","true","44.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You can find it on steam for $29.99 (at the time this story was written) Being that I have spent many hours playing FS13 I was looking forward to FS15.\n\nWell first thing first! If you have played FS13 it will look and feel very much the same.  In fact many of the textures and buildings look like they came from FS13. It feels like a bit of a rewrite with a lot of the physics problems fixed and a few new features added, also adding new physics problems.\n\nFirst the ability to cut down trees and sell the wood to name one, though the placing of a full grown fur tree makes for easy money. (Via what i hope is a glitch.) The tree claws and grinder can be a bit buggy(new physics problem).Trees can have ghost limbs or fail to fall, adding to the bugginess of it.  You can’t get your forks under logs and there is no way to strap the logs down for transport. That means sometimes they fall off the truck and are hard to pick up. Aww the bugs got to love them.\n\nBut with a drive-able pickup truck that does 54 mph. Helps to make up for the bugs. All the while making transporting tippers around the map a breeze. Npc cars though can be quite the nuisance. They will stop only mere inches from you and you cannot force them out your way (Pull hair out in frustration at this point while using the big sprayer).  Then to top it off you bounce off when you hit them at full speed I mean WTH is with that.\n\nOverall the game plays well and seems to run smooth, but can get laggy when lights are turned on.  I give over all game play 4 out of 5. They still need to fix some bugs with objects interacting together but this game should give you many hours of fun game play, by yourself or with friends in multi-player mode. And  please enjoy the gorgeous sky boxes.\n\nThe game has some built in mod support. They are easy to find and install. These are just a few that I have found enjoy!!","January 18, 2015","true","267.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Kinda of a copy & paste kind of game, not much substance.  One has to have a good imagination to keep the game going.\n\nI wanted a time killer that was rather hands free.. . I got what I wanted and then some.  Have come from an industrial, heavy equipment background, it took me less than a 2 days to master this game.  Its big downfall is the logging system... the graphics engine and the coding makes it impossible to grab and hold on to pieces of wood.  All clamps should be redesigned from scratch... once the log is in the clap, it should stay there until you release the clamp, right now they are never tight in the clamp.  I have worked with every type of clamp in the game and others not in the game.\n\nThe best way to deal with the log and bale clamp problem is to make them like a tractor attaches to an implent... but for log clamps, have the capability to attach up to 3 mid sized logs or two large ones... that's what you get normally.  For bales, make it so they "snap in palce" once stacked.  I used to stack bales and they don't spazz out when touching another bale.\n\n-Employees I think should be called robo-control... because I am not sure employees can be this stupid, the AI could be a lot better when using train type implements sowing fields.... only thing that comes to mind is to leave a dog tied up in the back yard.... yeah it can get real gnarly.\n\n-Lacks in structures, parking garages, cars, trucks, wood chippers, skidders, etc...\n-Amazing freedom!  I got a quad mod and put it in the back of my pick up truck!\n-Fun to play even without mods but I personally would not like this game without mods.\n-No damage on vehicles... kinda odd in a simulator not to have damage... but I enjoy it.\n-After spending a good portion of my life in the woods, last thing I want to do is fight with fisher price clamps.\n-Best hand free time killer money can buy right now.\n-Your game can keep going even when you alt-tab out - it's amazing at it!  Most games put you on start menu.\n-Perfect game for home businessmen who need to kill time.\n-It's not a game, it's a simulator.\n-Georgeous scenery.\n-Lacks accomplishments, I got most of them within a few days... could have gotten then a lot earlier too.\n-Power generation shouldn't be in this game... once you have 1 solar panel, game over, you don't need to do anthing else; makes the game too easy... or should only be allowed on easy mode.\n-Start Menu lacks big time!!  Need to add key config!!  Amazing key config options though.\n- Only mods I have are pick ups, a quad, a chipper and garages.\n-Game needs a float trailer, a real one, hauling a harvester sideways can be problematic... especially with the header on.\n-Fines and licenses could add to the fun.\n- I am a retired logger / trucker but also know how to build basic video games...\n-The BruksUn mod gets rid of trees in a sec, much better.\n\nIn reality, most agricultural farmers are not loggers and vice versa.  An farmer would call a logger and split the profits 80/20 or whatever, I cvome from and live in a logging, stud milling and paper making area, if I made a logging game like this, I couldn't show my face up there anymore.\n\nThis is the most fun I had playing a video game since I was a child playing Mario 1, 2, 3 for hours on end.... too where I get up and the first thing I want to do is play.  Yeah it's a boring game but it is what I was looking for and I got what I wanted.  Thank you for making such an amazing time killer!\n\nI still think logging makes this game terrible and should be its own game.  Some will deal with it because of passion but it was just grunt work for me.  I didn't buy this game to do grunt work.\n\nIf anything, I hope the developers re-invent their logging because it has potential.","September 24, 2015","true","839.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The biggest addition by far is the ability to pretty much become a lumber jack, cutting and growing trees is great fun, that pretty much sold the game to me and im not regretting my purchase.\n\n65 Metacritic score seems wholley unfair based on other games rated higher than this that are not as good I would say this is at least a 70 if not a 75 and once mods start getting released it can only get better.

Not only is the game looking really good but also is alot more stable than having a motherload of mods in FS13 which is not good for your pc and if you want other mods you have to make sure they are compatible with your current mods, where as having the totaly new game with all these new componants such as new tools, graphics and engine along with stuff from FS13 mods with better graphics and more stability is alot easier than having a lot of mods in 1 game so people should be grateful the GIANTS are what they are and should really look at the brilliant game GIANTS produced for us to use maybe mod and to have fun on so be happy that GIANTS made modding and such easier for you now just sit down zip yo trap and play the damn game you baby","November 5, 2014","true","447.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Hey, maybe you hate it at first, but as soon as you harvest your field 4-5 times and you buy a new one, you lose track of time, you look at the clock and relize you've played the game for 12 hours straight. then you play More...

You can harvest the crops yourself or employ people to work for you, it really is that good!\n\nExcellent farm shop for purchasing upgraded equipment from tractors, massive ploughs, seeders or combine harvesters.

Physics engine has been improved over FS 11 and FS 13.  I tested it out by crashing into everything at full speeds and into other vehicles being driven by the AI and I do not go flying up into the air, twirling about and getting stuck upside down anymore!\n\nFor anyone who says driving is like "being on ice", when you have a heavy load or trailer connected to your tractor, attach a weight to the front.  It will weight it down and stop the sliding.  The issue is that you have all that weight on the back so when you turn at speed the front end lifts a little bit and you lose traction.\n\nIve played FS11 and FS13 and this is so far better than either.  Only downside is that 1 map is new and 1 map is the American town from the FS13 Titanium Expansion.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RolanDecoy/recommended/313160/","RolanDecoy","RolanDecoy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RolanDecoy/","658 products in account","English:\n\nA true successor to the series, although I must admit I am somewhat disappointed. It is still as addictive, but it is also still more of a leasure game rather than a simulator. They did manage to combine both Farming Simulator and Woodcutter Simulator into 1 game...but I'm not so sure how I feel about that...\n\nThe player takes on the role of a farmer, with substantial equipment and monetary resources already available as you start. As you try to make money you will find that it is pretty hard to go bankrupt, and before you know it you have the fields and equipment that justify the huge farm complex that you start off with. Then you notice that your equipment is getting dirty, which is a great addition to the game, even though it is only a visual effect and does not affect the way equipment is handling.\n\nI have stated in previous versions how the game could really become a proper Farming Simulator, and I have read similar comments in the forums and from other players since, but apparently the developers haven't picked up on that; There is no crop disease, so whatever you put into the ground, it will come out healthy and ready to harvest, always. There is no soil quality, it is always in mint condition and the only purpose for manure and sprayers is to double / triple the yield. On top of that, you start off with a rediculous large farm complex that isnt justified by the 1 - 3 fields you also start off with.\nThe community has made some interesting mods that solve some of these problems, but I'd rather see them in the vanilla game.\n\nFor those that are familiar with the previous versions, here are some nuisances you'll encounter:\nFirst off, remember the PDA? That little device in the bottom-left corner of the screen that showed you a map, demand, livestock info and all that? Ya, you now have to press I which will open an screen and pause the game. This is not much of a problem per se, but do you also remember the phones, where you can get information about just about anything, like a manual? When you interact with that you get a similar screen, but the game continues on the background. Which means that if you don't have the equipment to do something while your crops are growing, you will either have to go on a long strawl or read every page at the payphone; No more checking demand, livestock, etc while you watch your favourite handyman take the wheel of your combine...\n\nAll in all a good game, but in my opinion it still does not live up to its name, and the developers seem to have other things on their minds than adding more interesting game mechanics.\n\nDispite all of this ranting I cannot help but give this a thumbs up, because it is true to its legacy, addictive as hell, and it looks great without ruining the game (hint to Egosoft).\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNederlands:\n\nEen waardige opvolger van de serie, hoewel ik to moet geven dat ik enigszins teleurgesteld ben. Het is nog steeds verslavend, maar ook meer een nutteloos tijdsverdrijf dan een echte simulator. Ze hebben het voor elkaar gekregen om Farming Simulator samen te voegen met hun Woodcutter Simulator...maar ik weet niet hoe ik daar over denk op dit moment...\n\nDe speler stapt in de rol van een boer, met veel werktuigen en financiele bronnen beschikbaar al vanaf dat je begint. Terwijl je probeert wat geld te verdienen kom je er snel achter dat het moeilijk is om failliet te gaan, en voor je het weet heb je de velden en de werktuigen die passen bij het formaat van je erf en de gebouwen die er al sinds het begin staan. Dan valt het je op dat je werktuigen vies worden, een goeie toevoeging aan het spel, hoewel dit slechts esthetisch is en geen enkele werking heeft op de werktuigen.\n\nIk heb in recencies van vorige versies al aangegeven hoe het spel een echte Farming Simulator kan worden, en ik heb sindsdien soortgelijke opmerkingen in forums en recensies van andere spelers gezien, maar blijkbaar hebben de ontwikkelaars daar niets mee gedaan; Je planten kunnen niet ziek worden, dus wat je ook in de grond stopt, het komt er altijd kerngezond uit. Er is geen grondkwaliteit, het is altijd in perfecte staat en het enige doel van de mest en sproeiers is het verdubbelen / verdrievoudigen van je oogst. Daar komt nog bij dat je met een belachelijk grote boerderij begint die niet overeen komt met de 1-3 velden waarme je begint.\nEr zijn een aantal interessante mods gemaakt door de spelers die veel van deze problemen oplossen, maar ik zou het spel liever aangepast zien worden zodat het niet nodig zou zijn.\n\nVoor hen die bekend zijn met de vorige versies, hier zijn wat irritaties die je tegen zult komen:\nTen eerste, ken je de PDA nog? Dat kleine apparaatje links ondering je scherm waarop je de kaart, prijzen, je veestapel enzo kon vinden? Ja, die is dus weg. Nu moet je op I drukken om een venster te zien waar datzelfde beschikbaar is, alleen wordt het spel gepauzeerd. Dit is niet per se een probleem, maar herinner je je de telefoons nog waar je informatie over alles kon vinden als een soort handleiding? Als je daar nu gebruik van maakt krijg je een soortgelijk scherm, maar het spel blijft op de achtergrond doorgaan. Dit betekent dat als je geen werktuigen hebt om jezelf mee te vermaken terwijl je velden aan het bloeien zijn je je of dood verveelt terwijl je wacht, een lange wandeling moet gaan maken of elke pagina in de telefoon moet gaan lezen; Niet meer kijken wat de huidige prijzen zijn of het voedsel niveau van je veestapel controleren terwijl je je favoriete knecht achter het stuur van je combine laat.\n\nAl met al een goed spel, maar naar mijn mening is het nog steeds de naam niet waardig, en de ontwikkelaars hebben iets anders aan hun hoofd dat interessante spel mechaniek.\n\nOndanks al dit geklaag kan ik het niet helpen dit product aan te raden, omdat het in de lijn van de serie valt, verslavend als wat is en er grafisch geweldig uitziet zonder dat dat ten koste gaat van het spel (hint naar Egosoft).","November 28, 2014","true","173.9"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

There are some ajustments they could make towards the gameplay, such as when and if you where to crash into something.. It would not flip your car fifity million times, especially crashing into a tree at 5km/s.\n\nAlso, I love the woodcutting scenerio.. It's pretty realistic how you can grab your crane and pick up logs and ♥♥♥♥, but holy ♥♥♥♥, could you make it so the logs acctually go into the woodchiper when I shove it in there, and like.. not make gravity so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and chuck it back out?\n\nOther than that, it's pretty well made, good graphics.. everything you need to make your own little farm and ♥♥♥♥. It also has some nice features, like your vehicle and ♥♥♥♥ get dirty, pretty realistic... and when you're using your harvester to chop all the ♥♥♥♥, it brings it into the middle, like it's being dragged into the machine for proccessing.. Very good details, add more, because they make the game good.\n\nIt's a good game, and that's why I'm commendating it for it's hard work in some parts. I'd give the game about a 8/10.. It's fairly good, not perfect.. but.. good.","October 30, 2014","true","14.3"," 14 of 28 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","14","28","0","0"

Keeping in mind that this isn't a triple A title, and they only ask 30$ as release price, knowing that i find that Gaints has done a great job in creating this game, it may not run on the same level of graphic like other games like Destiny or Diablo 3, but i think in over haul it looks fine as it is, simple but fun. So in the end it's all up to your preference if you gon like this game or not, it's not a story based game casual.\n\nWhat's new in fs15? The biggest thing will be the foresting, you now have a new way to make money by chopping wood. The next thing you gone notice is the upgrade in graphics, everything looks more polished then in FS13. Then there is more realisme added to the game, where weights are more important and to pull off a large trailer you may need a stronger tractor, then there is a power issue where a cheap tractor won't operate two pieces of equipment at the same time, so when buying a new tractor at the shop you really need to ask your self what you gone use it for. And yes!!! you now have the option to turn on/off the withering of crops, and you get rear view mirrors, nicely done Gaints thank you for listening to your customers.\n\nNow there are some low points to this game, not that they are game breaking but who knows maybe Giants read this review and acts on it and if not then at least a review must give it all right?\n\n*There is a new PDA system and its full screen, the game pauses and if you are used of playing FS13 you know how handy it was to drive and check the pda at the same time for prices or demands, well you can't anymore.\n*Missions, the got a new system now where you have to walk to a board and check if there are any missions you may want to do, sadly enough this can be annoying if your waiting for that one mowing mission or for a demand to popup, cause you have to leg it each time to the nearest mission bord.\n*Screen tearing, seams Giants forgot to add Vsync, now if your good with pc's then you can change that in your graphic card settings but not everyone is a computer wizard and a option in game can really make a difference.\n\nI was hoping for some Ski Simulator in FS15 but maybe Giants is holding that for there next installment who know, anyway the game feels addictive like all previous farming games and by the time i get bored with the vanilla game i am sure i can look forward to many mods to breath new life in to the game.","October 31, 2014","true","170.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Then I tried it out of curiousity, and promptly lost a couple of days in it.\n\nYou need to play this game as you would minecraft. It's kind of a zen thing, you do repetitive tasks, but it's really compelling in a strange way, and it sucks up so much time and you know you should go to bed but you just want to go back and do _one_more_thing.\n\nThe graphics are decent for a game of this time. The mud effects on vehicles are nice, and the lighting is good. Skyboxes are very pretty. Vehicles are amazingly detailed, every time I buy a new one I spend a good couple of minutes just looking at all the work they put into the model. The environment textures are relatively low-res, which is a shame.\n\nThe driving physics are... adequate. They're not great, but you don't really notice when you're playing. It's not like OMSI or ETS2, where you are really into the driving aspect of the game. That isn't really the point here. I'd like to see some improvements, though.\n\nThe forestry physics are... surprisingly good. They're still quite buggy, but compared to other simulator titles, they're pretty damn good. It's perfectly functional and enjoyable, but not exceptional.\n\nSound design is good, the vehicle sounds are surprisingly nuanced, and you can hear the engine and transmission system working independently of each other. The environment sounds are just lovely, with animals, wind noises, planes passing overhead... It's quite immersive. For me, sound design like this is lacking in a lot of games. It's no OMSI, but it's better than ETS2, and this is a core part of the game's immersion in my opinion.\n\nOverall I definitely recommend trying it, especially if you enjoy resource gathering games where you can just zone out and relax, like Minecraft or Terraria.","December 28, 2014","true","331.8"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Then I tried it out of curiousity, and promptly lost a couple of days in it.\n\nYou need to play this game as you would minecraft. It's kind of a zen thing, you do repetitive tasks, but it's really compelling in a strange way, and it sucks up so much time and you know you should go to bed but you just want to go back and do _one_more_thing.\n\nThe graphics are decent for a game of this time. The mud effects on vehicles are nice, and the lighting is good. Skyboxes are very pretty. Vehicles are amazingly detailed, every time I buy a new one I spend a good couple of minutes just looking at all the work they put into the model. The environment textures are relatively low-res, which is a shame.\n\nThe driving physics are... adequate. They're not great, but you don't really notice when you're playing. It's not like OMSI or ETS2, where you are really into the driving aspect of the game. That isn't really the point here. I'd like to see some improvements, though.\n\nThe forestry physics are... surprisingly good. They're still quite buggy, but compared to other simulator titles, they're pretty damn good. It's perfectly functional and enjoyable, but not exceptional.\n\nSound design is good, the vehicle sounds are surprisingly nuanced, and you can hear the engine and transmission system working independently of each other. The environment sounds are just lovely, with animals, wind noises, planes passing overhead... It's quite immersive. For me, sound design like this is lacking in a lot of games. It's no OMSI, but it's better than ETS2, and this is a core part of the game's immersion in my opinion.\n\nOverall I definitely recommend trying it, especially if you enjoy resource gathering games where you can just zone out and relax, like Minecraft or Terraria.","December 28, 2014","true","331.8"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Definately worth it if you want to be drunk near farm machinary and not have to worry about losing an arm.\n\nFS15 is a decent refresh of FS13, the new shaders are definately a visual improvement on the equipment. Forestry is a nice addition. That said, it is still full of hilarious FarmSimulator-esque physics issues and minor annoyances from lack of attention-to-detail (like the Log trailer doesn't unload correctly at the designed depot, so why bother with it?). While the tractors/equipment look great, the stock buildings and terrain/enviroment lighting continue to look as drab as they did in FS13. Custom mod/map support still is present (as it was in FS13), however it's also obvious it's setup for future DLCs (for pay?).\n\n","December 6, 2014","true","65.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Now this comes in many new ways. One the HUD of everything has changed, from the start menu to the ingame HUD, though you still need a mod to hide it. The in game sounds seem more smooth, not on a loop as much which is nice. The graphics is the biggest improvement. Everything looks shaper and better in everyway. The dirt overhaul seemed to be my favorite part. How when you drive through fields you get dirt on your tractor, thus making you have to powerwash it off, very cool. Also granted some equipment was missing, (One i noticed was the sprayer machine that drove itself, as now you only get sprayer attachments) but more default equipment was added (without requiring payed expansions) such as tractor trailers and flatbeds, a truck to drive around it, more tractotrs and different types of equipment (such as more diverse range of plow lengths, or now the potato pull behind harvestor does a greater witdth of harvest) New companies were added, and the another big add on was logging. Though, the logging does seem really buggy still, I haven't successfully been able to cut down trees into trunks without having them spaz out, but its new. Once it gets perfected, it will be a great, unexecpted fun to Farming SIm. Also i liked the use of first person items ! (this game did alot of new updates that putting them all together perfect the game) But between the powerwasher and chainsaw, you get a more of a first person feel to the game. All in all, I would absolutley recommend this game. To people that have played it before, and enjoyed it, you will love this one, and to new comers to the farming world, if you have any interest, this game is for you.\n\n\nPS\n\nThere is also a "driving on dirt" system in the game now, making you drift as if you were on dirt, using the pickup going 50mph across a field sideways is hands down amazing. Everytime i walk past my truck in the game (ALSO you can change the colors of some of the equipment, the truck being one) i take it drifting across the fields.","November 6, 2014","true","128.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Definately worth it if you want to be drunk near farm machinary and not have to worry about losing an arm.\n\nFS15 is a decent refresh of FS13, the new shaders are definately a visual improvement on the equipment. Forestry is a nice addition. That said, it is still full of hilarious FarmSimulator-esque physics issues and minor annoyances from lack of attention-to-detail (like the Log trailer doesn't unload correctly at the designed depot, so why bother with it?). While the tractors/equipment look great, the stock buildings and terrain/enviroment lighting continue to look as drab as they did in FS13. Custom mod/map support still is present (as it was in FS13), however it's also obvious it's setup for future DLCs (for pay?).\n\n","December 6, 2014","true","65.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I thought I'll get bored quickly but there is always something to do . Cultivate sow harvest and then in between you can do forestry , cut grass for silage . And the reasons behind all the work is so you can get new machines that can let you do other things.\n\nYou start with basic equipment for wheat /barley/canola . If you want to grow corn, beets and potatoes you need either a header (corn) or a whole set  specialized equipment.\n\nYou don't have to do everything manually you can hire workers to do most of the field work. Either that or play multiplayer and get your friends/strangers  to do the work.\n\nOther than that there are a lot of mods that add mostly farming equipment  for looks and functionality. There is also a mod called “course play” which let your "hired work" do more complex things than vanila version.\n\nCrane control in game can be challenging and some people really hate the wood chipper because of it. I just use an Xbox 360 controller for simultaneous 5 axis control and deal with it. I don't like “game breaking mods” . If it seems too good to be true it is.\n\nIf you value your time stay away from this game.","May 16","true","337.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/knexfreak32/recommended/313160/","knexfreak32","knexfreak32","http://steamcommunity.com/id/knexfreak32/","52 products in account","Alright... So, Farming simulator 2015 is a farming game (No surprise there) Where you can: Harvest crops, Raise cows and other farming stuff. Its fairly fun... At least, when it works.\n\nThe DLC is abundant and extremely overpriced. You may get a couple of vehicles or a couple of attachments. And to be honest the amount you get from each pack is surprisingly low... I would happily pay 75% of retail price for it but for its full price I think its just a money grab.\n\nThe multiplayer is utterly terrible. If you have a poor connection it is nearly impossible to steer properly. The client often freezes while moving and will reset your velocity which is very frustrating. And as previously stated makes steering and maneuvering difficult. Loading is extremely annoying. When connecting its really  luck based. Sometimes it may connect but usually it doesn't. And when you actually manage to connect it takes forever to load and once you finish loading you end up with this weird player sync thing that takes ages and the entire server freezes the entire time during this process.\n\nPhysics in this game are nearly non existent. When getting out of vehicles you can glitch through walls. Grabbing logs and bales is difficult. Getting bales on and off bale forks can be glichy and difficult. Tools often glitch through the ground when attaching to them and it can be difficult to get them out of the ground. Wheel friction is a little funny and you rarely have proper traction.\n\nAs for content I feel this game is lacking without overpriced dlc. There are only two maps and only a couple of vehicle brands. And I feel like certain categories such as road tractors and lowboys are extremely lacking. The maps seem small and the layouts are confusing. It is also difficult to get up the hills with large loads because of the wheel friction. The ai on the roads is just frustrating and isn't programmed well. I have had cars turn into me at an intersection many times.\n\nThe modding community is riddled with unfinished, broken, and stolen mods. However there are also many well made and good mods. Another problem that I have found is that mods in multiplayer are extremely annoying. You have to find every mod that is on the server before you can join which can be a tedious and slow process. Other than that mods can add allot of what the dlc does to the game and add alot more variety.\n\nSo, In conclusion I bought this game during the christmas sales and I have enjoyed it to an extent. Do I think it is worth the money? No, I personally don't believe that at full retail price this game is worth the cost given all of its problems. Would I buy it on sale? Possibly but now that I have seen its problems I am not so sure.\n\nAs for fs 2017? I feel that if I don't see alot of improvement in the netcode and physics I don't plan on purchasing it.\n\nTL: DR Buy something else\n\nAlso for those complaining about me having poor specs and how that affects my game... My computer is running a q8400 @2.66 ghz, Gtx 750ti (Manualy overclocked) and 8 gigs of ddr3 ram. Yes, It isn't the best computer but it runs fs at max settings with no lag.","April 18","false","40.6"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","46","6","13","4","6"

I wont go into the improved graphics and engine as this has been covered by many. There are some niggly little things that could and/or may be addressed in patches (such as only one cruise control speed as opposed to 4 in 2013) and logging machines being a little bit awkward to use  - the chipper being nigh impossible.\n\nHowever, before reading any negative comments please note that most people who are saying its too easy are playing on 'easy' difficulty or making changes in the XML files to cheat.

If there were a star rating, I'd give it a pretty neutral rating, but since there's no inbetween option, it gets a no. Here's why:\n\nCons for the game\n\n- Very little help/ instructions. Almost none at all. This is the single biggest reason for the low rating. After all of the effort put into making this game, you couldn't add an extra couple lines of text? One example, balers. There are 2 types of bales in the game, each made from it's own baler. There is no description as to which kind of bale each machine makes, you just have to know. There are also machines and trailers that interact with these 2 different types of bales. Do these other machines specify which type of bale they work on? Nope! Of course not! Because adding a single line of text, even just a 2 word "xxxx Bale" discription would be too much work. Another example is a harvester, the Mex 5. I bought it when I had a little extra money and tried to figure out what it's for since, again, there was no description saying how to use it. I tried cutting different things and no results. Finally I had to look it up online to get an answer.\n\n-Very "hands on", you can hire workers for some tasks but not many. Alot of the jobs, including what I would consider to be some of the most boring, you cannot hire a worker for. Why? Again, given the scope of the game, would it really be that much harder to implement a feature that you already made on some other duties? Example, you can hire workers for some harvesters but not others. Beet farming looks like it would be the most profitable use of a field, but it takes 10x the work since you cannot hire workers to harvest them until you buy one of the single most expensive machines in the game. Instead you have to sit in the tractor yourself, with one of the narrowest harvester heads in the game. It took half an hour to harvest one of the smallest fields, compared to the under 10 minutes of letting a paid worker do it for me, and I only make about 2x the money. Of course even then beets take up much more room, 3x, so that means 3x the trips from the field to the market where you are selling them.\n\nI suppose those are the only cons that come to mind for me. However, they are nearly game breaking in my opinion. You can *almost* play this as a management game, which I would prefer, but too much of the game requires you to actively control the machinery. Also spending hours, and game money, trying to figure out what the machinery does because they could not be bothered to add a description, is just rediculous.\n\nPros:\n\n... well I wouldn't say there are any, just some middleground "okay" things. Decent or better graphics, though graphics are pretty low on my scale of what makes a game "good". Some jobs can be given to workers, allowing you to do other things, or even nothing if you want, while they work. Yep, that's about it in the plus columb for me.","April 27","false","71.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

While I have to say I'm somewhat impressed with the graphics, parts of the game are repetitive, such as taking crops to sell, or tilling a field. You can hire farm workers to do these jobs if you have enough money or your equipment is efficient enough.\n\nAll in all, I'd say it's fairly entertaining, especially for someone like me who knows little about farming or the equipment involved. I was also surprised ot find a large part of the game is more like forrestry simulator, though I guess technically you can farm trees.\n\nAlso, keep in mind, this is "Farming Simulator" not "Farm Simulator."  I was personally disappointed, after my first long day behind the manure spreader, (yes really in the game), I wasn't able to go home and knock my wife's remaining teeth out or commit incest. You can't even go inside your farm house.\n\nIf you're looking for a simulation of farm life, you'll have to look elsewhere, this only covers the act of farming.","April 13","true","557.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

If you have no interest in farming or machines you would not like this game.  This is not a bad game it has had small improvements over the previous one. IMO it should not stand alone as a new game. It does not have new maps. They put some new machines in and features. I can understand that people spend time developing games and deserve compensation. I just do not think that this game deserves to be labeled as a new game. Most of the features in it should have come out with free patches.

Forestry being added to this game is perfect because if you hire a worker and then encounter a tree that prevents them from doing the job you just cut it down, remove the stump, and take the logs away or turn them into woodchips and then the worker can continue with no problem.

If you grew up around farms this game will bring back some good memories. It is also great to enjoy together with your friends or on your own when you are running a successful business in singleplayer. I especially enjoy the high quality of the 3D models within the game.\n\nI would highly suggest to look up the many free (!) mods for this game created by the community (vehicles, maps, placeables, game improvements, ...) - They really expand the gaming experience and give you a lot of new equipment to try out!\n\nSome minor cons I have found:\n\n- The ambient AI traffic is a little bit awkward in its behavior.\n- For high-end computers the graphic settings are too basic and restricted. (Tip: You can greatly extend draw, view and shadow distance by manually editing settings in the mapXX.i3d files found in the game folder using the Notepad.

If you have no interest in farming or machines you would not like this game.  This is not a bad game it has had small improvements over the previous one. IMO it should not stand alone as a new game. It does not have new maps. They put some new machines in and features. I can understand that people spend time developing games and deserve compensation. I just do not think that this game deserves to be labeled as a new game. Most of the features in it should have come out with free patches. I will thumbs up this game because it is different and not as intense as other games a relaxing game to play inbetween more intense games.","November 22, 2014","true","4.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The graphics are amazing and the fact you can use turn signals, leave tire marks in the ground, and the fact that your equipment gets dirty overtime is absolutely amazing, it makes the game more realistic. Forestry being added to this game is perfect because if you hire a worker and then encounter a tree that prevents them from doing the job you just cut it down, remove the stump, and take the logs away or turn them into woodchips and then the worker can continue with no problem. I highly recommend this game.","November 21, 2014","true","075.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you grew up around farms this game will bring back some good memories. It is also great to enjoy together with your friends or on your own when you are running a successful business in singleplayer.

(Tip: You can greatly extend draw, view and shadow distance by manually editing settings in the mapXX.i3d files found in the game folder using the Notepad.

It's just not worth the amount of time I spent trying to figure it out. The rest of it is fun enough, but I can tell already that it will become a massive grind for very little point.\n\nOverall, I can't recommend it, to be honest. If, however, you're hard core into simulators then I'd at least suggest you wait for a really good sale.\n\nUPDATE: After playing some more, and finding a couple of forestry mods I am changing this to a recommend.

It's very low stress and relaxing. Put on some tunes, plow your fields, milk your cows or whatever you want to do to earn money. Then buy better equipment or more plots of land. Rinse and repeat. Logging will earn you the most money by far of anything you can do, however it's pretty buggy, at least it is on my end. I have to save and save often. I even have a tree that I had to leave on the ground  (part of it is actually hovering in mid air) because I was unable to move it once I sawed it in segments. So be careful with that. I have not tried The Scorpion yet, but the controls on the basic logging equipment took me the better part of two hours to hang of. I've pretty much just giving up on logging despite the money, and only use it as a supplemental income to pay for my labor costs and let my fields and livestock be my main source of income.

This game is very fun to play and it also is very addictive. i have now got a massive passion for farming and i have also got the gold expansion and jcb dlc plus many more mods from the website. The mods are free and you just click install and they do it. NO UNZIPPING NEEDED! This game has many in game features and does not require you to buy any add ons to do certan things. Definately worth buying. If you want to seemore of my Farming Sim reviews, go check the other DLC packs.","December 28, 2015","true","256.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game is IDENTICAL to the day it was released and lacks some key features one would expect of a 'Farming Business' game.  There have been a few DLCs released for purchase, but they ONLY contain more of the same equipment or mabe in the future a new map.  No new functionality!\n\nThere is a large modding community, but byand large from what I can see they never moved on to FS15, choosing to stay with previous FS...which I can understand as the games are pretty well identical except for logging.  As such the modding community for FS15 is pretty much just specialized equipment and a few handy mods for field management.  But no large scale overhauls to introduce anything you would associate with a 'Farming Simulator' such as need for any Herbicide, crop rotation, soil quality, or even an effect of weather on harvesting or planting.\n\nSeriously.  Just skip this one.","March 3","false","72.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

But it's engine is terrible. Worst engine ever for a simulator.\n\nIt's impossible to say this game is a SIM, they should remove this part of their game's name. The tractors can't be damaged, the physics are terrible. If you turn over one of your vehicles they just straight up for themselves.\n\nPlease devs, strip simulator out of this game's name and put something like Farming Managing 2015.
