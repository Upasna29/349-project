It blends elements of FTL and The Binding of Isaac in a unique and enjoyable way. I’m not typically someone who enjoys the rogue-like or super hardcore games - which is why I was surprised at how much I’ve enjoyed this game.\n\nWhen I started off, I quickly died over and over (you only have one life per run). It took me a good 5-10 attempts to really begin making good progress in the game. Each enemy has a unique combat style that requires time to learn and understand. Traversing the “overworld” is a fairly complex task (even though it seems quite trivial at first). Yes - you have to make it to the boss before the “shadow” catches up to you - but there are a lot of hidden elements that aren’t as random as one might think (which I’ll refrain from spoiling in this review).\n\nMy next 10 or so playthroughs took me much farther - and I was able to consistently beat the “Phoenix” - although the gods that follow proved to be quite challenging. Despite the large number of playthroughs, I never felt like it was boring or repetitive due to the large number of races, skills, and weapons.\n\nBy now, I am able to consistently beat the game on normal - although hard mode remains quite the challenge. I enjoy the daily quest (where everyone gets the same race, skills, weapon, and world) and you compete to see who can beat it the fastest. It’s fun to see how I stack up compared to my friends.\n\nI’ve greatly enjoyed Altitude (another game created by these developers) - where they provided support and additions to the game for free for years. I’m sure Flamebreak will be no different and I’m excited to see what features will be added in the upcoming months.\n\nFor $10, I’d highly recommend this game.","October 16, 2015","true","90.1"," 48 of 54 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","48","54","0","0"

You can choose your path through the game much like FTL. You get random spawns including races and skills. You unlock more races and skills as your characater levels up and there's a ton of flavor and variety in how you can choose to play each run. Some-what like Rogue Legacy without the permanent progression of leveling up your castle or upgrading classes.\n\nThe combat is top-down and feels very much like Binding of Isaac with its control pattern and movement style. You can choose what items to buy, what skills to upgrade, what armor sets to complete, what gods to gain favor with to get blessings all allowing every playthrough to feel unique in some way.\n\nA playthrough takes 20-40 minutes. The game also offers a hard-mode and a daily challenge which is the same configuration for all players to race each other against.","November 21, 2015","true","170.4"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","18","21","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Uncle-Rob/recommended/399640/","Uncle-Rob","[Wombo-Combo] Stuntman Mike","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Uncle-Rob/","201 products in account","UPDATE:\n\nWithin DAYS of my review you now have a "retry" button after death to restart with the SAME guy. You also still have the reroll option that will reroll like normal. The blizzard animation was also changed is SOOO Much better!!\n\nTHANK YOU DEVS!!!! I changed my recommendation from a no to a yes. These small changes literally make the game SO much better!!! I can now grind through with a guy and retry as many times as I want which gives ample time to learn the ability combos first run through. And then start learning the patterns the next few times.  I cannot express how critical this was for my enjoyment of this game.\nI still think the game could benefit from a new "easiest/noob/learning difficulty" that let you choose your abilities/ skills. This really would make the game very beatable. But that would be the point. You would then have normal, hard, and daily to go through which is a TON and I mean a TON of replay ability. If you do end up making a noob mode I might also recommend that you disable the favor / spirit rewards when playing this new suggested difficulty.\n\nI bought this game because I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE altitude and wanted to support the devs. It combines a lot of elements of other games. The best way I can describe it would be a blend of final fantasy and the old raiden space ship game.  A ton of varied and random enemies that shoot and attack many different ways. It keeps it fresh and a LOT of fun.\n\nPros:\n\nThe game is challenging\nHas a lot of replay ability\nThe graphics and game play are quite smooth and interesting\nIt's well put together and thought out. Everything from the items, enemies, and the quality is very good.\n\nCons.\nI've removed them since the update. My biggest complaints with the game have been totally fixed and I can't tell you how happy this makes me. The game is at least 80% more enjoyable while still maintaining the challenge of the game.  It's no longer as brutal.\nPossible improvements:\nCreate a super noob difficulty where I can even pick the OP combos if I want. Let me learn how enemies move etc. Heavily handicap me so I can get a firm handle on the game before you throw me to the wolves. These mini bosses are quite tough. I mean I've died on the first map over 15 times. Got past that maybe 3 times. Never even to level 3. And there are like 15 or something levels! This is actually a good thing. I like the fact that it's so tough!! It's challenging but not impossible.\n\nThere are a lot of people who like to play games competitively. I only play for casual but I can see these things really helping those who like to compete.\n\n1. time trials? Leader boards\n2. There has to be abilities that are more favorable to others. Assign each ability a value and let the user choose which abilities he wants. The more desirable abilities "cost" more and as such reduce the person's arbitrary points on the leaderboard.\nSo if a guy chose all the best skills he would get less bonus points than someone who chose all of the least desirable skills.\nMaybe have a board that spawns a guy every X second of a certian type. You get X amount of points per second you're alive?\n\nOther ideas:\nMore points for the following:\nHow much life did you lose over the course of the run?\nHow long did it take you?\nWhat bonus health % health did you give the enemies?\nWhat bonus damage % health did you give the enemies?\nhow many flawless?\nI'm sure there are abilities that would make it super hard. Then you could also give bonus points for reduced health, higher hit point enemies. You could make a whole bunch of things that you could make it harder or easier for the top of the top players to gain points.\nYou could reset the leader boards each time you tweak something. Or add different runs that are preset boards.\nSuggestions continued:\nI wish you would explain what fight power is or mastery. There are many stats you can get from items but it's not quite clear what they do or how they work. Same way with the gods favor.  They explain you can earn favor by destroying the other god's temples etc, but not really what they do for you. Of course it's a buff. There just isn't enough training.\n\nThey have a training thing before you start the game where two guys spawn. They don't attack or anything. They are there to get used to how your guys works. I think this could be expanded on. Be able to select how many guys to spawn. What type of guys. Do they move? Do they attack? Do you want blizzards to spawn? So you want laser beams? This could be good training level. Are you immune to damage?","December 23, 2015","true","19.8"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","17","20","0","0"

(Most areas, involve an arena battle, but sometime you will see an area on the overworld-map that has a town, or bazaar or other non-dangerous location to spend the coins you have accumulated.) Each area of the overworld has a boss on the Northern edge of the map. There is an inherent trade-off between exploring more to find/buy better items with which to face the boss, versus avoiding needless battles which may require you to consume precious health potions. (Health potions are a limited resource, use them with care.) Finally, there is a shadow that slowly advances Northward across the overworld-map, which puts some mild pressure on you to work your way Northward, and prevents you from fully exploring each area of the overworld.\n\nThe place where this game shines is in the variety of fights you encounter on your journey. The game features a large number of enemies, each with its own unique attack patterns. Each fight consists of a small number of different types of enemies -- Enemy marksman are typically weak, but when they are protected by foes who lay mines, the fights gets a bit more exciting [at least for a melee character <grin>]. Additionally, many fights have environmental hazards -- like damaging hail-storms that move randomly around the map, or bullets being fired randomly from off-screen.\n\nTo tackle these challenges, your character has access to a weapon and three different skills. Your race determines your starting stats and one of your skills. (For instance, Dwarves are slow, but have lots of hit points and deal bonus damage with weapon attacks -- and Dwarves can right-click to stun enemies around then. Alternatively, Faires are very fast and their skills cooldown more quickly, but they have few hit points and do less damage per attack -- and Faires can right-click to teleport instantly in battle.)  The starting weapons are well-designed and each plays very differently -- for instance, swords swing in an arc for strong AOE melee damage, crossbows cripple enemies they hit, slowing their movement. Finally, the game provides a wide variety of active skills, including utility and movement skills -- for those who want to kill foes with weapons -- to high damage spells.\n\nThe variety of weapons, races, and skills provides the game with a ton of replayability. At the start of each run, the game randomly generates three possible heroes for you to choose from. This allows you to pick the style of hero you enjoy, but the exact combination of skills will be different each run. Experimenting to get the most out of your combination of skills is a ton of fun. For example, there is a backstab skill that teleports you behind a foe and deals a percentage of your weapon damage. If you have this skill on a burly dwarf with a sword and an AOE stun, then you can backstab into the middle of a group of enemies and stun them all. Alternatively, if you are playing human with a crossbow, you can get more use out of the backstab skill by targeting an isolated foe on the other side of the battle in order to escape a rush of melee attackers.","October 25, 2015","true","12.3"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/saere/recommended/399640/","saere","Saere","http://steamcommunity.com/id/saere/","465 products in account","Flamebreak is a roguelite action-RpG blending twin-stick and MOBA combat gameplay, whilst accompanied by a terrific story, brilliantly told in lyrical prose and voiced quite nicely. I felt as though I'd been playing for only half an hour when, in actuality, over 3 hours had disappeared! In fact, it was only because my index finger was seizing up - and not the fact that it was nearing 3:30 in the morning - that made me stop playing.\n\nThe in-battle gameplay is fairly reminiscent of TBoI, but it's far more enjoyable: rather than punishing you for even thinking you could play it, Flamebreak offers a real and rewarding chance at developing your skills and getting to know a bit about the game before dying a bajillion times. It's action-packed and fast-paced, and paying attention to how your enemies deploy attacks is required to overcome and go far. However, this game is not bullet-hell-silly like others similar and I really think that gamers who are usually hesitant to try such games will actually love Flamebreak.\n\nLevels are randomly generated with approximately 25 possible waypoints that keep you moving forward to the boss' lair where success propels you on to the next level. Each waypoint can be a shop of sorts for upgrades, equipment and skills, or a battle. While on the waypoint screen, there are skill abilities you can use that give you a buyer's edge or just to stay ahead of the creeping Shadow that will overtake you if you dally around too long (like FTL's Galactic Federation fleet). In-battle is total arcade gameplay where you may encounter skirmishes, skirmishes with environmental or supernatural hazards bombarding all, gold nabbing and guarding challenges, shrines and temples, even mini-bosses. With numerous races, weapons, skills, battles and bosses randomised every level, not to mention unlockables you get as you become better and better, Flamebreak offers huge replayability and countless hours of white-knuckle fun.\n\nI cannot comment on the use of keyboard+mouse, but I couldn't imagine playing this game with anything other than a controller. With slick, responsive gameplay; clean, bright graphics and pleasing artwork; great story narrated by an attention-grabbing voice; good music and sharp sound effects, I cannot recommend Flamebreak enough, and I feel the regular price is reasonable.\n\n11/ 10\n^ that extra point's gonna be force-fed to Britius when I finally best that taffer...","January 15","true","4.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

It really captures that plug-and-play procedural action I've been looking for after hundreds of hours of The Binding of Isaac. It offers an immaculate blend of challenge and strategic options that keeps me engaged at the edge of my seat for the whole ~22-40 minute play session. I'm just starting to have hard-mode win-streaks. And even during a -29 lose streak I was having fun discovering character combinations and honing my exploration and gold-spending techniques.\n\nMy other favorite thing is the controls. I play mostly with a gamepad and the game offers seamless transition between playing with a controller and playing with keyboard and mouse. Simply move the mouse or joystick and the game snaps to the new control layout. Both options offer very different approaches and are both satisfying to play.\n\n**There are a few issues with balance and (**seemingly) underpowered combos. I couldn't for the life of me get a Human-Sword-Arcane Blast- Meteor character to victory on normal.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Borba/recommended/399640/","Borba","Borba","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Borba/","1717 products in account","Borba Recommends\nTL:DR at the end, scored 10 / 10 as of 19th April 2016\nBorba likes:Genre - A 2D top-down roguelite action rpg, similar to the likes of Binding of Isaac and bundled with different play modes, including daily challenges with online leaderboards. Characters may be customized through race, weapon, skills and items, adding a nice layer of depth to the game, while procedurally generated levels extend longevity.\n\nReplayability - Thanks to the procedurally generated levels that are based on a seed, so players players may share the seed to play the same maps and encounters, and the daily challenges that provide one attempt to score high in the online leaderboards, not to mention unlockable content and achievements, the game provides many hours of challenging fun. There are also custom and hard modes for those wishing to tailor their experience, or face a real challenge.\n\nNarrative - The storyline is presented through artistic painted scrolls, narrated by a lovely voice and with fitting background music. More excerpts are unlocked as players progress and defeat major Bosses.\n\nGameplay - As a top-down action rpg, the control scheme is twin-stick based and it includes full controller support, being fluid and responsive on both gamepads and keyboard setups. There are hotkeys for skills and items, and a basic attack button, so there aren’t many keys to memorize.\n\nInterface - Even with a certain degree of complexity involving character and item stats, not to mention skill effects and particularities, the whole interface is clean and simple, while still providing players with the ability to mouse over mostly everything in order to reveal a tooltip with all the information and math needed, effectively removing the need to look on wikis or guides for them.\n\nGraphics - Cartoonish and pleasant, with detailed characters and special effects, there is just enough enemy and scenery variation to keep the game interesting for a long time.\n\nMusic - From pleasant melodies to engaging battle tunes, the music blends perfectly with the game at any time, and will unlikely feel repetitive or annoying.\n\nSound - Satisfying, there are plenty of sound effects to go with the weapons and skills the game provides, and none ever felt out of place.\n\nDesign - Borba felt curious at the description of “twin-stick meets moba arena combat”, but after playing the game that expression felt just right for the gameplay. It provides a unique experience from similar games, and every feature and mechanic feels well planned and implemented, so that the final result is a fun and original title.\n\nPolish - No major bugs or crashes experienced, just a minor issue that causes frame drops when opening the options screen for the first time after launching the game. Other than that, the game feels and plays like a charm, and so far seems fairly well balanced in terms of difficulty.\nBorba dislikes:Nothing!\nBorba feels like Flamebreak is a must have title for fans of rogue-lite and / or action rpgs. The small price tag and the amount of replayability you get is amazing, and hopefully more content will be added in the future. It’s also perfect for short sessions, or as a break in between other games, and it even includes twitch integration for live streamers such as himself!\n\n10 / 10","April 19","true","34.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

Especially once you have unlocked a few more abilities/weapons.\nDifficulty is pretty high when starting out -- be prepared to die a lot.\n\nMy only real quam is that it takes a bit to get used to the rotational sprites -- kinda gave me a headache at first to be honest. The angle is between facing the screen and topdown so when they rotate around it creates a weird visual illusion/effect.\n\nSolid game though.

While some combos obviously work better each ability has individual strengths that give it a unique role.\nSkill always trumps luck. RNG will fight you but never kill you unfairly.\nExtremely high replay value, 50-100+ hours of gameplay if you enjoy the game and want more.CONSSpirit level takes a long time to level up. Don’t expect to have access to all abilities/weapons/races for a long time.\nSprites are reused a bit too frequently with very little variation. Even most bosses are just resized and recolored normal enemies.Flamebreak takes the Binding of Isaac formula to the next level by combining it with the rogue-like/lite elements of FTL. This combination creates a game that not only requires mechanical skill but also good strategic planning as well. Each time you play the abilities of your character will be randomized in addition to the map being randomized resulting in each playthrough being a completely different experience. It is impossible to overstate how much replayability this game has, even the main game mode will take you quite a while to beat (still working on it myself) and even after that there are challenges and more difficulty modes to keep you interested well into 100+ hours.  If you enjoy the twin-stick genre and are looking for a challenge then Flamebreak is definitely worth a buy.\n","March 15","true","20.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

That's if they survive the 3 attacks you make for 2000 damage.\n-Seriously, it's so much fun how much everything in this game goes together. Stacking cooldown reduction on a human? Cover the entire map in turrets and squires. Your dwarf with a sword started with whirlwind?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/setari/recommended/399640/","setari","Setari","http://steamcommunity.com/id/setari/","463 products in account","Flamebreak is an absolutely gorgeous, well-polished game filled to the brim with RNG and awesome fights. Minotaurs with hammers, Halfling ninjas with throwing stars, lichs that ressurect fallen allies so you have to fight them again, the entire game is awesome in and of itself. It has features lent from DOTA in terms of item pickups as well, but the feature feels extremely good.\n\nGameplay:\nGameplay consists of you, the hero, fighting against denizens of the world in an attempt to reach the Godsplane and kill a god. It is... not a "twin stick shooter" but more of a top down shooter/meleer in my opinion, but whatever it is, it does it SO WELL.\n\nSound: Music is done excellently in the game as well as the fighting noises, skill ability noises and everything else.\n\nStory: The story isn't really important in the game, but it does lend itself to the game at least instead of detracting from it. The little cutscenes are beautifully drawn and rendered in-game and are really very nice to look at.\n\nUnlocks/Gameplay: So when you begin the game you only have a few races available to you to use: The Human, Minotaur, Dwarf, and Elf. There are an additional 7 races to unlock as well, and there are also multiple skills and weapons to unlock as well. There is also ONE unlockable race that you just unlock in the options menu by just checking a box labeled "bonus content" lol. But the unlocks just feel really great when you unlock them and get them added to the random pool to use in the game. Unfortunately, there are certain synergies with skills you'll find out that work extremely well together, but you'll barely be able to get them in the random pool, and I can't figure out how to make a custom character so whatever. Still 10/10 features lol.\n\nItems: The items in the game are extremely well balanced in my opinion and it's DEFINITELY ALL RNG. And it's really nice to go into a shop and see a great attack damage dagger or anything like that, or going into a blacksmith and seeing that LAST SET PIECE. Great, great stuff. And also how each shop has cheese in it to regen your HP when you come across one, and there's no better feeling than getting a shop when you're super low on HP so you can continue your run and have MORE FUN. :D\n\nOverall, the game is 10/10. I don't normally like these kinds of games, like Binding of Isaac and such, but Flamebreak just... pulls it off SO WELL.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gsuorez/recommended/399640/","gsuorez","Grayson","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gsuorez/","291 products in account","An excellent arena shooter with plenty of variety in characters, skills, weapons, mob behaviors and upgrades.\n\nHowever, the balance for character/weapon is awful. The faerie's ability to move around the arena makes it dramatically superior to every other race, and the crossbow's range means that all other weapons are utterly useless, by comparison. Melee weapons need tremendous damage buffs and, if there are going to be races that can't avoid attacks? Then how about beefing them up so that they can withstand attacks. There needs to be at-least one other weapon on-par with the crossbow's range, because the other ranged weapons are all just "oh look: I rolled something that is not as-good as the crossbow."\n\nThe random-rolling of race, weapon and skills being a core aspect of gameplay is nice. But there is a single, incontestably superior result for each, which makes it really frustrating to roll for a second-best. And the slowest races and least-ranged weapons are pure garbage, because they can neither avoid nor score attacks, and don't have boosts in health and damage to compensate for how often you get hit and rarely you deal hits. You want to try a mage? Too bad: you get killed too fast. A close range fighter? Sorry--everything ran away, you can't catch it, and you get killed too fast. A tricky, technical fighter that pulls enemies in? Sorry--you don't deal enough damage before your interrupts wear off and you die because you can't dodge anything. A summoner? Sorry--your summons all die in a single hit and you still get killed too fast. A quick, ranged character? Good thing you made the only viable choice; now hope that you rolled the quickest character and highest range because otherwise you're just playing a second-rate version of it.\n\nIt desperately needs more weapons at highest-range and huge damage boosts to sword and dagger. Movement speeds also need a tweak, unless the slow characters get some damage resistance to make tanking viable. Right now? It's great fun, but a frustrating experience because of wonky weapon/race balance.","December 20, 2015","true","136.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

It uses a top-down view. You choose a character from three randomized options. You can reroll the options, but if you've managed to beat the game the reroll will end your winning streak.\n\nTo start you have an overworld. You move one space and then fight some mobs or go into a merchant to buy something. The mobs can be easy or have extremely tough. The merchants sell stuff like potions or gear. Healing potions can only be used in the over world view - not while fighting mobs. Making this game really tough.\n\nEach region in the overworld is basically a 'level'. The region ends with a boss. I've never made it past the fourth boss.\n\nThis game is ridiculously difficult. And after dying you have to start over completely - no saving it before a boss and trying again. Nope, to get back to the same spot you're looking at another 15 to 20 minutes - reminiscent of the old Nintendo games like Super Mario Bros, but with only one chance to get to Bowzer.\n\nAnyway, it's okay. It's very arcade style. It's mostly just run around the screen avoiding flying things and clicking on different mobs to eventually kill them. It's pretty mindless.\n\nI've enjoyed it, but it's a "sit and play for 30 minutes" game, not a "waste an afternoon and most of a night".\n","October 23, 2015","true","46.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NotMark/recommended/399640/","NotMark","Krantom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NotMark/","344 products in account","First off let me just say I got this game for free indirectly by the devs. I think they were just lurking in a popular stream of the game and handed out some keys to a mod who then started private messaging people who asked genuine questions about the game or seemed interested. I guess I just happened to be a lucky one and got a key.\n\nAfter about 12 hours of play I seem to have 'finished' the game almost completely. I guess I'm sort of done with the game now at level 12 of something like 21 levels [last unlock is at level 21 I think]. You gain leveling EXP, called 'Insight', by clearing a zone/world. Further leveling would reward me with new playable races, weapons, and abilities/spells being added to the pool. Missing the 2 hardest [?] achievements which require a bit of focus [clear hard mode 5 times in a row, get 40 favour with Furere]. I've beat all the gods at least once and looped the world once just to try it.\n\n\nAnyway I'll try to give my half cent on the game:\n\n-Visually the game isn't too appealing at first sight and many people seem to compare it to flash games which honestly doesn't seem too far off. Just going by the screenshots on the steam store page I honestly wouldn't give this game too much thought, but after playing ~12 hours the visuals have somewhat grown on me and I now find them appealing. Enemy types are easily identifiable just by looking at them. The fields are randomly generated and have obstructions placed in them which can't be walked over but can still be attacked over. Some of these, especially on the snow levels, can be a bit hard to see during combat. All hitboxes and AoE's seem very clear, for the ones you aren't too sure about the game let's you see their AoE by mousing over the skill icon at any time. A small iffy I got with the fields, the forest one in particular, is that if you push an enemy to the edge of the arena then they can get completely covered up and hidden by the tree's that decorate the edge of the screen and it has gotten me hit a few times because I can't see their animations.\n\n-Audio is pretty chill. I was quite content just listening to the BGM instead of putting on my own music, which is my usual opposite for games. Sound doesn't seem to play a big part in the game at all except for some hazard zones and knowing when things will appear from outside the screen [boulders mainly]. SFX is enjoyable except for when you have heaps of summons/helpers on the field helping you, then the sound of them bashing at things is quite overwhelming and unpleasant.\n\n-Gameplay is the main appeal of this game for me. All races, weapons, and skills that I have unlocked so far seem to be viable for a successful run in some way and seem to be quite balanced. On each run the world also selects 5 sets of items from ~10 you can buy in shops which have stat boosts and special effects which usually carry your run. Every one of them has a use, although some are definitely more useful than others. Enemies, hazards, fields, bosses, shops, gold gains, etc, all seem fair and balanced in their own way. Even though the game is tagged as a rogue-lite, it is quite forgiving with being hit by giving you plenty of HP, it's possible to do an entire run without being hit. Every time you finish combat without being hit it says 'Flawless!' which stacks up with every flawless clear. Although this doesn't seem to add any direct benefit to the game it does feel good knowing you've fought X amount of battles without being damaged. I've gotten to the point where I can clear just about everything [except for arcane traps god I hate them, they're not even deadly it's like they're just made to break your combo] without being hit.\n\nThere are multiple game modes you can select which vary the difficulty of the game in some way. In normal mode you have a choice of 3 characters which are randomly generated. If you don't feel like doing a randomly generated character you can just choose custom mode and make your own from scratch, but receive less insight during the run in exchange. Hard mode just hands you a randomly generated character and you take 50% more damage, but double your insight gains. Then there is nightmare mode which is the same as hard mode, but forces you to loop the world in exchange for triple insight gains. There are also daily options for all of these which give everyone the exact same character loadout, world seed, etc, for you to compete on a leader board.\n\nNot sure what else I can say about the game. I found it quite enjoyable. The challenge was definitely there. I guess I was pleasantly surprised by the game and stuck around longer than I initially thought I would. I would definitely recommend this game, but I personally probably wouldn't buy it even after watching other people play it and even if $10 USD isn't much. I might buy it if it was on sale but it wouldn't be high on my priorities. The game was good sure, but it didn't really feel memorable or anything like that. The most memorable thing for me was the little rhyming intro and outro screens that appear before every zone and after every boss. It just didn't feel very different from many other rogue-lite experiences for me.\n\nI'll just say it again. It's enjoyable and not too brutal in difficulty, but it really doesn't feel like anything new. Even though I say that, I still recommend this game.","March 22","true","11.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You can move in all directions unlike BOI and have several abilities that don't take long to cooldown.  Much like most roguelikes, FB has random levels and loot at shops.\n\nAnother comparison  you can make is FTL.  Much like in FTL, you must continually move up on the world  map, escaping the darkness envoloping it.  If the darkness takes you, you pretty much have to fight monsters for zero reward unitl you move up more.\n\nIt is a fun game and worth it if you can get it for dirt cheap like I did.  The developer is working with me right now on the controller support.  If you own a steam controller, it doesn't detect the xbox 360 configuration the dev's have implemented for some reason.  So...what this means is the right trackpad only works as a mouse and makes playing FB with a steam controller a vigorous trial.  Here's hoping he fixes this issue.\n\nEdit: A pretty amazing dev.  5 hours after I posted my complaint about the controller, he released a small patch to fix it.  The steam controller works as a joystick now.

If you like roguelites, you're probably going to like this one too. The map screen and skills make this game distinct from others. While you can set yourself up to just spam skills as they become available, that doesn't always work and there are plenty of skills that are better saved for more beneficial situations. My only real complaints are that the battle area layouts are kind of boring and that there isn't more enemy variety. But it's definitely a lot of fun to play.

The auto lock on system for gamepad control works great to target your attacks and powers, and it's easy to switch to the target you want usually. This game is also based on player skill and not luck. Every death so far has felt like it was my fault of skill, or a power/weapon selection that wasn't ideal in combo with my play style.\n\nFor this type of game that's high praise.\n\nYour character has 4 powers and is made up of the following:\nRace. Each race/species has slightly different stats and a unique power. For instance Humans have an ability which summons a 1 hit to kill ally that can distract and attack enemies, while the Dwarf has an ability to slam the ground and stun all nearby enemies.\n\nWeapon. Each weapon mostly just attacks (which is another power) but at least one, the spear, you will throw if you wait a few second between attacks. There's a fair variety between melee and ranged weapons.\n\nAbilities. There's a set of powers that you get two of. These have a range of effects. One throws a flame wave out, another throws out a stun that passes through enemies, and there's one that summons tiny skeletons holding bombs that seek out and explode on enemies. Of course there's more than just those 3 powers.\n\nYou start with 3 randomly selected characters with the above to choose from normally, though I just unlocked the ability to choose a combination myself at the price of only recieving half "Spirit" rewards which builds up and levels over games to unlock more races, weapons, and abilities.\n\nThere's a map screen and you shoose a spot next to you to move to and fight or shop at the location. There's some kind of evil darkness that comes from the bottom of the screen so you can't take forever and clear every spot. At the top of the map there's a boss you must defeat to move on to the next map area. There's a few different bosses you might fight at different maps.\n\nAt the shops you might pick up items that increase attack damage, attack speed, move speed, or certain shops have pieces of gear sets that when complete give you extra passive abilities. I believe there may also be items and gear sets that give active-use abilities.\n\nOver-all a fun game.","January 19","true","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You're basically entering a bunch of arenas, each with random enemies and sometimes battlefield effects to dodge (Meteors, traps, etc). Think isaac with no treasure rooms and a large focus on shops and finding complete set pieces.\n\nIf you like dual stick shooters, or real time roguelikes, definitely check this one out.\n\nEDIT: bumped it up a bit in score. Really starts fleshing out and having more of that craziness you come to look for in these games once you get a bit into it.","March 8","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The chances you are going to play the same game twice is like 1 billion to one. The game randomizes everything, you play a random class with a random weapon, with random abilities. You then fight random enemies, and find random shops where you get a random selection of items. So much fun to explore and find different things every playthough, A great game!\nMy video review if you are interested in seeing gameplay:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmAdQr-DhO0","May 21","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Game throws me a random race and set of skills, and just says, "try beating the game with this combination". I love being challenged to beat the game differently every time.
