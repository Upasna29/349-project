But that's sort of hard to do when you're talking about a game that is a giant metaphor for sex. Luxuria Superbia is a game about making love, thinly disguised behind the notion of making flowers "bloom", placing you in the "role" of a hypothetical ♥♥♥♥♥ flying through an infinite ♥♥♥♥♥♥. It's both incredibly strange yet oddly alluring, like something you know you shouldn't enjoy but can't quite pull yourself away from it. All the same, it fails entirely at being anything more than a very unusual art project; hyper sexualized (though not at all pornographic) and occasionally even beautiful, but shallow and tedious as an actual game.\n\nThough I'm hesitant to say you actually "play" Luxuria, interaction comes in the form of you flowing through colorful tunnels, with burst to life as you touch petals that come along the path, with the goal being to keep as much color showing without entirely filling up every side and "finishing" the flower too soon (which results in a disappointed message on screen asking you "what went wrong"). The longer you can stay in a flower the more points you get (which are gained faster when more color is on screen), and the happier the "flower" will be at the end. That's really all there is to the "game", which straddles the line between interactive entertainment, and something you'd find on a perverted corner of the internet. Every moment is tinged with a highly suggestive undertone, though I wouldn't call it subtle, for as soon as you begin to get deeper into a flower much of any pretense is abandoned as the developer makes sure you know exactly what they are symbolizing.\n\nPlaying Luxuria Superbia made me feel dirty, like I was a kid stumbling upon his father's secret magazines and proceeding to throw away my innocence. It's awkward and maybe a little uncomfortable to sit through, but at the very least I can't knock it for being anything but unique and artistic. Once you get past the erotic outer layers though, you are still left with an incredibly boring and ultimately pointless experience that grows tiresome before you bring your first flower to completion. I couldn't say quite how I feel about the analogies the game presents, but my opinion of the portion that makes it a game at all is very clear, that being one which I couldn't wait to abandon and really have no explanation for why I started in the first place.\n\nLet's just say Luxuria Superia is weird, and you would probably be best to leave it by the wayside in favor of more traditional forms of pleasure.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","July 3, 2014","false","1.3"," 66 of 81 people (81%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","81","66","81","3","11"

Luxuria Superbia is a game that leaves many suggesting images in your mind, without ever getting absolutely explicit. Still, it has very, very, very many allusions to the more pleasurable sides of life. (Gods, how can I review this without feeling twitchy? I don't even know.)\n\nAlright.\n\nI played with both a mouse, and with a X-Box controller. (Thanks to a friend, I got to try the controls for a controller). I absolutely recommend using a controller for this game, as it will be all about the... well...\n\nOkay. *deep breath*\n\nThe game is all about teasing flowers. 12 different flowers, in different colors, accompanied with music and strange suggestive phrases coming onto the screen. (There is no way for me to review this without me feeling naughty, is there? Nope. Nope, not at all.) With the controller, it's easier - two touching areas makes the game faster by at least three times, that's at least my opinion. With only the mouse, you'll also get quite something out of it, but really, try it with a controller and two sticks. (That gives the term 'joystick' a very, VERY naughty connotation. Good Gods.) And at the end of the teasing, when the flower reaches its peak (see where this is going?) you collect seeds to fill the gardens with color. All nice and such.\n\nI do recommend the game, but I have to admit there isn't much of a story to it (pantheon of 12 flowers, fill the fields of the pantheon with the seeds you collect from the flowers). And it leaves a very strange feeling, at least with me. And since my imagination tends to run rampant, this game really didn't do much good for me. So. Many. Naughty. Things. *sighs*\n\nOkay. Done. Without inserting too many slippery things.\n\n...dammit!","February 2, 2015","true","10.1"," 37 of 41 people (90%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","90","37","41","22","1"

Why?\n\nIt is colorful, highly sexual without having any actualy pornographic images (though the text leaves little to the imagination), has an unusual, electronic and reactive soundtrack, and is less a game than an experience.  I happened to think it was a somewhat snide concept, innovative for it's genre, and immersive in an artistic way, and I took it on that level.  I like it.\n\nOn the other hand, it is not a game built for the PC, but a touch screen, and as I understand it, it hasn't been altered in any way to improve gameplay for a PC.  It has no plots, no really deep puzzles, isn't really a simulation (unless you count stimulation), and is graphically on par with a nicely done flash game.  It also has little replay value (unless it happens to fulfill some other needs in your life), and can be played through in under an hour.  In other words, it was built for casual gamers, and it is casual gamers who shall play it.  Because of this, while I like it, I can't in good conscience recommend it to the Steam community, which prides itself on technologically and graphically superior games and/or immersive, story-driven games.\n\nGreat for:  people who really like experimental games, colorful and design-heavy images, and simple gameplay (and innuendo).\n\nNot great for:  Most computer gamers (I.E., if you want at least an hour of gameplay, to make use of your graphics card, and/or some kind of plot to your diversions).","January 30, 2014","false","2.5"," 74 of 122 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","74","122","0","0"

Yes, I suppose I do.\n\nOkay, deep breath, annnnnnd go. Luxuria Superbia is a game in which you must tease, tickle, and stimulate the sensuous concavities of several flowers, engorging them with color and causing them to experience untold delights as you make them burst forth with fertility. It is a thin, laughing veneer of gardening on top of a Beginner's Female ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Instructional Video, and it is gorgeous and rich and every 13 year old should be given a copy as part of a solemn adulthood how-not-to-suck-at-this ritual.\n\nAs you pleasure the petals, they will go from pale white to rich with color - the more brightly colored they are, the more pleasure the flower derives, the more fertile it becomes when it experiences its final climactic rush, and the faster your score piles up. Delivering too much pleasure too quickly, however, causes the flower to burst early, resulting in a failure; ideally, you'll attend to every spot equally, tapping lightly and driving the flower to greater and greater heights of ecstasy before the eventual plunder. Along the way, the flower will goad you on, dropping euphemisms ranging from the charming and playful to the uncomfortably surreal. While each flower plays roughly the same, they each come with their own surreal visuals, their own beat-heavy background music, and their own sensual banter, all of which combines to give each of them a memorable personality and an image uniquely their own.\n\nIn the end, the game ends up feeling a little short and a little meaningless, but it's an exhilarating and unique rush along the way. Top marks to Tale of Tales for attempting something as unorthodox and unconventional as this; even if the game's appeal vanishes the minute you finish, it's certainly something you can look back on fondly. If you like boundary-pushing weirdness, definitely give it a go.\n\nFor the records, the touch controls of the tablet version are far, far superior to the gamepad controls of the computer version, but you should get a pretty solid experience regardless.","July 30, 2014","true","0.8"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","0"

Probably, their best overall project, mostly because it ditches all the parts, that detract from the experience and leave just what they can do best. This time, they decided to focus on ideas of sex and passion and did their job amazingly, despite the minimalism of the game. You stimulate flower, try not to get it to climax too early and look at pretty visuals and listen to nice tunes. Simple, yet beautiful.\nThat said, this is one of the still rare examples, where the game would definitely benefit from playing it on a touchscreen - it's pretty obvious, that the game was designed with "touching the flower" in mind, and using just mouse on PC doesn't feel as good. Even more surprisingly, gamepad can offer a more interesting approach with it's two sticks, but it still clear, that touchscreen should be the way to experience this game.\nAlso note, that the gameplay described in the first paragraph is all there is, so you might find it really boring really quick if you're wishing for something more.","February 9, 2014","true","1.4"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

Appropriately enough, you engage in  the aforementioned floraphilia by tickling the trippy insides of your sylvan lover. Tickle them too much though, and you'll be prematurely ejaculated from the flower, and no-one wants that. That seems to be about it. Nary a hint of foreplay, and as for pillow-talk, let's just say that's no bed of roses either.\n\nPiling onto the already burgeoning raft of assumptions I've made with this review, I'm further assuming that Luxuria Superbia is a lifelike representation of boning garden plants, and ergo we can conclude that getting jiggy with a geranium is extremely tedious and barely arousing at all.","June 4, 2014","false","0.3"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","7","8","4","1"

But much like resisting an ♥♥♥♥♥♥, everything is beautiful and enjoyable, and yet the urge to slip off that tightrope, to just go for it, stops it from being a truly satisfying experience. Though it does get better after a playing couple of levels, the constant repetition quickly knocks out the built up excitement, leaving behind a game not unlike an old screensaver.

Essentially, you use your mouse to try to add color to the "flower" that doesn't really look all that terribly much like a flower, while some levels have other leaves growing on the petals that take away the color on that petal if you hit them with your mouse. There's really no real challenge of any kind involved, nor is any real concentration required. Basically, keeping your mouse moving and watching the color grow is all that there is to it.\n\nBeyond that, there is also nothing that you're really working for at all, except to maybe take a longer amount of time coloring in the flower next time in order to score higher. Even when the game is "beaten," there's nothing special that happens. You just are given the same screen from which to choose a level to play. From what I've read, if it was accurate information, this was developed as a game for touch-screen tablets and such, and that would make perfect sense. Unfortunately, it's the right kind of game for that, but not really for standard computers.\n\nAs for the awkwardness, well, let's just say that this game is about as sexual as it could get without showing any skin, as it urges you to hit the right spot and make it feel so good while you kiss it slowly, and so on. I'm still not quite sure if it's really some x-rated simulator masking as a flower game or not, but needless to say, playing it with family in the room made me feel really weirded out.\n\nSo, for all the reasons detailed here, I really can't recommend it. For my part, I'm just glad that I got it in a bundle, because the  small amount of positives come nowhere near approaching the negatives as far as this game is concerned. The only reason I even found myself continuing to play it at all is that it took so little time that I was willing to hold out and see if there was more to it later on. Now I kind of regret that, but at least I can delete it knowing for sure that I didn't miss anything.","March 5, 2014","false","1.6"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","1"

It is an incredibly simple game about... I don't know what, but it's really fun.  All the player does is use their mouse to create color by clicking on certain parts of the screen.  It's fun comes from the fact that we were all once five years old.  It feels like a step back into childhood with it's vibrant colors and simplicity.  I've only played for a short time, but this is a fantastic game.\n\nOn the OTHER hand, the game has on mechanic that kind of ruins the immersion.  The flowers.  The game has you going through tunnels wich are describing as being flowers.  That concept is easy to understand, except the player appears to be doing... something to the flowers.  If the player creates enough color (Or, as the game describes it, 'create joy'), the flower begins to talk, saying somewhat creepy things like, "Grip my petals" and "Oh yes, yes".  I'm not into ****ing a flower am I?\n\nThat portion of the game DOES contribute to the feel of the game, since the creator so obviously intended that.  The game is playable by both children and adults, for the simple reason that children who don't understand what the flowers are getting at won't care, and the children who do are likely doing something age-inappropriate anyways, and still don't care.\n\nOverall, creepy, but fun.  9/10 because I feel like I just gave a flower a handjob.

I feel cheated because I did not at all get what was advertised. I watched the trailer and thought the game looked like a fun, relaxing color + music game, similar to audiosurf or something. What I did NOT understand from the trailer video is that this is an erotic edging game. You travel down a tunnel (it's a vag, lets face it), as strange music plays, while being given commands to go slowly and make "it" last as long as possible. The game gives you commands, like "buzz in me", "you on top" and "kiss me", among many other awkward things. Had I known this game was going to make me feel uncomfortable, like I was being coerced into leading a digital vag into a thinly veiled ecstasy, I NEVER EVER would've bought it. I bet some crusty nerds will think this game is super sexy, but as a woman I just feel used and confused by it. If you want to make a porn game, just make one.

It looks more interesting than it actually is.\nI went and turned off the text rather quickly since it makes me uncomfortable and is completely irrelevant to the gameplay itself. Which maybe defeats the point of the whole thing but if so then the game was flawed to begin with.\nThe problem is that there's just no diversity here. From the first level to the last, the core gameplay changes exactly once, aside from increased time necessary to complete levels. It's not really challenging and even playing one level can get tedious, much less playing them all. The game also seems to encourage you to replay levels over and over, but provides absolutely no incentive for doing so. Maybe there's accomplishment value in it for some people but, really, this is just a mobile game at its core. Maybe it's just not for me but I grew tired of it really quickly and am quite thankful I only got it as part of a bundle.","March 1, 2014","false","1.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It probably has more focus on gameplay than everything else they've done combined, but it's still more of an experience than a game, considering the minimal amount of challenge and focus on aesthetics and presentation and the mood it sets.

Basically you have to hit the different rows to get points, making sure not to anything too fast to prevent blowing your load before the flower-thing gets off. The audio is reactive to your playing, with a spine-tingling little bit playing anytime you approach climax.

Its.... highly sexual... but nothing is offensive about it. I guess this is like one of those cheap romance novels but as a video game.\n\nThis game is not for everyone, if i could - i'd give it a neutral rating. Its okay. Its rather boring, and amusing (if you're a bloke and playing with other guys) with the little things it says. It's not exactly clear what to do, and to begin with you will fail often until you actually finish (I guess a bit like real life interactions?).\n\nHow this is a simulation I don't know. Its just an artsy-fartsy game with a strange metaphor that will disturb most people and you will walk away thinking "what the hell have I just played" and likely never speak about it again.","March 31, 2014","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(I suppose it depends on your available leisure money.)\n\nThat said, the game is fun for people like me who like games with low-pressure win conditions; it's not at all clear when you start playing what you're supposed to do--but it doesn't matter; you click the pretty flower and it explodes into color and moans at you.\n\nFlower. Moaning. And saying "yes" and "more, faster, please," and similar comments. The only thing subtle about the eroticism in this game is the lack of human-shaped genitalia. The actual game mechanics are subtle: after the first flower event (not sure what else to call it), you get progress bars, and more flowers open up; you can replay each of them, trying to maximize, erm, "color," which is not the same as speed--go too fast, and you'll be told to slow down.\n\n... Maybe it is worth full price.","November 9, 2015","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
