Since the core goal is to alway solve the tile turning puzzle this becomes frustrating quickly. The developers tried to compensate by allowing the player to automatically skip levels, but this doesn't correct the core problem since the level after the one you skipped has the same problems.\n\nIf you have always wanted a twitch reaction tile puzzle game, this one may be perfect for you. Otherwise you may lose interest quickly, as I did.","May 30, 2014","false","1.7"," 49 of 54 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","49","54","0","0"

I was really surprised at how unfun the gameplay actually was. Mixing up several different gaming styles – contemplative puzzling, timers and fast-paced enemy avoidance – apparently didn't pan out that well in this case.\n\nThe gameplay's two major inspirations would appear to be Qix and Pipe Mania (or the hacking puzzle in Bioshock, shudder). Instead of drawing lines like in Qix, you navigate a grid of Pipe Mania -type puzzle parts and manually rotate them one at a time while avoiding enemies.\n\nI kind of want to like Tom – the writing's amusing and the production's solid.

To do that you have to redirect power through the system. You just have to rotate tiles till they form a path from the power source to your objective.

Also imagine that you control Frogger, who hand-rotates these tiles while listening to techno and dodging traffic on a highway.\n\nIf you dismiss indie games as being EITHER fast, tough-as-nails platformers OR artsy atmospheric environments, I highly encourage you to give this game a shot - this is a fine example of original gameplay that requires split-second precision and risk/reward decision making. I had beaten (not gold-medalled) the single-player campaign in about 4 hours, but don't take that as a knock against the game - I preferred to play in 10-minute intervals to give my nerves a chance to recover from the frantic pace, and I haven't played much of the other modes yet.\n\nThe soundtrack by Ian Hicks is extremely well done - 7 tracks that nicely complement the setting and gameplay that are well worth purchasing and adding to your mp3 player. The 8th, which is used in the trailer, feels out of place and I've removed it from my playlist.

There's no difficulty curve, you'll have random hard levels mixed in with middling ones. You go straight from a pure-puzzle stage to a pure-action one and there's major whiplash. Some levels require memorization as pieces are hidden, which only makes things more tedious. Controls need work too, TOM is not always responsive to slightly early arrow presses which can lead to you coming to a dead stop when you meant to move right and often even a fraction of a second can get you killed. Also, the death penalty is incredibly steep and if you're going for a gold score you might as well restart if you die even once. Which wouldn't be a problem except in levels with enemies all over the place and avoiding dying is the only real goal of the level. This game is just simply unfun to play, the art's nice, the music's alright though a bit dull after a while, but just playing this game is a chore. I couldn't even find it in myself to finish the game, I was just having that little enjoyment playing it. I'm sure there's an audience for this kind of game somewhere but it isn't me and I don't think most of the crowd that would want to play this from how it looks would be in that audience.

Despite this, my excitement never waned.\n\nFast-forward to now when I have a new PC and this bug is gone, and I can say that this is an incredibly shallow game. Every 3-5 levels a new gimmick is thrown into the mix, but they don't really make it better so much as just turn a set of levels into something beyond the basic Pipe Dream gameplay. The biggest issue is that, unless there's some late-game revelation I never got to, the board remains roughly the same size and you're just trying to connect everything, sometimes before it all locks up and screws you on a few stages. Scoring is just based on speed, turning a puzzle into an action game if you want rewards: figure out the solution, then do it 30 seconds faster without dying.","February 12, 2015","false","2.0"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

Redirect the virus' infection by rotating the circuits while dodging the anti-virus countermeasure drone spiders. Elements such as locked circuits and red game over blocks get thrown in later. Eventually, you get to a point where it's solely based on timing your moves around the spiders. Tedious.\n\nGraphics: The character and level design are simple, but worked for what they are. The little cutscenes follow an art style reminiscent of what you would see on Cartoon Network in the mid 90's, just not as good. Also the resolution is locked at 1280x720 so if you switch the settings to 1980x720, you get a horrible border all the way around the screen.\n\nSound: So little going on here that the only thing worth mentioning is the respawn noise is annoying.\n\nMusic: Surprisingly solid with a track or two I'd actually listen to outside the game.\n\nControls: Simple enough bindings, you've got directional controls, glitch drop, and circuit rotation. The game recommends the controller, but you can honestly make do with the keyboard. I couldn't tell any difference in the gameplay between the two.\n\nDid I Finish It: No.\n\nWill I Finish It: Eventually, but I'm so irritated with the later levels, I'm taking an indefinite break.\n\nShould You Buy It: Only if the concept interests you, snag it in a bundle or if you see it for 80% or less.\n","October 6, 2014","true","5.6"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

For Dr. X, it's more than just a clever invention, but his entire livelihood being taken away by a mega corporation, framing and imprisoning him in the process just to make it abundantly clear what a bunch of greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥ they are. Unfortunately, they forgot about a little virus named Tom, who's about to turn their billion dollar company into a pile of rubble, one computer at a time.\n\nA Virus Named Tom is something like a pimped out Pipe Mania. Guiding Tom through computer mainframes, you need to redirect the flow of the hack by twisting panels until the infection has spread across the entire board. Simple in theory, but in execution it becomes quite an elaborate challenge once anti-hack bugs, hidden and unmovable tiles, and the intricate maze designs start to pile on more and more things to keep track of. One of the most impressive things about AVNT is how it balances these elements into a gradual but brisk increase in difficulty. Rarely did I feel overwhelmed by any of the mechanics, instead rather impressed with myself that I was able to solve what initially appear to be incredibly involved puzzles. It's constantly rewarding and satisfying to progress, even with the surprisingly long single player story (which doesn't take into account the entire separate coop campaign which I've yet to even dip into).\n\nAs a puzzle game, A Virus Named Tom resides pleasantly in the realm of the best pick up and play arcade classics. It's challenging and enjoyable whether in short bursts or drawn out sessions as you try to attain a gold medal on every level, and never once managed to outstay its welcome for me however long I spent with it. It also features a fantastic electronic soundtrack, and some rather charming and humorous cutscenes which somehow manage to make mass hysteria and deconstruction feel lighthearted and amusing. Really, if a game can't sell itself to you with a dog that doesn't poop, I don't even know what more there is to say.","August 8, 2014","true","6.4"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

The game plays a lot like Pipe Mania with the player controlling Tom, who moves around the gridded game area and spins the 'pipe' pieces by moving around them and holding a button, all while avoiding enemies. Tom has 'health' (time bar) that slowly drops over time and is reduced further when hit by an enemy.\n\nThis game has potential, given its inclusion of a bare but amusing story that gives context to the player's actions, as the game slowly introduces new concepts, powerups and enemy types. It also rewards the player with a few 'skip tokens' every new world, so if you are really stuck on a level you can still continue playing.\n\nUnfortunately, I just feel that the game lacks polish and refinement as the difficulty spikes and curve seem to be pretty uneven, and the very fast and 'instakill' enemies just seem to throw the balance out of whack. There is a nice mix between standard puzzle and enemy levels, however the game as a whole did not hold my interest very well with the fairly plain looking levels, fairly shallow game mechanics and unfair 'twitchy' game movements required in later levels just to survive, all while trying to think how to solve the actual puzzle.\n\nOverall, an enjoyable but flawed puzzle game that hardcore difficult puzzle fans will love but most people will find just too unremarkable and difficult to be enjoyable. 6/10.\nFinally, kudos to the people in the audio department for a memorable and enjoyable soundtrack! One of the best parts of the game for sure.","November 20, 2014","false","1.8"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

(The Schmaltzy Cynic)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brian_Colfxire/","468 products in account","I really do want to recommend this game. The aesthetics, the humor, the character design of T.O.M., the snazzy soundtrack (the one positive thing I got from this game) are fantastic, but ultimately the gameplay is where the game fails to understand itself.\n\nIf you have played the demo, you might actually find the game interesting and fun with the pipe-linking puzzle game AVNT wants you to believe it is. But once you get to the middle of the second area/world/device, the game suddenly forgets the methological approach.\n\nThe main problem with this game is it wants you to take your time to figure out the puzzles, yet it also rushes you to solve the solutions as your health is your time-limit. Some levels will slowly degrade your health while others will rely on you manuevering around enemies to absorb more health. And you have to complete the puzzle while doing that as well.\n\nEven worse, you have to do all of that while you CAN'T see your progress. There is a mechanic introduced fairly early that hides the grid unless you connect the pipes.\n\nSo that means you have to brute force your way to completion. But some levels seem to demand that you memorize each level, THEN do it as quick as possible while not getting hurt and losing time/health.\n\nSome might argue that the skip-tokens let you get past those frustrating levels, but the game just continues to get more frustrating for all the wrong reasons. The challenges at the start of the game do not prepare you for the trials towards the end. I couldn't even imagine trying to convince someone to play cooperative with me on the later levels.\n\nThen you have the other glaring issue: The controls.\n\nThe best way to explain the problem is that you always feel tied to an anchor. Whether you use a controller or the keyboard, you have to hold a button down to interact with a section of the grid. Combine this mechanic with having to dodge enemies quickly and you'll find yourself stuck on the same paths or you'll accidently slide into an enemy you were trying to avoid.\n\nIf there is A Virus Named TOM 2, however slim, I hope the devs choose one type of puzzle or the other.  Testing your reflexes or testing your puzzle-solving is fine, but testing both at the same time is a challenge in frustration, not of fair difficulty.","June 9, 2015","false","4.0"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

I thought it would at least keep my attention for a while as it was classified as a puzzle game, but to my dismay it wasn't really a puzzle game overall.\n\nThe game is mostly a twitch/reaction game with some puzzle elements. The game takes its roots in the genre Pipe Mania made popular. You have to move circuit pieces around so that you have a complete circuit/flow of the virus and the level is complete. You may ask "But isn't that a puzzle game?" and to that question I would say it is a puzzle game.The last half of the game it introduces too many elements for it to remain a puzzle game. The later elements all rely on the player moving quickly and trying to think on their toes and often that leads to death. A good puzzle game gives the player time to do the puzzles and doesn't require ADHD levels of movement while still trying to solve a puzzle.\n\nMany design choices made in the game are inherently flawed. After you complete a level it takes you back to the main board to select a level wherein you will often find that you have to move around a couple times to get to the next level. I would have liked to see the game progress you to the next level after a level is completed. My next issue is with the music. There felt like there were 3 tracks of music that were randomly selected at the start of a level. I would have liked to have seen a couple tracks for each world and I would have liked it if the music didn't change every single time I had to restart a level. The sound effects are some of the most nerve-wracking I have heard in a while that I ended up just disabling sound to play the game.\n\nOverall the game is an "Okay" experience but I know for sure that I will not play it anymore. It's not worth $10 and has the same amount of content I would expect from a $3 mobile app. I'd have to say to all my friends to give this game a pass as there are plenty of other games you can get that are better for the same price point.","January 7, 2015","false","1.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

You will need to use quick reflexes, and the logic part of your brain to help TOM bring down the corporation, one invention at a time!\n\nGame Play: The controls are extremely simple, you move in any direction, rotate tiles, or drop glitch spots to slow down defenses going after TOM. There’s not much else to be said about it. I played on a keyboard, my brother has been playing the co-op with me and he’s been using a controller, the game controls are very straightforward.\n\nAchievements: The achievements are rather dynamic and more complicated then I want to get into.

If you intend to purchase A Virus Named Tom though, well that's a different kettle of fish.\n\nThe game starts off as an innocuous pipe dreams style game; organise the circuit pieces to infect the part. The game quickly introduces more boundaries to your success, both related and external to the circuit itself: fixed pieces, encrypted pieces, anti-virus pieces, drones, glitch-proof drones, hunter drones etc. Personally I enjoyed the puzzles that involved finding the correct circuit within the defined time limit, and initially the drones gave levels the right amount of pressure. Unfortunately with the glitch-proof and hunter drones things start to get obnoxiously messy, especially as they are often paired with extremely fast patrol speeds, changing the game into a frustrating mess of puzzle solving and timing-based movement.\n\nIt's certainly not a bad game but there are dozens of fun and challenging puzzle games on Steam that certainly outclass A Virus Named Tom.","July 3, 2014","false","7.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Except, the puzzles aren't difficult, just time consuming. But it has enemies, so it's sort of an action game! Except the enemies are predictable, and being hit by one only serves to reduce the time remaining that you have to solve the particular puzzle until you 'run out of energy'. At which point you need to start the 'puzzle' over again. This game then quickly devolves into two kinds of levels:\n\n1. Long and boring puzzle levels where enemies are hardly a threat, and sometimes pieces of the puzzle are obscured so you either have to rely on memorization or gueswork.\n\n2. Insultingly simple puzzles that are only made 'difficult' by a pointless overabundance of enemies, which, due to the fact that you are limited by a grid, are impossible to dodge unless you literally wait for the perfect timing, jump in, rotate pieces of the puzzle, and jump out before you get hit and waste your time.\n\nWasting your time is the name of the game, here. This game is not a puzzle game, nor an action game, nor a game in any sense of the word. It is a time waster, in the purest sense. Buying it is, predictably, a waste of time.","July 6, 2014","false","2.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The gameplay was basically like the thousands of connected the pipe minigames and maybe it does get better after the first stage, but I didn't want to have to go through the rest of that to get to it. Watching some of the videos if you're not a completionist you can get through this game rather quickly. There is a mutliplayer that I never touched because I believe it was LAN though the Dev said he was making it Online so it might be by now.\nI do kinda feel dicky for having a negative opinion for this game as it is Indie and the Dev seems like a nice guy with a wife and two year old child, so good on you if you do buy it as you're supporting them but for me it was lacking it what reviews and video hype put it up to be.\nIf you're a puzzle fan then you'll like this.\nIf you're not a puzzle fan then you'll ever dislike this or be netural about this.\nIf you're not a puzzle fan but you really wanna try this I'd wait until a sale came.","April 16, 2014","false","0.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, most puzzles are fairly simple, and the difficulty comes from 2 additions :\n- Either there are hidden tiles that force you to remember the layout, relying on rote memory rather than actually thinking about the solution.\n- Or the difficulty is in the execution, where the solution is known but you have to race around enemies to execute it.\n\nThis is not a puzzle game, this is an action game. And since the controls aren't intuitive, it's not even a fun action game. The memory-based puzzles are infuriating, and the action ones can also be frustrating, because the floaty controls (with gamepad) can generate some mistakes and stupid deaths.\n\nThat's too bad, because the character design and the sound design were well done, giving Tom a fun personality. That unfortunately isn't enough to redeem the faults in the gameplay\n\nHowever i do give kudos to the devs to include skip tokens, which allow you to skip puzzles that you're stuck too long on.

You can't actually plan things out now - you just have to rotate each piece, one by one, until you've got them all connected with the water source. Then you can see you were rotating them all wrong and have to start over. And did I mention there's a timer? And enemies that take away your time? Be prepared to restart the level a lot.

Most of the puzzles are an entertaining way of blowing a couple of minutes here or there, but those boards with an antagonist element, while novel, are more frustrating than tense.  Due to the way Tom moves in a "notched" manner across the grid, getting out of harm's way is often down to how fast you can hammer a given directional key.  Twitch gaming isn't really something I'm looking for in a timed puzzle game.  The ability to skip stages is doled out piecemeal as a reward for progression, and although using them feels a bit like throwing up a white flag, those with no compunctions about this will find the feature handy.  Overall I'd rate this a bit above average.","November 28, 2014","true","3.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

While doing that, you have to look out for enemies and use various powerups to your advantage. There's a very humorous approach to the story through cutscenes before and after the levels, showing the effects of your virus at work.\n\nThere's a very well implemented scoreboard which shows how you are doing relative to your Steam friends. That made me redo a few levels just to see if I could get to the top. It controls very well with a controller, once you get the hang of their method for turning each tile.\n\nThe graphics are good enough for a puzzle game.

I bought it because it was categorized as a puzzle game, and now it's tagged as a puzzle game, but don't trust that.\n\nIf you like brain teasers, really stay away from this. The game has a good presentation, but is overall frustrating. It doesn't require thinking to get by and many of its mechanics go against puzzle game fundamentals. For example:\n\nThere is a flawed gold/silver/bronze medal system for finishing levels with certain ammounts of energy remaining. Which gives the impression there is an optimal way to solve levels until LATER in the game you gain the ability to RECOVER energy and you can use that ability in levels BEFORE gaining that ability!\n\nYou can die, and you will, a lot, if you touch the creeps in stage, but then you respawn. You also gain the ability to kill them, but they also respawn. This is like an arcade game that doesn't work.\n\nOne of the "puzzle" features is that the pieces you have to rotate appear for 2 seconds on the screen then become "?" symbols until you pass energy through them. You can rotate the "?" symbols. Just so you know, it's 100% not possible to beat a level of this kind and get a gold medal without memorizing what you should rotate first, after a lot of restarts.\n\nNot a good puzzle game. Flawed mechanics. Frustrating. Would not recommend. If you want a connect the paths game, get Droplitz, it's a casual puzzle like Tetris and at not in the least frustrating.","June 21, 2014","false","2.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Initially, the puzzles are timed, so you must think relatively quickly to solve them, and you receive points based upon speed. Most of the puzzles require small thought during this part of the game. Later, the difficulty ratchets up to keyboard destroying frustration, as enemies infiltrate the puzzle board and move across it as fast or faster than you can control poor TOM. Then, the game introduces enemies that home in and seek you out, all the while your time runs out. With limited counterplay options, it becomes a race against your inevitable demise to solve a puzzle in your head by looking at the board while avoiding the AI, and then a question of dexterity to actually pull off the necessary movements without dying. A Virus Name TOM is a well designed hardcore puzzle/action game that became so frustrating to play that I uninstalled it. I would only recommend it to people who already hate themselves.","December 4, 2013","false","2.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SaxColonel/recommended/207650/","SaxColonel","The Nicolonel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SaxColonel/","415 products in account","One day it would be so great to go up to Hideo Kojima, the creator of the Metal Gear games and say to him about A Virus Named TOM, ''Sir, you have created a game that is both original and good. Sadly the parts that are good are not original and the parts that are original are not good.''\n\nHarsh? I don’t think so. A Virus Named TOM is a massively overrated game. Although it breaks new ground in it fantastic graphic and superb sound, its gameplay is often badly flawed and plotwise is almost laughable in its political naivety and Z-grade writing. But before we get started here is the obligatory information stuff that all reviews must contain by law in case you have never heard of this game before.\n\nA Virus Named TOM is a game that probably needs no introduction, but here is one anyway. It was released in 1999 by Konami on the Playstation and updated into three dimensions the adventures of Solid Snake a covert operative from the group Fox Hound. Previous adventures on the NES and MSX were fairly basic but innovative stealth action games were going in with all guns blazing was not the sensible option. The PlayStation incarnation saw Solid Snake being sent to a base in Alaska where former members of Fox Hound have taken control of a huge robot called Metal Gear Rex and its Snakes job to defeat them and return control of Rex. Unusually for such a console style game, it was also released for the PC a year later to a fairly muted reception.\n\nYou are supported by various helpful people via a radio in your ear called your Codec. This allows you to ask advice, gain info and save your game. Controls wise you action is viewed from a top down third person viewpoint that can be switched to first person (static) view for looking around in detail. Support items such as infrared goggles, cardboard boxes etc are kept on one side of the screen and weapons such as the Socom and Nikita on the other. One can be assigned to each and as you progress through the game you collect a fearsome arsenal. Each type of weapon is effective against certain Bosses, for example Sniper Wolf needs to be taken out with a sniper rifle, the Nikita Launcher needs to be used versus Liquid Snake and his helicopter. Your main tactic is to sneak about, sneaking everywhere is the key. You rarely need weapons unless you are in a boss battle. The elegant controls give you a wide range of crawling, sliding, ducking options.\n\nThe graphics and sound are beautiful on the lowly PlayStation, despite the colour palette being heavy on the greens and greys it was still a stunning achievement from the little grey box. Breath clouds in the cold. However the voice acting is still far superior to most of what has gone before or since. The plot forms a huge part of the game with long discussions and cut scenes cropping up at regular intervals. With its strong anti-war message the game is often preachy and unsubtle in it's ''fighting's bad mmkay'' proletising and considering the overall content of the game one of the rankest pieces of hypocrisy ever to be committed to any medium.\n\nSo what’s wrong then? Well lots. For a start, the much vaunted stealth aspects of the game are not as original as many would have you believe. the first NES games may have included stealth elements for the first time in gaming but the way they have been implemented in AVNT are much more reminiscent of N64 game Goldeneye and the superb ninja stealth game Tenchu. But whereas in those games enemies could spot you from a great distance and if a surveillance camera spied you, it was pretty much mission over, in AVNT its just plain dumb. For example if you are spotted by a camera or guard you only have to avoid them for about ten seconds before they get bored and go back to patrolling. EH??? And for some reason these genetically modified genome soldiers can only see ten feet in front of them. Stay out of range using your handy radar and you can run right in front of them and not be seen. Ridiculous.\n\nIn the same vein, the super bad bosses who are so much tougher than you, all seem to have very low IQs. They happily pause and show you a weak spot for you to hit, and as you spend four hours wearing their health down, they will refuse to change tactics, which is nice. Its also in a blatant attempt to make the game seem bigger, much backtracking to unlock doors early on in the game using key cards obtained later on. There are also some terrible attempts to introduce postmodernism into videogames. That means a cultural text that acknowledges it is a work of fiction by addressing the reader/viewer/player. In this case, its demanding you remove the controller in a boss fight, having Psycho Mantis read your memory card and Snake referring to the vibration of the controller to sooth his poor, sore arm. This struck me at the time as a rather odd thing to do, when so much of the game is supposedly geared to sucking you into its story. to suddenly bring you up short by yelling ''hey this is a game yah know!'' seems to be very strange and schizophrenic.\n\nWhere A Virus Named TOM tries to break new ground is via its storyline. It tries to present itself as quite radical in its condemnation of war, fighting and the effects on the human spirit. Yes, that’s very nice, but the constant whining of Solid Snake about how bad his lot is and how Meryl shouldn't want to be a solider is not great, just grating. Especially when you have a bajillion items to commit all kinds of murder in your possession and can strangle and break guards necks with your bare hands. Also by the end the plot seems have careered off at various bizarre tangents. What started out as an interesting tale about political intrigue and genetic experimentation has turned into some kind of idiotic farce. Every other person turns out to be a traitor, and the great threat turns out to be a big robot that can fire missiles off its shoulders or something equally stupid.\n\nPerhaps its worst fault is its moronic vision of global politics. The world we live in is not ever likely to be threatened by super enhanced terrorists using a giant robot to launch nukes. To even try and present it seriously (with footage from global conflicts and Hiroshima amongst others) is an affront. As we have always been shown, if terrorist want to hurt us they attack out basic freedoms by targeting our transport, leisure and centre's of commerce. What irritates the hell out of me about AVNT and the like is the stultifying effect it has on the minds of players who sink into a kind of apathy about world affairs, always assuming there is a quick and violent solution to the deep, protracted, long-term problems of this sick world we live in.\n\nA Virus Named TOM is a lovely game to look at and makes nice noises. But if you really listen to it and probe what its trying to say you’ll find its nothing more than primary school politics, with a moral message delivered with all the subtlety of a brick in the face. Its stealth-based gameplay is badly flawed and has been done better elsewhere, both before and since. Snake is possibly one of the most tediously self-centred “heroes” ever to appear in a videogame and to cap it all, the villain, Liquid Snake has an English accent(!). Oh Hideo, stick to the Mech games you obviously really want to be making, this Snake needs a mongoose to put it (and us) out of its misery.","February 19, 2015","false","3.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The puzzles do ramp up in difficulty with new blocks, and enemies that chase you as you try to complete the level, but the game truly isn't very enjoyable. This lies in the fact that unless you can immediately visualize the solution to a puzzle, you're going to be spending a long time using trial and error. The fact that you have drones chasing you down that can kill you, makes this trial and error proccess all the more painful. Once you eventually find out the solution, you're really just relieved that you're done. I was glad to be doen with the game, and all though the art and the music are nicely done, there are dozens of other puzzle games that are a lot more fun than this one.","December 5, 2013","true","29.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The concept works well on paper, but unfortunately the controls are a bit too loose.\n\nTom tends to fly about the playing field, which is great if you're trying to get away from an enemy, but you will likely find yourself losing a great many unintentional games of chicken.

The puzzles do ramp up in difficulty with new blocks, and enemies that chase you as you try to complete the level, but the game truly isn't very enjoyable. This lies in the fact that unless you can immediately visualize the solution to a puzzle, you're going to be spending a long time using trial and error. The fact that you have drones chasing you down that can kill you, makes this trial and error proccess all the more painful. Once you eventually find out the solution, you're really just relieved that you're done. I was glad to be doen with the game, and all though the art and the music are nicely done, there are dozens of other puzzle games that are a lot more fun than this one.","December 5, 2013","true","29.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I just couldn't, this game is too difficult and I just don't care enough to complete it, if I liked it more I could have finished it in maybe another hour or two, but sod it. I've seen all this has to offer anyway.\n\nThis game is good for a few reasons. The game is a unique and challenging puzzler with a entertaining story. Nevertheless, this is far from the best puzzler I've played in my opinion, but as I know this game holds true quality even though it's not for me, I have to recommend it. The game's gameplay is simple at first and quickly gets very challenging, the story is fun, the engine is good, world design is ok, level design is very very good but too difficult for people of my ability, the dialog is decent, AI is basic but all it needs to be, graphics are ok nothing special, and sound in game is all it needs to be. If you want a real challenge this game is for you, maybe look at some gameplay first to see if it appeals to you. I would just rather do something else with my time than suffer completing this game.\n\n8/15 "Good, but hard and not for me."","August 5, 2014","true","3.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Like most games it increases in difficulty as you continue on and reaches almost impossible difficulties. It is a test of your problem solving skills aswell as your reflexes because the time between being caught by the antivirus (and other twists to stop you) or moving into safety can be more instinct than skill. The only real complaint I can make about this game is that it seems to be built more for console or a controller rather than a PCs control scheme.

It's a flash game in disguise, you see.  It is pretty to look at, and funny to boot, but it's one of those "pipe" puzzlers that wants you to put the virus, in this case, into every section of piping on each level by spinning the differently-shaped pieces until they all light up.  It's that simple.  They throw some curve balls at you later, but there isn't much to the game but that.  It's cute and simple.  The music is very dubsteppy and electronic (as can be expected from a game where you play a computer virus), and gets very grating after a while.  I recommend listening to it quietly or not at all.  The visual components are actually very well done, and while the content of the story is a bit lackluster, the voice acting is very entertaining.  Not worth very much money, to be frank, but a nice little bonus on the end of my Humble Bundle.","May 23, 2014","true","12.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Most of the puzzles require you to think up some new mechanic or strategy to get through the gauntlet, and accordingly they give you that nice charge when you figure it out. I was stuck on one puzzle for awhile until I figured out that every instant-lose block had to be exactly the same amount of tiles away when I turned on the power. It was one of those situations where it seemed impossible until the light bulb went on, and then it was trivial. Not for the easily frustrated, but it's pretty short, it keeps leaderboards against all your steam friends (I should mention no one has gotten very far yet...), and the interstitials and art style are entertaining.

While the concept is a good foundation (a puzzle type game that has been done many times before), the additional mechanics that they add to the game turn it into a fast paced action game, making it less and less of a puzzle game, which is the reason I wanted to play it in the first place.\n\nAt first, it was enjoyable. The introduction of some mechanics such as the encryption and standard drones did not take away from the puzzle like feel to the game. However, the more you play, the less and less you're solving a puzzle and instead using quick reactions to avoid being killed every ten seconds by drones that move at an insane speed and literally swarm the level. The number of times I've reset levels because a drone killed me and I wanted to try and get a gold medal is beyond counting (I still wound up getting silvers).\n\nGood concept. Poor execution. The developer's intention to make the game unique by adding in loads of mechanics that were not used in other similar titles ultimately led to this game's downfall. If you like fast paced puzzle games, by all means give this a try. As far as I'm concerned, this game is just another way for me to get trading cards.\n\n5/10.","March 31, 2015","false","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's twitch-based puzzle solving... okay, I get that might not be my cup of tea, but it's the addition of silly mechanics like "you only get to see the level for two seconds and then you have to solve it blind, and then you can only glimpse the map every two minutes or so" that made me just put it down and relegate it to the pile of games owned only for trading cards. And then there are stupid mechanics like some levels just randomly punishing you by refusing to let you get your energy back to retry the level if you failed the first couple of times. Isn't part of the attraction of hard puzzle games the ability to fail, think about a new plan, try the new plan, and repeat? I have no idea why you'd introduce a mechanic where the game gets infinitely harder if you don't succeed at first.\n\nI really like the output of their art, writing, and sound teams, but I'm not impressed at all with the mechanics and gameplay.

The increase of the dificultiy of the puzzles went in a direction I wasn't fond of.  I liked the game in the begining but as I look back on it now, I'm disapointed I finished it.\n\nInstead of making puzzles that were more complicated or harder to figure out, I felt like they made puzzles that involved more reflex skills than anything else.  I don't think there is anything wrong with blending the action and puzzle genres but I just didn't think it worked well in this game and you should be aware that you will need to have good reflex skills to complete this game.\n\nThey also started to rely more and more on having "hidden tiles".  These are tiles that you can only tell what shape they are when they are powered.  These tiles only add a memorization element to the game.  To make it even worse, they add some puzzles where turning these tiles the wrong direction will immediately fail the level.   There is one level in particular that is filled with this behaviour.  Imagine 20-30 dark tiles that all have to be turned in the correct direction or else it is in an instant fail on the level.

While the concept is a good foundation (a puzzle type game that has been done many times before), the additional mechanics that they add to the game turn it into a fast paced action game, making it less and less of a puzzle game, which is the reason I wanted to play it in the first place.\n\nAt first, it was enjoyable. The introduction of some mechanics such as the encryption and standard drones did not take away from the puzzle like feel to the game. However, the more you play, the less and less you're solving a puzzle and instead using quick reactions to avoid being killed every ten seconds by drones that move at an insane speed and literally swarm the level. The number of times I've reset levels because a drone killed me and I wanted to try and get a gold medal is beyond counting (I still wound up getting silvers).\n\nGood concept. Poor execution. The developer's intention to make the game unique by adding in loads of mechanics that were not used in other similar titles ultimately led to this game's downfall. If you like fast paced puzzle games, by all means give this a try. As far as I'm concerned, this game is just another way for me to get trading cards.\n\n5/10.","March 31, 2015","false","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's twitch-based puzzle solving... okay, I get that might not be my cup of tea, but it's the addition of silly mechanics like "you only get to see the level for two seconds and then you have to solve it blind, and then you can only glimpse the map every two minutes or so" that made me just put it down and relegate it to the pile of games owned only for trading cards. And then there are stupid mechanics like some levels just randomly punishing you by refusing to let you get your energy back to retry the level if you failed the first couple of times. Isn't part of the attraction of hard puzzle games the ability to fail, think about a new plan, try the new plan, and repeat? I have no idea why you'd introduce a mechanic where the game gets infinitely harder if you don't succeed at first.\n\nI really like the output of their art, writing, and sound teams, but I'm not impressed at all with the mechanics and gameplay.

Most of the puzzles require you to think up some new mechanic or strategy to get through the gauntlet, and accordingly they give you that nice charge when you figure it out. I was stuck on one puzzle for awhile until I figured out that every instant-lose block had to be exactly the same amount of tiles away when I turned on the power. It was one of those situations where it seemed impossible until the light bulb went on, and then it was trivial. Not for the easily frustrated, but it's pretty short, it keeps leaderboards against all your steam friends (I should mention no one has gotten very far yet...), and the interstitials and art style are entertaining.

Clearly an inspired take on a well worn style of puzzler, A Virus Named TOM starts off with a lovely art deco bang that quickly loses steam as you progress. The whole set up--Dr. X, The City of Tomorrow, etc-- oozes charm, and there are plenty of variables and gimmicks introduced to keep things interesting.\n\nThe main issue with TOM lies at the very roots of design; instead of challenging you with complex and fascinating puzzles, TOM forces you to combat its own controls and obstacles while solving the base pipe puzzles, which, while initially engaging in the hecticness of the whole thing, suffers from an overload of obstacles while failing to make up for it with interesting overall design.\n\nIs the gameplay loop bad in any way? Not exactly. While I lost interest almost immediately, I can't deny that there is a certain draw to find the way through the chaotic mess of some of the harder levels. It's fleshed out in certain areas, yes, but I could never move past the sheer mediocrity of it all. There was heart here, and yet my interest waned the more complex it got. It's just not a fun time, at least not for me.\n\nWith all of the flaws to be had, I think there is a lot of talent to be had here. As this is a game from 2012, I can only imagine how far the Misfits have come. I don't doubt that their newer stuff has vastly improved, and look forward to playing them in the future. Nevertheless, VNT wasn't something I enjoyed past the aesthetics. Fun in concept, but in execution? Not so much. From the way Tom controlled to the constant feeling of 'this could be so much more,' A Virus Named TOM fails to impress. Give this one a pass, or at least wait until it's in a bundle or something.","February 10","false","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The music. The characters. The art. It takes place in a zany Jetsons-style futuristic city (think Fallout before the bombs hit). This game didn't actually need any of these but the dev chose to put them in all the same, and the game is better for it. It feels like a quality title.\n\nWhat I disliked:\nI generally don't mind difficult games, but this crossed the line into frustration one too many times. Later levels are patently ridiculous, with the player being expected to multi-task to a degree where there need to be simultaneously dropping Glitches (essentially land mines) to catch two bugs at once while trying to work out the orientation of hidden pipes WHILE trying to re-orientate the known pipes. You don't feel any satisfaction once you've done it because often you win by sheer luck.\n\nIt's a decent title. It's well-made. But there's a line between challenging and annoying and this game unfortunately has no idea where it is for the most of the time. By all means, get it in a sale and have a blast on your laptop when you're bored :)","June 9, 2015","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unfortunately, these additions end up making the game more frustrating than interesting.","May 24, 2015","false","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I can understand why some people don't like how fast you can move and the fact there's hazards. But I think that has more to do with expecting a puzzle getting a getting an action puzzle game. That being said there are many legitimate criticisms for example although the puzzles gradually add new mechanics and become more complex they add artificial difficulty through just adding a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of hazards. Which means it becomes more about surviving long enough to figure out the puzzle and get it done. It's one of the few games where the leaderboards are well handled and it can be addictive yet frustrating, I wish there was a sensitivity setting, despite that I wouldn't lower his speed if I could. The fast paced nature of this game is what makes it more exciting than a pipe minigame. lol.","January 22","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
