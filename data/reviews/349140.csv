I'm not usually an impulse buyer - as God is my witness, I'm a cheap 'n' nasty "sales ♥♥♥♥♥" if anything - but since I'm on holidays I found the opportunity to be one of the first reviews for a freshly-released horror game all too tempting, and this one looked intriguing and wasn't too bad a price, even at a mere 15% off.  Sold!  The first lesson here, boys and girls, is to properly read the Steam Store page, as what I foolishly assumed to be a "regular movement" kinda first-person game is in fact a point-and-click game, and if there's one genre I have ambivalent feelings towards, that'd be it.  Oh well.  The good news, however, is that even an adventure gaming dumb-dumb like myself can tell that this is one of the QUALITY specimens of its genre.\n\nFor the hour I've played thus far, it has all the hallmarks of a well-made horror point-and-clicker:  Nice visuals, spooky music, atmospheric sound...and, perhaps most importantly of all, a genuine air of MYSTERY.  Granted, Scratches started off similarly well, before steadily devolving into unnecessarily convoluted storytelling and even MORE convoluted "puzzle"-solving...but as far as I can tell, the puzzles in this one are super-logical and genuinely clever, though the downside to this is of course that UN-clever people like me have precisely ♥♥♥♥-all chance of getting anywhere in them without constant reference to a walkthrough.  But at least I could work SOME of it out without resorting to such cheating, and the bits which I couldn't made perfect sense once I'd looked them up.  Which is more than I can say for a LOT of "adventure" games I've attempted over the years...\n\nWhat I'm trying to say, in my typical long-winded fashion, is that if you're the type of person who can actually get their noggin 'round this kinda game, this is certainly shaping up to be one of the good'uns.  Me, I'm a university student at the moment, so I'm inclined to find my leisurely pleasures elsewhere for now, but if at some point in my future I feel like this kinda high-level cerebral challenge, I'll be sure to recall how this one actually impressed me, not least of all in the fact that I was able to make a teeny, tiny bit of progress before seeking out that much-needed help (hell, most point-and-click games I can't even seem to get past the first ROOM without a walkthrough, I'm that feckin' stoopid).\n\nVerdict: 8/10.","July 2, 2015","true","1.0"," 47 of 54 people (87%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","87","47","54","12","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrRokuro-san/recommended/349140/","MrRokuro-san","Mr. Businessman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrRokuro-san/","330 products in account","The overview A sheriff, a stranger, and Cold Winter Farm. Three words from the stranger, the only three words, and three months in the saying. An insufficient answer for why he was wandering the road in the outskirts of Deacon Oaks. Sheriff Truman wants – needs – more. Cold Winter Farm and its stately home beckons.\n\nA snowstorm, a tree fall. Trapped in a basement, a door is revealed. A door to a corridor. He can’t go back, so Sherriff Truman goes forward. What he finds he cannot have imagined.\n\nAnd so begins Corrosion, a self proclaimed “dark, shocking, and fear-charged mystery horror game”.\n\nThe underview A large part of Corrosion’s thrill is discovering what the hell is going on, with tantalising hints dropped in at a satisfying pace, leading you down that dark and terrifying path towards the inevitable truth. You’ll spend a lot of time hunting down keycards and codes to access locked areas of the lab. This does get a little repetitive, but the excitement of exploring a new area keeps you going - you’ll be dying to see what’s in next room, despite - or maybe because of - the potentially nasty things you may find.\n\nThe game is packed with journals and recordings, which fill in the story of Cold Winter Farm’s past and flesh out the characters. It’s a well-worn but trusty method of driving the narrative along, and pretty much the only option, as this is one of those games where you’re on your own 99% of the time. Of course, the occasional self-locking door and mysterious noise hints that there’s someone - or something - else inhabiting the labs, but to say any more would spoil the surprises.\n\nAside from tracking down keycards, you’ll have to solve the occasional brain-buster to progress through Corrosion’s plot. Puzzles are about 50/50 on logic and inventory ones and they tend to lean towards the brutal side in terms of difficulty. These aren’t brainteasers. These are migraine-inducing hard puzzles. There are moments where there isn’t a logical connection between where you are and where you need to go next. You’d expect a hint as to what to do next, perhaps one of those handy keycards for accessing another part of the lab, but three or four times I was left clueless. It was only after scouring the entire building that I discovered a previously locked door had been opened, with no warning at all. It’s a simple case of patiently covering old ground, but I could’ve done without it. With that being said, there’s a cool little maths conundrum, which I thoroughly enjoyed, and you’ll need to work out times and dates of specific events that occurred in the lab, then play back recordings using the handy security archive.\n\nIs it scary? After several hours of creeping through Cold Winter Farm’s eerie corridors, I sat back and considered the key question: is Corrosion actually scary? It’s surprisingly tough to answer. “Fear-charged” is probably an apt description. Psychological horror might be another. Things don’t go "boo", and I have already said it wasn’t frightening, in the scary sense of the word. But there is fear in the game, as an emotion expressed in a variety of ways. People who were here before you were clearly fearful, and some frightening things went on. After unlocking the door to the medical lab or morgue, I hesitated before plunging inside, for fear of what I'd stumble into. Some of the contraptions I saw, including a particularly memorable chair, definitely surprised or shocked. Those with weak stomachs will also balk at some of the diary and computer entries, while the sinister music gets under your skin and creeps you out. This understanding builds, and by the time you get to the chase, all the little parts – the music, the setting, the sounds – may well have come together to produce a tension waiting to be relieved. Or run away from.\n\nFinal thought Corrosion: Cold Winter Waiting isn’t an easy game, so it ended up being a good length, and it kept me engaged and wanting to play some more. It suited a lot of my preferences, and what didn’t appeal was outweighed by what did. In a way, the theme that revolves around this game reminds me of Exmortis. It's one of the better (if not my favorite) free horror/adventure point & click that available out there.","April 7","true","8.9"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","18","19","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/recommended/349140/","Humanure","Belphegore","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/","1597 products in account","While Corrosion: Cold Winter Waiting wasn't exactly what I had expected, it's one of the more decent horror inspired point and click titles on Steam.\n\nThe player will take on the role of Sheriff Alex Truman, who winds up getting trapped in an underground lab. Although the store page says a basement, it really is more of a lab; equipped with a morgue, sleeping quarters and many places for the player to explore. The story itself is solid, although for the first few hours of the game it will be shrouded in mystery. You will slowly unveil it as you progress, and the ending has a surprising turn that will leave you wondering.\n\nWhile there is really no linear way to play the game, in order to progress you will be required to trigger certain events by finding, crafting or viewing certain objects. I will go ahead and admit fully that I used a guide, and while doing so I still clocked in at almost 5 played hours. Without the use of a guide, this game could take upwards to 10 hours to complete, depending on your competence regarding hardened point and click adventures like Myst and Dark Fall. Make no mistake, this is no casual point and click.\n\nMy only gripe with Corrosion: Cold Winter Waiting is that it isn't grittier. There are very few sections that include blood or gore, and there is no horror to speak of. Sure, the story once you reveal it in its entirety is horrific, but quite honestly I would classify this title under suspense rather than horror. This isn't a huge issue though, as the story and gameplay are both compelling enough to hold the interest of the player. Once I started playing this and uncovering the truth of what happened, I couldn't put the game down.\n\nThe game is worth its asking price for any point and click fan; especially those who are looking to venture away from the current casual industry standard. If you can get it on sale, that's an even bigger bonus, but don't hold out for one... it's rare that a $10 point and click will last for more than two hours. With this game. you get a minimum of 4 hours if you're using a guide for $8.79 CAD.\n\nRating: 4.0/5.0 - Excellent, highly worth playing.Belphegore's Hell House Reviews (Group)","January 8","true","4.9"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","15","19","0","2"

I had to use a walkthrough to get through this game. Particularly very early on. With that said, Corrosion: Cold Winter Waiting is very much a game oozing with mystery and the unknown. You're trapped in the basement of an abandoned farm looking for clues. What you find, though, is conspiracy upon conspiracy and what amounts to supernatural forces at work. Or is what you experience just a figment of your imagination? I'm a fan of games that treat the player with more questions than answers by the time the credits roll and this one doesn't disapoint. I'd love to see more from Viperante. It's not a perfect first-person adventure game, but if you're a fan of horror and don't want jump scares, this one might be up your alley.","July 5, 2015","true","4.4"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","13","17","0","0"

The plot is quite extensive, and concludes pretty brilliantly.\n\nHated the movement though.It's easy to lose your bearings because of the angles they give you in each room. Sometimes you have to go "up", "left", "down", then "right" (or something like that) just before you can look at objects that are otherwise right in front of you! Because of this, it's easy to lose track of which way you're facing, and subsequently which direction you should go.\n\nSome of the puzzles also really sucked.As the game progresses, you acquire an extensive inventory. There were at least 3 different instances where I could think of other perfectly reasonable ways to solve the puzzle at hand by combining different inventory objects from what was required (e.g. Item A could be combined with Item B to give the same result, but the game insists that only Item B be combined with Item C for the solution, or something like that). And in many cases the solution required was ridiculous - you'd have to specifically know that you had to use those items, otherwise you'd never logically think of it.\n\nAnd the English was subpar.I kept seeing "there" being used instead of "they're", and other small but glaring linguistic errors. It got quite irritating to a point, especially when some of these errors were being made in things like in-game newspaper articles and official government docs, which one would expect to be impeccably written. The mistakes undermined the realism.\n\nBut ultimately, the engaging plot and incredible atmosphere made up for everything.To be honest, the game was far from impressive when I first started playing it. But then as I found out more (don't worry, this happens quickly) and the story started to unravel, things got pretty intense. Add to that the superbly effective music/sound/ambient noise + sleek graphics, and I was completely immersed.\n\nNot to mention, things do get pretty scary.It's rare to find an adventure game that effectively manages to convey a sense of urgency. Very often you can spend as much time as you like dawdling away at any location. Not with Corrosion though. There were a few times I felt a heart-pounding need to get out of one particular location as soon as possible, because it was so unnerving! And at a certain point in the game, there's even a chase scene - that sure got my adrenaline pumping alright!\n\nConclusionMoney well spent - in terms of conveying the desired mood, atmosphere and story, this game succeeds brilliantly. Puzzles, navigation & other game details may be less than perfect, but the overall gaming experience is still pretty awesome.","April 26","true","13.6"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","2"

Remember 'Dark Fall'? That's how they used to make games in 1990s - and that's how I like it :) No WASD, no real-time - just good old unhurried point-and-click.\n\n'Corrosion' is rather suspense and thriller than 'Horror' - there are (almost) no monsters, besides those you read about in journals and diaries. You spend the whole game inside, in dark underground rooms and corridors - some people could find the graphics outdated, but it does serve its purpose well.\n\nAs for the puzzles and gameplay - well, my impressions are rather mixed. The first real puzzle, that of figuring out the code to reset the computer system, was in fact the best math puzzle I have seen in years - great job! Too bad some others are not so good. And not so logical - for example, if you turn a power switch off, it is indeed logical to go several rooms back and to check whether that changed something with the working fans you saw before. But there are many points in game where one action leads to another event with no logical connection between them traceable: take this item here - and the door is unlocked far out there... So you have to go all the way back and to check if something has changed there. I have to confess I would probably not finish this game without a walkthrough - luckily, the one available for the 2012 edition works fine with the enhanced one.\n\nSo, despite some flaws, I would definitely recommend 'Corrosion' to all old-school adventure-game lovers!","July 25, 2015","true","7.7"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

The game is in a "slideshow" style and you navigate by clicking to move to different views. If you're not used to that type of game it might be a bit irritating that you have to sidle up to some items in just the right way to interact with them, and there's no free looking. You are going to be doing a LOT of clicking in this game. The game is set in a single location but it's surprisingly large, and you'll be doing a lot of backtracking as you acquire items and keys that can be used in previous areas. Additionally there's a puzzle involving a safe combination where you have to click once for every tick that the knob turns, which was kind of ridiculous.\n\nThe voice acting is passable. Nothing super memorable but not making you wish the game wasn't voiced at all. I was impressed to see afterward that the game only has two voice actors to cover 6 or so characters. There are only a few instances of voice acting in the game (from listening to recordings) and you will be doing a LOT of reading. The story was pretty well-written and I was interested until the end. (YMMV on the actual ending, which was kind of far-fetched and weird, but I liked it)\n\nThere aren't really any jump scares in this game and the story is much more of a "slow burn" horror where a lot of things are left to your imagination, which was very effective. If you don't like blood though this is probably not the game for you.\n\nMy chief complaint is really that you are going to be wandering around aimlessly a lot if you don't use a walkthrough, because some things happen at very specific times and there's no real indication that they happened aside from checking every room once you're not sure what to do. Some of the puzzles themselves are quite complex but overall they make sense and are enjoyable, but sometimes things just happen in a way that you as the player can't predict (eg. you read an article in one room and a door is unlocked in another room). Also there are a few sequences where you need to make 'internet searches' on computers in-game and if you don't use the exact phrase the dev intended then nothing will come up (eg. an article about a pharmaceutical company developing a new drug can be found by searching the name of the company but not by searching the name of the drug even though it's in the article)\n\nOverall though well-done, one of the better indie horror games on steam.","September 12, 2015","true","4.5"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

I kind of enjoyed the time I spent with this game, and found the story interesting at times. If nothing else, it inspired me with some story ideas for some tabletop horror games I run for my friends.\n\nBut in the end, a number of flaws keep me from recommending this:\n\n1. FIrst and totally foremost, this game has WAY TOO MUCH backtracking required to get anything done. There are several moments in the game where the only way to progress is to literally go room by room looking for anything at all that might have changed, without any clues as to what you're looking for or where. And outside of those specific moments, there are many more instances where you learn something new and have to once again run all the way back to one of two different separate computers to look things up (all done via very, very specific typing sequences, too). It feels like artificial time-padding, and didn't really maintain the suspense or tension.\n\n2. CONTROLS: The backtracking wouldn't be anywhere near as annoying if the game had functional keyboard controls to make moving around less tedious. But being restricted to arrow-only moving when the majority of movement in the game is "Forward, Back, Left, and Right" makes the entire back-tracking significantly more cumbersome. I've gotten used to mouse-based controls for many other games, but with this one, the lack of key controls really hurts it when so much movement-based back-tracking is required.\n\n3. STORY: As others have complained, the voice acting is pretty weak, and there are too many weird holes in the story. Certain characters are mentioned and then never followed up on, others too heavily contrast with their text, and others make no sense at all. And to top it all off, the game just... Ends. No clarity, no epilogue, no explanation, just... Game Over, Thanks for Playing, Watch Some Credits.\n\nUltimately I think the game could use a story overhaul, and some enhanced controls to mitigate the tedium of backtracking. WIth those in place, I'd likely change my recommendation.","April 25","false","4.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Now I know that some people love point and click horror games, but it just didn't feel right. Eh, mixed point on that. But then we get into the actual gameplay and hoo man.\n\nThe puzzles start off mildly complex and require you to flex your brain, and only get more intense from there. I won't outright say what they are, but one puzzle that comes aout.. a quarter of the way in, and serves as your introduction to what ends up being a core component of the gameplay, was rather absurdly difficult and nearly had me give up on the game then and there. I managed to perservere though, with the help of a walkthrough.... a walkthrough that was written back in 2012. Over three years ago. Welp. Seems like this didn't come out of nowehre after all, just out of nowhere to me.\n\nBut yes, the puzzles which had been slightly difficult before get more and more so, and end up requiring you to wander back and forth throughout the area of the game you've already explored, to find what has changed after you solve a pzzle. I wouldn't have minded this as much, if there had been clues on where you were supposed to go. There weren't.\n\nThen there's the fact that this walkthrough from three years ago exists. I don't mind that, but the edition available here is supposedly the 'enhanced edition'. Nothing at all had changed from the experience the walkthrough guide had, as all his solutions were the exact same in this game. Maybe the graphics updated or gameplay changed between the two version, but for nearly seven dollars, this game felt like a rip off.\n\n\nTL;DR: Point and click obtuse puzzler from years ago.

The story is set up to be a "recreation of true events," and you play as the sheriff of a small town who stumbles upon a secret laboratory far beneath a farm on the outskirts of a small town.  The game has a strong indie feel--and that just adds to its creepiness.\n\nCorrosion is a traditional point-and-click adventure game presented in the first person, in the style as classics like Myst.  The entire game takes place in one environment, a large underground lab.  Over the course of the game, you will explore this solitary environment, solve puzzles, and read journals of the labs former occupants.  As you do, you will slowly discover the lab's true purpose and the events that occurred prior to your arrival.\n\nGraphically, the game falls into the "indie" category.  And in that category, it looks good.  The environments are suitably creepy, and the game oozes atmosphere.\n\nThe game's music is fantastic and really sets the tone for the environment.\n\nWhere the game really shines, however, is its puzzles.  This is not an easy game.  In a modern industry plagued by simplicity, I found this to be a welcome change of pace.  While the puzzles are a challenge, they also make perfect sense.  The game's sense of progression is entirely logical, in a way I seldom see in adventures.  Every item that you use has a logical purpose.  Every step you must take toward the completion of the game makes sense, and the layout of the maze-like environment complements the steps you must take--you are never too far from where you need to go next.\n\nAs for the game's plot...well, I won't spoil anything here.  But I will say that it is incredibly dark, and things may not be quite what they first seem.  The story is well-written and has a nice psychological element that is missing in many horror games.  You won't experience any "jump moments," but I appreciate that, as I find those to be a cheap way of scaring the player.\n\nThe game isn't perfect, of course--no game is.  The interface is pretty bare-bones, the voice acting is somewhat amateurish at times, and the game lacks a climactic ending.  Despite these downsides, however, the game is still definitely worth playing.  For me, story is what matters most in games, and in that way, Corrosion succeeds wonderfully.\n\nOverall, I found Corrosion:  Cold Winter Waiting to be a fantastic and suitably creepy adventure.","March 1","true","6.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

You play as a sheriff who is investigating what happened to Cold Winter Farm. You get trapped by a snowstorm in a basement. You quickly discover that you’re in a secret underground lab, and so the adventure begins.\n\nThe game basically consists on you trying to find out what the hell happened there. You’ll get information through computer archives, the Internet, personal journals, etc. It mostly consists of lore: about what happened before, à la Dark Souls. The execution of this form of storytelling is absolutely phenomenal. You’ll be asking yourself lots of questions as you uncover more and more. “Who were these people? What were they trying to do? Why? Are they completely insane? Is this just another crazy cult, or are they onto something?” The questions in your head won’t stop bubbling up. The realistic tone works incredibly well, as you’ll be feeling like this place actually exists, as in you’re actually there trying to piece it all together. You’ll feel horrified, disgusted and appalled as you get a clearer picture about this organization, but that won’t stop you at all. The more you feed on information, the hungrier you’ll get for MORE. It pulls you in, and you can’t resist. You’ll feel like you HAVE to know exactly what the hell is going on. You’ll feel a bit disgusted with yourself as you realize that you’re actually enjoying the horror, dysfunction and suffering that you’re witnessing on these people. I personally couldn’t stop playing. I beat it in one single 9-hour-long sitting.\n\nAs you’re reading this, you’re probably thinking: “This game resembles a history class: You’re just reading facts about something that happened a while ago. You’re just a historian who is only feeding his curiosity on something that already concluded. You take no part on it, and you’re completely free of danger.” No worries, because that could not be further from the truth. You’ll get a constant feeling of dread, like you’re being watched at all times. Some events will happen that will make you wonder: “What was that? Did that door just close by itself? Is it automated, or is there someone else in this place? This thing was in a different position when I left this room…” The feeling greatly resembles what you feel when you’re reading a Lovecraft novel, or when you hear an odd noise at night: “Was it the wind, or is someone breaking into my house?” Of course, I’ll have to stop writing about this as I feel I’m about to tread onto spoilers…\n\nThe ambient music amplifies those feelings of dread greatly. I don’t have much to say about it, other than it fits perfectly with the game, and does an excellent job at pulling you into the game’s depressing world.\n\nAll in all, it’s a great Lovecraftian (sort of) horror story that deserves your attention. Seriously, why is this game not popular?\n\nAnyway, this is a game after all, so let’s talk a bit about the game aspects of it:\n\nControls\nThe way you interact with the world is pretty standard: The mouse pointer icon will indicate that you can click on something to interact with it. You click on the edges of the screen to navigate. You can pick up things that fill your inventory. You’ll sometimes need to combine certain items to progress. You also interact with computers by typing with your keyboard. One con about the game is that there are literally NO keyboard controls, except when you’re using computers.\n\nYou’ll have to use the mouse at all times. Navigating the world with WASD would have been a much appreciated option. Inventory hotkeys would have been nice, too. It’s a shame that the game wastes the chance to have the keyboard as an input option.\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay consists of you solving puzzles, basically. It’s a fairly open map, where you need to solve the next puzzle to unlock a door to progress to the next area, or similar stuff like that. Some puzzles were satisfyingly hard for me. I had a notepad to write stuff on at all times, and I also took pictures about relevant stuff for future reference. It was mentally stimulating. I think that the difficulty level was perfect.\n\nSadly, it has those “Monkey Island” moments, as I call them: Sometimes the solution to a puzzle won’t be intuitive at all. Sometimes you’ll need to do a crazy, unintuitive, oddly specific item combination to progress. Or sometimes you’ll have to input a REALLY specific set of data to a computer that you had no way of figuring out. I recall a time where you needed to input the exact time in which something happened: (Spoilers) When you need to see the recording in Cell 7 about the confrontation between Remelia and Sasha. The blog says it happened at 3:15, but she was actually referring to 3:15 PM. How the hell was I supposed to know that? If she said 3:15, then I’ll assume that she’s using the 24 hour format... Also, the date is 09-28-09, and, as I read in the guide, you’re supposed to know that because the tally mark in the cell is apparently of a different color than the rest. The problem is that I could barely see the difference in color, even AFTER reading the guide. I could just barely see it by getting my face 5 inches away from my monitor.. I had to use a guide for these segments.\n\nThe inventory interface isn’t too pretty. It gets really messy when you get a crap load of items, and navigating through them is a slow and sometimes frustrating process. The interface consists of one row of items that can be scrolled, one item at a time, with a timer that limits the scrolling speed (What I mean by that is that after you click the arrow to scroll, you have to wait a certain amount of time to scroll again. If you click again before that amount of time passes, nothing will happen). These might be engine limitations, I’m not sure. One idea would be to have 2 extra arrows that scroll one entire tab of items at a time. Or maybe displaying more than 1 row of items at a time. Of course, keyboard controls would have helped a lot here.\n\nThe movement isn’t smooth either, sometimes. At times, you’ll need to do something like 5 units of movement to get somewhere right beside you. But at 90% of the time, the movement feels just right. Again, I wouldn’t have any complaints about it if you could move with the keyboard.\n\nGraphics\nThe environments are breathtakingly realistic. They give a creepy, claustrophobic and gritty vibe, reminiscent of the Resident Evil pre-rendered backgrounds (The REAL Resident Evil’s (1 to 3, and especially REmaster). You really feel like you’re there. It’s really hard to believe for me that it was all made by one guy, as I understand it.\n\nFinal thoughts\nFor the people who are game developers (like me), or are just interested in the process, the game was made in the Wintermute Engine, and the beautiful and photorealistic environments were modelled and rendered in TrueSpace 6.6.\n\nThank you so much to Viperante for creating this amazing game! I Hope you get the recognition you deserve in your future projects (Maybe by investing a bit more in marketing ;)). The fact that this game isn’t popular is baffling to me. You inspire me a LOT as a game developer. I can’t wait to see your future projects.","May 18","true","9.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","1"

While it's not "scary" in the shaking-in-your-boots sense, it is atmospheric with all the creepiness that abandoned places are prone to.  People who like the Myst/Dark Fall static-slideshow style will likely really appreciate this game.\n\nVisually, the game does a great job of setting the mood, and the sounds/ambient noise only enhances it.  I didn't love the voice acting, but it wasn't horrendous and I tend to be overly critical of voiceovers (so what I think is sub-par might be fine to others).  My only real complaint was a strange font issue with captions and with areas needing screen input (i.e. the computers), but that could easily have been a setup error on my part and there's so little of it that it didn't impact the game in the slightest.\n\nThe story is very engaging, doing a good job of feeding scraps of information a bit at a time and ultimately letting the player lace them all together into a final plot.  It's open-ended enough that two players doing exactly the same playthrough might have different interpretations of what "actually" happened, and a player who didn't choose to look into side-information (i.e. using the computer to search a few things) might have a whole other interpretation as well.\n\nPersonally, I like stories that don't spoon-feed every detail, because I like doing some of the detective work and deducing myself.  If you like your stories to be clean cut with orderly chapters and a decisive ending, this might not appeal to you since you are definitely required to connect the dots yourself.\n\nThe ending is a little abrupt.  This isn't a bad thing, as you are expected to be left going "hmmmmm I wonder...." afterwards, and any further drawing-out of the story would be detrimental to that.  The game doesn't want to tie everything up for you with a little bow on top.  I think it works well.\n\nSo all in all, I was very pleased with this game and would recommend it especially to fans of the Dark Fall series and Myst series.","July 8, 2015","true","4.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mysterysquid/recommended/349140/","mysterysquid","mysterysquid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mysterysquid/","81 products in account","The Good:\n\nI really, really enjoyed the story of this game. It was engaging, mysterious, and very well put together. A lot of games like this leave lots of holes, or leave you completely hanging at the end so that you have no idea what was happening - but this game has a great pace of releasing information to you. You'll slowly understand more and more until, near the end, you realize the truth. And when you do, it's extremely satisfying. I genuinely enjoyed exploring every aspect of this world and learning about the game - and I think the story is much stronger than the average game. For this reason, I highly recommend playing this game.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nThe controls are completely wonky, especially at first when you're trying to get used to it. It's kind of hard to navigate and the interface is not exactly user friendly. As an example, there are rooms in which you have to move to the back and then return to the front on the other side in order to get to something by the door - which is a lot of clicks that really just shouldn't be there. It's very easy to become disoriented and confused in attempting to navigate, and some hidden objects are very finicky and require you to be on a certain exact spot in order to interact with them.\n\nThe Very Bad:\n\nThis game is impossible without a walkthrough. Like, the puzzles are completely absurd. There were at least 3 parts where the things you have to do and find are so ludicrous that I felt like I was building a Rube Goldberg machine. Honestly, the story is so good that getting through these is worth it. But I do recommend a walkthrough, which you'll end up using more often than not. I honestly have no idea how the walkthrough writers managed to figure this stuff out because there's simply no way you would know some of the things that the game expects you to know.\n\nFor example: entering precise phrases into a fake google search (including proper capitalization) without being prompted (maybe if I were psychic this wouldn't be a problem), clicking on a random screw hiding on a random table that doesn't even highlight when you hover over it, building contraptions that honestly don't really make sense and are unprompted, returning to random rooms and finding that something very small has changed, and solving very tedious puzzles that take more work than they're worth.\n\nI'm generally pretty good at these kinds of games and usually try very hard not to use a walkthrough, but this was the most ridiculously difficult one I've ever encountered.\n\n--\n\nAnyway, all in all I think the story is so good that the game is absolutely worth it. Just sit down with a walkthrough and don't hesitate to look things up if you get stuck. You probably won't figure it out alone, so no use fretting over it.","December 24, 2015","true","5.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

That's rare for me -- hell, I played World of Warcraft for seven years and I still couldn't tell you any of the silly backstory that Blizzard concocted.\n\nThe plot of the game is GENUINE psychological horror as you are charged with investigating just exactly what the hell happened at this facility.  I won't spoil the game for you by disclosing any of the story line.  Truly, I saw the twists coming but I didn't care, it was compelling and a wonderful distraction from life.\n\nThe game is short but the puzzles can be extremely complex.  Many solutions, though not intuitive given many of the mystery games you have played before, take some creative, out-of-the-box thinking.  In retrospect the solutions are pretty obvious if you pay attention and if you think about it.  But you'll have to concentrate and pay attention to details.\n\nGraphics are good, sounds are good -- I enjoyed the computer "interface" as you "connect" to the Net.  If you aren't a fan of point-and-click adventures you ain't gonna like the graphics or sound on this.  It's a product that does its engine, Wintermute, a great service.  Especially considering it's open source.\n\nReplay value is, obviously, low.  If you go back and read fiction novels two or three times, you might find yourself doing that with this game as well.  Who knows, in a couple of years I might want to experience the Cold Water experiment again.\n\nHeartily recommended, worth the time and the money.  One of the few times I've felt so positive about recommending a game.\n\nOkay, so one spoiler -- SPOILER ALERT (sort of):  If the government had just done their research they would have found that Milgram was already carrying out this kind of experiment.","December 31, 2015","true","5.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

There's a lot to praise and a lot to complain about.\n\nAudio & Video\nThe game has simple but sufficient graphics that suit its atmosphere well. Sound design and music is also fine. Voice acting is a bit problematic; the voice actors actually do not "act", they just read the lines.\nAlso, the game is locked at 1280x720. This may cause problems on certain displays.\n\nControls\nThis is interesting. Unlike classic third person adventure games this one plays in first person. And the way you move around reminds me of old-school dungeon crawlers - like Dungeon Master, you know? I'm not saying I want every other point&click game to play like this, but it was refreshing and it's one of the reasons I will remember this game.\nBut yes, the movement is a bit too clumsy. That's because you can only step forward and turn right or left. Having an option to sidestepping and walk backwards would definitely improve the control scheme.\n\nDifficulty\nThis difficulty is brutal. Tons of items, some entirely useless, others absolutely necessary but pretty easy to miss. Several times you need to enter a date or a search term into a computer - the dates are not that hard but the search terms? The documents mention hundreds of names, things, people or events. How the hell am I supposed to know what to search for? Or do I have to try everything?\nSometimes you need to build a rather complex contraption without any hints whatsoever. No item descriptions, no goals, no info on active spots, no reactions to correct/incorrect actions, nothing. The developer expects you to think exactly the same way as he does. Or to try everything on everything. Or use a walkthrough.\nI admit I'm not the most patient player in the world. But I've rarely spent so much time reading walkthroughs like I did in this game.\n\nStory\nThis is one of the highlights of the game. It's presented to you through many articles, notes and journals you find along the way. I don't want to spoil anything so I'm just going to say that it's a rich, well-written story that likes to play with your interpretation of the events.\nI really enjoyed it... except for the ending. What was that supposed to be? The game just ended suddenly, leaving many thing unexplained. Ok, it's not that bad as in other games, at least you have some understanding of what was going on, but it still feels unfinished.\n\nOverall, I can't say I had a lot of fun solving the puzzles, mostly because of their hardcore difficulty. But the mysterious atmosphere and the story are the reasons why I do not regret spending time with this game.","April 7","true","6.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Maybe not the greatest game ever, but it had an atmosphere and a good sense of the unknown about it, so hey. I could forgive having to click five times to get from a doorway to an object visible from the "doorway entrance" slide, but inaccessible unless you moved forward, turned right, moved forward, turned right, moved forward again. I could even forgive occasional forays into outright pixel-hunting (spoiler alert: the vent grate, after you remove it, is reduced to about 15 pixels at the very top of the frame). Whatever.\n\nThere was even a fun little math puzzle!\n\nBut then the puzzles veered into the illogical, nonsensical, and downright irritating.\n\nAt one point a random door suddenly unlocks when you view a certain completely unrelated event across the map - you have no way of knowing or reason to suspect that this particular door is now accessible. There's no in-universe "reason" for it. It just magically unlocked. Magical door-unlocking gremlins - oooOOooOOoOooOoooh, scarrRrrRrrRrrryyyy!\n\nOne particular puzzle requires following an insane series of left/right/straight directions along a map - switching between the directions and the map is a multi-click process. Screenshot ahoy.\n\nWhen looking through security camera footage at one point, you need to search for the "<place> #" camera - not "xx" (the in-universe room reference number when looking at a map of the entire facility) or "<place> 0#" (with a leading zero, as it's labelled on the in-game map). You also have to deduce that "hh:mm" is referring to 24-hour time notation, rather than the 12-hour time we're all used to, despite 12-hour time being used everywhere else in the game text. Because inputting the required fields is a cumbersome process (accompanied by a slight delay after each "guess"), trial-and-error at this point is not encouraged, and it's easy enough to put "Cell 07" instead of "Cell 7", get the standard "nope" result, assume that you were barking up the wrong tree, and wander around aimlessly wondering what clue you're missing.\n\nBut worst of all is the in-game Google.\n\nSee, there's an in-game computer with a "web search", but pretty much everything you enter returns zero results - the name of a central organization, the names of leading characters within that location's organization, hell, the name of the large city near which the game takes place returns "0 results". But you need to search for a particular place of business (mentioned in passing) into the web search and, huh, all of a sudden there's a result!\n\nThen - as if this wasn't enough! - you need to know to put a person's nickname - not their first name, not their last name, not their first name and last name and nickname, but just the nickname - into the web search so the computer will vomit up some more puzzle-solutions.\n\nLook, I respect that the game doesn't have a giant pink elephant holding a neon "TRY SEARCHING FOR THE NAME OF THE HOTEL!!" sign next to the computer that does web searches, and I understand the developer may not have the time or patience to create an entire exhaustive fake web history for every character, including social media accounts, press release mentions, their old high school site that mentions them by name in a photo caption, and of course the social media accounts / press releases / high schools of their facebook friends, but my capacity for trial-and-error is a finite resource, and seeing central themes within the game return the exact same "0 results" page does nothing to replenish that resource. A bit of backstory and filler text for major characters or concepts within the game-universe would go a long way to ensuring that, eventually, I'll feel compelled to put "Fargo Lane Hotel" into the search and advance the plot. Failing that, at the very least, have me find a memo where someone says "hey, I forgot the address of that hotel" and the other person writes "do your own web search" or something, because I've run numerous complex statistical analyses and it turns out that in the current state of affairs there's precisely a 0% chance of me ever deciding to type that into the search box.\n\nAnyway, my reward for finding a walkthrough and following the walkthrough to solve the above idiotic puzzle was a five-minute monologue delivered by a voice actress who honestly, truly sounds like she's trying extremely, incredibly hard to not sound wooden but unfortunately ends up sounding wooden AND mentally challenged instead, accompanied by buggy subtitles that occasionally glitched out ("<first line of text> <second line of text> <voiceover keeps playing, subtitles remain on the second line of text> <fourth line of text>") and hence kept me from just muting the bad voice actress.\n\nAt that point, it's Seinfeld wincing, putting his hands up, and getting out of his seat. The puzzles really are unsolvable without the walkthrough, and the game mechanics - the clicking, the pixel-sweeping, and of course the awful awful voice acting - only serve to detract from the plot. The sum enjoyment of "<game> + <walkthrough>" is less than "<walkthrough>", so I'll just close the game and continue reading the walkthrough.\n\nNot the worst point-and-click MystLike I've played (that award still goes to the stunningly awful "Real Horror Stories Ultimate Edition"), but not worth paying for either, and certainly not worth paying $8 for. Even at its lowest-ever sale price ($1.59 at the time of this review), it's probably a "meh", and if you're not into trading cards then that "meh" would be a "nah".

The atmospheric tension and building sense of dread reminded me of Scratches, but this has deeper gameplay and a more 'modern' horror slant.\n\nThe puzzles are nicely varied: classic inventory-based puzzles; usage of computer terminals for accessing records, emails, online searches, etc.; a security archive with audio recordings; a couple of math puzzles; a few very clever puzzles that combine multiple inventory items with the environment and sometimes even the computer systems (the use of the infra-red paint was probably my fave); and more.\n\nPlenty of save slots (yay!). No technical issues encountered (running Win 7). If you like old-school adventures, this is a challenging, engaging, and recommended title.","April 19","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Amnesia, Outlast, Dead Space, etc and found them to be mediocre, nothing like the original 90s classics like RE, Silent Hill and others which always had a unique way of making you terrified without constantly needing things to jump out at you.\n\nThis game brought me right back to the 90s, pure raw atmospheric storytelling, you have no Idea what is going on and it is scary as HELL, the story is very mysterious and many of the puzzles are challenging and require some thought and a pen and paper!\n\nI highly reccomend this game, it was an absolute love letter to the horror genre which has became too focused on jumpscares, overused Unity assets and YouTube reactions recently. My only complaint is that it would be nice to be able to change the resolution in-game, windowed mode had me occasionally minimising the game by accidentally clicking outside of the window while moving around, but this is a minor complaint.\n\nBuy it and you will NOT regret it!","June 4","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
