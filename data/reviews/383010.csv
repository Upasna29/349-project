You need to be focused and patient to finish levels in a reasonable time, but sometimes you'll think it through, you just want to finish the stage, the time will be the last thing to care :D You can adjust the size of yor marble to gain more speed or strenght.\n\nAs you see, this is a one-man project and I appriciate this motivation that makes this game more polished and enjoyable. If we get the Workshop support, this would be a great fun for a long time.","July 15, 2015","true","0.8"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","13","14","2","1"

It cites Marble Madness and Ballance as inspirations, and the easiest comparison is to the latest. It has almost the exact same gameplay style, uses very similar graphics and view, and uses a simple yet very dinamic core game mechanic, which is in this case changing the size and mass of the marble on the spot. Based on the trailer, after hours of gameplay I still haven't seen half of the game.\nI put together a quick pro/con list, but keep in mind that the game is still in Early Access, so all of the bellow can change in the future.\n\n+ PROS:\nVery challenging (might not be a good thing, but works for me)\nEasy to pick up and play\nConstant updates\nBugs are few and minor, mostly with the UI\nDev seems to actually be paying attention to what people say\nFast paced but gives you time to catch your breath\nHard challenges are always after a checkpoint, so you won't lose much progress\nSmooth controls\n\n- CONS:\nVery challenging (not everyone likes tougher challanges)\nSingle player\nEarly Access\nNo background, basic textures, simple graphic design\nStill has an alpha bug\nAfter a couple levels, challange difficulty becomes hectic\nNo soundtrack or sound effects yet\nNo linux compatibility\n\nA word on the puzzles. Sometimes it is hard to find the good solution, which is part of the fun for me, and the game mixes dexterity and wit based challenges in a very good ratio. Thats being said, sometimes the solution seems trivial, other times it feels like my brain is slowly spanked with a sack of lukewarm goat cheese.\n\nI think this review was probably about as much good than bad, but honestly, that's mostly just because I like to complain. The game is engaging, frantic, and frankly hard to put down. For $10 it's not cheap, but if you are a marble game fan you're getting a really good game. I've not even given half the levels a go yet, so I'm sure I will get my money's worth and some. With the promised features and additional levels and content likely to come, i likely to come, it's easy to recommend this game for it's hectic, challenging, and borderline mind-melting fun.\n","July 11, 2015","true","4.1"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","13","16","2","0"

The smallest ball can move on horizontal surfaces and the biggest ball can move bigger objects.\n\nIt has great physics, nice graphic and it's easy to control.\n\nCurrently it is in Early Access, so it's still missing some content, like sounds, music or the background, but with time it could become a great game.","July 15, 2015","true","0.1"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","0"

Neither you judge a game by the look.\n\nBehind this cover is a gem hidden.\nI just found myself playing and playing continuously without getting bored, because it gives a challenge. That is fun.\n\nHaving frequent updates and fixes, I see a lot of potential in this game.\n\nDo I recommend it?\nYes. Absolutely.","September 1, 2015","true","1.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

It's 90 percent of the way there, I feel like.\nBecause the levels are forced to be unlocked in a sequential order, at times you may be stuck repeating the same checkpoint a dozen times in a row before you're able to move on to the next. Version upgrades are adequate, you can see the game sprout and grow in front of your eyes. Can't wait to beat the next level.","July 15, 2015","true","23.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

JamG is trying to fill this gap and it is very prmising.\nThe levels are challanging ad does not hand anything to you on a plate. It is interesting that you can change the size of the ball and the physics and behaviour along with that, which gives you a lot of possibilities to work with.\n\nIt is still in alpha and you can feel it. Can't deny there are bugs and the look is definitelly not finallised.\nHowever the developer of the game listens carefully to every negative ad positive feedback to make the game better.\n\nThere is a long road ahead of this game until it is finished, but the essential gameplay is already there, and it smells like success if you are a fan of the genre :)","July 16, 2015","true","0.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

Built-in or store assets, minimal gameplay, no sounds and ridicolous price tag for it's current state.\n\nThough I have to admit the base idea is pretty neat, I have to emphasize it was a bad decision to post the game in it's current state. It's nowhere near enjoyable even by steam greenlight's standards. Give it another look in a few months if you enjoy games like this.","July 14, 2015","false","0.1"," 4 of 16 people (25%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","25","4","16","3","0"
