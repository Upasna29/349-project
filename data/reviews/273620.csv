For me personally, as-downloaded, my installation of Freespace 2 refused to run properly, but after installing FSO, it executes effortlessly.\n\nIn the space of a few minutes, you'll find yourself weaving between capital ships, trying to dodge flak, focus-fire on enemy capital weaponry to disarm them, and dog-fighting with customizable ships and loadouts.

I bought it back when it first came out, I bought it on Good Old Games and now I've bought it on Steam. Why? I'll tell you why - I believe it's the greatest game ever made.\n\nWhy this game is awesome and deserves your attention;\nThe original graphics were fantastic back at release in 1999.\nYou won't be using the original graphics when playing the game.\nThe story was - and still is - amazing. Far better than the usual tripe.\nThere's an excellent balance struck between you being an incredible pilot who saves thousands of lives, and you just being a dude in a one-person fighter who can't single-handedly save the day.\nYou play against both rebel humans, and a dark & insidious alien race.\nYour Shivan opponents don't have Star Trek-style translators. There's no communicating with them or understanding their objectives. They don't fight for territory and they don't act like humans on a different team. They're aliens - and both their ships and their tactics demonstrate that.\nAll too often, the strength of your enemies in games is inconsistent. They march into the beginning of the game with a roar, and then die with a whimper at the end. Or else you're handed a gimmicky win. This doesn't happen here - both your victories and your loses feel justified and fair.\nYou play a variety of roles. You scout hostile territory, battle enemy fighters, protect large capital ships from enemy bombers, destroy large capital ships as a bomber, neutralize the main weapons of enemy destroyers to give your side a fighting chance, protect innocent civillians in transport vessels, hunt down a traitor and more. Look, it's hard to give a comprehensive list while avoiding spoilers - y'know?\nThere's a huge variety of ships, primary weapons (lasers) and secondary weapons (typically missiles).\nThe community at hard-light.net are constantly creating new content by developing their own missions and campaigns - which you can do yourself - as well as enhancing the game engine, working on new models and textures, improving AI... and it's all yours for free!\nThe community at hard-light.net provide technical support for Freespace 2 Open.\nAdvice to those who buy it\nY'know what's better than playing a game 15 years old? Playing one with modern graphics!\n\nThe community at hard-light.net are regularly churning out improvements which make the game prettier, improve the AI, and expand the content available by creating their own missions and campaigns which you can play FOR FREE. New models, new textures, game engine enhancements, etc.\n\nRead this guide: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=271287997\n\nI was going to create one myself, but there's no point re-inventing the wheel.","February 10, 2015","true","303.1"," 61 of 63 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","61","63","0","0"

The game didn't run at first and gave the message: ""Freespace2/Fred2 cannot be run from a drive root directory!". After looking around and saw some crazy solutions finally came to this very simple steps (no need for you to edit anything just  click 3 times):\n\nA) Go to the directory that the game was installed in\nB) Go to the 'data' folder\nC) DOUBLE click on the file 'FS2.reg'\nD) Click 'Yes' When asked if you want 'Registry Editor' to make a system change\nE) Click 'Yes' When Registry Editor asks if you are sure you want that change\nF) Click 'OK' when Reg Edit says it's done\nG) Run the game and enjoy\n\nOK with that out of the way, one more point: you need a mouse (or preferred: a stick game controller). I was using the mouse tab from the laptop and then tried to navigate with the keystrokes and it is just too hard that way. You need to aim.\n\nThis is a 10+ year old game and I think the last great space simulation. Great game. You play a pilot and get promoted along the way until you are controlling your aircraft and giving instructions to wingman. Here are some highlights:\n\n+ A campaign well thought out. After a few missions you get involved in it. Feels like an epic campaign.\n+ Even through you are controlling your aircraft and giving missions to a few wingmen, you feel you are part of large battles. Lots of aircraft flying around.\n+ Great tutorials, which are made nicely as training missions needed to be completed to get promotions. Also tutorials are made throughout  the campaign. So you start with a few tutorials and latter on you do some more advanced ones.\n+ The game is easy to get into. Part of it is the tutorials and the level design very well done.\n+ Aircraft have multiple kinds of weapons, shields, you can call another aircraft to resupply you.\n+ High production values\n\nMinus points:\n- Graphics feel a bit outdated.\n- Need mouse or better stick controller.\n- There will never be a Fresspace 3 :(","August 9, 2014","true","15.7"," 55 of 60 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","55","60","0","0"

It is the game that defined the genre and set the standard for all games of it's type for the future.\nYou play the role of a Terran (human) fighter pilot fighting against a seperatist Terran faction when the doom bringing alien race, defeated in the first game (which was equally good) known as the Shivans appear and threaten the Terrans and Vasudans (old enemy turned allies).\nThe gameplay is dynamic and the missions diverse in objective, from dogfighting avast array of fighters, to bombing capital ships or going undercover on special missions. The graphics are more than decent for a game of it's era and the physics are superb.\nI would recomend using a mouse/keyboard for gameplay rather than a joystick or gamepad, because space goes in all directions and relying on a joystick can get confusing sometimes.","June 6, 2014","true","0.1"," 100 of 134 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","100","134","0","7"

After several years of hoping this game would appear on Steam (My physical copy is getting old), it finally made it and I got it and the first game in a heartbeat. The game is the best space-flight combat simulator that I have ever played. Rich with its own lore and story, Freespace 2 has much to offer. Two different storylines (The main campaign and the Hammer of Light) are available right off the bat to get you started. The main campaign gives you an in-depth tutorial on how to play (I play with the keyboard because I think it is easier) and it has joystick combatability.\n\nAnother nice thing about this game is the amount of support it has from its fanbase. Freespace Open is a mod that updates the graphics to a more modern equivalent and it opens you up to different mods that include Battlestar Galactica, Wing Commander, and there's even a Star Wars mod.\n\nIn conclusion, I must recommend this game to everyone who sees it. There were some problems with the launch of this game on Steam, but if you are using Freespace Open and follow one of the guides, you will no problem getting this game correctly instaled.\n\n9.5/10","October 10, 2014","true","22.0"," 31 of 39 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","31","39","0","0"

It's combination of exceptional storytelling, insanely satisfying combat and the best control scheme and H.U.D. around still make it the pinnacle of the genre. Whether you're escorting a convoy, flying undercover or destroying a Shivan cruiser, you're in for an amazing thrill-ride.

Thanks to the Source Code Project, you'll not only have access to updated graphics, but new missions, campaigns, and mods that extend the Freespace universe and help create new universes as well. This engine also powers the total conversions for the Wing Commander-based Saga and Battlestar Galactica-based Diaspora games as well.\n\nSo with Freespace 2, you're not just buying one game, you're purchasing a portal into years of fan-based work and content that goes well beyond the amazing base game.

Remember, when Wal-Mart still had PC games? One of my friends had been raving about it, and he was a pretty big nerd, so I figured I'd give it a try. I didn't expect much from a game released the same year as StarCraft, but it was only $10 so what the hell? I took it home, popped it into the CD drive of my 200MHz Pentium MMX machine with 32MB of RAM and a video card with 4MB of memory...\n\nAND WAS BLOWN AWAY.

Find it through Google and bring this classic, masterpiece of a game to the modern day.\n\nI will go on record and say it: Freespace 2 is the best space flight sim ever made. It has never been beaten and no game has ever really come close to matching the high-octane action and depth of control gameplay, nor have they ever matched the amazing sense of scale (Freespace 2 truly gives you large capital ships and swarms of fighters), nor have they ever beaten Freespace 2's incredibly atmospheric and surprisingly deep story of apocalyptic hubris. It is a game I have kept on my hard drive since first playing it in 2000.\n\nThe voice acting is solid and understated, befitting the professional military nature of the story. The music fits. The gameplay is fast-paced with missions ranging from dogfights to blockades to covering capital ships as they duke it out with beam cannons, flak batteries and torpedoes. No space sim has come close.\n\nThe fan community has kept the game alive for the past decade. So, while there is no final conclusion to the Freespace saga, many talented individuals have turned out many professional campaigns and mods. There are even huge projects for popular series like Battlestar Galactica, Babylon 5, Star Wars and Wing Commander. If this reviewer may make a recommendation, when you finish FS2, move onto the Blue Planet campaigns for a thrilling possible take on Freespace 3.\n\nThe best space sim ever made. 10/10.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zingmars/recommended/273620/","zingmars","zingmars","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zingmars/","667 products in account","As other reviews have mentioned - this copy of the game is a crappy one. At minimum you need to set up a registry fix (which on the top of the store page, though it might've not been there then), however you'll most likely end up modding your game with FreeSpace Open which, thankfully, has a really easy to use installer. After installation you can rename fs2_open_<version>.exe to FS2.exe to play the game (I only realised that after playing it for a while, so Steam didn't even track my game time :( ). You can also use FS2 Open to play the original campaign using the second game's engine, and as far as I saw, you don't even need to own the first game for that (not sure how that works out for them legally).\n\nAs far as the game goes - it's a classic space combat sim that I still consider being the best in it's genre. Other games (read - X series, Evochron Mercenary, SpaceForce and whatnot) are great and all, but they're more about the economics aspect, while games that do try to be like Freespace (most recent one being Strike Suit Zero/Infinity) don't really come close to the way this game handles, although I'm still not sure how turning off your engines can cause you to go to full stop in space. With FreeSpace2 open the game's graphics aren't all that shabby either.\n\nAs far as the gameplay goes, there's nothing more to this game than flying in space, infiltrating behind enemy lines, escorting stuff and shooting stuff. In space. It's harder than you might think, as there is no right side up. If you don't think killing stuff in space is exciting, then this game might not be for you. There is multiplayer, but it's a bit tricky to set up since you need to use, you guessed it, FS2 Open to make it work, as the original implementation is kinda ancient and doesn't really work well. There is also a modding community that makes campaigns that try to extend both this universe and various other sci-fi universes. Also, this game did Reapers before Mass Effect ever did.\n\nSo do I recommend it? The game - yes, definitely. The steam release - not so much. Go get it on GoG instead as it seems to be the better version of the game.","March 15, 2015","true","8.7"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

Decades after the war that lost both race's home worlds, the new Galactic Theran-Vasudan Alliance is rebuilding its forces, up until the the discovery of an extremely ancient Jump Node, and the return of the Shivans.\n\nPros: There is little to say besides it is everything you liked about Descent: FreeSpace - The Great War. The engine was improved, both in terms of resolution, interface and control, and those improvement match in terms of in-game technological advancement of shield, firepower, and options. The story, once again told to an anonymous pilot recruit through mission briefings and in-game events, picks up some time after the previous game and digs deeper into the lore and origins of the mysterious Shivans, and includes multiple winks to missions from the first game. Control are just as pitch-perfect as they used to be, assuming you play in keyboard-only mode (early 90s style: no mouse).\n\nCons: Same flaws as the previous game: no exploration, little branching paths, ugly aged graphics (even with the better resolution). "More of the same" is accurate, as there is little innovation over the gameplay or game itself when compared to its predecessor. The game wasn't correctly ported to Steam and requires a manual intervention before working (luckily, it's an easy process well documented in forums).\n\nVerdict: ★★★☆☆ - It's up to you\n\nBy today's standard, this game could have been an expansion pack rather than a sequel. If you didn't like Descent: FreeSpace - The Great War, there is no reason to even consider this one. But if you did like the previous one, you'll like FreeSpace 2 just as much!\n\n—————————————————————————\nThis was just my opinion.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.","June 1, 2015","true","32.6"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","10","18","0","0"

The AI in this game does not suck and can excel at dispatching your teammates and you if you are not careful and the same can be said about your own teammates, although they will sometimes need a helping hand when an enemy gets behind them and will inform you of the same thing.\n\nThe guns and missiles that you will unlock as you progress through the game will allow the adding (if the ship allows it)  of individual guns into slots to complement eachother such as a gun with good hull damage but not very good shielding damage with a gun with the opposite properties. Missiles range from lock ons, fire and forget and dumb fire and are useful in quickly taking down enemies or turrets.\n\nThe line up of ships vary from space superiority fighters, intercepters, heavy fighters and bombers and in most cases have multiple versions of the types with differing armoring, speeds, manoverability and gun and missile (and differing amounts of the same missiles you can carry) slots.\n\nThe actual playing of the game is smooth and other than a few hiccups in framerate runs incredibly well and the fights can become challenging and exciting for the player with the right difficulty, the HUD on your screen will keep you up to date with monitoring crucial ships to protect and constant tracking of any ship that you can target.\n\nThe joystick is a very effective tool for this game as with the mouse i found that the fighter would zoom of my screen  (thank god for the display that shows up at the edge of the screen to tell me where to turn)  and i would have to swipe the mouse a few time in the direction i wanted to go before I had visual contact again but unlike the mouse i found myself overshooting the target lead multiple times with the joystick but thats probably because i'm bad at using it.\n\nThe game also has a mission editor called FRED2 that I personally enjoyed playing around with but requires a understand of how the coding in the engine works, for example the corvettes will not fire their main lazers until you give them the ability to by going into the events editor and enabling it there by replacing the operators of the event I made for it, despite that you can change the name of the ships in this program and had fun giving them wacky names.\n\nOverall the game is impressive and is highly entertaining. The only negatives i have for this game is that:\n1. I bought this a day before the special  (thanks steam)  and;\n2. once during a mission a prompt in the coding did not activate as it should and i flew around for a few minutes while nothing happened before deciding to reset which fixed the problem the second time around.\n3. Resolution...but that's just nitpicking at an old game.\nBut other than that i could not give a higher recommendation for anyone to at least pick up the game for a little bit to play through.","May 3","true","0.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This may be the greatest game in the history of the world, but as of today, I still wouldn't know. You almost need to have a modding Ph.D. to get it working the way you want.\n\nSame day edit :: Finally got game to work on old Vista laptop by following the directions in the link below (which require another off-site download and some file management). I admit that when I purchased this game from Steam a year ago, I never expected I would encounter these sorts of difficulties. This is definitely not gaming "straight out of the box." However, I offer sincere thanks to Lyonide for authoring the message found in the link below.\n---\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/273620/discussions/0/540744475152850046/\n---\n\n08-15-14 :: After using the registry fix found on the Steam store page, I can now launch the game and play it on my 64-bit Windows 8 machine.\n\n06-09-14 :: Game will not launch. When launching from Steam, you'll get the following message: "Freespace2/Fred2 cannot be run from a drive root directory." I purchased the game with good faith under the expectation that it would work correctly using the Steam interface, but this is clearly not the case. My recommendation is that no one should purchase a game that does not work.","June 9, 2014","false","0.5"," 33 of 72 people (46%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","46","33","72","3","2"

So in conclusion, no don't buy this if you are after something good, buy this for the "old game" feel.","October 29, 2014","false","1.1"," 5 of 53 people (9%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","9","5","53","3","0"
