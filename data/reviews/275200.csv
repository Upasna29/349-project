"http://steamcommunity.com/id/misspauling/recommended/275200/","misspauling","Cade","http://steamcommunity.com/id/misspauling/","586 products in account","A love letter in many ways to classic Western movies and classic games, Westerado: Double Barreled starts with a familiar premise: your family has (spoilers for the first 30 seconds of the game) been murdered. Your ranch has been burned down. With nothing but the hat on your head, the shirt on your back, and the revolver in your holster, you set out on a quest for vengeance.\n\nAnd then the game basically turns you loose on a sandbox Western action-RPG and lets you do whatever the hell you want.  Sure, you're supposed to find your family's killer and enact your revenge, but let's be honest: there's a lot more to do in Westerado, and you'd be foolish to simply skip through the main storyline and be done. Most people will probably do the same quests first: helping a concerned wife bring her drunk husband home, clearing out a graveyard of bandits, etc.\n\nThe quest design at first seems pretty straightforward, but there's actually a great deal of freedom here. As far as I can tell, literally every single NPC in the game can be killed, which can be a boon during certain quests whose other option for completion is a hefty amount of money. In one notable mid-game quest, a local Indian chief tasks you with freeing buffalo from ranches. I did so with a blend of violence and not-giving-a-damn and wound up finishing with the blood of a few ranchers on my hands but the satisfaction of herds of bison now roaming free.\nUpon attempting to finish another quest, however, I learned that this quest was now failed because the woman who gave it to me was angry at me for killing one of the ranchers. It's this inter-connectivity that makes the quests interesting, and as the game goes on the quests get bigger and more important.\n\nIn my favorite questline, you're tasked with trying to bring peace between said Indian chief's tribe and a local militia. I don't know how much else I could've done, but let's just say it didn't go well. In my story, I ended up heling the tribe wipe out the fort and take it over. I was then given the option to continue this questline and help them take over the nearby city, a task I attempted but then failed at. Upon reloading, I reckoned I wasn't sure I wanted to kill every shopkeeper and innocent civilian, so I moved on and hoped the Indian tribe would stay in the fort and not murder everyone. To be fair, it WAS the militia chief's fault for pulling a gun during peace talks, but still.\n\nThe main questline is unique in one feature, however: for most of the bigger quests, completing them gives you a detail about the murderer. As far as I can tell, the murderer's identity is randomized fully, so it's not the same game for anyone. In mine, I learned that he had a medium-brimmed hat, then learned it was a ten gallon, then that he wore blue, etc. until I had a reasonable picture of him. It's a satisfying way of tying sidequests to main storyline, but it's important to note that you can confront ALMOST ANYONE in the game through dialogue. I think if you got lucky you could confront the murderer right away if you happened to find him.\n\nWith all this talk of systems and RPG mechanics, I want to make one thing clear: this package wouldn't work if the core gameplay wasn't top notch. Fortunately for everyone, it is. To fire a shot you have to unholster your gun with a button, then press a button to ♥♥♥♥ it and the same button again to fire. This methodical, three-step process every time you want to shoot something feels good, and it can lead to stressful moments in firefights with more than one enemy. Reloading is a similar process of hitting the reload button once per bullet, so to fully reload you have to mash R like a madman to put your six shots back in your revolver.\n\nThat said, is the combat itself any good? The answer is yes. Westerado's health system boils down to you having up to three hats: each hat is an extra life point. Get shot with no hat, and you die and are returned to a respawn point, half your money gone. The upside of this is that each enemy is the same; shoot an enemy and his hat flies off. At this point, sometimes he'll surrender, but other times he'll keep on firing. Shoot him again to put him in the ground.\n\nOccasionally, one shot will kill an enemy who's wearing a hat, but I couldn't figure out consistency on this: whether it was where I aimed, some sort of critical hit system, or what. Sometimes the hats from dead enemies fall on the ground, and you can quickly pick them up to restore hat-health (to your maximum of three). It's a fun and lethal system that feels close to the likes of Hotline Miami or other fast-paced, everyone-has-low-health games.\n\nThough you start off with only one revolver, eventually you can buy other guns, including a shotgun, dual revolvers, or a rifle. I only purchased the rifle, and it was a great upgrade; though slower-firing, it could pierce through enemies and offered a wider view of areas.\n\nI'm running rapidly out of room, but I'll spare a few sentences for aesthetic and aural notes. The artstyle of the game is a beautiful mix of spritework that doesn't adhere specifically to any sort of artificial old-school hardware limitation; because of this, color abounds and there's a lot of variety. The characters all sport a lo-fi charm, and the animals are both cute and occasionally deadly.\nBodies remain where they've fallen, so it can be fun to walk through a location you've cleared of enemies and look upon their fallen remains as vultures fly in to scavenge their corpses. It sounds morbid, but the cheerful cartoon artstyle doesn't make you feel bad for your enemies as their bones are picked clean.\n\nOn the sound front, the music in this game is sublime. Harmonicas carry the main weight here, evoking a Western feel that makes you want to strap on some spurs and spit into a jar. (Editor's Note: Cade does not support spitoon usage and urges people to find other pastimes less harmful) The music changes crazily when it's fighting time, pumping you up to pump lead.\nOnce the last enemy is killed, a triumphant trill lets you know you've lived one more battle. It's well-done and exciting each time.\n\nWesterado is a fantastic game that blends action and player choice, and I've tried to keep spoilers to a minimum. At one point, I wandered off the map through a tiny, not-really-visible path, and found a crazy area that made me at once intrigued and amused.\n\nThe writing in the game, while sparse, is charming and interesting, and keeps you wanting to solve mysteries, get in gunfights, and help out townsfolk. While the normal price and even the sale price is a bit steep, there's nothing like Westerado out there and there appears to be considerable replay value (the randomized murderer, extra player characters with their own motivations, hidden boss fights, etc.).\n\nThough the lo-fi aesthetic may initially appear to be just one of many, the unique touches and captivating gameplay elevates Westerado above the rest in the indie scene. Though the game's length is short (I finished the main story with the first character in roughly two hours), it's well-paced and I didn't do anywhere near everything.\n\nHighly recommended, though perhaps waiting for a sale is the best option; for non-completionists and speedier gamers, you may come away disappointed at the relatively short length.","April 17, 2015","true","2.3"," 234 of 247 people (95%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","95","234","247","13","11"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/275200/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","Westerado: Double Barreled is an open world set in western times, released in April 2015. You take on the role of a gunslinger who is tasked with hunting down his families killer.\n\nThe way in which you complete this task differs from other games in my view; you have to find clues about the identity of the culprit by completing missions and objectives for locals around the towns. This really adds to the mystery behind the killer. Even the options menu has a screen dedicated to showing you all the clues you have found along with a model of a character showing the clues on, such as a "fat, blue shirt, medium sized hat" figure for example.  These clues are all randomly generated each playthrough as well.\n\nAnother really new feature in Westerado is the that you can draw your gun at anytime, even during a conversion with any NPC, this can sometimes trigger a different set of dialogue, initiate a new quest, or just go completely wrong and end up in a gun fight. This also means you can kill anyone in the story too, no matter how important they are to the plot, anyone can die.\n\nThe main gameplay is a top down action game, in good old western style, you have your gun which you have to manually reload every six shots, or you can upgrade it to a big ol shotgun. The gunfights can sometimes feel a little bit clunky, but once you get used to the controls and how the game responds to them, it soon becomes clear and easily executed.  Another one of my favorite parts of the game would be the buffalo scenes; riding horse back defending carriages from bandits on a buffalo's, although simple, it is really compelling to play.\n\nWesterado has a very clever story, and has all the main plot points that any good western film will have in it. Although you can make the story different each time you play, for instance just killing one of the main quest givers, I am not sure it actually changes the whole outcome of the game, I think all that will happen is you'll just miss out on those quests rather it have an effect on the grand scheme of things.\n\nThe world in which you play in is huge, it's set out like a very Zelda style map, each tile on the map has four entry points, north, west, south and east. This makes navigating across the map very easy and you can always make your way to where you need to be very quickly. Each of the zones look amazing too; lots of detail has gone into adding plenty of objects, background items and scenery to add to the western feel. Although the graphics are the ever growing popular, pixelated style, it still has a really nice look to it.\n\nLength wise, Westerado can be over and done with in less than an hour if you just do the main story, which is actually what I did on my first playthrough. However it is highly recommended that you don't just do that, as you are missing out on tons of content in the side missions, along with loads of story too. There is so much to see in Westerado if you just take the time to explore.\n\nObviously there are no technical problems that I ran into, as this game is actually based on a Flash game, so it will run on anything - only thing is that it runs at 30fps (which you may or may not notice in this type of game).\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Only recommended when on sale\n3) Recommended\n4) Highly recommended\n5) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Arrgeron/recommended/275200/","Arrgeron","Morse","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Arrgeron/","602 products in account","Westerado: Double Barreled is a top down, open world shooter where you play as a man who (light spoiler)  has his family murdered by a random desperado  in this western world. The thing I love about this game is its open world nature, and your ability to kill anyone at any point. This ads a lot of variety to an already varied world with lots of things to do. You can do bounty quests, kill random people for money, and even play a few(or many) hands of poker. The world is so varied, and has a vast array of side quests. It reminds me of something like Morrowind, where you can kill any character at any time and it can impact your story. To show an example of some variety, I'm going to tell part of my adventure in the next paragraph. It will contain some spoilers, jump ahead to the next paragraph if you wish to avoid them\n\nSpoiler Warning I was doing some side quests to try and find more information about my killer. Your killer is randomized, which is one of the cool things about this game. You can't just memorize the details of the killer and do it every time, it will be different each time. Anyway, I'm told by the banker to find the ranchers and get the money he needs to pay off the Oil Tycoon man. So I go to each of them, and I end up slaughtering all of the ranchers. I had no idea what this would do. There are several quests that ask you to get help from the ranchers, or even recruit them. I had to skip these parts, or simply fail the quest because they were already dead. I decided that this was all the Oil Tycoon mans fault, so I decided to pay him a visit after acquiring a rifle. which is in my opinion the best weapon in the game(that I've found). I slaughter his men and him as well, and steal his stash of money. Feeling well rewarded, I return to the bank to find the Bank owner now wants nothing to do with me, I think because I killed the ranchers. This would have went very differently depending on my choices.\nSpoiler end\n\nBased on that story, you can see how many different paths you can take. If you skipped it based on spoilers, just trust me, it is a world were your choice matters. Another great element is the ability to pull out your gun in the middle of any conversation, making dialogue very interesting. Westerado is a great game for those on a budget looking for an open world that rivals any AAA game.\n\nPros:\n-Strongly woven together open world\n-Multiple side quests and other things to do\n-Choices with NPC's matter\n-Several different hats with different functions\n-Optional fast travel(works similar to Morrowind)\n-Guns for different situations\n-Variety in the environment\n-Randomized bounty hunter missions\n\nCons:\n-Main story is very short if you find your killer quickly enough\n-Some bugs, One of them required me to quit and restart from an earlier autosave\n-Pixel graphics can occasionally(not often) make it hard to see your bounty target.\n\nWait For A Sale","May 11, 2015","true","5.7"," 59 of 63 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","59","63","3","1"

Very western thing indeed!\nThe way you search for the villain is pretty much up to you. You can just kill each in every person on your way until you find the bad guy. Or you can go around and ask people if they saw anything. Some will tell you small bits just because they hate the guy, other will ask you for a favour in exchange for this info. Then you’ll know that he was tall, was wearing green bandana, black trousers and red jacket. Main villain looks are actually randomized every time you start a game, so there’s a bit of replayability involved.\nIf you just do the main quest and decide to find and kill the guy - you can make it in ~2h. But most of the cool stuff happens as side-quests, those small favours people ask you about.\nAnd it’s not just some linear stuff about bringing thing from point A to point B, there are actually factions in here. And you have to decide who you want to help - would it be indians, military, oil tycoon or fellow ranchers?\nIn addition to quests, you can grab wanted posters from sheriff and try to find the bad guys to get some bounty. Money can be spent on cloth which is purely visual. And guns which vary the way you need to act in combat.\nSpeaking about combat - it’s pretty simple. You have one button to draw (or sheath) a gun and second button to ♥♥♥♥ and then shoot that gun. Bullets fly only left or right and you cannot move while shooting. So you’ll have to run around quite a lot to evade enemy bullets and to place yours correctly.\nThe game plays quite well with gamepad, a bit less so with keyboard (at least to my liking). And since the game’s made using Flash, you can play it on pretty much any hardware.\nOverall it’s pretty fun experience for a good price.\n\nDownsides right now:\n- Not too much replayability (all the quests and the world are same on every start, just the villain has different cloth)\n- If you do main quest, it takes just about 2h\n- No key rebinding and a pretty strange default binds (works better with gamepad IMO)\n\nYou can watch a bit more in-depth look at the game here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlkJx2ub6l0\n","April 19, 2015","true","1.8"," 24 of 27 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","24","27","2","7"

There is three lives to live, and when you run out of those, story starts over from an earlier save point.\n\nThe soundtrack fits the world, and the graphics couldn't look more awesome with a touch of a retro pixelrated style.\nThere is also also a gamepad support allready built in ( i was using xbox360 one).\n\nIf you like adventures and wildwest, this game is a muss to have.

That's why I naturally gravitated towards Westerado, because from the looks of it - and having briefly played the original Flash version on the Adult Swim website - it seemed like it checks all the points of the grand list of Western clichés. And that's an entirely good thing.\n\nAs is typical for a Western, our quest is motivated by revenge. At the start of the game, our family gets murdered by an unknown bandit while we were off catching a runaway buffalo. So it's up to us to avenge our family and punish as many bandits as time permits. On our quest, we spend some time walking around a bunch of towns and getting to know a variety of colorful characters. But the vast majority is spent traversing the prairies or exploring some mines. All of this is very reminiscent of the original The Legend of Zelda, since each area is an enclosed space and the world is divided into a grid. Similarly, some of the challenges we face can't immediately be surmounted and usually the MacGuffin we need is placed at the other end of the map. Thankfully we're accompanied by our trusty horse that enables us to fast-travel to certain locations.\n\nIn order to uncover the identity of our fugitive bandit, we'll need to gather some information. Westerado knows full well that a good Western is always playing double duty as both an action movie and a detective story. So we're tasked to fulfill a variety of side-quests in order to receive information on the looks and whereabouts of our nemesis. However, the way we go about our business is largely up to us. We can play the loner with a heart of gold, or we can become an outlaw ourselves, either helping every soul we encounter or leaving behind a trail of blood respectively.\n\nBut we're not here to just talk and walk around the desert, we wanna shoot some dudes. Luckily Westerado has us covered. The world is filled with baddies acting as target practice, though the game's challenge isn't too taxing. Part of the reason is the fact that both our enemies and our protagonist can only shoot horizontally, meaning you have to be on the same plane as your enemies in order to shoot them or for them to hit you. More skilled players can also attempt to shoot off enemies' hats. What sounds like a token homage to every Western ever actually has a pretty good reason for being there. Hats represent your health in this world and you've got three hats as your life bar. Meaning you can take three bullets before the fourth one sends you to your grave. Coupled with the shooting mechanic, in which you first have to draw your weapon, ♥♥♥♥ the hammer prior to every shot and then finally shoot your enemies, as well as reload every bullet manually one after the other, it turns an otherwise unchoreographed mess of revolvers into an intricate ballet of preparing your gun, lining up the sights and hitting your enemies between the eyes all the while avoiding the crossfire from bandits that tend to surround you.\n\nAfter you've righted all the wrongs and put an end to the reign of terror of our nemesis, you can unlock multiple other characters to go through the adventure a second time, albeit with a different loadout to make things more challenging. Which is definitely needed, especially considering that it took me just around 2.5 hours to beat the campaign the first time around.\n\nOn the aesthetic front I have to say that I greatly enjoyed the visual style they employed. Sure, it's another indie game with an 8-bit aesthetic, but it excels when it comes to color palette and subtle animations. Coupled with the gorgeous soundtrack that hits all the right notes in every situation, it creates a genuinely nostalgic atmosphere. Fans of Westerns are advised to pick up the game as it's a nice little offering that's not quite an adventure in the league of something like Red Dead Redemption, but still manages to capture that feeling of being a cowboy in the Old West.","April 16, 2015","true","2.9"," 29 of 41 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","29","41","2","0"

But ALL the fun parts are framed by negatives.\n\nIf you want to follow one path - i.e. support the Ranchers - you cannot screw up EVER. So when I got to a climactic point, the fact that the Ranchers' AI blew it hard meant that I could not start over, I could not turn coat, and so I could not progress in the only meaningful thing that you CAN progress in, in the game (the quests).\n\nSo if you screw up a mission, it's easy to lose heart and turn toward a murderous rampage. Which is fun, the first 2 or 3 times. But even the gunfights are surrounded by crap - the hats are your "life points", basically. You can either buy hats to refill them, or with skill, shoot them off of enemies and collect them, which would be super satisfying... if they didn't blow away after about 5 seconds of lying on the ground. Contrast this with the money that they drop, that remains even after you wander all around the map. So your skill is rendered useless, unless you do it within 5 seconds of clearing the enemies off a screen.\n\nThe quest tracking system would be nice, if I could tell the difference between someone giving a quest, and a quest destination. And some of the screens are pretty big (which would normally be a bonus), but there's no way to narrow it down between the potentially dozens of people you might talk to in order to turn something in.\n\nUltimately, this is a game that I WANT to be fun, because I see a ton of potential, but which un-fun keeps crowding and frustrating the fun out of.","November 22, 2015","false","4.3"," 20 of 26 people (77%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","77","20","26","4","0"

I normally don't review games, but I feel like this one deserves it.\nThe story may start out as the over-used revenge story, but by the time you finish it feels completely fresh. The tutorial introduces the plot right away (a mysterious bandit burns down your ranch), and the rest of the game is dedicated to your personal vendetta. The mechanic here is interesting, because every playthrough the outfit of said bandit changes, and you are tasked with asking around to learn what he looks like. This is achieved through a multitude of ways, from rumors, to quests, to even blaming everyone until you find him. Seriously, this game takes free-roam to the next level. Even in conversations, you're not only given dialogue different options, you can pull out your gun, ♥♥♥♥ it, then fire it if you want. You can also just walk away. These are legitamate options, and the characters will respond appropriately, some will just hand you money when you threaten them or get annoyed if you walk away. Personally, I find this incredibly satisfying.\nThis open endedness extends to everything too. To earn money you can do jobs for people, mug strangers, or even rob the bank. And you don't need a quest or specific button to rob the bank, you just go in, shoot everyone, grab the money, run, and pray to god that the sheriff doesn't find you. The map is pretty massive for such a short story, and there's a ton to do. Every quest has several different ways to go about it, and quite a few of the quests will depend on you not doing another one. For example, you can help free the buffalo for the Indian Camp, but if you do that, you can't help the army fight them.\nCustomization is there, if you're wondering. They have different outfits and hats to buy or pick up all over the map. There's no RPGish skills or anything, but it's not needed. The game depends on the player skill.\nThe music and sound are not only authentic, but match the mood and fit the game perfectly. I would say the same about the art style. It's simple and pixelated, but get's the job done well. Even though the characters are basic and abstract, some of the backgrounds are detailed and gorgeous. The art and sound design fit Westerado well.\nNow you might be asking if there's anything wrong with this game. I have only one small complaint, so  if you need to read any part of this review, here it is. The combat is weak. It's a 2D shooter, and while it fits the game well, it can be a bit clunky and difficult to aim. The depth is unfortunately hard to judge, and several times I found myself shooting right behind enemies. And in a game like this, a few misses will cost you. It's such a small issue though, and the rest of the combat system is quick and satisfying. Also, here's a ton of different guns which brings variety to the mid-game, and improves the combat system.\nReplayability is also high, with 4 different characters and tons of different options each playthrough.\n\nTL;DR: Buy this game, especially while it's on sale.","April 16, 2015","true","7.6"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

Red Dead Redemption's name was invoked several times when I was briefly scouting around to see if the game was any good, and I can see the comparison in that sense. It does have a way of grabbing you.\n\nI do really appreciate this game's extreme open-endedness, and how basically no two games will be alike. Seems a lot like any NPC can die - I was a little surprised to find the Oil Tycoon dead after a skirmish in his office - and there are tons of quests with all manners of outcomes. All the quests are there to give you information to go after that one true goal, though: Get the Bad Guy. For that reason, when I Got the Bad Guy for the first time, I had quite a few open quests that didn't seem to be going anywhere, some that didn't even appear to still have objectives. That was kind of unsatisfying, but I guess it makes sense that this amount of open-endedness won't button up all neatly at the end like RDR. Fair enough.\n\nGetting Bad Guy took me right around five hours, and I'm a slow-paced player prone to spending significant periods of time just hanging around and looking cool. But I'm sure there's a lot more content to be explored, so I'll have to give it another shot.\n\nThe gameplay itself isn't really anything special, but it's not bad either. My major frustrations came around with those damn scorpions in and around the desert, and a really annoying endgame. It's pretty neat how your gun controls stay the same during conversations. The weapons are fairly satisfying. Really not much to argue about, but also not really the game's focus.\n\nDo I recommend it? Sure, but I have to admit the endgame payoff didn't seem like much compared to the trip. I got it on a sale, and I might recommend that, but really I don't think it'll steer you wrong.

Buuuut... Well, you get to the last boss fight and it's this long slog that's pretty easy to get the hang of and serves only to wear down your health so that the super cheap final fight can finish you off quickly. And every time you die you go right back to the beginning of the boss dungeon. You can breeze past this stuff quickly once you've figured it out, but it's freaking tedious to do so.\n\nHonestly, cheap boss design really marrs this otherwise awesome game.","May 13, 2015","true","5.2"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

Watch our review here on Steam Punks: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdZT8LH22n4\n\nWe’ve seen our fair share of pixelated adventures, but none that honour its source material quite as well as Westerado: Double Barreled. Developer Ostrich Banditos has refined their free online game into a fully-featured spaghetti western. Is it an indie title worth saddling up for, or should you stay out of the desert heat?\n\nThe game’s plot is set up quickly; a murderer burns down your ranch and kills your family almost as fast as you’re introduced to them. Of course it’s up to you to identify the mysterious killer and avenge your fallen kin. It seems the locals have their own issues as well, and can tell you about your notorious antagonist’s appearance in exchange for whatever help you choose to give them. Overall the story isn’t terribly interesting, but witty character dialogue helps carry the narrative along nicely.\n\nPlayers will spend a great deal of time interacting with townsfolk who reward you with hints and tips. Your choice of what to say in these conversations is abundant. While a lot of these will only alter simple lines of dialogue, it’s often used effectively as avenues to find and complete new missions. People trade a piece of information on the villain’s appearance for a completed mission, meaning once you’ve helped enough characters you can set out to find the murderer without finishing your entire itinerary. Story progress actually depends upon not completing every quest you come across, as progress in some tasks may impede you in others. A rancher friend may want to rally farmers together for a franchise, but that could be difficult if you just finished killing half of them to release their buffalo for an Indian chief. The sort of fail state handling in missions like this is extraordinarily unique, putting a fresh spin on the quest-collecting adventure. Your choices will dictate your overall experience from beginning to end, each decision bearing permanent consequence. If you decided it was easier to kill the pony express driver than it was to pay him, don’t expect to see him for the rest of your play through. Ultimately you can navigate around your failed missions and complete whatever is still possible in order to collect clues, but this level of gravity to your choices and failures feels real in a way that is rarely seen in games.\nIt’s up to each player to decide how they want to get from one end of the game to the other, who to help and who to harm, and overall what kind of hero they want to be. Because of this, Westerado holds excessive replay-ability after your first run of the relatively short story is over. Though most will be able to complete the main story in about 4 or 5 hours, this is leaving many quests unsolved. The game’s length becomes much longer for those who want to replay and see different paths, and you’ll likely want to do this to experience the game’s fascinating attention to detail rather than for any character’s sake. While the locals make for some funny conversation, the writing isn’t nearly as impressive as the carefully structured space out here in the desert.\n\nQuest givers are placed in thoughtful locations; you’ll often finish one mission to immediately discover two more. There is the occasional fetch quest, but most tasks feel deeper than that, having you actively take part in the locals’ problems through various mixes of exploration, action, and speech. There are a handful of different weapons to choose, from dual pistols to shotguns and rifles. Each have distinct capabilities and optimal situations to be used in. Money is tight, so the addition of the shooting range to find which gun suits your preference is appreciated. Something quickly noticeable in the gunplay is the restriction from shooting up or down; characters can only fire left to right. While this seems limiting at first, it actually makes for entertaining cinematic 16 – bit shootouts as black bars enclose the screen during your conflicts to emphasize the showdown.\n\nThe atmosphere the game goes so far to create is done with expert care. The pixel art has been masterfully crafted; the environments are a beauty to marvel, and character models convey a surprising level of detail for their simplicity. Accompanying songs are magnificent but few, with live recorded instruments helping to carry your adventure along. Each song is excellently chosen for their attached location, but the main over-world theme may start to drone on during extended sittings. Nearly every western set piece imaginable is present; you’ll visit the sheriff to get the news on outlaws, the pony express to make a delivery, and maybe even the nearby saloon to take a load off and play some poker.\n\nIt might be a short trip, Westerado: Double Barreled is a must-have for indie lovers. It’s an experience that handles atmosphere, decision-making, and comedic narrative better than most big-budget releases. It’s definitely worth ponying up for this adventure.\n\nSCORE: 8.5\n","April 22, 2015","true","5.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Shooting seemed a bit weird at first given that you'd have to ♥♥♥♥ the gun and then shoot each time, and when the barrels empty you got to reload the entire thing 1 bullet at a time. Unless you are using a tomahawk, in which case there is no need to reload. Lives are measured in hats, there's a reserve of 3 and everytime you get shot once 1 hat flies off and you'd pull 1 out of your jacket. You can get other hats of different designs and 1 particular hat which has an additional function of lighting the area around it, which is useful in dark areas in mines.\n\nOne notable feature of this game is that no matter how important an NPC might seem he can  be killed and it looks like the story adapts to this change.

One day, a buffalo escapes from your family ranch. You decide to go after it to catch and bring it back, but at return, you see the ranch burning down, your mother dead and your brother as good as dead. He makes you swear for revenge after he asks you to put him out of his misery. With nowhere to stay, you meet up with your uncle.\n\nAnd now you do whatever you want.\n\nObviously, this is a tale of reveange and of the wild old west, so you are free to do as you please. The game is structured after missions you can get from different NPCs which can be morally ambiguous, so technically you can become a hero, a renegade or a neutral mercenary, which is a freedom I always welcome, but the goal of the game is set on taking reveange on whoever did what they did to your family, and each mission completed will give you money and a hint on how that son of a b*tch looks like. Slowly you'll puzzle together their appearance, and exact your vengeance on them. Each playthrough the culprit takes on a new appearance, allowing for multiple playthroughs, along with unlockable characters, which all come with a different weapon besides the revolver.\n\nThe graphics try to invoke a classic charm, and most of the time succeed, but at points I couldn't help but think they were just ugly and messy. Personally, I really enjoyed the shooting animation. The way the gun powder disperses into the air looks amazingly detailed, and the line in which your bullet travels appears briefly but long enough to have an idea were you are shooting at and how much you need to adjust. Since the combat here is hectic and, surprisingly, very tactical, I appreciate this game design choice as it is fast and intuitive, whereas maybe the absence of the limitation of the horizontal fighting lock would have lead to a lot of frustration.\n\nYes, to fight it out here you get somewhat locked into a horizontal combat. Let me try to explain: you can only shoot in a straight line exactly 90° to the left or right. Your enemies naturally share this same condition. Add to this a health system that counts your "lifes" as "hats" (you have up to three), and for each time you are hit, you lose one hat. And let me tell you, the population of the West has an humerous obsession with hats. Genre savvy as they are, they know that nobody should get into a fight without a hat, because once you are out of them, you lose half your money, all your bought weapons and restart at your uncle's. This is why I said that the combat in Westerado is tactical, positioning yourself is of uttermost importance: you need to get out of the line of enemy fire, and yet, you need to stay enough in front of them to be able to hit them with a straight shot. To encourage this engagement, each headshot you manage to hit doesn't kill your enemy, but makes him lose his hat that you can pick up to "regenerate" your hats. They can than either surrender to you or resume to shoot at you. It is a small detail but very intriguing, even more so because if you decide to play bounty hunter, you will need to deliver some bounties alive to the sheriff, so in other words your gunslining skills need to be good enough to land a perfect headshot if you want to deliver your outlaws alive.\n\nSimilarly, starting a ruckus in a town may make you unpopular to the point of making the townspeople try to get rid of you. Or you might kill enough people to make you feared among bandits, to the point of them starting to avoid conflict with you. It is those reactions that make the game so entertaining to replay in a different way than before, out of curiosity.\n\nThe open-world concept is awesome for a 2D game -- but the world feels too small. I managed to complete 150% of the map, that is, all the overworld plus the underground mines, on the very first day I played. And it just happened out of curiosity, I wasn't even aiming at discovering the whole map! There needed to be a lot more space to explore, it really just feels too small.\n\nI also missed some more interactive actions, as scavenging from corpses, item management or upgrades of any sort. I think in that aspect, Westerado could have taken some inspiration from the Fallout series. On the other hand, being able to threaten ANY NPC with my gun during conversation really fleshes out the Wild West experience. It may sometimes even be necessary, and the very first mission of the game teaches this smoothly.\n\nIt is a good game, but too small of a world, too short of a story and has ultimately too little to offer to spend longer than two or three days playing it. Which is not enough return for the price of it. I like this game, in fact, I like it a lot, but it could have been so much more. It feels like a game of wasted potential, but I'd still recommend it on sale as a game for in between those days you got nothing to do and are too lazy to start/continue that long quest of your actual favorite game.","April 23, 2015","true","8.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

While Westerado: Double Barreled has some absolutely beautiful artwork and quite appropriate music and sounds, it suffers from fairly awkward gameplay and being overly simple. The concept on paper is pretty good - a small western sandbox game with a bite-sized storyline and side quests. The dialogue is pretty meh, and the controls feel awkward (for some reason I cannot quite put my finger on; more on this in the 'Cons' below).\n\nPros:\n+Beautiful artwork and animations.\n+Music and sounds are appropriate for this genre, albeit fairly generic.\n+Local co-op is a nice touch.\n\nCons:\n-My biggest problem with the awkward controls is the shooting mechanic - because the camera view is both sort of top-down and side scrolling. You have to line your gun up with the enemy, and not so much your body, which for some reason throws my brain for a loop with this game. Its weird.\n-Honestly, this feels like something that would be free on some free flash website (it may have been, in fact). Other than the beautiful artwork, nothing really merits the fairly high price tag. The gameplay is very simplistic, which IMO seems to be the trend with Adult Swim Games (in fact, I will mostly be avoiding titles from them in the future).\n-This genre is beat. As far as the 'western' genre, this game is as stock as it gets. I'm not saying we need to add zombies or anything, but I need something to give it its own character or personality.\n-Sandbox is very small - I've seen almost 100% of it in about an hour.\n\nIn conclusion, its cute and certainly has great artwork - but the core gameplay is too simplistic and has moderately awkward controls due to the side-scrolling/top down conundrum. I get why some people have love for this, but I also don't see them getting that many hours out of it to merit the price tag (average looks to be about 2.5 hours, and I mean its a fifteen dollar game). I'd watch some LetsPlays to really get a feel if this is for you, before diving in.","January 2","false","0.8"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","60","6","10","3","0"

I did quick video on my playthrough of the first 20 minutes or so to give you an idea of the gameplay.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vx7hWCyrhs\n\nThe care taken in the visuals and soundtrack made it clear the developers were committed to their theme and the game could easily fill in as a game adaptation for any of those old spaghetti western movies. If you enjoyed the original Fallout games or the old Sierra games (King’s Quest, Police Quest etc.) I think you’ll enjoy Westerado.\n\nPlayers who tried the original flash version on Adult Swim with recognize many parts of Double Barreled (Steam edition). But they have definitely improved the game significantly. It feels much more polished and expanded. If you’re not sure if you’d like you can check out the old flash version, but I’d take it with a grain of salt as there are a number of differences.\nThe learning curve isn’t too steep. The fight mechanics are a bit basic but they work with the overall design of the game. In this regard it reminded me of Fallout – it’s not turn based, but the fighting is just not a major focus of the game. You fight to complete some missions, but it’s not a fight-your-way through game. The gameplay is more about speaking with people, gathering clues and completing quests with the ultimately goal of finding a killer.\n\nAnyone expecting it to be like Titan Souls or Hotline Miami gameplay will be disappointed. At its core Westerado is an adventure and RPG game. If you approach it with that mindset (and enjoy those style games) you will like it. If you don’t enjoy adventure games, while this game is good, it isn’t likely to change your mind as to the genre.","April 23, 2015","true","5.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's definitely good, but the replay value depends. It can be beaten very quickly (my quickest was in just over 10 minutes), but I think generally a playthrough will last a couple of hours, if you really want to do a couple of quests and learn everything you can about the murderer. Every time you play the murderer looks different, and there is a bunch of different main questlines and endings to make every playthrough unique.\nEven with that, the replay value depends mostly on whether you like hunting for achievements. Most of the achievements of the game have you beat the game in a specific way (in under an hour, without dying, without getting hit, etc) or have you complete a certain questline, so you can't get all achievements in one playthrough. I've completed about 5-7 playthroughs I think, and I have 34/79 achievements now.\nIf you like achievement hunting the game has a lot of replay value. If not, it probably doesn't. Even then, the artstyle is really good and the game plays really well (in my opinion), so again, it's definitely a good game.\nTL;DR: yeh cool","April 26, 2015","true","32.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

My mandatory obscure indie game my best of 2015, and it's a good pick. Created by Ostrich Banditos and published by Adult Swim Games, this game is the closest thing I've played to Red Dead Redemption since I played Red Dead Redemption. It's the closest thing on PC to it, and that's pretty cool. So should you pick it up? Well, let's take a look at it to find out.\n\nSTORY: You are... some guy. Your brother and mother are killed by a man, and you go out on a journey to get sweet revenge. You go around and help people and you find clues to find the murderer. The story is a RPG, so you can choose what happens and that'll shape the world around you. Shall the military fight the Indians off their land, or will the Indians fall back, or can you make peace between the two? Shall the railroad go back to its former glory? You can decide. The murderer is randomized everytime, btw, so it has some good replay value there. Overall, it's a decent story.\n\nGAMEPLAY: The perspective is kind of like Dota 2, though it's not similar gameplay wise. You have your handy revolver. You ♥♥♥♥ it with one button, fire with another, and reload with a different one. If you get hit, your hat falls off. You usually have some spare ones, but if not, you are hatless. If you are hit then, you're dead and you wake up at your last spawn location with half of your cash gone. Decent enough, has some fun firefights and cool side activities, and it's good fun.\n\nGRAPHICS AND PERFORMANCE: 30fps, though with this game, that's fine. Runs smoothly. Game looks nice, has a nice pixely artstyle. It's charming, and it looks nice. That's nice to see.\n\nCHARACTERS AND DIALOGUE: Decent amount of variety. Your character is the usual player character, and you run across a lot of western stereotypes. The washed up sheriff, the girl who wants a man who can give her an adventerous life, the robbers who rob just for the hell of it. Fun little characters, some complexity to them as well. Nice to see some of them, I won't complain.\n\nFINAL RATING: Underrated game. Worth picking up on a sale without a doubt. 8.5/10, good game, nice debut for this studio. See if you can go out and support them if you have the money to.","December 16, 2015","true","4.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And I must say, it's an enormous amount.\n\nWesterado is an eight-bit RPG set in the Wild West. Or rather, a version of the Wild West built out of the most delightfully hilarious stereotypes and Spaghetti Western tropes imaginable. Make no mistake, this is a world of intensive depth, which will require many hours of exploration to see all of, despite any initial appearances to the contrary. From the scorchingly bright deserts, to the cool and gentle forests and the dingy underground, this world breathes life from every pixel. Long after you believe you've found everything the game has to offer, you'll stumble on some new quest or hidden grotto. It's helped in no small part by an utterly perfect soundtrack, which encapselates every dramtically cliched aspect of the Wild West one could hope for.\n\nThe gameplay is exceptionally original, clever and intuitive. From the use of your favourite hard-wearing hats as a set of lives (Don't get too attached now!) to the simple and brilliantly intuitive gunplay, which will keep you coming back time after time. In the new 'Double Barreled' steam version, there is also a larger plethora of weapons to choose from. The experience is delivered through a main quest, dealing with hunting down the man who killed your family, countless side quests of varying complexity and length, and two world-spanning questlines. (The Army versus the Indians and the Ranchers versus the Oil Tycoon) In addition, there are various rewarding side activities, like bounty-hunting and poker. Red Dead Redemption comes readily to mind, though this is a far more humorous experience.\n\nThe ending is deeply satisfying and well-executed, maintaining the game's balance of humour and surprisingly investing drama. It must be said that it's sole flaw is it's difficulty. While Westerado is intended to be as unforgiving as the old-school titles it imitates, there are times at which it becomes a bit absurd, and simply counter-productive.\n\nMost notably, the game's lack of save feauture means that the player can pour a dozen hours into completing nearly everything, only to accidentally ♥♥♥♥ one's gun in the wrong place and turn key story-characters permenantly aggressive, thus making it impossible to finish certain quests that time around. It would be rather nice to make the system a little kinder to minor mistakes like this, perhaps with a warning system of some kind when dealing with the most key characters.\n\nIn closing, Westerado is a startlingly deep, witty and timeless experience, which any fan of related genres is likely to find highly rewarding. With the above caveat as a warning, I recommend it highly.\n\n","March 10","true","31.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game allows for a nice variation of playstyles and you can pretty much do whatever you feel like, ain't nobody the boss of you!\n","April 19, 2015","true","7.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I normally would of shrugged this off but with how it was structured, I really got invested as I learned more and more about my family's killer. It gave him a face, a story, it really drew me in and made me feel like I was hunting a criminal to deal justice to rather then another faceless AI I was just going to shoot, and the payoff to this buildup really felt like it was worth it.

Westerado slides firmly into the last category.\n\nThe first thing I want to talk about is the atmosphere. This is easily the top reason to buy this game-the world is laid out metroid-vania style, and each screen is lovingly detailed. Locations range from ranches to towns, caves to deserts, abandoned towns to bandit hole-ups. Each of these areas have something do do; generally someone to kill, and sometimes quests or hidden secrets. On top of all this, the music that plays is very fitting, While some of it is more ambiance than music-like the cave theme-most of the overworld music is just a great blend of guitar, banjo, and harmonica, making for great western music.\n\nThe game's premise is that someone has killed your family and you're out for vengeance. The killer is randomly generated, and to find him you must gather clues to his appearance (Guess Who style) by solving problems for the local folks. This makes the game a variable length...some questlines give you a lot of clues, and depending on which quests you complete you can get different endings. This works well enough, and it adds to the replay value just a tad. I'll come back to this.\n\nThe combat in this game is great. There's a variety of weapons available--a Colt revolver from the get-go, and a coachgun, repeating rifle, and a set of dual revolvers available from the shop, and bolas and a tomahawk besides. I've had the time to test all but the tomahawk, and they're all fun to use-the default revolver is probably the best, but everything else works better situationally...the coach and rifle reload slowly, but they can hit in clusters or pierce respectively. The dual revolvers are a lot of fun, and can shoot in both directions at once. The bolas tie up an enemy, making it easier to shoot their hats off. Hats serve as your health-each time you are shot, you lose a hat, and if you are shot without a hat, you die. If you shoot an enemy's hat off, he'll usually run off, and you can take the hat for your own.\n\nAs to replayability, each run on the game is good for an hour or two on average, less if you know what you're doing. While there are several endings, the game gets a bit repetitive after a while.\n\nThis game is absolutely worth five to ten dollars, and is definitely worth your attention. With how much fun I've had in the time I've played, I feel like a sequel would totally be worth it.\n\nOne of the biggest things holding this game back is the randomized killer. Having a randomized killer means that there's a whole bunch of NPCs with zero point, spewing the same lines every time you speak to them. Removing it gives room for more quests, more fun, and more fleshed out characters to populate Clintville.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend this game when it's on sale, and a tentative recommendation when it's not. Fifteen dollars might be a bit much for this, unfortunately. You'd have to use your judgement on how much you love westerns, shooters, and RPGs.","December 28, 2015","true","7.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The graphics are similar to 8-bit style, yet look great when playing. The lighting and mood change as you transition between sections, and as you move between dark and light areas. There are multiple different NPCs which all have varying appearances to keep from repeating too much. There are also plenty of animals and aggressive enemies in this game that you must keep an eye out for, so don't just go running through the desert expecting it to be uneventful!\n\nThe premise of the game is to find your family's murderer, which involves getting clues about how the murderer looks, which help finalize an overall picture of who you're looking for. Your job is to then search the impressively large map to find this man/woman, which can seem daunting considering how far you have to travel. There is the ability to ride a horse between cities though to cut down on time.\n\nIn orer to do this take, you must perform jobs, many of which involve escorting wagons, buffalo, etc. from one place to another while a group of bandits try to steal/kill your cargo. These minigames are actually very challenging, and I died many times attempting, as you can see in the video! The shooting mechanics in this game require you to ♥♥♥♥ and fire your gun, including reloading bullet by bullet, which make maneuvering and fighting that much more difficult. I'd recommend constantly strafing up and down the screen to avoid getting shot and to help you line up yours better.\n\nAttaining money can be a challenge aside from finding bags on the floor. Most missions involve having to defend something, while others require you to simply pull your gun out. Either way, buying things required for missions takes away from being able to purchase new guns and clothing, so I typically stayed away from those missions. There are plenty of side missions to choose from though, so you will have plenty to do in this game.\n\nOverall, this game is tons of fun, and well worth the money. It's meant to be replayable, and I can see myself replaying this game multiple times, each with a new murderer to search for. I'd highly recommend trying this game if you have the time/money.","April 16, 2015","true","1.0"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","0"

If you've played Red Dead Redemption it's along the lines of that, except more pixelated. Like in Red Dead Redemption, the game offers an open world where you can interact with the people and the enviroments as you chose. You can explore the world and take on quests in any order you chose. You can even rob a bank, murder the towns folk, and accuse any one of heinous acts... or you might not. . It's totally up to you!\n\nAt the start of the game, you'll find your family murdered and your ranch burned down. The goal is to figure out who did it, and get your revenge. Here's the interesting twist, the bandit that wronged you could be any one, any NPC in the game. You'll be tasked with doing various missions to find clues to the masked bandit. As you find more clues that describes different features, such as fat or skinny, color of his/her cloths, the type of hat s/he's wearing, you'll be able to accuse people of murder. You may accuse who ever you like and when ever, but if you're not sure, and you're wrong, the situation could turn south very quickly. Caution when accusing is suggested. You'll also be able to find more clues and hints through conversations with the townsfolk and though it does feature the usual "dialog choice A or B" design there is an additional option to draw your weapon in the middle of any conversation. Doing so could affect the out come. Besides talking to the locals and hunting down bandits, there are other mini games such as poker to help distract the player. The game has a vast open world for the player to discover, and offers a lot of content and things to do while adventuring.\n\nAesthetically I think the game looks wonderful. The game's pixel art does a great job detailing the game's environment. The color pallet is suiting and easy on the eyes, and there's a high degree of artistry being displayed here. The audio is equally worth praising, as it's full of memorable spaghetti western themes.\n\nThe only part of Westerdo I would critique is how the game handles identifying the killer. The whole goal of the game is to identify a very specific person with very specific visual traits. Since the game is done in all pixel art, it could potentially make the task more difficult than it needs to be. There are tons of NPCs in the game, all looking quite different, but not THAT different, and telling the difference NPC A's slighly taller hat than NPC B's could prove more challenging than need be. But to be fair, I haven't had that issue my self, but I can see it as a potential issue for some one else.\n\nOver all Westardo is a wonderfully designed pixel open world western game, with a lot to like about it. The game is open not only in the world that you explore, but also in how the player explores it. Be a bandit, be a hero, it totally up to you. Either way, Westerdo is an easy recommendation.\n\nPros:\n- Well designed open world gameplay\n- Very open to a variety of play styles (Be a bandit! be a hero!)\n- Great aesthetics and music\n- Encourages replay\n\nCons:\n- Pixel style could make identifying the killer harder than needed\n- Lacks extra features and options","April 16, 2015","true","3.4"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","47","8","17","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sydneysworld/recommended/275200/","sydneysworld","Sydney's World","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sydneysworld/","168 products in account","The good reviews here on Steam convinced me to give Westerado a try. I really liked it at first, I felt like I was a part of this little retro Western world. After about an hour though, I found myself bored. Some of the missions were pretty good, but most were fetch/go here/do that without much in the way of payoff.\n\nThe biggest beef I have is the acutal gunfighting. Unless you're right near someone blowing them away, the controls are too awkward: you can only fire in the exact position you are facing, no gun rotation/diagonal shot (even Outlaw on Atari 2600 had diagonal shot!) Gunfights not fun? That's a deal breaker for this kind of game.\n\nAlthough I liked the map art, I despised the character dialog interaction art: just a pixel blob bobbing around. Whatever sense of story the game may have had lost me with this; I don't give a damn about a pixel block without even a face. How can you develop empathy with a block?\n\nI wanted to like this game, but I just couldn't.","April 6","false","1.2"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

Being a huge fan of it's flash father I was super overjoyed to see this polished up and extended version.\nStory: The story is right out of any old school western where you first control a young man who's mother is  a rancher In California during the gold rush. After spending the day ringling a stray buffalo you come back home to see you ranch burned, you mother killed, and your brother not to far behind. After giving you his gun and begging you to put him out of his misery, He asks you to kill the man responsible and gives you your first clue and the next day your off to find him\n\n\nPros:The look. I'm always fond of 8 bit looking games and this one's no exception. Everything is clear enough to know what it is but still be pixelated and blocky with almost exclusive warm colors throughout it's all very charming\n-The music is amazing. Even my mom liked it and she's a western snob. The music is pleasing even if it's not in 8 bit. Each different area (Desert, forest, towns,military base, Indian camp, caves ect) Has its own track. my fav is the forest\n-The killer is someone different every time you start a new game, giving it a lot of replay value\n-The game has a lot of personality, the main character is very likable and there quite a few funny lines coming from this game\n-The game is huge for what it is\n-There are a lot of new things to give to our young friend to help him in his journey (Guns,close,hats,ect)\n\n\nCons:\n-They didn't really fix the combat system, it's not bad just hard to aim at times\n-The clues might be randomized but the people you get them from arn't so if you played the flash version or play it again you know exactly where to go\n\n\nSo if you liked the flash version or like 8 bit adventure games you'll like this","May 4, 2015","true","5.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

It's definitly not worth $15 however, so wait for a BIG sale. It's a short experience, but it's still quite enjoyable, although not worth the price. The quests are more or less repetitive. You go somewhere, you kill someone. There are like 2 or 3 quests where you don't kill people, but you still use your gun. The combat is pretty neat though. If you get shot you lose a hat. Hats are like lives. You can have up to 3 hats. If you lose all of your hats you can die with a single bullet. I prefer Iron Man mode (you die, your dead) since it's probably the only true way to experience this game to the fullest.\n\nThe game has a randomizer on the person who killed your family for "replayabilty" but that doesn't make it replayable at all. Your still doing the same quests, still going to the same places, it get's boring. I suppose if you wanted to you could play the second time around and shoot everyone in sight, but other than that it's not worth playing a second time.\n\nIf the game ever drops somewhere like $5, it's worth a buy.","January 8","false","2.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

For the first few hours, it's pretty fun. A whole world to explore, so quests to do, bandits to kill, and a decent main story. Now, it probably takes about 2 hours to complete the game in one sitting, and do all the quests, even if it's your first time. The combat is fun at first but gets old quickly. The only fun thing to do is make enemies shoot each other. The endings are pretty good, seeing each time you get a different one, but this game still lacks in content. I've played it time and time again, and there's nothing really to keep your attention. It's far to short, and after an hour you will have done everything worth doing. This game is worth 5, maybe 7 or 8 €, not 15.\nGame is pretty decent, but only buy it if it goes on sale.\n6/10, to expensive.","May 15, 2015","false","20.0"," 8 of 19 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","8","19","0","0"

Adult Swim delivers yet another great game.\n\nWesterado is a Mystery/Action game wit ha great 2D combat system. They nailed the atmosphere of the game. The music is beyond amazing and perfectly fits the game. The story of the game is great, it's a murder mystery with a completely baffling twist ending.\n\nThe point of the game is to do quest to find out what the murderer looks likes. Some quest involve just serving some good ol' western justice. Others involve helping a ghost. The game is short, only lasting about an hour at most. It has to be short becasue that's where the replayability comes in. each time you complete the game, the murderer switches to one of the hundreds of NPCs in the game. One time it could be a fat rich man, and the next it could be a skinny yellow bellied outlaw.\n\nThe NPCs are all interactable. They have a reaction to almost anything you do. If you draw a weapon, they will match. If you pull the hammer they may very well shoot you, or it could be a quickdraw. You have the the choice of being an outlaw, by killing civilians or anyhting that moves, or you can be a justice seeking law bringer, seeking out the worst outlaws and wiping their mark off the face of the wild west.\n\nI do have a few nitpicks though.\n-There are only 4 weapons in the game.\n-The quest are the same each time around, (although you probably won't finish all of them on your first time around)\n\nEven with these, the game is still great. It's well worth the 15$ price. I highly reccomend this game and hope that anyone reading this will buy it.","April 26, 2015","true","6.5"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

You will meet Indians, ranchers, bandits, ghosts and many other characters who all have great lines to say in true western fashion. Constantly finding clues to discover the identity of the murderer makes the hunt more and more engaging, and when you finally confront him there is a really well executed plot twist after an action-packed climax.\n\nGRAPHICSThe 16-bit world is full of little details, from the shadows, to the houses and the civilians. Sometimes I just found myself staring at the screen for a minute or two looking at how perfectly the developers captured the cinematic look of the Far West.\n\nGAMEPLAYThere are so many things to say here.\nFirst of all, the combat. You can carry three weapons max, and the arsenal includes: a revolver, dual revolvers, a shotgun, a rifle, a tomahawk and bolas. In order to shoot, you must draw the gun, ♥♥♥♥ it and then pull the trigger. This can also be done during dialogues in order to scare or get informations from someone. You have a total of three hats, which serve as your life: you die when you are shot without a hat. In order to get hats, you can buy them in stores or shoot one off a person.\nThe game map is relatively big and you can fast travel by using a horse that you find in certain areas. There are a lot of missions to do, which include escorting buffaloes, killing bandits in a certain area, finding an object and so on. You must complete them to acquire more and more information on the Murderer.\nThere are also some side activities, like visiting a saloon to drink, buying different outfits, bounty hunting, visiting banks to deposit money or playing cards.\nYou can also play the campaign with a friend at your side. Unfortunately, they can do little to nothing other than helping you in gun battles.\n\nCHALLENGEThe game is not particularly challenging when playing as the Hero, since you will always have an hat or two. In case you die, you will spawn back to your Uncle's house and you will lose half of the money you had, which can be acquired really easily.\n\nSOUNDThe soundtrack to this game is beautiful, and perfectly fits the atmosphere of the game and of the different areas that you explore. The sound effects are also well executed, especially the ones related to the weapons.\n\nREPLAYABILITYAfter completing the story, you can use the save file to finish all the other quests, or start a new game by playing as three different characters, each with different skills. Each playthrough there is a different Murderer, so every time you play is different from the other. And for the completionists out there, there are 79 achievements to unlock.\n\nOverall, this is a fantastic western game, with great graphics and soundtrack, responsive controls, engaging combat and a lot of content. You can't miss this, especially at the honest price of 15$.\n\nStory: 8\nGraphics: 9\nGameplay: 9\nChallenge: 7\nSound: 9\nReplayability: 9\n\nENJOYMENT: 9.5\nFRUSTRATION: 5\nFollow me on Twitter: @nickygra97\nSubscribe to my channel\nLike on Facebook\n{LINK REMOVED}Check my official website\nJoin my Steam group","April 16, 2015","true","5.5"," 12 of 28 people (43%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","43","12","28","7","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/phawx/recommended/275200/","phawx","Phawx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/phawx/","4248 products in account","TLDR: Excellent Game. Seldom do I feel I can so freely recommend a game without reservation.\n\nMy Quick Look on Westerado: Double Barreled (spoiler, I take the outlaw route)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItZp400oB9M\n\nThis game is REALLY good.  It starts with the usual western plot device that sets up the story, but what Westerado does great (that I was actually surprised at) was how important all of the NPCs were to the story.  You start off with a clue as to who killed your brother and mother.  But it's not much of a clue at all, because it basically only solves 50% of the population (maybe).\n\nBut the interesting thing is that dialogue trees are not limited to just different dialogue options.  You can have actions be your dialogue options.  The actions are pretty limited, you could either walk away from a conversation, to which the NPC you were talking with might get upset or find it strange but it could also be a tactic.  The other dialogue action you can take it pointing your gun towards the person you're having a conversation with.  This gets them nervous as they try to cool the situation.  You can FURTHER push this action by cocking the hammer of your gun back which puts additional pressure on the NPC to act.  Sometimes they'll just drop whatever money they have and run.  Others will make a funny comment that manages to reflect the situation.  Super refreshing, well designed and it's this very element that I believe will make people want to play multiple playthroughs.\n\nIf you have a quest that informs you to visit the owner of a tavern and you shoot that owner, that quest is no longer available as well as closing the tavern down. It can be tremendously fun to just threaten and accuse everyone you speak with but it can also be fun to play as a detective.\n\nThere is an excellent map system/quest log/hint log that keeps you updated with where you left off and is executed perfectly.  I never found myself wanting for information in any particular way and the presentation is just fantastic.\n\nSpeaking of presentation, while some of the character pixel-art is bordering on Atari 2600, the environmental artwork is truly something to behold.  I realize that it may not be everyone's cup-of-tea, but damn do I enjoy it.\n\nNormally, I don't comment on music, but holy ♥♥♥♥ these guys nailed it.  Not only is it authentic, it's scripted magnificently.  At each and every turn that there could have been a musical embellishment to heighten what was happening on screen, it was there. The quick strum of an acoustic guitar when something dramatic is on the screen but still managing to flow with the rest of the soundtrack remains to be a distinct bulletpoint for me. The score is masterfully done.\n\nAll-in-all, I never knew that I really wanted a 2D sandbox spaghetti western.  Considering that you have full agency to control the narrative of the game, your playstyle actually matters and dictates how the story will unfold.  Will you simply carry-out what your quest log tells you?  Or will you be an outlaw?  A vigilante?\n\nWesterado is crazy good.  Normally I am a bit reserved when recommending games, but I am very confident that pretty much everyone would have a blast with this game.\n\nVery much recommended.","April 16, 2015","true","0.9"," 14 of 33 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","14","33","0","0"

Westerado: Double Barreled is a game about getting revenge on the bandit that burned down your home and murdered your family. The game thrust you into the west with nothing more than a hat and revolver and tell you find killer.\n\nYou must go through out the west completing quests for various people to get enough information to successfully identify the killer. The killer is random NPC, so his appearance change every playthrough. You can kill anyone in the game, so if you choose to just go on a rampage till you get the right one that could be an option. The missions can range from protecting a herd of buffalo, working with natives to take on the rangers, or clearing out a cave full of bandits. The combat allow you to shoot in either the left or right direction and you can move up and down to avoid gun fire. Hats are the system health system. The more hats you have the more hits can take, but once you run out the next hit will be fatal.\n\nThis game sound and feel like a western. It got so many winks and nods to westerns, there no way I could get through them all. Heck the main town is name Clintville, and they even manage to throw in a Doctor Who reference. But I digress. The game set the mood as western film, and with the game being an open sandbox you can really explore the west. Also the soundtrack is just amazing, never had I wish to download a OST as much as with this game.\n\nOnce the game have been completed under certain conditions you can unlock up to 3 additional characters, all with their own unique play style. Combine this with the fact that you can buy guns in games, along with clothes, and a house and well let just say you can get a lot of mileage out this game.\n\nHonestly I like the western setting in game and feel it an underrated genre. Westerado fulfill my need for a western game and let me choose whether I can be the lone hero of the west or a mass murderer killing everyone till I get my revenge.","April 26, 2015","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Westerado has you play as a rancher whose family is slaughtered one day by a bandit, the rest of the story is you helping people to get bits of information to piece together who killed your family. While it is a typical revenge story, it's still a blast to play through each time. The game allows you to be a noble hero or to become a villain yourself. You can choose to take out your revolver at any point in a conversation while talking to anyone (even your own uncle!) to persuade them.

The story is pretty generic, but the attention to detail is great. Lots of secrets hidden all over the place (Also, did I mention, "more secrets?" because there are MORE than lots of secrets hidden away that are great to discover). The music sounds nice, but I personally wouldn't listen to it very long, as it goes from nice to being slightly annoying after hearing it for over two hours straight. The graphics, though extremely simplistic, look great, and remind me of the GBA versions of Pokemans. I like the way the social interactions work in-game, and how so many of the characters are interconnected in different ways to each other. The gameplay mechanics (and controls), though slightly unorthodox, are great to use with a little practice. My only real complaint is the multiplayer (co-op if you're wondering, though friendly fire is possible). Apart from being able to help out in firefights, "Player 2" has a lot less ability to do stuff than player one. Player 2 can't open dialogues, and nor can he/she go very far from player one (They need to be in the same region, and only player one can move the camera to different places). Besides Player 2's inability to do anything of great use, however, this is a great play for anybody who's even remotely human. If you're the sort of person who'd spend ten dollars on a game like goat simulator for two hours of fun, $15 is well worth paying for for a few playthroughs of Westerado: DB.\n\nSummary: Great game, r8 8/8, And, because it's not CoD, 10/10.","May 18, 2015","true","16.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a fast-paced, casual free-roaming shooter in which you avenge your family and help (or shoot) anyone you want along the way. The game draws some criticism for the short playthrough duration, but it's built around replayability, with many quests being mutually exclusive. Think tiny pixel Red Dead Redemption with a splash of Fallout-style world interaction. Gunfights are quick and simple, but still feel satisfying. Saving is done automatically (seemingly on screen transitions), making some mistakes permanent, but that just leads us back to the replayability. The presentation is well-polished; the jokes are good, the music is varied and enjoyable, the interface is quick and smooth. Spiced up with side quests, bounties, and co-op, Westerado is a solid choice for some light-hearted retro gunslingin'.","April 24, 2015","true","13.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The pixel art in this game is fantastic, the artist did their best work right here, and you can see it in all the little details. I personally love most of the soundtrack, fitting the western setting with ease. The only gripe I have with the game is the combat, which is lackluster, and the length-for-price. I beat the game the first time through in about forty-five minutes or so, and the rest of the play time was me playing through and exploring the land. The game is totally worth the money if it's on a Steam sale, but not for it's current price tag.\nFull Review? ------> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14XL1-V5Yt8&index=1&list=PLvEdq1kr0E6aB1BDiOBAdrIymgzn4aCZB","April 26, 2015","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Westerado has you play as a rancher whose family is slaughtered one day by a bandit, the rest of the story is you helping people to get bits of information to piece together who killed your family. While it is a typical revenge story, it's still a blast to play through each time. The game allows you to be a noble hero or to become a villain yourself. You can choose to take out your revolver at any point in a conversation while talking to anyone (even your own uncle!) to persuade them.

Unlike WotS, however, you're not free to just do whatever and leave whenever you like, though you can easily break the storyline and just murder everyone if you so choose. There seem to be a number of scripted events that can occur in reaction to your behavior, in lieu of following the main storyline, but it doesn't really address the fact that once you break the storyline, there's no real way to "finish" the game in many circumstances, the way that you can choose to just leave town in WotS. The game doesn't seem to have a "New Game +" state, however, so maybe it doesn't matter whether or not you can "complete" it; completing the game simply leaves that file permanently loading just before the final battle, requiring you to start a new game in a new slot to access your unlocked characters and the like, or else delete the original file.\n\nCombat interestingly requires you to ♥♥♥♥ your gun before each shot, and manually reload each bullet, but still manages to be INCREDIBLY easy. Often what will kill you will be battles that drag out over an incredibly lengthy series of areas, terribly cramped rooms with no space to maneuver, or wild animals, who take one life just by touching you.\n\nUnfortunately, the "randomly generated killer" that the game boasts seems to always be a generic, nameless NPC that wanders around one of the two towns, rather than one of the named characters with actual dialogue and characterization.\n\nWorth picking up, though considering the 2-3 hour length, and that I saw most of the game's content in a single 2.5 hour playthrough, maybe not for $15.\n\nHas an unexpectedly excellent soundtrack that, while unavailable for sale through Steam, can be picked up at the artist's bandcamp: https://samvanlonkhuyzen.bandcamp.com/album/westerado-double-barreled-ost","May 5, 2015","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game isn't long, but there are loads of ways to play it and loads of ways to get what you want. You can choose to help out anyone who needs it, but of course if you want to be the tough guy, you could just murder everyone. It won't get you any clues but it will get you loot, so you have to choose between loot and clues.\n\nThe combat is great - easy to learn but hard to master - and every kill feels satisfying no matter what weapon you use. The gunfights tend to be rather short, most taking place under 20 seconds, but it feels frantic and tense through the whole fight.\n\nThe missions are mostly minigames or fetch quests, but don't let that put you off - the minigames are good fun and there's sure to be a good gunfight or two during the fetch quests. On top of that, some quests require that you don't shoot up a place in order to start, so much of the time you're gonna have to think twice before you start spraying and praying, as the people you kill might be significant to that quest you're currently on.\n\n(Spoilers-ish) The only thing I don't really like about the game is the end sequence, mainly because it's the same every playthrough apart from a possibly varying plot twist once you defeat the murderer.","June 6, 2015","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

To end this review on a high note, I'll get through the negative parts first.\n\nTo start, this game is NOT worth 15 euro. If Westerado is on sale, go ahead and buy it. If you like the sound of it after what this review tells you, go and buy it. If you're looking for a long experience and you don't have much money to spend, I'd say that Westerado isn't for you.\n\nThat being said, the game has an unfortunately short playtime. Start to finish with a few of the sidequests in between lasts you about 2-3 hours. That being said, exploring around, interacting with the NPCs and truly doing everything that the game has to offer will last you an extra 2-3 hours on top of the original playtime. Altogether, you can get a truly immersive 6 hours of entertainment from this game in total. Unfortunately little.\n\nThat's about it for the negative side, other than one tiny bug that really didn't affect gameplay at all. Instead of my money displaying in the money GUI, it displayed below it. Any money that I picked up went into the money GUI with the total amount I had before banking it being below the GUI, saying "+X", X being the money I was carrying at the time. It didn't affect gameplay, it was just like normal. Forget about it. Now, moving on to the good part.\n\nThis game is oddly immersive. I blame the soundtrack. Listening to that beautiful opening theme and then hearing it again in certain other areas, it almost made me proud of my character at the end, despite the fact he was a murderous ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ (In my defense, they all fired first. The fact that I pointed and cocked a gun at their face is beside the point)\n\nNext up, the game offers quite a lot of freedom to do things however you want to. Do you have to convince someone to deliever his buffalo to an army fortress? Well, you can do a little job for him and then help to defend the buffalo from bandits like an upstanding citizen, or you can threaten him at gunpoint and force him to deliver them. This goes for pretty much every quest in the game. You can be forceful and violent to get what you want, or you can actually be a helpful citizen.\n\nNext up, the whole system of finding "The Murderer" the main antagonist, is pretty fun. It can just appear out of nowhere, that guy you've been hunting for the last two hours. You might suddenly stumble upon someone who resembles him and then realize "Wait, that couldn't be... the murderer?". Not only do you have to constantly match people with his description and generally keep an eye out for him, but you've gotta go on a big quest for information, narrowing down potential suspects until you can find and accuse the right person.\n\nThe shooting mechanics in this game are oddly satisfying. Although they only work on a 2D Plane and you can only shoot in straight lines, it's pretty suspenseful. Buying new weapons and using them keeps the experience fresh and interesting along the way.\n\nThe game also has a small open world. You can go across the entire map back and forth in about two minutes, but with all the quests, NPCs and other distractions throughout the world, you'll stray from the main quest and end up spending three to four hours at the game anyway.\n\nBasically, if you've got some money to spare and want to experience an interesting story and a 2D Red Dead Redemption with all the traditional Wild West activites, get this game.","August 12, 2015","true","25.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

You have to pull out your gun, ♥♥♥♥ the hammer, then fire, so that makes some interesting gameplay where you want to ♥♥♥♥ the hammer as you move, so you can fire instantly.  And you reload bullets one at a time, so you can put in as many as you can before you need to fire again.\n\nCan aim your gun at anyone, even during conversation, and kill anyone - even "quest" characters - all it does is shoot yourself in the foot in terms of the gameplay, so this is what probably leads people to "feeling like a bad ♥♥♥" as they walk through town, because they're choosing not to kill anyone, I guess because most games don't give you that control.\n\nThe whole game has a "You made a mistake, now deal with it" vibe, no going back on anything, which is pretty cool.  It's like Minecraft, it saves itself.  Kind of fits with the rugged "wild west" vibe.\n\nThe pixel art style, coupled with the dialogue, and the high quality music makes me think someone dreamed this up like a kind of half awake dream, and because it's under "Adult Swim Games", they had the money to make it happen and do well.","August 23, 2015","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even the death scene is so beautiful with the grave and the hat and the scarf and... the music.\n\nBesides me being addicted to this for the music, the game has something that the games that have it become annoying for it. That being that the game forces you to do side quests because you can't just find the murderer with one clue.\n\nAnyways, this goes in the top 5 or 10 of best game i have ever played. I just don't like the fact that after you finish the game you can't play the game after the deed is done, when you load the game it loads before the murderer dies.","August 28, 2015","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The plot is simple. Your character comes back to find that his ranch has been burnt to the ground, his mother killed, and brother on his dying breathe. You are given a clue about your families killer and sent off to avenge them. You explore an open western world helping people, and gunning down a couple cowboys and indians along the way in the hope of gathering enough evidence to identify your killer out of the many characters in the world. Every playthrough you are looking for a new killer. The gameplay is addicting, it has a beautiful western soundtrack to accompany the beautiful pixel art.

Ah don' think it's worth the full amount, but if you can get it on sale, you have a nice little game to play.\n\nStory - 7/10 - Yer family gets killed by a person, and you have to go kill that person. The story does make you want to play, but it ain't too original. The cool thing about it is that the person that killed your family changes every time, so you ain't gonna know who the killer is ferever.\n\nGraphics - 7/10 - Nothin' to write home bout'. It looks fine, and there ain't any glitches in animation as far as ah can tell, but somethin' feels a little lackluster bout' it. It ain't gonna fect' the gameplay though.\n\nGameplay - 9/10 - The gameplay is very simple. There are 3 parts of the game. Movin', Shootin' and Talkin'.\nMovin' - You move round'. This is bearable cause' you has a run button and there's an open world to explore, even though the world ain't very big.\nShootin' - You shoot people. The Combat is fun cause' there are multiple weapons to use, but you can only shoot left er' right, which is a weird design choice.\nTalkin' - You talk to people. Most of the time you will do one of 3 things. Help, Ignore, or Threaten. You can git missions and sist' people with jobs or be a little varmint and walk away. The fun things that you can do are accusin' people of murderin' yer family or pull out a gun and have the option to shoot em'. Pullin' out your gun may lead you to new dialougue options, but'll get you into a gunfight 50% of the time. It's yer choice!\n\nOverall - 8/10 - Westerado's a nice little game that doesn't last too long, but it packs punch, like ah shotgun to the hat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(P.S. NO OFFENSE IS MEANT TOWARDS ANYONE WITH A WESTERN ACCENT! IT JUST FITS THE THEME!)","October 25, 2015","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The 2d gunfight mechanics are novel though not deep, there's a decent amount of map to explore, and between the branching quests and multiple endings you'll probably play through a couple of times at least.\n\nThe main downside is that even if you play through a few times the game isn't very long and unless you have strong completionist tendencies you probably aren't going to be motivated to play through a fifth or sixth time just to see the few story paths you haven't tried yet. I would suggest waiting for it to go on sale if you want good value per hour played.","September 28, 2015","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In a world of overly refined games where soda caps can add experience and paying money can make one better than a competitor, Westerado pays tribute to a gritty world of games like it does  Americana. In this case, less is more. The more I put into it, the more I get out of it. If you're like me and like to grind out a map until you discover all of it and then sulk when a quest doesn't drop off because you screwed it up, then Westerado will tickle your fancy. It's plain fun. It has great, funny dialogue. The music is captivating. The plot is classic as are the iconic Western references. If you're an adult and remember the good-ole-days and want to take a trip down nostalgia lane, it'll meet your expectations. It has old-school game true grit. If you're expecting a highly polished, super interactive world with diverse and complicated characters affected by diverse and complicated circumstances, you're not going to be satisfied. But then again, with all of the reviews you probably read before this one, how much of the dissatisfied reviews would be echoed on games like Wolfenstein 3D (DOS version), Oregon Trail (Old Apple?), or Legend of Zelda (NES)? Probably, a lot of it. Go 'head and disagree, but if you do, fill yer hands, and wait until the music stops.","January 1","true","16.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Ah don' think it's worth the full amount, but if you can get it on sale, you have a nice little game to play.\n\nStory - 7/10 - Yer family gets killed by a person, and you have to go kill that person. The story does make you want to play, but it ain't too original. The cool thing about it is that the person that killed your family changes every time, so you ain't gonna know who the killer is ferever.\n\nGraphics - 7/10 - Nothin' to write home bout'. It looks fine, and there ain't any glitches in animation as far as ah can tell, but somethin' feels a little lackluster bout' it. It ain't gonna fect' the gameplay though.\n\nGameplay - 9/10 - The gameplay is very simple. There are 3 parts of the game. Movin', Shootin' and Talkin'.\nMovin' - You move round'. This is bearable cause' you has a run button and there's an open world to explore, even though the world ain't very big.\nShootin' - You shoot people. The Combat is fun cause' there are multiple weapons to use, but you can only shoot left er' right, which is a weird design choice.\nTalkin' - You talk to people. Most of the time you will do one of 3 things. Help, Ignore, or Threaten. You can git missions and sist' people with jobs or be a little varmint and walk away. The fun things that you can do are accusin' people of murderin' yer family or pull out a gun and have the option to shoot em'. Pullin' out your gun may lead you to new dialougue options, but'll get you into a gunfight 50% of the time. It's yer choice!\n\nOverall - 8/10 - Westerado's a nice little game that doesn't last too long, but it packs punch, like ah shotgun to the hat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(P.S.

The game isn't long, but there are loads of ways to play it and loads of ways to get what you want. You can choose to help out anyone who needs it, but of course if you want to be the tough guy, you could just murder everyone. It won't get you any clues but it will get you loot, so you have to choose between loot and clues.\n\nThe combat is great - easy to learn but hard to master - and every kill feels satisfying no matter what weapon you use. The gunfights tend to be rather short, most taking place under 20 seconds, but it feels frantic and tense through the whole fight.\n\nThe missions are mostly minigames or fetch quests, but don't let that put you off - the minigames are good fun and there's sure to be a good gunfight or two during the fetch quests. On top of that, some quests require that you don't shoot up a place in order to start, so much of the time you're gonna have to think twice before you start spraying and praying, as the people you kill might be significant to that quest you're currently on.\n\n(Spoilers-ish) The only thing I don't really like about the game is the end sequence, mainly because it's the same every playthrough apart from a possibly varying plot twist once you defeat the murderer.","June 6, 2015","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You have to pull out your gun, ♥♥♥♥ the hammer, then fire, so that makes some interesting gameplay where you want to ♥♥♥♥ the hammer as you move, so you can fire instantly.  And you reload bullets one at a time, so you can put in as many as you can before you need to fire again.\n\nCan aim your gun at anyone, even during conversation, and kill anyone - even "quest" characters - all it does is shoot yourself in the foot in terms of the gameplay, so this is what probably leads people to "feeling like a bad ♥♥♥" as they walk through town, because they're choosing not to kill anyone, I guess because most games don't give you that control.\n\nThe whole game has a "You made a mistake, now deal with it" vibe, no going back on anything, which is pretty cool.  It's like Minecraft, it saves itself.

In a world of overly refined games where soda caps can add experience and paying money can make one better than a competitor, Westerado pays tribute to a gritty world of games like it does  Americana. In this case, less is more. The more I put into it, the more I get out of it. If you're like me and like to grind out a map until you discover all of it and then sulk when a quest doesn't drop off because you screwed it up, then Westerado will tickle your fancy. It's plain fun. It has great, funny dialogue. The music is captivating. The plot is classic as are the iconic Western references. If you're an adult and remember the good-ole-days and want to take a trip down nostalgia lane, it'll meet your expectations. It has old-school game true grit. If you're expecting a highly polished, super interactive world with diverse and complicated characters affected by diverse and complicated circumstances, you're not going to be satisfied. But then again, with all of the reviews you probably read before this one, how much of the dissatisfied reviews would be echoed on games like Wolfenstein 3D (DOS version), Oregon Trail (Old Apple?), or Legend of Zelda (NES)? Probably, a lot of it. Go 'head and disagree, but if you do, fill yer hands, and wait until the music stops.","January 1","true","16.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But very zany, some great parody elements of the Spaghetti western genre, with a simple but overall compelling narrative that fits its theme.\nIt boils itself down to some simple elements to allow for a fair amount of diversity in how the paths can branch out. Unlike other games with a 'get quest' format, most missions will have some impact on the progression of the main storyline, so you can generally pick and choose what missions you want to pursue in order to reach the end goals, or complete them for their own merits. The main story is not really the meat of the game, but it's a satisfying chunk of narrative.\nThe gameworld is possibly one of the most reactive and natural I've played in any game. For example, there are no 'essential characters' that you cannot kill. when characters die, they stay dead, which can have real consequences for completing the game, and there's little to no railroading in how you have to complete certain tasks. Heck, you could be like me and end up triggering the end mission by complete fluke whilst doing something else. Even the tutorial is short, sweet and gets you to grips with the gameplay quickly while providing the first part of the story.\n\nThe soundtrack is delightfully western, but it can be a little too intense during times it shouldn't be. Walking around town should be a mellow track rather than the main theme playing in the background.\n\nGameplay is unorthadox, but very engaging when you get a handle on it. It's fast paced, hectic and relies on both reaction times and quick thinking. I would say this game has the gameplay that best fits the style of the 'gunslinger'. Greater precision allows you to regain health ('health' in a matter of speaking, westerado again has appropriated the spaghetti western style with it's combat system) and the combat blends nicely into the mechanics of the rest of the game (for example, you can draw your gun at any time while speaking with an npc).\n\nClassic pixel style graphics, but the art is well realised and the animations are smooth and vibrant. Very consistent aesthetics.\n\nOverall, if you've wanted a short but satisfying & replayable experience that caters to the old-west fan in you, Westerado delivers a very solid punch of the classic spaghetti western, which stays true to its core themes in all aspects.","December 6, 2015","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game isn't long, but there are loads of ways to play it and loads of ways to get what you want. You can choose to help out anyone who needs it, but of course if you want to be the tough guy, you could just murder everyone. It won't get you any clues but it will get you loot, so you have to choose between loot and clues.\n\nThe combat is great - easy to learn but hard to master - and every kill feels satisfying no matter what weapon you use. The gunfights tend to be rather short, most taking place under 20 seconds, but it feels frantic and tense through the whole fight.\n\nThe missions are mostly minigames or fetch quests, but don't let that put you off - the minigames are good fun and there's sure to be a good gunfight or two during the fetch quests. On top of that, some quests require that you don't shoot up a place in order to start, so much of the time you're gonna have to think twice before you start spraying and praying, as the people you kill might be significant to that quest you're currently on.\n\n(Spoilers-ish) The only thing I don't really like about the game is the end sequence, mainly because it's the same every playthrough apart from a possibly varying plot twist once you defeat the murderer.","June 6, 2015","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
