The simple conceit is that you control the maze with only a left-click of the mouse.\n\nThere are various elements in the maze, blue triangles that reflect the ball 90° red triangles that also reflect the ball 90° but also rotate 90° with each mouse click, another sort of triangle that can be turned invisible at a click allowing the ball to pass through, objects that are destroyed after a single hit, teleporters, switches and splitters that spit out 2 balls for twice the fun!  Every click will change the state of the maze, you can't set and forget, you have to constantly adjust and watch the ball like a hawk.\n\nThough the most important tool is if you click and hold the mouse, you can draw a single use short grey wall where the ball is currently traveling.  As you get to the higher level puzzles you will have to reflect the ball multiple times a level to succeed.  Whether it's a bug or intended, there is a small but noticeable delay from when you click and hold and where the wall starts and this will have to be taken into account.\n\nThe graphics are quite good, the game is presented as though drawn in pen on graph paper though the mobile origins are obvious, giant buttons!  Levels range from simplistic to quite challenging and you receive a grade from A to C based on the number of moves, clicks, you make.  There is also an easy to use editor and an inbuilt publish and rate system with more that 20000 levels available online!\n\nWhile there are only 60 official levels, there probably should have been more, in the release and you'll probably be done with those in 2-3 hours, this is a fantastic little puzzler presented with style that's very worthy your time.","June 19, 2014","true","8.4"," 28 of 30 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","28","30","0","0"

No doubt, a pencil like written board and little touches of pencil eraser make you feel like you are playing on the notebook at break time between classes back in the school years. It is a game meant for all those players who loves a chill out at evening with a puzzle game. The game keeps you addicted and the feel of paper background makes the game just the best. It is a one button to click kind of game that requires quick finger and a good reaction. I find it to be an incredibly charming game with well designed puzzles. It is a simple enough at first, but gets more challenging as it progresses. The first few levels are simple and easy, but as you progresses the levels become tough and difficult. You control a ball that travels round the screen and it must bounce off against the walls and triangle objects that are placed all around the board. The triangles can be interacted easily with the tap of a screen. The ultimate goal is to collect all circular objects with the less taps as possible. To finish a level you need to manipulate objects on the board through tapping, like rotating triangles, toggling buttons, drawing temporarily walls and so on. How well you finished a level determined by a grading scale where A is obviously the best completion grade, like in school. If you don't like the inbuilt levels of the game or you have an idea for genius level, you can create and share the custom level. It is easy and simple to use the editor. Custom levels created in number of thousands make the game endlessly playable. I would recommend getting this game. It is great and deserves a chance for everyone.","February 6, 2015","true","11.8"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","19","20","0","0"

While it comes packed with 60 premade levels for you to complete, these are merely a teaser for the main course that is making and playing user created levels. It's a one touch game with more depth than it gives itself credit for, but is simple enough to be instantly understandable to anyone that gives it a go.\n\nAs I said, Ichi is a puzzle game that relies on a single touch to interact with the various mechanics within levels, with the goal being to bounce your ball around the screen collecting all the dots without running into spikes or getting overzealous with your taps (which will earn you a lower grade). The items you control start off simply, with triangles that rotate or disappear with a touch, but then evolve into more complex tools from switches to portals and various others which add upon each other to make puzzles more complex and engaging. Despite this, my biggest issue with Ichi is that all the developer made levels are surprisingly easy, to where I rarely felt any challenge from them up to the very end. Ultimately they act more like a tutorial to the user generated levels than something to fill a game with in their own right.\n\nThankfully, with already 20,000+ created and more popping up every day, there are tons and tons of absolutely brilliant user created puzzles that will give you a far greater challenge if you want it. A handy tagging and rating system makes sorting through them easier than you'd expect, and a simple (if slightly over restrictive) editor allows you to forge your own puzzles should you feel no one has made one that's just quite right for you yet. It took a long time to get here, but in the end Ichi is just as much fun as it was when I first played it ages ago long before it managed to get on Steam, and can recommend it without reservation to anyone interested in an immensely easy to put up and hard to put down puzzler.","June 17, 2014","true","2.1"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","21","24","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MikeWelch/recommended/300300/","MikeWelch","ID","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MikeWelch/","658 products in account","Rather unsatisfying, simplistic little puzzler.\n\nAbout 2 hours in and having completed (with an "A" grade) almost all of the 60 official levels in the game, I've yet to find a single one of them even remotely challenging (and therefore rewarding) to figure out. And yet, I still feel like those levels have taken far longer than they should have to complete, for two reasons;\n\nFirst, because the pace of gameplay is so gratingly slow. The level starts, and within a few seconds it's pretty clear how to solve it - and you are left for several minutes just watching the ball crawl its way back and forth across the level before you can move on. Worse, maybe you overlooked something, and need to make a minor change to the sequence in which you collect the circles - so you must start again, and crawl your way along the same path again... This sense of boredom is only made worse by the extreme simplicity of the graphics, with the result that every level looks so similar as to barely be distinguishable.\n\nThe second, and probably more significant problem, is the control system. Having been designed entirely around touchscreen support, they are an overly simplistic "left-click-anywhere-does-everything" affair, with no alternate or rebinding options. It wouldn't seem like a big deal, as the game mechanics are so limited - and, as far as rotating and activating or deactivating bumpers, if you've got a smoothly functioning mouse there's no real problem. The second control mechanic of drawing lines, however, becomes unnecessarily clumsy with these controls. If, for example, you need to turn a bumper then immediately draw a line, or vice-versa, this imprecision can easily trip you up and force you to restart the level - taking us back to problem #1.\n\nOverall - as a lover of puzzle games, I became so bored as to find playing the game a chore after less than 2 hours of gameplay - which in any case, was enough to grind through almost all of the levels. Unless it's 95% off, I'd recommend avoiding this one.","July 17, 2015","false","3.9"," 27 of 37 people (73%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","73","27","37","4","0"

There are 2-3 endless music loops, with trumpet, flute, strings, piano and guitar\nDuring gameplay you have rotateable or switchable triangle bumpers to change the direction of the quick moving "pong" ball. On walls the ball is reflected except if they have spikes - then you die. Another interesting elements are a divider, switches or swirl portals. A special ability is to draw a grey reflect line per left mouse hold which is useable once. The main purpose of the game is to collect all yellow coins in a level without dying. That's all. In the standard levels you have also a bonus  for minimum use of actions.\nBut then you'll find the level creator and begin to generate your own puzzles. After you published them, they can be played by other players, rated, tagged and you earn each time a gamepoint your level is played. So try to make popular puzzles. Unfortunately the game points are highly neccessary to reach at least the 1000 points achievement. It's a real grinder.\nYou must play or generate tons of rubbish empty levels to get this last achievement.

It's a casual puzzle game where you control everything with one button.\n\nA ball slowly bounces around the level, and you must control reflectors and draw lines to make the ball hit every circle in the level. The line-drawing technique is especially cool, as it requires you to predict where the ball would bounce into unfavorable places (like spikes) and preemptively direct the ball to cut off its own future path with a line which will later bounce it back to safety.\n\nThe levels are simple and clever, but not mind-bending. It is a slow-paced, relaxing puzzle game.\n\nSo what’s with the thumbs-down?\n\nThe game is heavily focused on the level-sharing aspect, somewhat like Mario Maker. There are only 60 built-in levels, and the game advertises “tens of thousands more” levels on the title screen. 100% completionists will also find this an important part of the game, since one achievement requires having 100 other people play levels you create. There’s also a very long achievement for accruing 1,000 points, where you are only awarded one point per unique level you complete, and one for each unique click someone else gives on your levels. The only way to speed up this process is to create popular levels that a lot of people click on.\n\n95% of levels are empty rooms that instantly solve themselves. This is because everyone’s farming for clickbait for the achievements. Thanks to the fact that the player only gets a point if they beat a level, but the creator gets a point for every clickthrough, these are the only types of levels that ever get created, because they’re the only ones that get played. Puzzles that don’t look empty on the thumbnail might not even get clicked on at all.\n\nWant to browse the levels for some gems? Too bad, discoverability is abysmal: you can only view ten levels at a time, and it always returns to page 1 at the completion of any level. (Seriously?!) Levels can be tagged, but you can’t search by tags, only by ratings and popularity. Basically, if you don’t have level codes on hand from someone’s forum post or something, you’re stuck slowly paging through thousands of levels by ten at a time, then returning to page 1 after playing one.\n\nMy biggest gripe, and the main reason for the thumbs-down, is that the level editor is far, far, far too glitchy to be acceptable. To give you an idea: placing 3 teleporters in a level will prevent you from placing any teleporters in any levels until the program is restarted. Dragging a red reflector off the screen will not delete the reflector, but just make it invisible until the level is saved and reloaded – its collision box will remain and block the way of anything else you try and place. Spike objects frequently become completely locked, unable to be moved or deleted, until the level is saved and reloaded. And that’s not even getting into all the bugs with the level-testing feature, some of which will cause the ball to spawn in the wrong place or randomly take away your line-drawing power. This all amounts to a royal frustration for even the shortest of level editing sessions (unless, of course, you're just making empty rooms that instantly solve themselves)\n\nIf the editor issues were fixed, I’d easily change my verdict to a thumbs-up, but sadly there doesn’t seem to be a patch in sight. Seems the developers no longer care.\n\nIf you’re not an achievement hunter or you’re otherwise just interested in the 60 campaign levels, I wholeheartedly recommend this as a short, clever, refreshing puzzle game. But the level-sharing system is simply not worth the trouble to get involved with. And that’s a shame, because it’s supposed to be the centerpiece of the game.","April 10","false","23.8"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","12","17","0","1"

Ichi easily falls into the fun, but challenging puzzler category.\n\nIf you like "simple" puzzle mechanics (move the ball to pass through all points) that progressively get harder, then you should really enjoy this game.\n\nThe aesthetics are nice and simple and make me think of Ballpoint Universe because the background looks like blueprints drawn on grid paper. The music is nice and cheerful, however, I listen to my own music while I play.\n\nThe controls are very simple (mouse only) and instructions are given whenever a new mechanic is introduced. The learning curve is minimal, however, the levels get very challenging, and obtaining an "A" grade for each level can be extremely difficult when you reach the later levels.\n\nIn Ichi, your goal is to get a ball to pass through a number of points, in as few moves as possible. Initially, all you have to do is manipulate triangles by click the mouse, causing them to rotate - and change the trajectory of the ball when it comes in contact. Spike hazards on the walls are introduced, and you will see new mechanics like the ability to toggle solid triangles with a mouse click, or even drawing lines on the board to change where the ball will go.\n\nYou can also create your own levels and play others', greatly adding to the playability.\n\nThe game is a great time puzzler and I've added it to my time fillers between games (or just when I want some down time), alongside KAMI.\n\nVery good, challenging puzzle game, grab it if you are interested.\n\nRecommend!","August 1, 2014","true","4.5"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

The aim is to help a self-propelled yellow dot collect all yellow circles and you do that by rotating wedges, turning them on and off, teleporting, splitting and pushing buttons. Very simple to learn and a good way to unwind - if you like solving puzzles. Also included is a level editor and access to nearly 20,000 user-created levels.","June 13, 2014","true","2.6"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

While normally "indie puzzle game", "minimalistic", and "one-button" aren't good signs to me, Ichi manages to both be a good core idea and really bring out the potential of that idea to the fullest, making it simple enough to pick up instantly but surprisingly challenging and brain-twisting at times.\n\n$5 might seem a bit steep given the simplicity, and I'm not sure of the point of it coming in a two-pack at all, but it is actually a solidly-made game and easily worth the cost. Plus, if you end up really loving it, you're not going to run out of things to do in it - there's over 21,000 user-made levels even after you beat the 60 that ship with the game.\n\n(Note: I beat all but one of the premade levels back before this game was on Steam and haven't really been interested in playing it again, hence my relative lack of achievements/playtime here. I still recommend it, though.)","July 16, 2014","true","1.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The whole goal of the game is to get the ball through all the rings without this one popping/dieing by simply changing its course with a single click on the right time. There are different ways for the ball to intereact with certain objects like teleporting and bouncing off from triangles you rotate.\n\nThe game is quiet short with only 60 levels of simple but challanging puzzles, very simple "crayon drawn" style graphics and relaxing but upbeat music that doesnt get repeatitive easly.\n\nWhere the game really shines is in its level creator, letting you make and publish your own levels online, and you can obviously play over 27000+ user created levels (as of now) and rate them.\n\nPROS\n+Good  and easy to learn mechanics\n+Good music\n+Level creator\n+User created content\n\nCONS\n-No Full screen mode\n-Only a few pieces of music\n-Short loading times that take you out of the experience\n\nConclusion\nThis is definetly a good game, maybe not a must buy on Steam but I could surely find myself enjoying this on my phone during small brakes.

I really love this game, it's simple yet puzzling at the same time. Your goal is simple, guide a yellow dot to meet all the yellow rings throughout the level. But you don't take control of the dot, you command the objects within the level.\nI've only discovered six "commands"/"action objects" so far, red turning triangles, yellow portals, disappearing & reappearing blue triangles, the black splitter, the block that allows you to bounce off it, and the ability to draw a line. The former 5 are blatantly visible, the 6th is up to you. Once you discover that feature, remember it. It'll help you complete levels.\nI've cleared four more levels in Ichi than what I previously completed yesterday. Yesterday, I remember thinking, "HOW CAN YOU BEAT THIS LEVEL? IT'S LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE!", and today, about an hour after I woke up, I blazed right through them. It really helps you think outside of the box, in some ways. Since it's also a level-by-level game, it's perfect when you want to take a couple minutes break from work.\nMy only complaint is that it says "taps", as it comes from mobile platforms. It applies to touchscreen computers, but not the others. But it really isn't that major.\nIsn't this game on sale now too? For less than one dollar.

The levels are well-designed in such way that they introduce the mechanics very nicely and will teach the player to actually think ahead about how to get to all of the rings.\n\nWhile the well-made level editor provides a way for the community to make their own levels and share it with others, most of the levels are overly-simple - sometimes even completely empty - and add only white noise to the content of the community. Most likely this is due to the achievement you get for 'Uploading your own level', which is obviously redundant, considering the community content 'fallout' it has created.\n\nIn conclusion, I really enjoy playing Ichi for its charms and interesting use of mechanics. The level-editor adds a lot of creative freedom and replayability to the game, but the developer really has to think of a way to make sure that players cannot just upload an empty level for the purpose of getting an achievement. Other than that, I think that Ichi is definitely worth it's price.","January 12, 2015","true","1.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Yes the players, You the player. The levels range from a creative art piece to brain stumping puzzles which may require to draw some lines and rapid clicking.\n\nThe single Player levels are a joke, 60 simple puzzles. Just click and wait for the ball to bounce from Location A to Location B (Then again,thats the whole game), but it nets you 180 points if you do score perfect A in them. They shouldn't last you more then an hour and a half.\n\nTo call a puzzle your own, you can create one in the Creation set. It contains spikes, buttons, rocks, red/blue triangles, On/Off triangles, Pogs, buttons, teleporters and an item that doubles the amount of balls on screen. It's main feature though is to change the layout of an empty box to whatever you most desrire, IF its possible to complete. Thats right, no imposible stages for people (except for that one "Popular" stage) to play.\n\nIchi falls short due to how the developers do not seem to care about the game and many levels generated by the community that are just empty boxes. The Developers do NOT support this game anymore, nor will release a patch for any of the bugs you the players find and report.\n\nIf you think about buying this game, wait until its on sale, buying at the $5 price is step for a game with no support from the Devs, or better yet, a simple flash game.","December 10, 2015","false","20.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The whole goal of the game is to get the ball through all the rings without this one popping/dieing by simply changing its course with a single click on the right time. There are different ways for the ball to intereact with certain objects like teleporting and bouncing off from triangles you rotate.\n\nThe game is quiet short with only 60 levels of simple but challanging puzzles, very simple "crayon drawn" style graphics and relaxing but upbeat music that doesnt get repeatitive easly.\n\nWhere the game really shines is in its level creator, letting you make and publish your own levels online, and you can obviously play over 27000+ user created levels (as of now) and rate them.\n\nPROS\n+Good and easy to learn mechanics\n+Good music\n+Level creator\n+User created content\n\nCONS\n-No full-screen mode\n-Only a few pieces of music\n-Short loading times that take you out of the experience\n\nThis is definetly a good game, maybe not a must buy on Steam but I could surely find myself enjoying this on my phone during small breaks.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CrazyC0330/recommended/300300/","CrazyC0330","CrazyC0330","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CrazyC0330/","91 products in account","Ichi is a solid game build on a simple concept.  It's completely mouse driven, requiring only a number of left-clicks per level.  The first click starts a ball in motion.  This ball will bounce off walls and other objects, such as triangles (which cause right angle direction changes).  Other clicks rotate triangles, or make them disappear or reappear, etc.  Using these principles, your goal is to guide the ball to areas of the 2D level to collect rings.  Early levels have 1 or 2 rings, later levels have more, or are harder to collect.\n\nAll the shapes that can be interacted with will do so whenever you click, so where you are pointing does not matter.  In fact, the clicking could have very well been implemented as a keyboard press, though I imagine left-clicking was chosen due to sometimes having to click multiple times quickly.\n\nThe levels the game comes with do not take long to progress though, though you will likely replay them at least once to better your score.  There is a grading system based on the number of clicks it took to complete a level.  For example, clearing a level might require 3 clicks in order to get an A, up to 6 clicks gets you a B, and any more than that and you get a C.  In another level, the number of clicks for the A is different.  Your goal then is to get an A in each level, which doesn't take a whole lot of time, and that's fine.\n\nThe meat of where I spent my time was creating/sharing my own levels, and then playing those made by others.  This is a cool feature of the game, however, due to the grindy nature of the achievements tied to this feature, (make x levels, play x levels), most people just create crappy levels instead of trying to add to the vibe of the levels that came with the game.  There is a rating system, so that after you play a level, you have the opportunity to give it 1-5 stars and also give it descriptive words such as "easy" or "fast" or even "rubbish".  However, there is no culling of poorly rated levels, nor a way to disclude them from showing up when looking for new user-levels to play.\n\nIn the end though, despite the shortcomings of the user-made section of the game, the packaged levels are good, the rating system is not too tough, and the game idea is a solid implementation of a simple concept.  The graphics are minimal, but not in a lazy way.  It comes across as more of a stylistic choice rather than lack of artist situation.\n\nI've talked two friends into also owning this game, so I definitely recommend it, especially when on sale.  I picked it up literally at 90% off, so I definitely got my 49 cents worth.  Whether full price is worth it, is up to you, but I can tell you I've spent $5 on a lot worse things!","April 19","true","18.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
