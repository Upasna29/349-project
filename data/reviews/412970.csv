Now YOU get to be the disc jockey, and you will tour around Symphonia and perform sensational concerts with your new partner… the one and only Beatbuddy is at your side! Ladies and Gents, let’s bring the house down!\n\nBeatbuddy: On Tour is casual/action game where you take the role of a disc jockey and the conductor will be Beatbuddy.  You control a blue hand and with it you have to hover over an instruments or stars (the gold ones) as soon as they appear, not only to make a great beat but to score some great points too! However, it is not that simple. You see, each instrument or star has a ring around it with 3 different colours. From the left to the right you will have green, yellow and red. As soon as you see either an instrument or a star with the colourful band, just hover your hand over it. Stay still and you will see an inner white ring which starts its 360 degrees circle. As soon as the inner white band finishes its circle, and the outer ring is still on the green, you will score maximum points. But if you let it pass the red colour, you will lose a life. Be careful as you have only 3 lives to spare.  The difficulty arises when some instruments have the colourful band going faster than others. This means you have to make the right choose very quickly. Bear in mind that your objective is to score the maximum number of points to get 3 golden stars on that level.\n\nOn top of that, some levels will have jewels dropping down the screen and you will have to catch them too… fun … fun…fun…!\n\nBe careful of the red stars; touch them and you will lose a life, and let me tell you in some levels they are coming from every angle and they move too, the buggers!\n\nBeatbuddy: On tour has 36 levels to beat and offers 3 types of difficulty, which are - normal (the game starts on this difficulty), hard and super hard, which have to be unlocked. They are two modes to play: freestyle (make sure you unlock all instruments), and world tour.\n\nThis game is all about having good reflexes and making the right move on time. The graphics are nice, you have a funky soundtrack and the game is well priced. You can play with your mouse, Touch and the game support  Intel® RealSense™ camera controls.\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~\n\n-	Works on your reflexes, fast gameplay\n-	36 levels to beat in 3 difficulties\n-	Good soundtrack\n-	Achievements\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	Repetitive\n-	No trading cards\n\nIf you like Beatbuddy, have good reflexes and enjoy funky music, just join Beatbuddy: On Tour!\n\n7.5/10\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.
