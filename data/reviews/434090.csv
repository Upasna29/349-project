Draw bridges are goofy and have a lot of weird oddities. They snap open or closed to surrounding roadways, which is just dumb.\n2. You have to progress through the bridges one at a time. Don't like a scenario? Too bad, you can try another bridge until you beat the one you're on.\n\nGraphics are ok, controls are ok, but overall, just feels sloppy.","April 29","false","1.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The graphics are fine, the gameplay has a very gentle difficulty curve, and the missions are varied enough to keep your interest. The interface could use a little bit of polish, especially when it comes to making the differences clear between hard connections and movable joints, but since it's only 10 bucks, there is nothing really I could complain about. If you like bridge building games, Bridge!2 is well worth a look.","April 29","true","5.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
