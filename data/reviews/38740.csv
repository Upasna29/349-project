Picking up small prisms that are dotted around the level speeds up your cube and gives you a higher rating for completing a level. There is also the ability to perform 'edge time' by balancing your cube on one of it's edges which allows you to hang off the side of walls. It's a mixture of balance and timing but it rewards you with time reduction at the end of the level.\n\nEach new level, of which there are over eighty, represents a new challenge and new gameplay mechanics, learning these new mechanics is fairly simple as there are clues along the way. Its success lies in its simplicity. Get your cube from point A to point B in the fastest time you can manage.\n\nIt can be frustrating at times and there are a couple of fiendishly tricky sequences that can verge on annoying/frustrating but it's also incredibly addictive and rewarding.\n\nIt's not a traditional puzzle game nor is it platform game, it's something in between and it's great fun.","July 13, 2013","true","18.1"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","21","22","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CuteC3/recommended/38740/","CuteC3","Adobe Cute C3","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CuteC3/","124 products in account","I have much to say about this game, I got it last sales for 0.99 and I’d say it’s worth buying for that price.\nBut about the whole gameplay, I’d say there is much you can do to make it better.\n\n————CONTROLS————\nBefore I start I want to talk about the controls because thats what most of the thumbs-down say aren’t good. Luckily in the settings there is a way you can change this. The default is more for left-handers, but you can change it for right-handers in the settings. It’s called North-west or North-east something like that. Once you have it set your way there should be no problem at all. If you’ve ever played Bloxorz you should have no problem.\n\n————GRAPHICS————\nOk now about the graphics, what made me want to buy this was defiantly because of the clean and colourful design. The movements and animations are smooth and the cube is beautiful. A comment said “ letting you’re cube flash won’t make your game better “ Maybe thats true but the flashing cube sure made me want to buy this.\n\n————GAMEPLAY————\nYou are a cube that has to reach the end platform for each level. You use AWSD or up down left right to control yourself around obstacles. Now the game is called EDGE for a reason, they had a great idea of you balancing on your edge to stick to the sides of platforms. If you do it right you can hang on for 10 sec and beyond. Normally 5 average for me, which is enough to get past all the levels.\n\n————RE-SPAWN / CHECKPOINTS————\nThank you, thank you for having this or I would have stopped playing after half and hour. This game is based on speed which means your ranking and score is based on the time you took to complete each level. I usually get the lowest score LOL, but I’m just glad I finish it. The thing is you can almost respawn after each mistake, each checkpoint is only like 2 meters apart so you can finish a level even if you suck.\n\n———— READ THIS————\nNow here is where I want to talk about this game. YOU HAVE NO GOAL. NO SATISFACTION.\nHumans like to think they accomplished something, even if it is the stupidest thing. Maybe its about their reaction time, or how smart they are. If they beat a level they thought was a challenge, they would want to play more. It is a complicated balance - hard enough to be a goal but not too hard to make them quit.\n\nYou see, you saved your game by giving all the checkpoints, that is sweet. But now to the game play!!! All those fancy platforms flying around and transforming is just a pain in the ♥♥♥. It has no help to the player and nothing to do with the game. It’s just like showing off fancy graphics, so yeah , I have to wait 10 seconds for this platform to come over just so I can go on it and take me to the next platform. I’d rather just walk on a bridge to the next place.\nThe thing is it doesn’t help and is annoying.\n\nAlso something I wanted to say is that you have these random blocks fall out / push me /transform in random directions, and you somehow assume the player is going to know your crazy moves on their first attempt.\nWhat happens is I die 5 times. Yeah ok, I know the pattern now so its simple and thats it! So easy!! The player does no feel a challenge because it wasn’t, It was just frustrating. And at the end it was easy because I died so I know how to do it now.\n\n!!!NO!!! you must let the player think they can do it on their first attempt !!\nLET them think they can do better !\nNot you NOT the developers. Make obstacles that actually have a pattern.\nLet the player know there is danger ahead. Let them see how they can avoid something as long as they think fast enough!\n\nTHIS GAME COULD HAVE BEEN SO INTERESTING!\nIt’s not that pleasant to right a long review, But I actually care about this game. Thats why I made sure I played all the basic levels before commenting on it. I just wanted you to know how much better this could be, and I love the edge time concept. You can add in a release button. Sometimes I’m stuck on the wall and I want to let go, but I can’t. Let there be a release button so the player can jump off when he/she wants.\n\nAnyway, yeah, this game is relaxing because of the respawn, usually just when you want to play a game but don’t have too much time, 1 or 2 of the levels should do the job.\n\nP.S music is awesome","March 16, 2015","true","2.8"," 22 of 26 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","22","26","0","8"

All the puzzles have one or two tricky parts, but you'll have more difficulty because of the camera angle than the actual level. You will need to use the top-down map to get through these parts, as sometimes your own block obscures obstacles or holes. One of the hardest parts of the game is hanging on to the edges of blocks, but more about that later.\n\n\nISSUESThis game, as I mentioned before, suffers from a camera perspective issue. This affects the game mostly when you have to differentiate between blocks of different levels and heights. As of now, you can work with this mostly as a trial-and-error situation. However, it makes speed runs or flawless runs very difficult.\n\n\nPERFORMANCEI tested this game in both integrated graphics (Intel HD 4600) and dedicated graphics (GeForce GTX 860M 2GB). The performance of the game was phenomenal with both types. It ran well both in 1080p full screen and 900p windowed. Even on dedicated graphics, the game didn't generate too much heat. There were no unexpected crashes in my experience. Another game by the same developer, Rush, suffers from huge performance issues, an I'm pleased to see that the devs have really stepped up their game (no pun intended) with EDGE.\n\n\nSOUNDTRACKPersonally, I loved the 8-bit feel of the game's sound. It is not distracting from the game in any way, and is in general just really enjoyable to hear. One thing to point out is that this game can be played 100% without the sound, making a great quick-fix game when you don't have headphones available.\n\n\nGAMEPLAYIn EDGE, you are a block that can pivot on its edges onto other blocks. You can also hang onto moving blocks, shrink down in size and scale walls, and find shortcuts on many levels. The hanging-on-moving-blocks is fairly difficult; when you progress into the game, many of the movement times get longer and therefore harder to hold onto. To complete each level, you have to find your way to the end while collecting colorful cubes along the way. Some cubes are significantly harder to find than others, but it is not necessary to find all of them to pass a level. At the end of each level, you are assigned a grade based on your time, number of failed attempts, and cubes found. You'll find yourself constantly replaying levels just to get the highest grade you can.\n\n\nOVERVIEWEDGE is without a doubt one of the most fun and addicting platformers I have played. Although it is fairly short, it has great replay value and once you start, you'll want to keep playing.\n\nAspect        Rating                Difficulty        7                Performance        10                Gameplay        10                Graphics        8                Issues        6                Overall        8\nTL;DRI got this game on sale for under a buck. It was a phenomenal deal. This puzzler has plenty of levels and is challenging enough to keep you playing, failure after failure. Having played this dev's other games (Toki Tori and RUSH), I can say that this one is probably my favorite. Great deal on sale, but still worth the whole 8 bucks if you like puzzle games.\n\nBe sure to check out any of my other reviews on my profile, and please upvote if this helped you, I hope it did!

Well, this game grows on you. At the beginning, I was kind of disappointed in Two Tribes. Then, I decided: "ok, I'll just beat the levels". After I did, I was "What the hell, I'll get all the achievements!" (and I did). One thing though: I started playing it on an old computer and the gameplay sucked. Unless you're running the game way above recommended settings (maybe just a video card with some decent dedicated memory will do), your experience probably won't be as good as it should be.\n\nPros:\nOver 100 levels that are nice and feel unique\nIt's challenging, fun, and you grow to like it more as you play it\nBGM is varied and all tunes are nice\nNice minimalist graphics (it's a pro for me)\nYou don't get thoughts like "If only this game had this feature..." or "Too bad it's missing from the game", which is a great sign. It feels like a 100% completed game\nHas some replay value if you aim for high scores\nCons:\nThere's not much of a difficulty curve. It isn't rare to play a easier level after a tough one (and that's the only con I can think of)\nBought on / for: Steam Store for R$ 2.79 (US$ 1.22) - totally worth it!","August 13, 2014","true","17.1"," 18 of 23 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","18","23","0","0"

(However, I would reccomend that you already know how to use your keyboard, eyes, and reactions.)\n\n* Quick download, low amount of space required, and little to no set up. This encourages people to jump right into the game, without having to mess with tons of configuration files to get a smoot, nice gameplay experience\n\n--------------\nCon's:\n--------------\n* The settings tab doesn't have very many choices in terms of render quality. (But the game isn't graphically intensive, so this is ruled out.)\n\n* The controls are solid, but it is hard to enterperate what it will do sometimes. This is only very few amount of times, so don't let it deter you from getting this masterpiece of a puzzle game.\n\n--------------\nIn Conclusion:\n--------------\nThis game is alot of fun for anyone, with interesting gameplay elements that get you engaged, without giving you a lot of stress like most puzzle games give you nowadays, as at some moments, it will get you on the EDGE... See what I did there? Anyway, I would give this Indie title a 9 out of 10, and I strongly reccomend you BUY THIS GAME AND GO PLAY IT!","December 19, 2014","true","4.1"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

The thing I like the most about "Edge" is that you can choose your "level of difficulty" in each stage for your own. If you decide to only go for the exit it will be pretty easy. There are a lot of checkpoints and they are mostly placed fair and reasonable. If you are playing this way "Edge" ist a normal platformer and getting to the end is not a question of knowing where to go but of your ability to move the cube the way you want. The next step would be collecting all the prisms scattered through the levels which is still easy although you have to think for some of them. The next thing to do is trying to get better times either way for the S+-rank (you need to collect all prisms for that) or competing for the leader-boards (just getting to the end the fastest way possible). At this point I would consider "Edge" as a puzzle-platformer since you need to find out what the best route is, where you should go first, looking for shortcuts and paying attention to timing for moving platforms etc. You also have to consider where you can and have to use the Edge-Time which is basically your cube clinging to a wall with just one edge. All the time spent as Edge-time will later on not be counted to your total time and therefore influence your results largely. So getting the best time possible is not only a question of sheer ability but also cleverness and like I said before is the part of the game I, personally, would consider as a puzzle.\nAlthough the graphic is minimalistic most levels give a different feeling and are unique and interesting with many interesting themes. Beside the games main 48 levels there is a free DLC with another 44 brilliant levels and additional 17 levels can be obtained by joining the Edge group at least if you are playing on Steam. To round this experience up the game comes with a catchy soundtrack which mostly will not annoy you.","October 30, 2012","true","102.8"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Our goal is to decide the best way to execute the solution, and then put it into motion. It's a puzzle of action, more than traditional puzzles which only exercise intellect.\n\nA good amount of skill is certainly required to master the cube, as its shape and weight make its movement distinct to the game.\n\nThere's a ranking system per level, and some not-so-hidden areas (see the map on the upper left) so that gives you lots of replay value as you strive to earn the highest ranking. Any game that encourages you to keep practicing is doing something right.\n\nYou'll be ripping your hair out as early as Level 10 ('Metro' will mess you up). It's a grand opportunity to practice patience, persistence and perseverance.\n\nDefinite recommendation for puzzle lovers and enthusiasts. Bonus for music lovers: the soundtrack is gorgeous.

You play as a cube with one main goal: get to the end of each level. In some stages, this is simple. In others, prepare for an onslaught of obstacles that will push you to your limits. Both casual players and hardcore ones will find appeal in EDGE. Don't believe me? Take a look below to see everything it does right.\n\nPros:\nEDGE has a grand total of 109 levels, all of them having unique traits and different ways of swiftly completing them. If you like the gameplay, you are not about to get bored.\nSpeaking of the gameplay, it's awesome. The few controls the game needs work flawlessly on the keyboard, which is what I used to play it. It is one of those delightful games that is quick to learn and difficult to master. Edge Time in particular can be very difficult to become good at. It may sound easy to tap a key and stay on the edge of a stage piece, but be warned, it is a lot harder than you might think.\nThe tutorials are well-constructed. In levels with new mechanics or potentially obscure paths, there are glowing squares to move your cube on. A ghost cube will appear to show you what to do. Thus, you can either watch the tutorials as many times as you want, or ignore them completely.\nFor a game like EDGE, the graphics do not need any sort of intensity. They are simplistic and they work perfectly. The colors are easy on the eyes and the levels look great.\nI really enjoy the music. There are lots of catchy tracks, and the electronic theme throughout the soundtrack is fitting. They are a good pace for the gameplay, too.\nEach level can get anywhere from a D-Rank to an S-Rank. Want to play the game leisurely? Ignore the scores and do as you will. Want to be an expert at it? Keep coming back and memorizing those levels. There is a fantastic amount of replaying potential, even after an S-Rank, because your best times will be saved!\nThe menus are crisp, clean, and easy to navigate. There are not too many options that you have to juggle between.\nIt runs smoothly. Not much space is needed for EDGE, and most computers will have no trouble with it.\nThere are achievements that range in difficulty. A lot of them can be gotten without too much trouble. Completing all of the levels with S-Ranks, though... I raise my nonexistent hat to anyone who can pull that one off.\nThe price is reasonable. I've put a lot of hours into EDGE, and for a base price of $7.99, you will get a lot of bang for your buck. Want to be cheap? You can wait for sale, where the Two Tribes bundle of four games (one being EDGE) is about $0.99. That's how I got EDGE, and I feel kind of dirty for that after experiencing how much fun it is.\nEvery time you enter the game, it says "hi" to you. How nice of it! Not many games take the time to greet you.\nNeutral:\nWhile there is partial controller support, I really see no reason to use a controller. The keyboard works perfectly. It is there if players want it, and having more options is good, if nothing else.\nSome of the achievements are difficult to figure out without any help. Some people might like the challenge. Others will be hitting the guides ASAP. I liked most of them, but when they get obscure, they get obscure.\nThe plot is nonexistent beyond, "You are a cube. You have to get to the end of the level. Go." It also has no need for a plot, so there you go. Hand-in-hand with this is a lack of characters or characterization, unless you count how smug the Dark Cube seems to be at times. Evil little jerk.\nThere are no trading cards. It is kind of funny to wonder what they would be if they existed. "Cube." "Small Cube." "Dark Cube." "Ghost Cube." ...Okay, I guess it could kind of work, but the game really doesn't need them.\nCons:\nTrying to get Edge Time can leave your fingers rather sore. It requires precise tapping, and sometimes you need to do that for a long period of time. I understand why it works the way it does, but I wish a method existed that didn't leave your fingers scowling at your life choices.\nA few of the levels are pretty darn hard. Even with frequent checkpoints, they can be rage-inducing.\nThe levels with the Dark Cube force you to speedrun them. Most of the levels are lax about whether you want to speedrun or not, and I prefer that option instead of being made to rush ahead.\nOverall experience:\n\nI had no idea what to expect when I first started playing EDGE. It was a surprise to me when I got hooked so quickly. I was really glad I had gotten it, especially since it was a bundle with the other Two Tribes games. I plan to try playing those sometime soon as well. As a side note, check out their upcoming game, RIVE. It will be their last game before they retire, so let's show them our support for their final masterpiece!\n\nRating:\n\n8.5/10. EDGE was made with a clear goal in mind, and it succeeds. I had a blast playing it, and I plan to continue revisiting it in hopes of S-Ranking all of the levels. Someday, I might manage it. Someday...\n\nLooking for more great indie games?

Knowing the mobile version, I can say that EDGE just doesn't feel like it's meant to be played on a computer. This is mainly due to the fact that the handling is horrible. Even with a gamepad, it's extremely hard to get the hang of the controls.\nSo, as much as I loved the iPhone version, I can't advise you to buy this game. If you want to try it for its cool graphics and mechanics, 70 cents surely won't hurt anyone.

The addition of movable platforms and platforms with special effects help to keep up the interest level. Unfortunately the keyboard controls don't work well with the game. For example, pressing the right arrow key once doesn't make the cube move one square immediately; it makes the cube start to tilt. Holding down the key makes the cube tilt and move to the next square. This makes levels which require precise timing and control a lot harder than necessary. Other than that, it's still a very interesting game, so if you can get past the difficult controls, you'll enjoy the game.","August 31, 2014","true","2.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

You don't want just to finish the game and the levels, but master them. At first, it's easy and given you interrogation marks as tutorials/guides.

The level design and pacing of the mechanics/timing go hand in hand and make for a fantastic, albeit very shallow learning curve where you're constantly trying to push on to the next level. EDGE generally doesn't have anything to rant nor rave about, but it's a good, solid, fun game, and that's often enough.\n\nHighlights\nWhat makes this better than average is its combination of sharp graphics and art-style, serene and ambient music and incredibly good level design. They serve to keep each level fun and keep frustration to a minimum and keep you engaged and wanting to get further.\n\n* Originally designed as mobile game, the Steam version came with the removal of the FPS lock and full resolution, which shows a level of respect for the players and platform\n* Simple, timeless design and graphics and a minimalist overlay and title screen mean this game wont feel out-dated for a long time\n\nMistakes\nTwo Tribes, who went far on the success of Toki Tori, are a small Dutch company who have worked on a ridiculously large range of platformers, and with a ton of big developers, and the polish and testing that you see in their games is the result of this. Everything works well and you'll be hard pushed to find mistakes, problems and things that take away from gameplay in their titles.\n\nThere are a few levels where you might be frustrated too much to continue, or suffer more than you want, but they're few and far between and actually add a higher level of challenge.\n\nRecommendations\nAt £5.49/7.99€/$7.99 and with at least 4 hours of main gameplay across 100+ levels, and plenty more for completionists, EDGE has plenty of content, but may feel overpriced, especially when you consider the fairly simple mechanics. I'd recommend waiting for a -50% drop or more before picking it up.\n\nEDGE is also available in the Two Tribes Classics Pack and Two Tribes Pack (which also includes Toki Tori 2+ for around double the price). Since Toki Tori 2+ is fairly poor, and both EDGE and Toki Tori are above average games, if you like the look of either of those two you will benefit from picking up the Classics Pack instead, especially when on sale.\n\n* There're 4 hidden levels and an Edge Tool which you can use to edit game files and install new levels and add a bunch of new content.","July 12, 2015","true","3.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

Cubes, rather. Because they're three-dimensional.\n\n\nThis is Edge. Original title, yes. They came up with it all by themselves.\n\n\nEdge is a game about squares that must roll around other squares in order to collect squares and make it to the square at the end of all of the other squares.\n\n\nIt's easy to see where its simplistic roots come from. Edge originally launched on iOS, with ports later coming to many more platforms including the Wii U, 3DS, PC, and Android. A mobile game, of course. That explains everything.\n\n\nEdging is a simple concept. Masturbate until you're right on the verge of climax, and then stop. Right at the edge. Wait for your body to settle down, and then do it again. Pushing slowly closer and closer to the edge, building up the tension in you as the sweet release of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ lies just out of reach. Sometimes it's a little kinkier, with a dom policing your edging. If you ♥♥♥ too soon, they beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of you.\n\n\nThis game is kinda like that.\n\n\nIt's not really a puzzle game. Calling this a puzzle game is like calling a traffic light a puzzle game. Green means go, red means stop. I mean, I suppose that's kind of a puzzle. Especially if you're colorblind. Or completely blind, that usually makes things like crossing the street or driving kind of difficult. Especially if it's an ambulance, with a lady giving birth inside. She's all grunting and pushing and trying to get the baby out, and her husband is all "What the ♥♥♥♥ are you doing, who are you, stop please, you're gonna kill us all" and getting on your case for stealing an ambulance that just so happened to be parked outside someone's house. It might not even be an ambulance, it might just be a family's SUV. In labor, having a panic attack because you forced yourself into their car, same thing.\n\n\nIt's not really any kind of game. There's what could be called obstacles or puzzles all around each course, but they're always simplistic and easily maneuverable in a way that's only vaguely stimulating.\n\n\nEdge is pretty good for a mobile game at least. It's relaxing to roll squares around while you're pooping. And the art style is extremely satisfying. Some very striking minimalism. It's very nice just to look at.\n\n\nDon't know what the ♥♥♥♥ is happening in this game, but there's some damn fine lookin' squares. Mmm, mmm.\n\n\nIf you're looking for a game to really push you, challenge you, and get you riled up, Edge is not it. There's no climax to Edge, much like actual edging. There's just squares. Lots, and lots of ♥♥♥♥ing squares.\n\n\nIt's a perfect example of the great things designers are capable of on mobile. And, at the same time, the many drawbacks of mobile. It's designed with simplicity, accessibility, and ease of getting into in mind. It's easy to pick up a level, play it, and stop. It's not something that could realistically hold your attention for longer than an hour, but poops don't usually take that long anyway. Considering it's only a couple bucks, it's definitely worth it.\n\n\nShort, sweet, and simple. But clever, smart, and stylish. By far some of the nicest squares I've ever seen. But still, this game is literally just ♥♥♥♥ing squares. That's all it is. All there is to it.\n\n\nLike they always say. Every square has its edges. They usually say that about roses, actually. But a game about roses would be even stupider than a game about stupid ♥♥♥♥ing squares.","January 4","true","0.1"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","60","6","10","7","1"

I hate using that word, but that's literally what it does.\n\nControlling the cube is tedious at first but I can get over that. The mechanics are original and work well. However, most of the levels don't use those mechanics in a clever way. The game isn't hard or challenging, it's just annoying. It's the level design that's atrocious. Obstacles aren't layed out for you to clear, they just appear out of nowhere and push you out of the stage, or they make you wait for platforms to stop messing around before you can take them.\nPlus, gray cubes in space, really? Making your cube constantly flashing doesn't make the levels more visually appealing.\n\nQuite a few of my Steam friends own this game yet none of them played past the first few levels. Less than 20% of the players have cleared 24 levels. That should tell a lot about the game.\n\nI haven't played the extra levels so maybe they're more fun to play, but the main levels are really, really annoying.","December 27, 2014","false","2.9"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","8","14","0","7"

Two Tribes does not disappoint here. Edge is incredibly fun and addictive, and I found myself laughing and praising the game when I was tricked by some of the levels, rather than getting frustrated and raging. If I had one gripe, it'd be that I was kinda sad to see the Steam version doesn't have a level editor and Workshop support.

I enjoyed the music, and the visual style is pure eye-candy.\nBut the controls are incredibly disorienting and awkward and the puzzles are infuriating at times because of it.\nThere were some parts in this game that I really liked.

The obstacles are wonderfully built and the sheer amount of thinking that went into this game will baffle you.\n\nSo would I reccomend this game...?

This one, however, quickly grew on me. Edge is more than just a puzzle game, it's a puzzle platformer that progressively gets harder, but remains fun and relaxing.\n\nAt first glance, I was thinking "Oh great, I'm a cube"... 5 minutes later, I just couldn't put it down (had to force myself). I never thought being a cube could actually feel interesting and challenging in a isometric platformer.\n\n- The level design teaches you something new every level.\n\n- If you mess up, its physics / game mechanics feel too solid to blame the game.\n\n- Most relaxing game I have played. It makes you think, but it doesn't overcomplicate / confuse.\n\n- Graphics/Audio are amazing and consistent.\n\n- While the game's highscore focuses on a completionist/time scale, its game design makes it a solid experience for those who just want to pick up and play a puzzle platformer casually.\n\n- Highly recommend for any (new/veteren) puzzle/casual/platformer player.","January 3, 2015","true","1.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I bought it only because it was on sale and looked interesting. I thought it was going to be one of those games when you say "I am bored, might as well play this". Well, one day I did get bored, and I played. For five hours without playing any other game, I was hooked. This game is very in depth too with over 90 levels and bonus levels. EDGE can also be a SpeedRun game for anyone who likes to get WR times but there is no global leaderboard unfortunately. Okay, let's actually explain the game. You are a super physicy cube that rolls around collecting other cubes. Sounds lame right? That's what I thought. The levels get really creative with moving platforms, coding puzzles, and even turning tiny to fit through small holes or to climb up a wall. The difficulty curve is perfect and as you learn different ways to play, you see them in the future levels and are like, "oh I remember how to do this!" The game teaches you almost everything within the first 15 or so levels. The controls are also spot on. They are very simple: the arrow keys. The more you hold down a key, the more the block rolls over (hence the physics part of the game). I rate this game 9/10.","January 2, 2015","true","5.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's kind of a puzzle platformer, but a lot of the puzzles are trial and error, and the lack of a jump button makes it hard to consider a platformer.\nI'm really impressed at the creativity of the level design given the 5 or so distinct level design objects in this game, they really did their best to keep things fresh an interesting in that regard. Not even every level is that good, there are some pretty garbage ones, of course, but I never felt like I was playing the same thing over and over again.

The thing I like the most about "Edge" is that you can choose your "level of difficulty" in each stage for your own. If you decide to only go for the exit it will be pretty easy. There are a lot of checkpoints and they are mostly placed fair and reasonable. If you are playing this way "Edge" ist a normal platformer and getting to the end is not a question of knowing where to go but of your ability to move the cube the way you want. The next step would be collecting all the prisms scattered through the levels which is still easy although you have to think for some of them. The next thing to do is trying to get better times either way for the S+-rank (you need to collect all prisms for that) or competing for the leader-boards (just getting to the end the fastest way possible). At this point I would consider "Edge" as a puzzle-platformer since you need to find out what the best route is, where you should go first, looking for shortcuts and paying attention to timing for moving platforms etc. You also have to consider where you can and have to use the Edge-Time which is basically your cube clinging to a wall with just one edge. All the time spent as Edge-time will later on not be counted to your total time and therefore influence your results largely. So getting the best time possible is not only a question of sheer ability but also cleverness and like I said before is the part of the game I, personally, would consider as a puzzle.\nAlthough the graphic is minimalistic most levels give a different feeling and are unique and interesting with many interesting themes. Beside the games main 48 levels there is a free DLC with another 44 brilliant levels and additional 17 levels can be obtained by joining the Edge group at least if you are playing on Steam. To round this experience up the game comes with a catchy soundtrack which mostly will not annoy you.","May 21, 2014","true","0.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

This game is where you are a cube and you have to flip to get to the finish. This is a really good mind game to be played. This game is very addictive for a person like me. Of Course this game is not as better as Skyrim or TF2 but this is a good game and is totally worth the money. Below are listed Cons and Pros of Edge with a detailed description.\n\nPros\n\n1.Colors: Edge is a very colorful game to be played. The cube(you) always changes colors even when its resized to a smaller size. Whole game is wonderfully made with great textures and colors.\n\n2. Brainy: You have to figure out a way to get to the colorfull boxes surrounding the finish. On the way to the finish, you will discover great mind power you will need. This game has about 45-46 levels(i think). All from easy to hard.\n\nCons\n\nNothing:)\n\nIs this game worth your money?\nOf course it is!

The game is super easy, but the controls are HORRIBLE. The cube attaches on whatever it wants, and it moves freely in a way, it doesn't just go from one square to another, you could press the button to go forward and it will barely tip forward, and then if you hold it go to the next one, you go right off the edge!\n\nI will say the game has a great art style, idea, and soundtrack. I loved those aspects of it and most likely will continue to play it for those reasons, and I understand that being a cube would be slow and tedious, but if you're going to make a game no matter what shape or size the character is, at least let it control well.\n\nI would recommend it for the first few levels, but after that it becomes unfairly difficult because of the controls. I tried it with a keyboard and controller, but both were slow and pretty bad.\n\nI personally got it really cheap with 2 other Two Tribes game, but it might be worth the full price to some people.","December 31, 2014","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The controls infuriate me beyond belief.      I've read some of the other negative comments, but I have played isometric puzzlers since Ant Attack on the ZX81 and Marble Madness on the AtariST.  It's not the NW/NE/SW/SE thing that really irritates me (as it does others), it's the way the controls REACT DIFFERENTLY BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF STUFF ON THE SCREEN!!!\n\nYou're a cube, and unlike most cube games where you ROLL along nicely, in this game, there's inertia and proper physics.  Have you ever tried to ROLL a cube?  It's about as much fun as shaving your privates.  It's why the square wheel never really took off.\n\nThe Physics engine is tied to the frame rate, so when there's less on the screen, the cube reacts a lot faster to your controls, and falls back at a different rate too.  So a light tap on the up key in one part of a level might allow you to lift yourself gently and get some 'edge time', while at another, it'll flip you boldy completely over two tiles and into the chasm.\n\nThe name, and the point of the game are to 'hang' on your 'edges', but hanging on edges is  so flipping HARD with keys.  I've worn a little gap in the surface of my down arrow repeatedly trying to get the 60 second edge-time achievement (bloody hard).\n\nSo, What do I think about the game?  It's music and aesthetics are okay..  The controls are clunky, variable, and highly annoying.    The level design is interesting and sometimes actually fun.\n\nWould I recommend this game?  If you haven't played Rush yet, yes.  If you've already played Rush, then this will be more of the same, with a much more irritating control system.   The only thing which really makes this stand out are the mobile levels which 'morph' on the click of a button.  That was fun.. But the 'click a button, then dodge a piece of flying platform' mechanic gets old.\n\nYes, if this game is a few quid, get it, play it, then move on.  I'd give it a 'Meh' out of 10.\n\nADVICE: Play this game on a high-end PC and frame limit it to 60fps.  Then the controls will at least be uniform across the game.","July 6, 2014","true","20.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Cela peut paraître basique, facile, mais il n'en est rien : avec seulement les touches fléchées, les possibilités sont aussi tordues que les idées des concepteurs de niveaux ! Petit ou grand, en mouvement ou inactif, ce petit cube devient vite atrocement stressant. Tout va de plus en plus vite, l'équilibre demandé est de plus en plus précis, et les chutes dans le vide sont fréquemment une hantise qui pousse à commettre l'erreur qui tue. Les nombreux niveaux proposés, variés à l'extrême, offrent un chalenge de réflexion et d'agilité qui laisseront plus d'un joueur sur le carreau. Heureusement, sitôt tombé dans le vide, le cube revient pas bien loin, et l'avancée peut reprendre sans trop de frustration. Edge est l'un de ces jeux qui captivent, énervent, motivent, épatent et divertissent à la fois. Une merveille !","January 14, 2012","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But anyway, it's a very literal take on platforming, in that you have to roll your cube onto different platforms to slide it across abysses (abbisi?). Anyway, you make your cube go through many different paths, and I enjoyed it a lot.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kungfulemon/recommended/38740/","kungfulemon","Mirkwood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kungfulemon/","245 products in account","Visuals For a simple puzzle experience, this game has a stunning yet simplistic visual and aesthetic design. Almost every object in the game is a cube of some kind, yet the game still presents itself with a lot of character. There is a retro, slightly glitchy, almost VHS vibe here. Collecting bonus cubes, for example, makes the screen fizz out, desyncing the RGB channels for a split second. The menus, backgrounds, text, sounds and music all follow that aesthetic, and fit together delightfully.\n\nSound As above, the music and sounds fit perfectly with the aesthetic of the game. On top of that the music is also just, really damn good. There's a fair amount of variety too, more than I originally expected. Tasty grooves, moody analogue synth drones, retro drum hits, bleeps and bloops, all fitting well with the pace of each level. The sound effects fall in line with the same sound palette as the music; clompy tapping sounds as you move, clicks as you enable switches and interact with the environment and cheerful electronic bloops as you absorb collectables.\n\nThe whole soundtrack is  available here for free or to pay what you want for. [ninomojo.bandcamp.com]\n\nControl The controls are quite unusual at first, due to the isometric nature of the game and the fact that your cube actually has a realistic, weighty feeling to the way it moves. When you first start playing sometimes you think you'll tip over onto the next square only to fall backwards to your death. You get used to the controls pretty quickly, and once you do the game feels great. Moving around feels logical and satisfying, and the great sound effects as you click-clomp your way through the grid-based levels adds a lot to the game-feel.\n\nLevel Design Near perfect. It starts off very easy, allowing you to get used to the controls and mechanics. Every level teaches you a new mechanic or introduces new ways to use elements you’re already familiar with. The first half of the game is very relaxing, but never boring. It does eventually ramp up and present a decent challenge, with the extended and bonus levels especially. Towards the end the game drops the pretense of introducing a new idea with each level, and instead becomes all about the challenge. There are a few levels that took me even multiple days to complete with all the collectables. My only wish is that there was a level editor for community-made maps, as this game seems perfect for it.\n\nWhy It Might Not Be for You There are a lot of movement based puzzles, which challenge both your reflexes and problem solving skills. Some people will not like this, but for me the balance between movement and problem solving is ideal. Frequent checkpoints allow for the level design to surprise you and be somewhat cheeky (and funny). I don't find this annoying but I imagine some people might think it to be unfair.\n\nTL;DR A well designed movement-focused puzzle game with a nice aesthetic and good music. Recommended for anyone who enjoys puzzle games. A great game to just sit down for 10 minutes and beat a few levels, but it also lends itself quite well to long play sessions.","April 25, 2015","true","20.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It only shows me having little play time because I did most of it on the Wii U. But anyway, it's a very literal take on platforming, in that you have to roll your cube onto different platforms to slide it across abysses (abbisi?). Anyway, you make your cube go through many different paths, and I enjoyed it a lot. Some levels like the freeway one were a bit harder because you would have to think quickly on the spot of what you want to do, but overall it's worth your money.","April 8, 2015","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The controls infuriate me beyond belief.      I've read some of the other negative comments, but I have played isometric puzzlers since Ant Attack on the ZX81 and Marble Madness on the AtariST.  It's not the NW/NE/SW/SE thing that really irritates me (as it does others), it's the way the controls REACT DIFFERENTLY BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF STUFF ON THE SCREEN!!!\n\nYou're a cube, and unlike most cube games where you ROLL along nicely, in this game, there's inertia and proper physics.  Have you ever tried to ROLL a cube?  It's about as much fun as shaving your privates.  It's why the square wheel never really took off.\n\nThe Physics engine is tied to the frame rate, so when there's less on the screen, the cube reacts a lot faster to your controls, and falls back at a different rate too.  So a light tap on the up key in one part of a level might allow you to lift yourself gently and get some 'edge time', while at another, it'll flip you boldy completely over two tiles and into the chasm.\n\nThe name, and the point of the game are to 'hang' on your 'edges', but hanging on edges is  so flipping HARD with keys.  I've worn a little gap in the surface of my down arrow repeatedly trying to get the 60 second edge-time achievement (bloody hard).\n\nSo, What do I think about the game?  It's music and aesthetics are okay..  The controls are clunky, variable, and highly annoying.    The level design is interesting and sometimes actually fun.\n\nWould I recommend this game?  If you haven't played Rush yet, yes.  If you've already played Rush, then this will be more of the same, with a much more irritating control system.   The only thing which really makes this stand out are the mobile levels which 'morph' on the click of a button.  That was fun.. But the 'click a button, then dodge a piece of flying platform' mechanic gets old.\n\nYes, if this game is a few quid, get it, play it, then move on.  I'd give it a 'Meh' out of 10.\n\nADVICE: Play this game on a high-end PC and frame limit it to 60fps.  Then the controls will at least be uniform across the game.","July 6, 2014","true","20.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm not a fan of the cardinal-equals-diagonal controls, but there really isn't a way around that, and you get used to it fairly quickly once you start playing.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gravityunown/recommended/38740/","gravityunown","GravityUnown","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gravityunown/","51 products in account","Edge is a borderline solid platform game. The strongest aspect of the game is the creative use of theming of the levels; from such a simplistic graphic standpoint Edge gets really creative with the level design, using the cubic platforms for robots, gears, birds, statues, flags, snakes, you name it. That's the big draw of the game, and it's really cool to explore them all.\n\nHowever coupled with the outstanding elements are some minor problems that do affect the enjoyment to some degree. The main problem is the key configuration. Edge is designed around a diagonal, isometric point of view so every move the cube makes is in a diagonal direction. Unfortunately the controls revolve around ASDW or the arrow keys, which simulate typical Up-Down-Left-Right movements, which can cause some confusion.\n\nOne game-related problem is the poor use of checkpoints. You can't see the checkpoints but if you happen to die then the game will bring you back to a certain point in the level so you don't end up starting the entire level again. The only problem is that sometimes the checkpoints will take you a little further than where you died, or take you back to a point where you have to redo an unfairly large chunk of the level.\n\nThe other problem is the platforming, which is a bit serious. If you collect a prism then your cube moves at a fluent and quick pace for a brief amount of time, however normally the cube feels very sluggish and makes things like edge climbing and falling very taxing. There's also the problem with the moving platforms, which can cause some shenanigans. When you make the cube fall onto a moving platform, depending on where the cube fell onto it, sometimes the cube doesn't get carried with the platform and results in you just falling and dying.\n\nOverall I did find this game to be fun, and as a fun fact the game runs at a perfect 60 frames here in comparison to the 3DS eShop version, where the framerate always drops significantly. HOWEVER! Due to the quirkiness of the platform controls the game will take some getting used to, for better or for worse.","July 20, 2015","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's one of those soundtracks you just can't stop listening to - almost mesmerizing.\nTo this fair price you can't do anything wrong - one of my favourite platformer/puzzle-games!","April 7, 2014","true","16.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The music fits the theme perfectly. Not only is it good, but it suits each map well. A dark map can have a little creepier music, while bright white maps can have happy music to play with you screaming in rage. Before you start a level, a robotic voice says what the map name is. It sounds robotic. duh.\n\nAll in all it is a great game. The atmosphere of each map is great, and it starts off easy and gets harder and harder as you go.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kungfulemon/recommended/38740/","kungfulemon","Mirkwood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kungfulemon/","245 products in account","Visuals For a simple puzzle experience, this game has a stunning yet simplistic visual and aesthetic design. Almost every object in the game is a cube of some kind, yet the game still presents itself with a lot of character. There is a retro, slightly glitchy, almost VHS vibe here. Collecting bonus cubes, for example, makes the screen fizz out, desyncing the RGB channels for a split second. The menus, backgrounds, text, sounds and music all follow that aesthetic, and fit together delightfully.\n\nSound As above, the music and sounds fit perfectly with the aesthetic of the game. On top of that the music is also just, really damn good. There's a fair amount of variety too, more than I originally expected. Tasty grooves, moody analogue synth drones, retro drum hits, bleeps and bloops, all fitting well with the pace of each level. The sound effects fall in line with the same sound palette as the music; clompy tapping sounds as you move, clicks as you enable switches and interact with the environment and cheerful electronic bloops as you absorb collectables.\n\nThe whole soundtrack is  available here for free or to pay what you want for. [ninomojo.bandcamp.com]\n\nControl The controls are quite unusual at first, due to the isometric nature of the game and the fact that your cube actually has a realistic, weighty feeling to the way it moves. When you first start playing sometimes you think you'll tip over onto the next square only to fall backwards to your death. You get used to the controls pretty quickly, and once you do the game feels great. Moving around feels logical and satisfying, and the great sound effects as you click-clomp your way through the grid-based levels adds a lot to the game-feel.\n\nLevel Design Near perfect. It starts off very easy, allowing you to get used to the controls and mechanics. Every level teaches you a new mechanic or introduces new ways to use elements you’re already familiar with. The first half of the game is very relaxing, but never boring. It does eventually ramp up and present a decent challenge, with the extended and bonus levels especially. Towards the end the game drops the pretense of introducing a new idea with each level, and instead becomes all about the challenge. There are a few levels that took me even multiple days to complete with all the collectables. My only wish is that there was a level editor for community-made maps, as this game seems perfect for it.\n\nWhy It Might Not Be for You There are a lot of movement based puzzles, which challenge both your reflexes and problem solving skills. Some people will not like this, but for me the balance between movement and problem solving is ideal. Frequent checkpoints allow for the level design to surprise you and be somewhat cheeky (and funny). I don't find this annoying but I imagine some people might think it to be unfair.\n\nTL;DR A well designed movement-focused puzzle game with a nice aesthetic and good music. Recommended for anyone who enjoys puzzle games. A great game to just sit down for 10 minutes and beat a few levels, but it also lends itself quite well to long play sessions.","April 25, 2015","true","20.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It only shows me having little play time because I did most of it on the Wii U. But anyway, it's a very literal take on platforming, in that you have to roll your cube onto different platforms to slide it across abysses (abbisi?). Anyway, you make your cube go through many different paths, and I enjoyed it a lot. Some levels like the freeway one were a bit harder because you would have to think quickly on the spot of what you want to do, but overall it's worth your money.","April 8, 2015","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kungfulemon/recommended/38740/","kungfulemon","Mirkwood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kungfulemon/","245 products in account","Visuals For a simple puzzle experience, this game has a stunning yet simplistic visual and aesthetic design. Almost every object in the game is a cube of some kind, yet the game still presents itself with a lot of character. There is a retro, slightly glitchy, almost VHS vibe here. Collecting bonus cubes, for example, makes the screen fizz out, desyncing the RGB channels for a split second. The menus, backgrounds, text, sounds and music all follow that aesthetic, and fit together delightfully.\n\nSound As above, the music and sounds fit perfectly with the aesthetic of the game. On top of that the music is also just, really damn good. There's a fair amount of variety too, more than I originally expected. Tasty grooves, moody analogue synth drones, retro drum hits, bleeps and bloops, all fitting well with the pace of each level. The sound effects fall in line with the same sound palette as the music; clompy tapping sounds as you move, clicks as you enable switches and interact with the environment and cheerful electronic bloops as you absorb collectables.\n\nThe whole soundtrack is  available here for free or to pay what you want for. [ninomojo.bandcamp.com]\n\nControl The controls are quite unusual at first, due to the isometric nature of the game and the fact that your cube actually has a realistic, weighty feeling to the way it moves. When you first start playing sometimes you think you'll tip over onto the next square only to fall backwards to your death. You get used to the controls pretty quickly, and once you do the game feels great. Moving around feels logical and satisfying, and the great sound effects as you click-clomp your way through the grid-based levels adds a lot to the game-feel.\n\nLevel Design Near perfect. It starts off very easy, allowing you to get used to the controls and mechanics. Every level teaches you a new mechanic or introduces new ways to use elements you’re already familiar with. The first half of the game is very relaxing, but never boring. It does eventually ramp up and present a decent challenge, with the extended and bonus levels especially. Towards the end the game drops the pretense of introducing a new idea with each level, and instead becomes all about the challenge. There are a few levels that took me even multiple days to complete with all the collectables. My only wish is that there was a level editor for community-made maps, as this game seems perfect for it.\n\nWhy It Might Not Be for You There are a lot of movement based puzzles, which challenge both your reflexes and problem solving skills. Some people will not like this, but for me the balance between movement and problem solving is ideal. Frequent checkpoints allow for the level design to surprise you and be somewhat cheeky (and funny). I don't find this annoying but I imagine some people might think it to be unfair.\n\nTL;DR A well designed movement-focused puzzle game with a nice aesthetic and good music. Recommended for anyone who enjoys puzzle games. A great game to just sit down for 10 minutes and beat a few levels, but it also lends itself quite well to long play sessions.","April 25, 2015","true","20.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is super easy, but the controls are HORRIBLE. The cube attaches on whatever it wants, and it moves freely in a way, it doesn't just go from one square to another, you could press the button to go forward and it will barely tip forward, and then if you hold it go to the next one, you go right off the edge!\n\nI will say the game has a great art style, idea, and soundtrack. I loved those aspects of it and most likely will continue to play it for those reasons, and I understand that being a cube would be slow and tedious, but if you're going to make a game no matter what shape or size the character is, at least let it control well.\n\nI would recommend it for the first few levels, but after that it becomes unfairly difficult because of the controls. I tried it with a keyboard and controller, but both were slow and pretty bad.\n\nI personally got it really cheap with 2 other Two Tribes game, but it might be worth the full price to some people.","December 31, 2014","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I also have it on my 3DS and now on my PC via Steam. It's a nice puzzle game that (in my opinion, of course) definitely benefits from the physical controls the 3DS or the PC offer. One thing I want to mention specifically for the PC version: This game, though developed by a mobile developer and then being ported by another developer to the PC managed to have this game work perfectly with 3 Monitor setups like mine. Which is AMAZING regarding that still quite a few high budget titles on PC cannot accomplish this. Great job Two Tribes for the port on this thing, because multi-monitor gaming is not a big thing for most people, but considering this game actually does it good makes me just that much happier to play it. And even more confused why multi-million dollar production games can't accomplish this as a standard, whether many people actually use it or not. Good game, definitely worth the 0,69€ I payed for it. I might not play it for long, since I have played it since 2009 on and off, but it's still worth the buy because of the bigger screen size on a PC compared to a 3DS or other mobile devices because of controller/keyboard support.","May 16, 2015","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Have you ever played that game from website where you become a rectangiar block and you have to fall into a specific hole in order to advance? Well this game is pretty much upgraded from that. Only, much more complicated. It may look really simple in the first levels you play, but you can get the WTF reaction on the later levels. The game is similar that I just stated. Move your block into the rainbow spot. What suprised to me the most is that you can edge grab. But if you get smaller, you literally go up walls.

The Difficulty in Super Meat Boy comes from the growing complexity of levels and the eventual precision to survive some of the more demanding levels. I do however feel I have got more frustrated with Edge though.\n\nThe main reason for this is the type of obstacles. Unlike Super Meat Boy where the danger is visible and conspicuous, In Edge it is not. I have died many times to unexpected movements and blocks causing me to fall or get crushed. It became more a game of trial and error and preparing for the movements after previous failures which was not exactly what I was looking for when I picked this title up.\n\nI do however love the graphical style and OST. It is polished, runs well and the amount of gameplay you can get out of the game on a casual level is great. The additional mechanics that are introduced as you get to the more complex levels really make this game standout.","July 23, 2015","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While this is often done for effect and purposeful confusion, it's hard to tell which direction your cube is facing, and often found myself going forward instead of right. Since the camera is at an angle and not directly behind the cube, you will find moment like that a bit common, but it's more of a nuisance than a game breaking problem. While I had a better time the more I played, it was a problem that never truly went a way, but never got in the way of my enjoyment. Still, as a game all about speed, I can see it getting annoying for those looking for the best time, even with the ability to cut down time by balancing on the edges.\n\nThe entire game is fully benefited through an abundance of creativity in its level design. The sheer genius and clear amount of fun Two Tribes had coming up with the level design shows the amount of passion they have for their work, and it's all amplified with the sublime, amazingly varied electronic soundtrack that's played throughout the game. Weirdly enough, I think I had more fun finding out what weird and vaguely familiar minimalist challenge I would face next. The amount they achieve with minimalistic colors and cubes is rather stunning, and the impressive difficulty curve really does rise in accordance to the player's skill. That is something I highly respect.\n\nTop this all off with the fact that outside of the base game, there are just as many extended levels and an entire community hub for user-made levels, (plus even a few seasonal ones that come up depending on the date), you can get lost in this game for a long time. It's also one I wouldn't be surprised to come back to again even if I'm finished. Seasonal levels aren't something you see that often, and I think it's a cool little touch to keep us playing months later.\n\nBetween the insanely cheap asking price and the impressive amount of game presented, you can't get a better deal than this. Minor flaws aside, this is one of the most polished, beautifully presented indies I've played inn a long time, and it's one I'll probably finding myself come back to again and again whenever the mood hits. Definitely worth picking up if you want something a bit different.\n","July 28, 2015","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You play as this cube and you have to navigate through an actually impressively big catalog of levels. That's basically it. You get bonus points for doing it faster and for hanging onto edges. The music/sound is actually not bad, but this game is not very fun to me. You may also notice that as of the time that I'm posting this review, I have very little time played on this game. This is because there is a glitch that has turned the screen completely white for me recently, making it unplayable. Until the glitch is fixed, my reccomendation for this game is that you should not buy it, but that's just my opinion.","February 11","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its main disadvantage is having some unique mechanics but not using them often enough. The best thing about it is that it's nice and pleasant to play, you don't get horribly punished for mistakes, you just respawn next to the place you failed at. It's a bit tedious and thus best played in bursts of 15-30 minutes. At some point the concept gets tired and the later levels get rather frustrating to complete. EDGE seems to have massive discounts during sales, and it's worth trying out when that it's priced at around a buck.","March 24","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I also have it on my 3DS and now on my PC via Steam. It's a nice puzzle game that (in my opinion, of course) definitely benefits from the physical controls the 3DS or the PC offer. One thing I want to mention specifically for the PC version: This game, though developed by a mobile developer and then being ported by another developer to the PC managed to have this game work perfectly with 3 Monitor setups like mine. Which is AMAZING regarding that still quite a few high budget titles on PC cannot accomplish this. Great job Two Tribes for the port on this thing, because multi-monitor gaming is not a big thing for most people, but considering this game actually does it good makes me just that much happier to play it. And even more confused why multi-million dollar production games can't accomplish this as a standard, whether many people actually use it or not. Good game, definitely worth the 0,69€ I payed for it. I might not play it for long, since I have played it since 2009 on and off, but it's still worth the buy because of the bigger screen size on a PC compared to a 3DS or other mobile devices because of controller/keyboard support.","May 16, 2015","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While this is often done for effect and purposeful confusion, it's hard to tell which direction your cube is facing, and often found myself going forward instead of right. Since the camera is at an angle and not directly behind the cube, you will find moment like that a bit common, but it's more of a nuisance than a game breaking problem. While I had a better time the more I played, it was a problem that never truly went a way, but never got in the way of my enjoyment. Still, as a game all about speed, I can see it getting annoying for those looking for the best time, even with the ability to cut down time by balancing on the edges.\n\nThe entire game is fully benefited through an abundance of creativity in its level design. The sheer genius and clear amount of fun Two Tribes had coming up with the level design shows the amount of passion they have for their work, and it's all amplified with the sublime, amazingly varied electronic soundtrack that's played throughout the game. Weirdly enough, I think I had more fun finding out what weird and vaguely familiar minimalist challenge I would face next. The amount they achieve with minimalistic colors and cubes is rather stunning, and the impressive difficulty curve really does rise in accordance to the player's skill. That is something I highly respect.\n\nTop this all off with the fact that outside of the base game, there are just as many extended levels and an entire community hub for user-made levels, (plus even a few seasonal ones that come up depending on the date), you can get lost in this game for a long time. It's also one I wouldn't be surprised to come back to again even if I'm finished. Seasonal levels aren't something you see that often, and I think it's a cool little touch to keep us playing months later.\n\nBetween the insanely cheap asking price and the impressive amount of game presented, you can't get a better deal than this. Minor flaws aside, this is one of the most polished, beautifully presented indies I've played inn a long time, and it's one I'll probably finding myself come back to again and again whenever the mood hits. Definitely worth picking up if you want something a bit different.\n","July 28, 2015","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The music fits the theme perfectly. Not only is it good, but it suits each map well. A dark map can have a little creepier music, while bright white maps can have happy music to play with you screaming in rage. Before you start a level, a robotic voice says what the map name is. It sounds robotic. duh.\n\nAll in all it is a great game. The atmosphere of each map is great, and it starts off easy and gets harder and harder as you go.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gravityunown/recommended/38740/","gravityunown","GravityUnown","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gravityunown/","51 products in account","Edge is a borderline solid platform game. The strongest aspect of the game is the creative use of theming of the levels; from such a simplistic graphic standpoint Edge gets really creative with the level design, using the cubic platforms for robots, gears, birds, statues, flags, snakes, you name it. That's the big draw of the game, and it's really cool to explore them all.\n\nHowever coupled with the outstanding elements are some minor problems that do affect the enjoyment to some degree. The main problem is the key configuration. Edge is designed around a diagonal, isometric point of view so every move the cube makes is in a diagonal direction. Unfortunately the controls revolve around ASDW or the arrow keys, which simulate typical Up-Down-Left-Right movements, which can cause some confusion.\n\nOne game-related problem is the poor use of checkpoints. You can't see the checkpoints but if you happen to die then the game will bring you back to a certain point in the level so you don't end up starting the entire level again. The only problem is that sometimes the checkpoints will take you a little further than where you died, or take you back to a point where you have to redo an unfairly large chunk of the level.\n\nThe other problem is the platforming, which is a bit serious. If you collect a prism then your cube moves at a fluent and quick pace for a brief amount of time, however normally the cube feels very sluggish and makes things like edge climbing and falling very taxing. There's also the problem with the moving platforms, which can cause some shenanigans. When you make the cube fall onto a moving platform, depending on where the cube fell onto it, sometimes the cube doesn't get carried with the platform and results in you just falling and dying.\n\nOverall I did find this game to be fun, and as a fun fact the game runs at a perfect 60 frames here in comparison to the 3DS eShop version, where the framerate always drops significantly. HOWEVER! Due to the quirkiness of the platform controls the game will take some getting used to, for better or for worse.","July 20, 2015","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Have you ever played that game from website where you become a rectangiar block and you have to fall into a specific hole in order to advance? Well this game is pretty much upgraded from that. Only, much more complicated. It may look really simple in the first levels you play, but you can get the WTF reaction on the later levels. The game is similar that I just stated. Move your block into the rainbow spot. What suprised to me the most is that you can edge grab. But if you get smaller, you literally go up walls. I am trying not to put it out of context when I say that. So yeah, has the, "Easy to learn, hard to master" kind of thing. But I do warn you, always predict what is going to happen next, or you are going to have a hard time.\n\nOverall: 9/10: Really worth the sale price of about $0.45\n\nOr for a ProJared rating: A Dance Party/10\n\nHere's a link to the game I'm talking about: http://www.coolmath-games.com/0-bloxorz","July 30, 2015","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While this is often done for effect and purposeful confusion, it's hard to tell which direction your cube is facing, and often found myself going forward instead of right. Since the camera is at an angle and not directly behind the cube, you will find moment like that a bit common, but it's more of a nuisance than a game breaking problem. While I had a better time the more I played, it was a problem that never truly went a way, but never got in the way of my enjoyment. Still, as a game all about speed, I can see it getting annoying for those looking for the best time, even with the ability to cut down time by balancing on the edges.\n\nThe entire game is fully benefited through an abundance of creativity in its level design. The sheer genius and clear amount of fun Two Tribes had coming up with the level design shows the amount of passion they have for their work, and it's all amplified with the sublime, amazingly varied electronic soundtrack that's played throughout the game. Weirdly enough, I think I had more fun finding out what weird and vaguely familiar minimalist challenge I would face next. The amount they achieve with minimalistic colors and cubes is rather stunning, and the impressive difficulty curve really does rise in accordance to the player's skill. That is something I highly respect.\n\nTop this all off with the fact that outside of the base game, there are just as many extended levels and an entire community hub for user-made levels, (plus even a few seasonal ones that come up depending on the date), you can get lost in this game for a long time. It's also one I wouldn't be surprised to come back to again even if I'm finished. Seasonal levels aren't something you see that often, and I think it's a cool little touch to keep us playing months later.\n\nBetween the insanely cheap asking price and the impressive amount of game presented, you can't get a better deal than this. Minor flaws aside, this is one of the most polished, beautifully presented indies I've played inn a long time, and it's one I'll probably finding myself come back to again and again whenever the mood hits. Definitely worth picking up if you want something a bit different.\n","July 28, 2015","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you like puzzles this is a great option for you.\n\nThe gameplay consists in taking a cube from one point of a 'maze' to another. Add some 'powerups' that change the size of the cube, some moving platforms and elements like that and you get plenty of hours of fun.","January 31","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Pretty fast-paced, platformer and your score will always matter.\n\nBefore i procceed with the PROS and CONS i would like to remind anyone who is reading this that these are my personal preferences and may differ by any individual who plays the game.\n\nPROS:\n+Very good graphics.\n+Well designed levels.\n+Achievements are really good, and sometimes challenging.\n\nCONS:\n-Needs more levels, i didn't enjoy it enough\n\nTL;DR Trully awesome game for anyone who wants to play an addicting, fast-paced game for like 10 minutes or more.\n\n10/10","January 8","true","13.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You need to flip yourself to the end of the level which has obstacles in the way. The controls are a bit confusing at first because the board is isometric but the movement is controlled by the arrow keys. But you get used to it after a while. The game is pretty good as the puzzles are interesting.\n\nNot a bad game. Get it on sale.","August 23, 2015","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For me, it's the latter. While I appreciated the soundtrack and the detail put into the game, it just didn't reverberate with me.\n\nGet a ControllerOne of the big turn-offs for me was the controls, while I understand the need for "stickiness" to get the Edge combo and finish certain puzzles, basic movement was often challenging. I'd miss simple corners because I thought I'd moved one block over when the "stickiness" brings me right back down to my original position. Perhaps this game is better with a controller and joystick, I do not have that luxury however, so I can't say so for myself.\n\nBreakdownPros\nGreat soundtrack\nLevel design is solid, the puzzels were clearly well thought out and the scaffolding is on-pointCons\nWeird key layouts\nMovement is kinda janky. If directional movement had no "stickiness" or resistance and hitting an additional key, like Shift, triggered the ability to do Edge, that would feel more fluidScore: 5/10 (if you like the game, it's a solid 10/10, if you don't, it's easily a 0/10, so I'm giving the average here with recognition that I am of the "not" party)\n\nDisclaimerMy time spent in game is actually around 3 hours, much more than what is reported. Most of that time was on a friend's account as my computer had a weird driver issue running this game.","May 18","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
