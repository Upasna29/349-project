Basically you start with a little ship, accomplish various type of missions to earn gold so that you can build up your "pirate town" allowing you to have a bigger ship or bonuses. Note that you can build a brothel, that's always a +. You navigate freely on the world map even though you can't do much on it, except for trading upgrade items in town or accepting missions. You can also interact with other ships on the map to escort or fight them.\n\nThe sailing and combat are VERY arcade-y. Aim with your mouse, left click to fire your cannons and right click to use a special attack when the bar is full. There is a mini-game in which you fire a cannon in first person to sink bad guys boat without hitting your pirate friends boats. Although it does not seem to actually give you the gold you earned during the mini-game.\n\nAll in all buy if:\n-You want a fast paced arcade-like pirate game where you sink tons of ships.\n-You like hit'n'run gameplay.\n-You like mindless fun.\n\nDont buy if:\n-You're looking for realistic sailing/naval combat.\n-You expect a game with factions or nations. (there are none)\n-You want the full pirate experience with sword fights or boarding.","November 9, 2014","true","2.0"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","10","14","0","0"

Also even though the game seems pretty basic it's fun! I think too many other games try to take on too much and lose sight that a game should be entertaining. Visually this all comes together well. The music is great and I enjoyed the humor you'll find here or there. This was certainly worth the price.","January 31, 2015","true","0.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","1"

However I forgive them though because this is a very fun game.\n\nThe main jist of it that I can see so far is that you can do tasks for people like one of them I had to destroy towers to save someones daughter and another to collect a certain amount of gold from ships I destroyed. You know the usual stuff.\n\nAnother thing I really like about this game is the soundtrack. The ole pirate singing and music really fits the game. But if your looking for a pirate realistic simulation game or something, then stop looking at this game because it is very arcadey.\n\nGraphics are decent, can run on almost any system. But you do need to download Java before you can play it.\n\ni give it a 8/8 m8, developer forgiven, and worth your money.","November 8, 2014","true","0.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

No. It feels like a early access game or free game. I'm normally a fan of piratey games but this one sadly is forgetable","November 9, 2014","false","1.3"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","7","11","0","0"

Why there hasn't been one I won't ever understand but this is a fun little game. So far I'm past the tutorial and it promises to get better.\n\nIf you're looking for a fun pirate game this is pretty good in my opinion. And it should definitely pass the time. I've heard that the developer accidentally posted the demo on release yesterday but it seems to have been corrected. I'll pop in and enjoy this game now and then.\n\nUpgrade the little town and get some better ships. Certainly a game I can have fun with even if I only have a little time to play.","November 8, 2014","true","0.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

There's a mission-driven storyline but missions are replayable or you can just sail around pirating (or helping) random ships.\n\nYou can build up your town and customise your ship or earn new ones including a (not very) secret ship.\n\nGood fun for the price of a few of bottles of beer!","November 9, 2014","true","5.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SLAYrRGaming/recommended/321080/","SLAYrRGaming","Emera Nova","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SLAYrRGaming/","192 products in account","I do not recommend this game at its current price for what is in the game. If this game gets a few more updates that add some more content to the game then I believe that this could become a pretty decent little pirate game.\n\nMainly my issue with this game is there is only 3 ships you can unlock, and 2 unlocks per building at your pirate island, it doesn't take very long to build up money in this game if you pay attention to its mechanics which in turn makes it even easier and faster to unlock all of the stuff you can and then you just have the story mode to complete.\n(Buy Brothels and the Taverns to get extra gold, then go to a port town and grab one of the treasure hunt tasks, don't finish the task and gold farm off the ships that come to attack you. Use gold magnets for increase pick up)\nAnother negative point is all the ports that are around in the game only offer the same 3 mission ever so that gets very repetive.\n\nOutside being able to unlock everything extremely quickly it also comes with some pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t bugs, a few that I've run in to are:\n~On exit the game will crash throwing up an error code, which when you relaunch the game later you'll find out it deletes your game saves.. (Kind of a ♥♥♥♥ off to have to start all over)\n~Controls of WAD can sometimes stop working if you pause your ship while picking up gold, you'll have to hope that it recovers before you get blown out of the water...\n\nAll in all it's not a bad game I just wouldn't recommend it without some new content being put in, I think a few more ships and upgrades for the island, and prehapes a few minigames would make it a better/easier buy.","February 7, 2015","false","2.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/plezmo/recommended/321080/","plezmo","Plezmo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/plezmo/","1036 products in account","One huge problem . The game crashed and deleted my save data at which point I abandoned it. But I rarely give negative reviews based solely on technical issues , that is to say if the game worked properly I would have recommended it.\n\nEDIT: On my second playtrough at the moment , backing up my save file after each tougher mission. So far so good . The dev was smart enough to include the save file location in the readme file , so Im guessing he knows about the issue.\n\nIts a cute little pirate game. I have to say it turned out to be a lot more arcade-ish than I originally imagined  , especially if played with a controller. Speaking of which the game supports xbox 360 controller , but it does not detect it automatically , you have to enable it in the options screen and it works well enough with it excluding some minor issues sometimes your ship continues to go in the last pressed direction if text pops up on screen.  Gameplay wise the game is much like a twin stick shooter. Except you can only shoot fron the side of the ship , yeah no bow side cannons , or at least I havent found them. You have missions to choose from , but the game has an arrow pointing to the next mission you need to do in order to progress the story. There are also side missions that you can get from ports , at which you can also trade. Missions themselves are mainly deathmatch arena tipe , but there is the occasional convoy , town protection or even race missions. Other than that there is a slight city building aspect. You have a pirate nest which you can make better by purchasing buildings which let you buy upgrades ot give you perks. Speaking of perks , your ship has inventory slots that you can equip items in , each item giving you a different perk.\n\nOne thing I found weird is that the menus and stuff are well made but the logo of the game looks iffy , like they changed the name in the last second and needed a new logo asap.","June 28, 2015","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
