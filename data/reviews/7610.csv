It says that it will not run on Windows Vista or Windows 7, but it's running fine for me on Windows 7 and I didn't have to do anything to make it work.  I simply installed it and it worked.  Now, to the game.  I really enjoyed playing Railroad Tycoon 3, being my first Railroad Tycoon game on PC (after having played Railroad Tycoon 2 on the PlayStation 2) and in my opinion, it is a much better and simpler game to play than its predecessors","December 7, 2013","true","44.4"," 111 of 118 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","111","118","0","1"

Before I go any further, the game WILL work on Vista and Windows 7. Go to http://hawkdawg.com/ to find patches for blurry textures and the Vista fix.\n\nRailroad Tycoon 3 is the third installment of the Railroad Tycoon series. Developed by PopTop Software and The Gathering of Developers, Railroad Tycoon 3 introduces the 3D engine to the Railroad Tycoon series. Railroad Tycoon 3 has three main game modes. Campaign, Sandbox, and Scenarios. If you want to play a challenging campaign mode, you have it, or if you just want to go and lay some track, you can do that too. In campaign mode, there are three difficulties; Easy, Medium, and Hard. You can choose between 25 different games to choose from, and can go from left to right, or start at the hardest one. In scenario mode, you play against a computer player on a selected map, and race to be the highest company to win. In sandbox mode, you pick a map and time period, and then go have fun!\n\nIf you feel like you want to develop for the game, you can create skins and maps too. Railroad Tycoon 3 introduces a new map editor, making it easy to create maps. Unfortunately, it has a few issues, but I will talk about those later. Inside the map editor, you can import grey-scaled maps defining the height of a map, and add trees, rivers, oceans, and many more!~\nProbably the best thing about this game is the community support. Railroad Tycoon 3 has a huge community, primarily the one at hawkdawg.com. There you can find unofficial patches, maps, trains, and other things to enhance your Railroad Tycoon 3 experience. Sign-up there today!\n\nOverall, Railroad Tycoon 3 is amazing. The game is far superior to it’s successor Sid Meier’s Railroads, and some may argue that it’s predecessor Railroad Tycoon II, is better. All three games can be purchased in the Railroad Tycoon bundle, which is an amazing price for what you get. If you wait for a Steam sale, you get an incredible deal.\n","February 13, 2014","true","157.9"," 57 of 61 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","57","61","0","8"

For me the game ran on Windows 7 without any problems whatsoever.\n\nWhile understandably the graphics feel slightly dated, the gameplay has really not aged at all. It does a superb job at modelling Railroad construction with plenty of Locomotives from the very begining, all the way up to the modern, high-perfomance machines.\n\nApart from that it also has an excellent virtual economy where it really does pay to plan ahead. If you want to build cars for instance you need steel and tires. Steel gets produced seperately combining ore and coal, whereas the tires obviously need rubber.\n\nRRT3 is about as in depth as any mainstream tycoon gets, even compared to modern games. Sure if you like micro management you'll find games that will challenge you more, but a game thats over 10 years old, it easily pulls its weight. Its also a lot better than Sid Meiers Railroads.","August 4, 2014","true","60.1"," 35 of 36 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","35","36","0","0"

For themost part, yes!\n\nRailroad Tycoon 3's graphics where great in its day, the soundtrack is good to listen to and tons of interesting scenarios, and for the most part, historically correct! It has has an editor to create new maps, and a decent multiplayer. The champaign is interesting, and hundreds of locomotives and a selection of industries.\n\nHowever, the soundtrack is mostly bluegrass music and doesn't make sence (Example: There is a scenario based in Japan, and you hear Kentucky Bluegrass instrumentals). The graphics are a little dated and the AI is can be a total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at times no matter the difficulty.\n\nThis game is like an old box of Twinkies, it's a bit aged and seen better days but the inside is great and filled with absoulute win. The game still hold up after 10 years and is still a good game that can hold my attention. I recommend getting this game. It serves as an awesome tycoon game, and is up there with The Movies and Game Dev Tycoon.","June 1, 2014","true","94.6"," 25 of 26 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","25","26","0","0"

I've been playing this since it was first released so many years ago.  If you can't get it to work on Windows 8, then do some Googling and figure it out.  I think I ended up replacing the .exe file with something from somewhere!  All available through my friend, Google.\n\nFor running a business, buying/selling stocks, investing in industry (and then feeding that industry), and considering business aspects of bonds, debt/capital, upgrading locomotives, electrifying rail, and so many other things, this game captures it all very well.  I simply wish there was a bigger, newer version by the same developers.  All newer games just can't capture the business side (with ease of UI) in addition to the rail building side of this game.\n\nThe newer "Railroads" was good but not great like this game.  The expansive maps of this game take it to another level.  Having millions of dollars moving around the map by multiple players is incredible...and oh, yes, there is multiplayer.  Not supported any more but on my LAN, my kids are learning business decisions and rail management at an early age.  All with me pushing them from my PC.  What a joy!  Cheers...

As an enterprising tycoon (yes, an ACTUAL tycoon) of the 19th century or 20th century, build a railroad empire across a multitude of landscape, laying or acquiring tracks and locomotives, ferrying people and cargo, investing in your (or your competitor's) stock and industries, while the cities around grow and more advanced steam, diesel and electrical engines are invented.\n\nPros: As a train company, you have a large amount of decisions you can make, although the game has a fairly enough simplified interface to avoid over-complication. A variety of options are available for the tracks you lay, the stations you build, the train engines you purchase and the cargo you haul. As time goes by, new technology and world modernization adds additional options, anywhere from new bridge types to new engine technologies (coal, diesel, electrical). Cities and industries are dynamic and take shape based on how much your company help them: cities will grow as you ferry passengers, new industries are build as cities grow, new cargo are available for import or export as new industries are built. You also get to manage stocks, whether issuing or buying it back, buying competitor's stocks for hostile takeover, and even influence how much power the shareholders have over your decisions from your own stash of stocks you can buy from your hard-earned salary as president of the company. The game also offers a large list of geographical locations to base your games, and game types such as goal-achieving scenarios, randomized games or straight sandbox.\n\nCons: The graphics are showing their age a lot. You have limited randomization options and the land masses are pregenerated. You are limited to a single, continuous or branching railroad, unable to plant additional stretches if it doesn't connect to your existing track. Depending on the difficulty, competing tycoons are both extremely aggressive and extremely dumb in their track laying strategy.\n\nVerdict: ★★★☆☆ - It's up to you\n\nEven today, Railroad Tycoon 3 remains fun and is still the best incarnation of its genre: neither too realistic nor too gamy/dumbed-down. If you like this sort of game and don't mind the aging look, you'll find plenty of options in this game, well worth the price!\n\n—————————————————————————\nThis was just my opinion.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.","February 3, 2015","true","16.3"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","2"

Classic and tons of fun.\nEdit: It does seem to crash very frequently, however. I guess that's what you get with a game as old as this one.\n\nCannot, however, give a thumbs up to Steam support on this one. As many others have said, you will most likely find that it crashes within seconds of launching the app. This is because of a default setting that conflicts with just about every modern video card. You won't be able to get into the settings menu to fix this, crashes too quckly. If you run into this problem, you will have to go to a third party site and download an updated config file, replace the original, and then the game will function. The file is safe, the people who created this have my gratitude, but customers SHOULD NOT have to be subjected to downloading a file from a third party site in order to use a product they've been charged for. Upon contacting Steam support, they offered no assistance with this matter. I asked for a refund, was denied (i was outside of the timeframe so that was expected), but I also received no attempt from support to get the game running. The last part should not have happened, no excuse for that. At that point, I finally went ahead and downloaded the file (I was not comfortable doing this). Glad to say it worked :)\n\nSteam continues to sell a game with a well documented issue that they're aware of. If you do purchase this game, be prepared to go through the process I've explained (check the guides section for this game), or to request a refund. Thank you to the community for helping resolve this issue for myself and many others, you shouldn't have had to do that. Hope this saves someone a headache.","January 30","true","84.1"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

To my surprise and delight, the game runs fine on my Windows 7, 64bit OS.\n\nRRT3 is a true classic.  (Don't look at my Steam hours -- I was playing this game long before Steam existed!  I spent hundreds and hundreds of houres of my youth playing the RRT series).\n\nThe game is very challenging and interesting to play; it's addictiveness rivals Civ's with "one-more-scenario" compulsions.  Essentially an RTS, you build rail lines and manage trains to deliver cargo over the map.  These range from tiny locales (the state of New York in the early eras), to entire continents later in the game.\n\nA huge variety of locomotives is available, each with their strengths and weaknesses.  Building lines carefully is also extremely important -- grade (slope angle) directly affects your trains' speed, hauling power, and therefore profit.\n\nRRT3 adds a lot more streamlining to the cargo consist options, allowing you to pick up specific cargoes or simply "freight", "passengers & mail", or "all", making it easy for your railroad to adapt over time.\n\nThis incarnation also introduced the idea of "other" transportation to the map -- where rivers and short land spans will be traversed by the computer (vis barges & wagon trains) to reach your stations.  For example -- if you notice a lot of sheep farms along a river, you can build a textile mill downstream and the wool will be delivered there over time, even if you don't have a rail connection.\n\nThis economic realism also makes the game significantly more challenging as supply and demand severely affects delivery prices, making you constantly want to search for more profitable routes.\n\nLike the other games in the RRT series, you can also play the stock market, buy industry, and sell/start new companies.\n\nMy favorite sound in gaming comes from this very game... when you have a thriving railroad, the "ding ding ding" of all those trains rolling into their stations making money is music to my ears!","December 31, 2014","true","9.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

But if you are looking for something that might appeal more to your eyes, stick with Railroad Tycoon 2. It is almost exactly the same except for the few improvements\n\n*** I used Windows 7, there is a fix that changes files in the Configuration folder.

The mechanics were good enough to keep me interested for a few hours, but the poor map generation (like having every city have a steel mill but putting no coal or iron ore on the map) was frustrating.  Still the ability to control the loading and unloading of goods manually was fun.\n\nThen I saw Railroad Tycoon 3 on sale and picked it up thinking that the inprovements in a newer edition would make the base game more enjoyable.  Wrong!  Essentially 3 removed all the fun aspects of 2 and added nicer graphics.\n\nIn 2 you could set up to play a 25 year game with beating the other tycoons your only challenge.  Start your rail line anywere on the map and take off.  In 3 you have to choose a scenario and each scenario has specific goals that must be met, pretty stupid goals like connect city A to city B when both those cities have no goods to transport.\n\nAlso, 3 did not fix the map generation issue and  worse, removed your ability to control the loading and unloading of your goods.  For example, in 2 you can specify that goods of a type be unloaded at a station for pickup by a different train which can then take them to the station that needs them.  In 3 you can not do this.\n\n2 is not a great game, but compared to 3 it's a gem.  If you must buy one of these then pick 2 and avoid 3.","November 12, 2014","false","30.4"," 8 of 22 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","8","22","0","0"

Not to say this one doesn't have its charm and place, being the best of the original Tycoon games, with streamlined functionality, graphics that actually looked good for the era, and a logic flow the average user could understand.  Its main competition is Train Fever, a very recent indie game that fails to inspire due to an over-complicated operation.  Railroads! may be too simple if you're looking for complexity, so this occupies the midway ground, provided you can put up with older graphics.","March 8","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Although the graphics are quite old (it was one of the first 3d economic strategies) the gameplay remains good, especially in the campaign. Also you can see that the game was made for railroad fans - the train models are brilliant, and the number of engines is amazing. The campaign itself gives you a glimpse into the history of building railroads across the world.\n\nAnd when you check how much the game costs today this is definitely worth buying. There hasn't been a better railroad building game since.","January 19","true","46.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Once you get it running the game is quite enjoyable. I grabbed it after playing Sid Meier's Railroads!, which I found to be fun but lacking in depth - and there is certainly depth to be found here.\n\nI'd say it's worth it if you're interested, but be prepared to have to do some work to get it running on Win 7/8/10.","January 3","true","53.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
