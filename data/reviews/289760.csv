I am a member of TEAM ROCKETS so my review would be biased and terrible for you. But we would like to hear your feedback; we check the steam forums many times a day!\n\nBut if you want to know what I really think about ROCKETSROCKETSROCKETS, let's get *serious* for a moment.\n\nI've been a game developer for many years. A lot of times you work on an exciting idea that seems like it might work, and a lot of times you work on things just out of momentum, and sometimes you wake up and discover you're working on something you should have cancelled months ago. It's sorta the way life goes, as a developer; it's hard to objectively see what you are working on as anything but "good." A lot of the time it's hard to even find playtesters to help you out.\n\nSometimes, though - rarely - an idea comes along that hits you like falling in love does. You jump out of bed every day to work on it. You can't stop thinking about it. The whole world gets more vibrant, and you see your idea everywhere. Everyone you show the early prototypes to instantly get it and also fall in love. You start gaining fans and all you have is a title screen or a doodle on a napkin... And they aren't friends or family. This kind of experience is incredibly rare, and I am stupendously honoured to be feeling it for ROCKETS right now.\n\nI know I'm in the thick of it right now, and I still have those rose-colored glasses on, but I think I will fondly look back on ROCKETS for the rest of my life. It may not be my best technical work, it may be unfinished right now, and it may not become a commercial success (I'm writing this before the Early Access launch!), but by golly does this game feel right in every way.\n\nIt feels incredible to build, it feels incredible to play, and it feels incredible to be a part of this talented team.\n\nI hope you'll fall in love with the game like I did.","April 29, 2014","true","409.3"," 171 of 230 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","171","230","2","10"

You fly around in a rocket and prove to others who is the studliest of all the rockets.\n\nHere's a Quick Look video if you want to see how this game plays. There's also my review below if you simply want a more in-depth and concise look at the game.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/daoI-IMkVk0\n\nLet me start my review by saying this game is extremely bare at this point. It only has local dogfighting between 2 rockets, 2 v 1 underdog mode, or team deathmatch. But damn is the dogfighting good. You get three different ways to attack: by shooting lasers that go straight ahead, dropping bombs that fling out your side and are effected by gravity, and finally mines that shoot out your backside and blow up behind you. Simple right? But try throwing that in with high-speed rocket action. Suddenly you have to plan your shots to cut off the path your enemy is flying. Did the enemy drop a mine? Knock it right back at him with a laser and laugh in his face. Wanna rain death on a pursuer? Fling bombs into the sky and try to weave away from the hail of death. It's simply fun experimenting and trying to become the best pilot.\n\nAnd trust me, you'll always know who is the better pilot. You simply can't win the game based solely on luck. You have to dominate your opponent with the tag system they implemented. Basically put, both sides start from scratch, and if you hit the enemy 3 times in a row, it's your win. But if he hits you once, he'll knock a tag off your streak that you'll have to make up for until you fill the gauge in the top of the screen. This means games can end quickly, or be an intense test of endurance between two evenly-matched pilots.\n\nAnother great point of this game is the visuals. I love painting the cosmos with my vapor trails. Not only does it enhance the sense of speed you're getting, but it also tells the tale of the dance of death the rockets have been through. And when I say dance, I mean it. The music in this game is super catchy, too.\n\nBut let's discuss some negatives now. Just keep in mind that his is Early Access, and most of this will probably get changed in future patches.\n\n*The game is super short in its current state (you do everything there is to do once you play your first match). It's just dogfighting. And while it's good, it might not be enough to sell it at this point for some people.\n*There is no progression or anything to unlock. Something that'll keep the player coming back for more is always knowing they'll get rewarded if they play more.\n*All the rockets are the same, just colored differently. I'd like to have different looking rockets just for cosmetic purposes at least. Just something to make me feel unique.\n*No upgrades to weapons. I'm not talking flat out upgrades that are better than another, but more of something that makes them act differently. Like a laser that fires faster but has limited range. Or a mine that explodes in a larger radius but you can't shoot out as many. Just something to make this game more strategic and diverse would be good.\n*No online. This will be fixed later, but it'll remain a negative until it's implemented.\n*No tutorial. Sure it's fun flying around and getting absolutely owned by the AI for the first few times, but some sort of menu to list the controls would be nice.\n*No options menu. You can't change the sound effects, resolution, or anything else ingame currently.\n\nNow while that may be a lot of negatives, most--if not all--of those while be ironed out in the future. So wait until then if they bother you.\n\nSo to wrap this up, this game is going to bud into something very good. And for the low cost of $5 they're handing it out for currently, it certainly worth picking it up even now.\n\n*As a side note, I will (hopefully) update this review as major patches are released or just do it again once it's finally released. Just yell at me and I'll come running to take another look if I forget.*","May 2, 2014","true","1.5"," 38 of 46 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","38","46","0","0"

At first I was very confused with how I controlled my rocket, thinking it was relative, but then I realized the up arrow goes up, down arrow goes down, left goes left, and right goes right. Okay, I had that figured out, but then I needed to figure out how to shoot. Space? No. Shift? No, that's a weird shield thing. Control? Nope. X? Nah. Z? Nope! D? Ah, that shoots rockets. I then started pressing WASD to see what it would do. A shoots smaller rockets, and S drops bombs.\n\nAlso, my resolution is stuck at 800x600, for some reason. This game needs an options menu, or even just a seperate executable to change the resolution.\n\nFor positive, well, the music is amazing!! This game is also very beautiful, and fast paced. It has a feel to it... It's great. And the light trails, wow. The AI is very smart, also. Still haven't won a battle.\n\nAnyway, this is a great game, and has a lot of potential for future multiplayer, but I feel it needs a tutorial and some options.\nPick it up, though, it's worth it!\n\nEDIT: It seems the developer added some settings! That's great, he even added a controls page. I'm loving the game and it fixed most of its problems!\n\nI know that this game will be also very good for the keyboard in the future, because right now it seems the developer still seems uncertain about the current controls. Hoping for the best!\n\nAgain, it's a great game, worth the money, pick it up!","May 2, 2014","true","1.2"," 31 of 37 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","31","37","0","0"

Do not hesitate, just buy!\n\nRead the tl;dr section if you want at the bottom(too long; didn't read)Better View\n\nReview will be updated periodically. [Last Update: 21:27 PM(EST) June 18th, 2014]\nI discuss: What is R3, the gameplay, music, and even the developer for those of you who are worried about Early Access.\n\nROCKETSROCKETSROCKETS. I haven't had more fun with a game in awhile, and I have a lot of games. However, I will not make this review solely based on praising the game, but to get a better idea of what the gameplay is like I will explain all the core mechanics and aspects of the game. Pictures will not help you, you must try this out for yourself.\n\nWhat is ROCKETSROCKETSROCKETS?\n\nR3 is a rocket flying arcade shooter, where you shoot rockets at other rockets.\nCurrently there is one single gamemode with local only, but don't let this dissapoint you. All my hours are with its smart 1v1 AI that faces a huge challenge at first. Games can go either way everytime. R3 relies on quick twitch mechanics with its easier to learn gameplay and controls. The learning curve flows very nicely where you will be able to play decently after a couple of hours, but you will always get better.\n\nYou have three weapons.\nStandard Rockets(You will use this most of the time.)\n\nDrop Rockets(These are advanced and even I have trouble using them. Many people accidentally hit themselves with it. It takes practice.)\n- They drop using physics, so based off your momentum and gravity,\nthe rockets will drop different ways. Usually you want to use this when the enemy is far below you.\n\nMine(Static mine that pops out behind you.)\n\nThe neat part about R3 is its controls. They aren't relative. Up goes upward, right goes right, etc. This means you have true freedom in how you move. You can pull of neat turns and dodge obstacles at fast speeds. Hitting someone can be sometimes very difficult.\nYou have a shield that you activate with a button, it only comes on for about a second and will promptly dissapear. Rockets can't get through your shield but mines can. This helps prevent your uninvitable doom when faced with a barrage of rockets that you realize you can not dodge. It also gives you a little boost, and has a cooldown, so you better be careful when using it.\n\nThe standard gamemode is an advantage system. Whoever has a +3 advantage in hits wins.\nYour opponent has 2 points and you hit them. They now have 1 point and you still have 0. When they are back at 0 you can now score. This gamemode influences long high octane battles, however if this sounds off to you still consider getting it as the developer plans to add more gamemodes.\n\nNow what about the Developer!?\nThe lead Developer Andy Moore is probably one of the best Early Access indie devs I've seen that not only is commited to adding lots of content, but making sure everyone has an enjoyable experience. Don't be afraid that this game will not work for you, he always puts out experimental builds that you can opt into to try and listens to every complaint you have.\nHe's not the type of developer that goes, "I like feedback, but I'm not going to actually use said feedback". He updates in a regular and timely manner and is always in the discussions on the forum.\n\nSo don't be afraid to put your money into this project. Infact I encourage you because the price will get higher upon release. Yes, this does seem off putting to a lot of you. However, the game is fairly polished and always recieving updates. They have plans for after release also. No, this won't end up being $60(DayZ... really?). My guess is $10 - $15.\n\nHot Jams\nThe music in this game is absolutely wonderful. It's composed by Power Up Audio, who did the music for Towerfall: Ascension and many others. Check them out! It features upbeat electro space jams. You can listen to it all day. I swear. It currently only includes 4 tracks. Menu theme and two in-game themes and a 2 part win theme. All are good and mastered well. They are adding in more music, but you can tell by the quality that they put effort into it.\n\nWhat's not good about R3\n- Currently it has a limited options menu(which will be improved soon.)\n- It needs a bit more polish on the UI, it's very clean and neat however it's missing a good amount of stuff.\n- The game is in Early Access so AI is only complete for 1v1, but they are now testing multi AI currently so I wouldn't worry about it. Honestly, the game is best for 1v1. You will probably most likely play 1v1. Any higher is for more advanced players.\n\nAlright, I can't think of anymore problems.\n\nWill this game support my controller and keyboard!?\nMost likely: Yes. Literally every recent update he has added support for a bunch of random controllers I've never even heard off. Keyboard controls are good at the moment, but are always getting better.\n\nWhat should I be warned about before buying?\nIt's Alpha mate. Things change.\n\nWhat I'm worried about in the Future\n\nMultiplayer Netccode\nThis game features a lot of collision and player interaction which is why it must have a good netcode. Netcode is the reason I haven't purchased Brawlhalla. I do expect on Multiplayer release the netcode to be very shoddy, however I hope the developers will work very hard on it, and based on my comment on the dev,  I'm sure he will.\n\nI hope this doesn't require any of our own servers like many indie games have been doing lately. A Peer-to-peer lobby or universal servers will be better.\n\nWhat I need you to do.\nBuy this game. It won't be good without players. Don't hold off and get it. $5, and you're getting it at a cheaper price than release also. Hate the idea of paying developers for alpha testing? Remember when games didn't tell you they were incomplete till you bought them? You're supporting development and helping this game get out there and faster. By buying in you allow them to afford a multitude of things that will go back into the game. Servers, advertisement, features, music. Just do it.\n\nIn current development I give R3 a: 7/10 Unique!\n\nGameplay and Controls: 10 Best!\nSettings and UI: 5/10 Average\n\nAnd I don't do that BS where 7 is average. 5 is average on my scale.\n\nHave fun Rocketeers!\n\ntl;dr\n+ Well polished.\n+ Frequent Updates\n+ Dedicated Devloper who releases Expiremental builds to ensure all users are having fun. Have a problem? Just post in the forum, a build will be out in seconds!\n+ Hot Jams\n+ Great Controls and pacing\n+ Support for everything\n+ Learning Curve\n+ Button Mashing is actually fun?\n\n- Limited Setting(at the moment!)\n- Missing a couple of in-game UI elements\n- Only two modes avaliable\n\n-------12:30 AM(EST) May 18th, 2014-------\nAndy is allowing the community to edit the level generation, controls, physics, and more with a new file. We're all testing different outcomes of how we believe R3 should play like.\n\n-------21:27 PM(EST) June 18th, 2014-------\nSo R3 Module One update hit for all users not in the Experimental build a few days ago. After getting my testing in the amount of stuff added is great. NA new challenge mode has been added with leaderboards and a couple of new styles for everything. Also more hot jams!","May 6, 2014","true","40.7"," 26 of 29 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","26","29","0","1"

You can shoot missles, leave nasty mines, and drop bombs to cause beautiful, beautiful havoc. I'm not kidding.

The regular game is still a thumbs down, for now, but most of my issues with it have been addressed in the beta version.\n\nThe beta version is playable for me with bloom turned off but imo its just not the same without it.\nChanges included in beta version detailed at the bottom.\n\n.............................................................................................................................................................\nRECCOMENDATION :  YES :\n\nI would wholeheartedly reccommend this game a few months ago, but not anymore.   I am writing this review with the hopes of getting the devs attentions, youve made an amazing game and I want to point out some things so that i can play it again.  I completely reccommend this game at 5$, but only after below said issues are fixed.   Review will be updated as changes happen.\n\nSound: 8/10\nGraphics: 8/10\nGameplay: 8/10\nBloom: 2/10\nControls: 6/10\nOVERALL: 6/10 for now\n\n...............................................................................................................................................................\n\nGAMEPLAY :\n\n\nRocketsx3 is a great PvP multiplayer game. Can be played against bots as well.  You can play upto 4 player but the experience is best with 2. You could play 4 on a TV pretty well.\n\nYou control a ship and you have 3 weapons.  Mines, missiles, and  bombs.  Each of these attacks can be fired one at a time, or charged and released to dish out a devastating barrage of your weapon of choice.\n\nMines launch behind you and detonate in an area after a while.  Missiles launch directly in front of you and shoot forward.     Bombs are like tiny missiles but have no thrust, so they fall off from the side of your rocket.\nYou get a sheild that also functions as a speed boost, allowing you to block attacks or get out of a tight situation.\n\nFirst to 3 hits in a row wins! You can hit yourself and that deducts from your score.\nControlling your ship may be hard at first but youll get the hang of it.\n\n\nGameplay is fast, solid, and fluid.  Matches are usually short but may last longer. And boy are those longer matches tense.   Dodging missiles, falling for mine traps, using bombs to block your escape, a well timed charge attack to get two hits in a row or that moment when you engage eachother in a tense spiral of death.\n\nGraphics are great, a very beautiful and neon art style, and the announcer ingame is great. A female, robotic assistant type voice.  The AI is amazing and WILL beat you many times.\n\n\n................................................................................................................................................................\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS :\n\nI used to love this game. I played it  everyday with a good friend of mine. Both of us have stopped playing this game now due to changes made to it over successive updates that has left the game unplayable for us.  These reasons are :\n\n1) WAY too bright. The brightness of the ship burner and particles, as well as environment objects and trails was multiplied by 20.   There should be a slider for this.  I miss the darkened out trails that the game had in the beginning, the bright trails before the christmas update were fine too, but it became WAY too sparkly after that. no reason that this cant be optional.\n\n2) Difficult to fight in tight spaces now.  Due to the changes to particles and brightness, when you clash with eachother in tight corners or against walls, you cant tell what is going on.\n\n3) Unncessary clutter added.  Your health is depicted by 3 balls around your ship. I feel that this adds unncessary clutter to the game and takes away from your focus.  I prefer the healthbar at the top. No reason why this cant be an option.\n\n4) Screen size  : I play this game on my 21 inch 1980x1080 desktop, where the game is just about playable in its current state.   On my  1366x768 laptop though, i cant see anything anymore.\n\n5) The background was darkened out to try and fix the visibility issue i reckon,  and it looks plain terrible.\n\n6) The pulsating rocket trail. Please no.\n\n7) The last life slowdown. Let this be an option. It takes away from the fast paced fun of the game for me.. Totally kills the mood, although it is cool sometimes.  Could be an optional powerup or 5th button.\n\n\n..............................................................................................................................................................\n\n\nCONCLUSION :\n\nOptions are your best friend. Please dont just remove something and replace it with something else entirely.   Some poeple prefer one thing over another.\n\nOnline play will be coming to this game later on im sure.  On a positive note the UI work is great. Always improving. The music score is also nice.\n\nThere is no problem in the gameplay , but how the game is visually presented has totally gimped it for me and made it unplayable. If you could provide me with an older build of this game, I'd much rather play that than what is on the steam store right now.\n\nI dont have any reviews on my account, but i care enough about this game to write this out.  Your feedback on this review would be much appreciated.  Heres hoping a dev replies or these issues are addressed.\n\n................................................................................................................................................................\n\n\nEDIT :     CHANGES IN THE BETA VERSION OF THE GAME :\n\n\nThe beta build of the game includes a lot of improvements, which are :\n\n1)   A bloom and rocket trail slider.  The lowest setting in bloom is still too high for me, its the same as the regular game.  The bloom slider is overkill. http://i.imgur.com/IyQAukE.gifv\n\n2) Tug of war is back!  But if you prefer the health bubbles, you now have bubble size, rotation speed, and distance from ship.\n\n3) An option to enable/disable speedup/slowdown  pickups.  Though there is a bug that the pickups still appear in game, they just dont do anything.\n\nOther misc things  and comments :   I still find the game more difficult to play than pre christmas update. Colors are brighter? The particles? I cant pin it down for sure without playing an old build again but here are my comments :\n\nThe pulsating rocket trail and environment objects distracts me.  Also, i still prefer the discolored rocket trails.   The speed boost sparks are something id want to turn off too.   In the tug of war end game timer, white on white is too difficult to see.  Its hard to tell how much time you have left, please change that.\n\n\n\nNo 1980x1080 resolution in the beta build, but thats a minor gripe.\n\nA new gameplay feature i noticed that i DID like, is that you can now visibly see when a rocket is charging an attack. Awesome.  But instead of the white lines that indicate this, a colored outerglow or border so that its easier to see?\n\nProgress is going well, i look forward to it.","February 23, 2015","true","27.8"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","77","10","13","3","3"

I'm excited to see where the game goes, and possible revisions to the mouse and keyboard controls as I do not own a controller, which is the currently recommended by RRR.\nWeapons/Bombs/Physics/Etc:\nNot disappointed at all, Physics/reactions to being hit are appropriate, music/sound affects are good.\n\nIt's Early Access so take it with a grain of salt, I don't know how often the Devs intend on pushing out updates, but for the current price and the hope of future revisions and addons to it's current state, ROCKETSROCKETSROCKETS is well worth $5.","May 2, 2014","true","12.4"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

However, lots of fun to be ad here with the insanely difficult AI, and when online MP is introduced, it is sure to be a blast.\n\nUpdate from Early Access:\n\nGameplay here is still rock solid. The online modes look to be alot of fun, and so far the game has only improved gameplay wise.\n\nVisually, however; not so much.\n\nMenus have gone from the sleek, minimalist approach from Early Access to cluttered, dare I say "ugly" designs. While functional, it looks more like a Flash game from the 00's rather than a fast and furious arcade shmup.\n\nThis transition is applied in game as well; previously a nice, solid background with vibrant solid colored walls gave the game a minimalistic yet attractive view in game. It made seeing you're rockets and missles alot easier. However, it has since been replaced by a black on blue background filled with squares; while some might find this look to be great, it looks "unprofessional" for lack of a better term, once again losing the charm that had hooked myself and others originally.\n\nAt the current state the game is fun to play, but the stark contrast between 6 months ago and now has left the game looking worse off. This does not mean it IS worse off; real beuaty is on the inside (Gameplay), but the outside layer on this game has turned myself and several other friends who I convinced to buy this title in Early Access off for the time being.","August 8, 2014","false","0.7"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

First of all, it's very fast paced. With that I mean VERY fast paced. At first I didn't know what was going on! This makes hits and kills feel that much more awesome. The music is extraordinarily well done and really gives that final touch to the game. The graphics are basic, but still beautifly produced. The gameplay is also great, but I don't think this game works very well with a keyboard and mouse. I did find one glitch which was after I finally beat my cpu opponent, the music in-game stopped. Of course, the game is still in development, so I don't want to concentrate on glitches and lack of content.\n\nSo far, the game looks good, the music is wonderful and overall, it's fun to play!","June 19, 2014","true","2.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Those could then fire off in some unpredicted direction and hit another player.  Is your opponent dropping mines?  Fire a missle at the mine and bounce it in to him.  Things like that.

Sure, the single player will take up some time (the AI is challenging), but you'll ultimately need people to play with (and scream at?).\n\nAs for the game, I adore the minimalistic gameplay and aesthetics - it's oddly charming! Something which I really found added to the game's challenge is the ship movement controls - it's fluid yet rather hard to aim your ship. This could've easily made or broken the game, and it definitely did the former.\n\nIf I have to criticize something, it'd be the inclusion of the zen mode, and lack of variety in game modes. I can't really fathom any situation where I'd play in the Zen mode and just fly around randomly with people, and not do anything.

Sure, the single player will take up some time (the AI is challenging), but you'll ultimately need people to play with (and scream at?).\n\nAs for the game, I adore the minimalistic gameplay and aesthetics - it's oddly charming! Something which I really found added to the game's challenge is the ship movement controls - it's fluid yet rather hard to aim your ship. This could've easily made or broken the game, and it definitely did the former.\n\nIf I have to criticize something, it'd be the inclusion of the zen mode, and lack of variety in game modes. I can't really fathom any situation where I'd play in the Zen mode and just fly around randomly with people, and not do anything. And yes, it'd be super cool to get more game modes, and an online multiplayer.","August 31, 2015","true","3.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You can also just ram their Bubbles with your Rocket, but it's risky since at that point freaking blank range, they're practically guaranteed to hit you unless you perfectly time your Shield, which makes you invulnerable for a couple seconds.\n\nThe game is very fast pace, colorful, with great music. Music that actually makes me want to purchase its soundtrack, which is saying something since it's $8. There's also a Tug-O-War mode, were, you need to hit the other team to move the counter towards your side 3 blips, and hold it for a small-ish time, but them hitting you forces the blips towards them. And then there's Zen Mode, where you just fly around and draw pretty pictures with your Rockets Color Trail.\n\nIf you've ever seen or played Mario Carts battle mode with the 3 Balloons, the Bubbles mode is like that.\n\nThe only downside I see is that the keyboard controls greatly limit your potential, and is nowhere near as fun as it is with a Controller.\n\nI definitely recommend this game to anyone who was some fast pace arcade fun.","August 19, 2015","true","8.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Its very hard, its very fast, yet I am not getting frustrated. It seems to have a steep learning curve to get to a point where you win more times than lose, and to be honest I still feel like when i win its mainly by pure luck that the AI hit one of my mines.\n\nI can see this being incredibly satisfying when your skill level increases to a point where you can actually land the shots you want to to kill the enemy and not just kill them by spamming buttons :)\n\nThe color pallete is nice, very nice.\n\nThe graphics style is VERY simple, yet it works and feels like it has to be that way otherwise you really wouldnt be able to see whats happening as things happen so fast.\n\nThe music is good, but needs more tracks.\n\nthe price is good for the type of game, I think £4 is what i feel happy paying.\n\nCons:\n\nVery limited gameplay atm. The only gamemode available is "Dogfight", which is just you against AI. (I am unsure if local MP is working)\n\nmaybe to difficult at times, maybe a difficulty slider would be good.\n\n\nSo final thought is it is a great concept, well executed for a good price. But that is only if the whole game getts fleshed out with multiplayer online, moree game modes, more music, more maps etc. As it stands now I would say buy it if you want to support the devs, but if you want a fully fleshed out game then wait a couple of months and keep checking back to see what people say, as its very light on content at this point and that will not please some people.\n","May 7, 2014","true","3.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zerathos/recommended/289760/","zerathos","Locke","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zerathos/","1102 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nROCKETSROCKETSROCKETS probably has the most rockets of any game on Steam. The mechanics are simple but solid. The only officially supported game mode in this early Early Access build is one-on-one against the AI, but there's plenty more planned along the way. There's also the ability to fundamentally alter the physics and mechanics via a config file to tweak how the game is played, which is pretty neat. The graphics are basic, but are beautifully stylized and suit the game well. Flying your rocket just feels right which is a pretty crucial thing to nail.\n\nI was initially drawn by the similarities to Gimbal, another top-down space shooter. That's about where the similarities end though. Gimbal has a variety of different parts and lets you build your own ships, all with a unique way of handling. ROCKETSROCKETSROCKETS puts everyone on an equal playing field with only a few tools, focusing on individual skill. Gimbal is a very serious take on the genre, whereas ROCKETSROCKETSROCKETS is as crazy and flamboyant as its art style. Both have their appeal, but ROCKETSROCKETSROCKETS is infinitely easier to pick up and play, especially on the couch for local multiplayer.\n\nIt should also be noted that you should have a controller to play this game. Keyboard controls are included, but the game is designed around the analog capabilities of the thumbstick. It's also far easier to hammer on the buttons of a gamepad to fire rapidly than on your keyboard, though you can make use of the aforementioned config file to up the fire rate of your weapons when you hold down the button.\n\nLastly, it's important for any Early Access game to have devs that respond to user feedback and actually work on building the game rather than using the Early Access tag as an excuse to sell something that normally would be decried for being incomplete. From my observation of the devs thus far they seem trustworthy, so nothing to worry about on that front. If the concept interests you at all, I'd definitely recommend picking this game up sooner rather than later to get in on it while it's still cheap ($5 at time of writing, $1.25 if you can snag a 75% off coupon).","May 16, 2014","true","4.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","3"

I also had troubles with starting games as the menu showed to use a controller. In the end it is another Indie game made in another day. I do not recommend spending the $5 to play this game.

You fly a rocket and shoot at other rockets. It has a great soundtrack, the announcer is very well voiced, the colors used are amazing, and everything works very smoothly with few problems. However, the game is all but unplayable.\n\nYou see, the rockets all leave trails behind themselves - trails that don't dissappear. The screen quickly fills up with color, so you easily lose track of your rocket. Even worse, the rockets and all projectiles are rather small, so they would be difficult to see without color trails clogging up the screen.\n\nI want to like this game. The gameplay seems good, the music is awesome, the game looks great - but I can't. the rockets' color trails and small projectile size make the game all but unplayable.","December 21, 2014","false","0.1"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","1"

What happens is, whenever you and your enemy get close to each other (which happens regularly), the camera does a quick extreme closeup, and then when you move away from each other very shortly after, the camera does a quick zoom out. Over and over.\n\nIt was so bad that when I went into the menus to look for visual settings that would reduce it - because surely something like that would exist in a game that does this - I was still getting sick from scrolling through the menus. I can't be sure, but I think they jolt slightly as you move between them.

But playing with friends makes the game even better. The fast gameplay makes it really enjoyable and the music is also really good. The only downside the game has is that is hard to play with keyboard so I needed a controller.","December 13, 2015","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So, I haven't had any bugs or glitchy experiences with the game, since last year it has been fully stable, which is great! Really down about the no multiplayer, they should hold a kickstarter for it! But still, fast pased crazy action that's worth the cash, thought it can get boring without a friend since there is little contect, I reccomend missions or more!","December 27, 2015","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Boiled down to sheer luck, as even if you're aiming directly at someone, your projectiles are not guarenteed to hit, or miraculously hit even though they weren't even aimed at you, which is cheap.\n\n.. And controls are fumbly but intuitive once I got used to it.\n\nSimply put, this is co-op-versus twin-stick shooter game well done with simplistic graphics.","December 22, 2015","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics and menus are great, the music is pumping and local multiplayer party games are rarely this good. Only issue would be the range of weapons and power ups available. The missiles and nukes make for great dogfights, but the it is too easy to hit your own bombs for them to be useful. More weapons and powerups would give this game more longevity. Bot AI can often be quite cruel too. Still, its one of my favourite party games on Steam.","December 5, 2015","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Took me a few minutes to figure out the delay when holding attack buttons.\n\nYou can shoot yourself pretty easy.\n\nThe CPU opponent is a jerk.  Best with multiplayer.\n\nOne thing of note is that the music is super Hi-FI techno.

What happens is, whenever you and your enemy get close to each other (which happens regularly), the camera does a quick extreme closeup, and then when you move away from each other very shortly after, the camera does a quick zoom out. Over and over.\n\nIt was so bad that when I went into the menus to look for visual settings that would reduce it - because surely something like that would exist in a game that does this - I was still getting sick from scrolling through the menus. I can't be sure, but I think they jolt slightly as you move between them. And there is no option to reduce the nausea.\n\nSorry guys.","July 17, 2015","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
