The gameplay tends to become repetative after a while, and the most effective strategy is just shooting everyone, and with bullet's being dirt cheap and most guns having a shoot all skill it quickly shows itself as the overpowered method. The campain lasts about 2 hours, with the replay value as sketchy. Having said that, there is a certain satisfation of shooting up the enemy. The story is mediocre, with none of the character's having any kind of backstory and the best motive being "Clean up the city of crime". If you do decide you want the game, buy it while it's on sale.","April 9","false","2.1"," 17 of 23 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","17","23","0","0"

Not much text to read or get eye strain.  Just simple elements, north/east/west/south movement choices on small maps, and simple battles.  I liked the special actions for each character and ammunition cost that added some depth to battles, but wasn't overly complex.  I liked the mission choice & rewards too, and the optional aspect to add more team members.  You can only have up to 4 active in battles, but you can have more on the bench.  It isn't too hard or frustrating, can save & load easily, and played easily on an xbox360 gamepad.  The game does have resolution choices if you go to the "system" menu item (press B to bring up menu).  However it wasn't pretty stretched to full screen on my 47" TV.  But I was happy playing in the default resolution in a window, which didn't strain my eyes for once.  Where Space Pilgrim gave me a headache, this was a pleasure.  This is the first RPGMaker game I actually liked.","May 15","true","4.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Lots of characters to choose from, a lot of missions to play, and a lot of choices of how to go about them. Lot of replay value and quality. And the left and right sprites are actually unique! Such an eye for quality and detail. The game play, the story's setting and pre-rendered sprites all give Outrage the feeling that it's a tactical blast from the past. The Windows 98 era, to be specific. Is nice! Lot of replay value. 10/10, would debate which mission to take on and with which party again.","April 8","true","7.0"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","55","11","20","3","0"

And that's only because I like cyberpunk and it's advertised as short - both promises which it delivers on nicely.\n\nI played through once and was tempted to play through a 2nd time to experience the other branches of the story (and get the achievements close to 100%) when I had some downtime and only a slow computer that couldn't run more demanding games... but alas, not enough hours in my day to come back to an RPGMaker game now that I'm back at my primary PC.","May 8","true","6.4"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

I'm glad I started with the hacker.\nClassic RPG style battle system with special abilities per character.\nAlso, making you feel that you're managing your time by choosing what to do in between major events.\nThey say it's a quick jaunt but i hope it's not too quick. I would definitely pick the game on sale if you like classic RPG with a slight twist. If not, take a look at video series we're building for something special.","April 10","true","1.5"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"
