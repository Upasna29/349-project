"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShaggyMoose/recommended/284970/","ShaggyMoose","ShaggyMoose","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShaggyMoose/","408 products in account","Anyone remember Zone 66? It was one of my favourite top-down "sandbox" shooters from the early 90s. This game harkens back to that era, both in terms of difficulty and gameplay. Be warned that if you are not experienced at this type of game and in particular, twinstick shooters, even on easy you will find this game an exercise in frustration. It is quite unforgiving...\n- Missions last between twenty minutes and an hour and there are no checkpoints! Run out of lives, back to the start.\n- Power ups seem to drop at times when you either don't require them (two repairs when I am already at full health, really?), or when it is practically impossible to pick them up without being destroyed. They don't hang around that long either.\n- Enemies fire from offscreen, many projectiles will track you for a long time and later enemies lean towards a bullet-hell style. These traits combine to make the airspace very crowded and sitting still for even a moment will be enough to make you very dead. This is where the game really shines; the flawless control and responsive movement of your ship make it a joy to play. It is possible to avoid practically anything, using a good sense of placement and understanding from which direction the next salvo of enemy fire is likely to approach. Unfortunately, the lack of on screen prompts and lacklustre radar make this heavily reliant on the player's intuition. Irrespective of that, there is a real sense of skill and reward, both for careful and ballsy play styles.\n\nThere are a decent variety of enemies that are slowly introduced as the game progresses. There are both air and ground targets, which need to be destroyed with an appropriate weapon, similar to both Zone 66 and Xevious. Each enemy variant represents a particular threat and they do force certain responses to deal with them. When you get many types mixed together, the game is at its most difficult and hectic. There is an experience system that awards points at level-up. These points can be used between missions to upgrade your ship. However, even fully upgraded your fire power always feels underwhelming. Players are better off focussing on upgrades that increase agility; this is the main means by which you will stay alive!\n\nThroughout, the graphics are decent and manage to keep up a good frame rate on a mid-spec machine. Enemy designs are standard fare and borrow from just about everywhere, but provide good variety. Explosions in particular are pleasing to the eye. Sound is a little bland, but does the job.\n\nA few minor technical issues cropped up while playing...\n- I was unable to confgure my Logitech F310 gamepad. Trying to change the controls in either mode (XBox 360 or F310 Direct Input) just didn't work. I ended up using the default XBox 360 control scheme, which did the job. You are basically forced into a twinstick control scheme to make the game playable anyway.\n- Steam achievements didn't work. They are awarded as in-game medals, but the corresponding Steam achievement wasn't activated.\n- Enemies occasionally get stuck in the scenery and cannot be shot. Usually not too annoying, but once the enemy was an objective and I couldn't complete the mission.\n- I had only one crash to desktop in seven hours of play, which isn't too bad.\n\nIn summary:This is an enjoyable but slightly repetitive game that rewards skillful play and will be appreciated by top-down shooter fans who are not looking for a quick fix.","September 26, 2014","true","8.7"," 29 of 32 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","29","32","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mccovican/recommended/284970/","mccovican","McCovican","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mccovican/","1188 products in account","A bug-hunters wet dream. Horribly broken menus (not that you can actually access the options in-game, because apparently this is 1995) and the inability to even fix it yourself because the player configs are in encrypted binaries. Menus are both slow to respond, and hard-coded to use xbox360 controller icons, regardless of control preference (oh yeah and the controls menu causes the game to grind to a halt). Which is probably just there to foreshadow the fact that the mouse controls in-game are abysmal and pretty much unusable. The ship will continue to rotate long after you've actually stopped making any input with the mouse, regardless of sensitivity settings - high sensitivity only results in massive over-compensation from any input, and low sensitivity results in the feeling that you're stirring tar. The standard troubleshooting (vsync, pre-rendered frames, etc) will offer you no remedies here, this is all game mechanism.\n\nThis could have the best gameplay in the world, but it's completely irrelevant thanks to an atrocious input interface with the user. Of course in reality, the gameplay is nearly as poor; it's marred by the usual suspects - invisible walls (with enemies that can shoot at you through them, but you can't shoot back - oh and they can do this with some standard geometry too), backtracking and just painfully bland & repetitive gameplay.\n\n4/10","May 7, 2014","false","1.9"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","12","16","0","0"

Super boring, you use the same 2 guns to shoot at endless guys that all look the exact same.

The barely there story sucks. And there are 3 lives per level, so even though the level is huge and takes like 15 to 20 min, if the endless guys that shoot homing missiles that don't seem to stop when they die or even after any reasonable amount of time, you have to start from the beginning, even if you beat like 5 objectives, almost if the developer didn't know to design checkpoints or levels. The guys just keep growing if you let off for a second and its impossible not to get hit by all the shots and homing missiles. Just stay away.

Not enough variety in the nme's, there must be about five or size types of flying craft and the same ground based...Its all very samey\n3. Lame upgrade system.  You earn xp to spend but do the upgrades do anything?  Havent a clue as you are stuck with the same dual shooter and rocket combo for the whole game.  No variety\n4. The special weapons dont stack, they just replace what you had....annoying\n5. the nme's will happily spawn right next to you, at one point I sat there shooting an auto spawning ship two inches in front of me\n6. nme's (and your own ship) occassionaly gets stuck in the scenary making it impossible to kill.\n7. The GFX are bugg'd to high heaven.  I fully upgraded by firepower and now all the shots I fire are completely invisible....To top it off the nme's are now firing barely visible black projectiles at me....and on occassion great big squares will come at me...most odd\n8. No options mid game\n9. Bearing in mind the levels are quite long there is no check point save system.\n10.  After fighting my way through to the final end game boss for some reason my ship became invulnerable...I just stood there and shot it happily absorbing every bullet on the screen....what an anti climax.\n\nMaybe if they fixed the bugs in this game it would be a whole lot more enjoyable and I could change this to a positive.","July 10, 2014","true","4.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Aircraft spawn to the sides and rear of you giving no time to dodge it, the number that do show up is not countable. They could have had a hanger to stop or slow the spawn rate on air craft but they dont. The good part, they have a single shots from them but the speed they fly and the shot speed are the same, you can see them flying with there shots right in front. The ground based tanks the AA guns are better balanced then what you face in the air, when you kill an area its empty after.\n\nI think they got he weapons swaped, guns would have been better for ground based and a little tracking on missles for anit-air, having to lead your target at a 90deg turn just to shoot aircraft makes it look bad. The limited ammo for big attacks has you wishing for more as this would have made the run and gun game play fun.\n\nNot recommened at this time needs work.","May 4, 2014","false","0.6"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

This completely destroyed my GPU.\n\nWhy do I blame this game? Well, it was a fairly new GPU (6 months maybe) and had worked flawlessly on every game. I installed this, didn't think to look at the forums (If I'm buying a full priced game then I do research but rarely for something that's a buck) installed and loaded up. Got into the tutorial and bam, had a black screen and the monitor turned itself off. Since that moment it's been doing it repeatidly until last week it decided to stop working completely.\n\nSo, why blame this game again? After checking the forums the first time I had the black screen, I could see I was not alone, in fact many threads were claiming the very same thing. Perhaps it's been patched now, I don't know, I don't care, there was zero reason for my GPU to go (new but not so new it was faulty out the box, not old enough to go wrong, it was spotless with no dust, temps were 37 degrees idle and 45-50 on load...in fact, I could go on and on but I won't). The sad thing is, it even did a bit more damage than "just" my GPU but i'd be here forever explaining it.\n\nPerhaps it was just co-incidence that it decided to pack up then? Looking at the forums, I really doubt that, and after just double checking a minute ago, even more so.\n\nIf it works for you? Great! Doesn't mean for one second though that there isn't an issue with the game and that it will work for someone else. It doesn't mean you're doing something right or the others are doing something wrong, it means that it's horribly optimised for different setups and you got lucky. I guess this is a problem with buying indie games.\n\nWas it 100% chance that it was this game that did it? No, I can't claim that for certain, but I do believe it and I can't in good faith recommend it to someone else for that reason.\n\nBe warned, and good luck to those who decide to risk their chances anyway. I think you would need to be unlucky for it to do what it did to me, but do check the forums before you purchase as general crashing to the desktop and freezes seem very common.\n\n(I can't review that actual gameplay because the game screwed up before getting a chance)","September 9, 2014","false","0.1"," 3 of 15 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","3","15","0","2"

Otherwise, I felt that the gameplay got very boring very quickly, with a boring upgrade system, uninteresting weapons, and very repetitive gameplay (is it dead yet? Circle strafe until it is!).\n\nThe controls felt clunky, and as a result, the combat felt pretty bad as well. Dodging bullets felt harder than it should, and the camera makes it easy for you to get sniped from behind without knowing what was coming.\n\nSound wise, this game felt like it had none. The soundtrack is so forgettable that I didn't notice when it wasn't playing. And get used to the horrid machine gun sample that they use for your main gun, cause that is pretty much the only noise this game has.\n\nI think this game has a story, but the dialogue that is supposed to fill it out only appears in small text at the bottom left of the screen, and goes by extraordinarily quickly, so when I was in the middle of trying to fight things, I couldn't read it at all, and as a result, I would often miss hints at objectives, making the game even more frustrating to play.\n\nTL:DR\nThis game is only for the most hardcore fans of the old strike series, or those of the shmup genre. Otherwise, I recommend a pass on this.","December 12, 2014","false","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Very frustrating to use and navigate.  Story is lackluster; spelling and grammar are atrocious.  Controls are a little tough in practice since both triggers require near-constant use and the right bumper gets used for special abilities.  You have to contort your hands on the controller to make it work.  Camera doesn't let you see shots behind you.  Radar is very confusing.\n\nThink those are petty, minor cons?  They are.\n\nProject Root is a fine game.  The difficulty on Normal is still scathing.  The radial gameplay is a cool feature used to great effect.  It runs smoothly and cleanly.  Shmup fans will find something to like about it.","November 1, 2015","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It launches to the main menu, then becomes insanely laggy and the game never launches to play, it just crashes.\n\nI left feedback and a dumpfile in the forums section, where it seemed someone involved with the creation of the game was helping people. I followed his instructions on how to leave the dumpfile, and it's been weeks, maybe over a month and he's never acknowledge my post or anything like he had been previously.\n\nI guess I just own a broken game.  I guess it's been too long for Valve to refund my money, but I was trying to give the people that made the game the benefit of the doubt and time to respond.\n\nDon't support broken-♥♥♥ games and teams that don't fix them.","July 1, 2015","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
