All levels + boss beaten in 20 minutes.  I would happily change my review if a lot more content was added. (The rest of my recorded playtime was spent idling for the cards.)\n\nOn the plus side, the dev is responsive to feedback, friendly, and appears to be working on fleshing out a lot more levels.  I'm looking forward to more levels and changing this review because the gameplay itself is enjoyable.","May 3","false","4.0"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","10","12","2","1"

Looking forward to see what comes next.

As long as the game is updated with more levels to play, then it's all good.\n\nThe boss fight was also fun, hopefully there will be more of those in the future as well.\n","May 27","true","0.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The reason for not recommending this is that it costs €5 for mere 5 minutes of gameplay. The game was simply released (even if in Early Access) too early.","June 5","false","2.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I went in with not many expectations but soon enough, I was hooked. The difficulty of levels and creativity adds to my experience, and after all, who would love "A puzzle-based action game about a slime escaping a lab inside of a volcano".","April 28","true","0.6"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","6","11","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EliteBossMan/recommended/463240/","EliteBossMan","THEBOSSMAN","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EliteBossMan/","71 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAn amazing game with an amazing developer. A must buy in my eyes.\nI've been observing this game for a while in greenlight and just couldn't wait for it to be released or at least made early access. As soon as the game came to EA I bought it and I can say that I was quite impressed.\n\nMagma Chamber, as simple as the concept is, can be really entertaining for being a puzzle game. The game gets difficult as you progress, soon introducing boss's that challenge gameplay even further. For an early access game at an early stage Magma Chamber doesn't cease to impress. Can't wait for the developer to update the game with more levels and worlds.\n\nI suggest you give Magma Chamber a try, even if your not into puzzle games. You won't regret it. ;)","April 27","true","10.9"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","47","7","15","2","0"

If you\'re like me and half your childhood was spent as a slave to Club Penguin, you will be rocking this game in no time.\n\nIn all seriousness, it\'s a really fun game, really well developed so far, and I can\'t wait to play more levels.  As the levels went on, they got more challenging (something that I am thankful for).\n\nMy only complaint thus far is that the sounds are unbalanced, so make sure you prepare your ears for loud explosions and quieter music.","June 1","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
