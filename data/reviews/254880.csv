"http://steamcommunity.com/id/psychodablo/recommended/254880/","psychodablo","Vini","http://steamcommunity.com/id/psychodablo/","366 products in account","This game has simple game mechanics, small tech tree, but provides a nice skill curve, once you figure out what each thing does, its a matter of how to use them effectively. no instructions (no tutorial) which is kind of expected from old games like this, but they have a tutorial video on the store page so that does help, the game isn't complicated. Though since the game was put on steam it would of been nice if they added window mode or resolution options or make it so the steam overlay worked ingame so thats disappointing. However the game works on new computers and I haven't ran into any color issues that seem to be present in old games on newer systems.\n\nGameplay:\nPlayers take turns launching units, structures or projectiles around the map. Players must secure resources around the map to gain more energy, the more energy you have the more things you can do per turn. The challenge comes from base planning and launching, every building palced is connected to the hub (the building that creates the other buildings) they are connected by a line, and no line can overlap each other so you must place your buildings carefully.\n\nThe hub can only launch the structure so far, when you press the "launch" button you have a charge meter to see how far it goes.\n\nThere is plenty of strategy and planning involved, the game has single player and multiplayer, single player offers skrimish mode and challenge mode. Skrimish is multiplayer but with AI. Challenge mode is bunch of scenerios with different objectives to complete. It's a nice way to learn the game and experiment with all the stuff.\n\nGraphics and Audio\n\nThe game is old and only supports low resolution but the sprites look really good, everything is pretty easy to identify and there are 4 teams each with different looks of the units so it has a nice mix up of the same units.\n\nThe music is catchy and fits the game, totally kickass and really enjoyable, the sound effects are great and the voices that speak to you help create character for the teams and fit really well together.\n\nOptions\n\nAs expected from an old game there isn't many options specially video options however it does contain the hotkeys and audio options including the ability to turn off the commentary if you so desire.\n\nOverall\n\nThe game is great and functions as intended, works on new systems but lacks features for a steam game, it's a small game and a low price, makes for an excellent game to play with friends. I give the game a 8/10, if they made the steam overlay work and add windows and resolution options it would be perfect.","November 16, 2014","true","7.3"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Was saddened when it disappeared into the maw of Atari, never to be seen again. Until now!\n\nThis may be the best strategy game that nobody played, and it just begs for a modern port for touchscreen devices. It's just an awesome strategy game with simple controls, and a depth that really grows on you over time. Yeah, the graphics are nothing special, they looked 10 years old when the game launched 10 years ago. The multi-player is LAN only. The voiceover accents are cheesy. It doesn't matter.\n\nYou play by launching one of 18 nodes onto the battlefield, scorched eath style. Every node costs energy, and is connected  to the node that launched it by a chain. If a node is destroyed, the nodes launched from it are destroyed in a chain reaction. There's the skill of placement, the tactics of deciding what to launch, and the strategy of resource management and the fog of war. There's never been another game quite like it, before or after. And that's sad. But at least you can still play this, even on Windows 8.1, 64 bit.\n\nPenny Arcade's effusive love for this game is still as relevant today:\nhttp://penny-arcade.com/2002/06/11\n\nAs this is an old game, there's not a lot of handholding. The challenge mode works as a tutorial, but you really should read the manual. Seriously.\n\nIt shows that this was a labor of love by a developer otherwise known for children's games. They must have polished this sucker in the back room for years playing amongst themselves. I've no idea how they made the pitch for this game work, but I'm still glad they did. Personally, I bought this just to convince Rebellion that a modern port is worth their time, this is one of the few game CDs that I've kept on the shelf since I bought it, and carefully re-installed on every new machine.","February 7, 2014","true","0.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Back when I was in middle/high school, picked this up at a Big Lots' bargain bin sale. Thing looked old, but I figured "why the hell not?".\n\nIt's a fun little game with an interesting feature: You fight with your buildings, not soldiers.\n\nYou become more powerful by expanding your base, setting Energy Collectors to boost the amount of energy you have to spend each turn, which allows you to perform more actions, such as launching more buildings and attacks.\n\nThe base is expanded by launching structures from a "Hub", which is the primary building for attacking and expanding the base. The hub can launch other hubs for further expansion, or set defensive buildings like forcefield generators and anti-air missile bases. And, of course, they can launch energy collectors for collecting energy. The Hub can also launch attacks against other buildings by launching a variety of ranged attacks, such as regular bombs, scatterbombs, missiles, and even a virus! The Hub can also launch a special "offensive" building which can only launch attacks, but at a far greater distance than the regular Hub.\n\nThis game also has a unique feature where all the bases are connected to each other by Power Cords. The power cord shows not only which bases are connected, but which hubs are supplying them power (aka which hubs they were launched from). If you destroy a hub that is supplying power to other buildings, those other buildings are also destroyed.\n\nAll in all, this game is fun. My favorite attack is the Energy Spike. You can hit cords and attack the two buildings on both ends of it!","February 11, 2014","true","0.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Very old, so if you're up to fascinating visuals and fast and easy skirmish on stupid aliens or whatsoever - please, look the other way.\nThe only downside that I see is that they only managed to add tutorial video on the store page and not in the game itself. Other than that - I'm completely satisfied.\nAs you can see from the store page print-screens, MoonBase Commander is much closer to board games than to something fast-paced like BroodWar. You starting with one pod, which is your base, and you building a network of connected pods, all looks pretty much the same. The only resource is the energy, which consumes on every action and restores if you settling on the acid spots. Of course, the only reason to play that game is competition - who is building faster, shooting more precise and planning further. Board game for LAN computers, marks 7/10.\nShould you buy it? Well, now, with that 85% discount - it is surely a good move in any case, because you can sell steam cards from the game for more money than you paid for it.

Disable fog of war , the wind and play on flat maps till you get use to the game machanics.

You sortof, launch the new stucture  to the desired location and it remains connected to your hub by a tether. So there's some skill involved in launching things safely on target. Just knowing what each unit is used for is really only half of the equation. Getting them properly deployed is where this game will offer you a fresh experience.\n\nIf you and your friends play RTS games... challenge them to a game of moonbase commander for some laughs fumbling over just getting your units deployed\n\nRecommended for unique gameplay mechanics and a fresh take on the genre, even for an old title","February 8, 2014","true","0.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atebash/recommended/254880/","atebash","Atebash","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atebash/","1019 products in account","This game will probably go by unnoticed. Shame, since Moonbase Commander is one of the most original and most entertaining games lately! It might not have stunning graphics and sound, but if it’s fun that matters then this is one great game!\n\nSo, what’s the story of this game? It’s quite simple – four companies are fighting for domination of the Moon. That’s all! There are no more details of the story, you will not be briefed about the current situation on the field, nothing! As the single player “campaign” starts, you will play as Niceco Company, then move on to Dewolf, then to System 7 and finally complete the game as Alpha team. Each company offers 4 missions and if you play for about 2 hours per day you should be done in less than 4 days. And I was just beginning to completely enjoy my superior strategy…\n\nThe game plays as follows: you construct various structures such as air defense missiles, energy collectors and radar towers as well as fire missiles, bombs or crawlers. Each component can be constructed only in the hub. Hubs are the cores of each “base”. When you want to build a component, you need to select it, pay the price for construction, then aim and fire the component in the wanted direction. New component will be connected to the hub and will be destroyed if hub is destroyed. Hubs can also construct other hubs, but note if the main hub is destroyed so are all others and you have lost. Each component has its price of 1, 3 or 7 energy points. When you start the game you will be getting 7 energy points per turn, but finding energy sources and placing energy collectors gives you extra 3 energy points. Your goal is simple – destroy enemy main hub(s) or place an energy collector on a specific energy source and hold it for a set number of turns (you will be told about your goal).\n\nThere is total of 18 components and weapons that can be “fired”. Aside from previously mentioned hubs and energy collectors, you can also build air defense (protects you from various air attacks), towers (provide larger viewable area when fog of war is turned on), shield (protects an area from everything) and so on. On the other hand, guided missiles are great if you are not aiming well, EMP disables shields, hubs and other structures, bombs are dumb and you need to aim well and finally, crawlers are ultimate weapon of destruction… but the move real slow. There are other weapons and components but you need to find something on your own!\n\nOnce you complete the single player campaign, you can still play skirmishes versus up to three opponents or in team with a computer against other computers. There is a multiplayer game option but you can only play it online via GameSpy.\n\nThe graphics and sound are much below today’s standard but such game doesn't need them anyway. Although the game can only be played in 640x480, everything looks real sharp and nice. Sounds are limited to the usual set of beeping, booming, crashing and whistling, with a voice commentary from your superior’s computers.\n\nOverall, the game is quite fun but it doesn't last long enough. After I was done with the campaign, I lost interest, as I never enjoy playing skirmishes (they just seem pointless to me).","July 15, 2014","true","13.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's definately my favorite strategy game of all time.\n\nI own a physical copy of this game, played it when I was six years old! I sucked at it back then but today, I beat Brutakas!\n\nThe enemy AI is stunningly inteligent, sometimes while playing I'll feel like I'm playing one of those computer chess games where the computer just does not mess around.\n\nThe challenge mode missions are fun and, as the name implies, challenging.\n\nLAN multiplayer is a blast! If you're playing with a few friends who are as equally skilled at the game as you, then it can be a blast! Just make sure you don't play against a person whose new to the game, you'll crush them easilly. Moonbase Commander is highly skill based game, I'd go as far and say that it's probably the most solid skill based game out there.\n\nThere is only one complaint I have with the game, which is that there is a balancing issue when it comes to underwater crawlers. Those who have played this game probably know what I'm talking about. If a crawler is launched into water, then it becomes the most overpowered weapon in the game, because the only way to neutralize it is to hit it with another crawler, when both crawlers hit each other, they detonate. This means that if a crawler is underwater right next to the shoreline, and you have buildings next to the shoreline, there is no way to stop the crawler from detonating and destroying your buildings. And if you think that's bad, it gets worse, because despite not being able to get hit by anything aside from other crawlers, missles will STILL lock on to the little things, and they won't do any damage to them. Underwater crawlers are easilly my least favorite thing about this game, and the more devious computers love spamming them.  Normally, crawlers aren't that ridiculous, because when they're on ground you can hit them with any type of weapon, and hitting them with a reclaimer defeats them without having them detonate. But put a crawler underwater, and it becomes very annoying. Honestly, a good way to balance it is if they would have allowed reclaimers to hit them while they're underwater.\n\nSo yeah. That is seriously the games only flaw. And guess what! If you don't play on levels that have a ton of water, then underwater crawlers won't even be an issue!\n\nBut, let's not leave things off on a bad note. I'm now going to discuss some of the even cooler things about this game!\n\nThis game features a map editor where you can make your own planets! And then you can play on them with your friends! And the map editor gives you a surprisingly large amount of freedoms, you can set spawn points, you can set multiple spawn points for different types of game types (such as if it's a team battle, a four on four battle, or a two on two battle). The map editor makes the possibilities of this game considerably greater, and I love it to death!\n\nThis game also features some interesting ways to change the game. In skirmish mode you can play with teams, set a WIND setting that changes the game feel considerably, and allows you to turn off fog of war. These options allow you to adjust the game to your preferences, in order to create the most fun experience possible.\n\nFinally... presentation. This game is gorgeous for a 2002 PC game. The theming of this game is awesome! Each of the four factions has their own narrator, and layout. In skirmish mode you can change the color of the team, and your faction, which also changes the color and style of your in game menu.\n\nThe four factions are as follows, (I'll give you my vague understanding of what they're supposed to be):\n\nNiceCo: Russian utopians who are hungry for control. "They will fall to our superior gameplay."\nDewulf: Industrialists who sound like agents from The Matrix. "We're gonna own this planet."\nSystem 7: Evil robots who are obsessed with triangles for some reason. "Our Galactic domination will continue."\nTeam Alpha: Military guys, the good guys, on a quest to save the galaxy. "Nice shot shirley! Keep em coming!"\n\nMy prefered fraction is Dewulf. But everyone else I know loves Team Alpha the most because they don't give you a hard time when you miss a shot.\n\nAlso it should be a mention that this game has a AWESOME soundtrack.\n\nFinal thoughts? GET THIS GAME. This game is awesome! And this downloadable version is just like the physical copy version! Except this one actually works on my new laptop, which has Windows 10.\n\nI give this game a perfect 10/10. One of my favorite games of all time. I honestly should have bought it twice during the winter sale and gifted it to one of my good friends .","January 12","true","9.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

But this game isn't it.  Wierd abstract sort of gameplay - can't even control where you build your base - you have to pick a direction and "velocity" and launch new base modules and hope they land where you want - there is no feedback - so if you don't get the velocity right you lost the cost of building and a "turn" for nothing!   Assuming you do build where you want - launching attacks is the same direction and velocity mechanic!  Argh!  I don't see how this could be so well rated.  It's not worth one dollar - can't believe I bought this!","February 7, 2015","false","12.0"," 6 of 20 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","6","20","0","0"
