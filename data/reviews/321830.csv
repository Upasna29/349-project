The dev of this game has created a game which forces you to play it over and over, it's really quite impressive. While it has lots of differences this game feels very similar to Risk of Rain which in no way is a bad thing.\n\n+Cool art style and the pixel graphics are done well\n+Loads of different items and plenty more to unlock as you play through\n+Plenty of characters to unlock\n+Different characters suit different playstyle so there's something for everyone\n+Rewarding combat, you feel good when you beat a tough enemy\n+Items are well designed and balanced, items also stack so the more you pickup a specific item the more powerful it becomes\n+You get statues in the starting location when you hit certain milestones, not the most incredibly feature ever but I like seeing what I have achieved\n+Simple controls\n+Lots of enemies\n+You can choose your loadouts\n+Item shops which allow you to choose what powerup (out of a choice of two) to buy and how many you want\n+Good variety of environments\n+Great Soundtrack\n\n+/-Bosses are really difficult, personally I love it because it makes you want to play again\n\n-Some weapons, the TNT Sling in particular (the equivalent of a shotgun in game), feel like they don't really fit in\n\nVerdict:\n9\n\nA solid Early Access game which is perfect for fans of Risk of Rain or platformers.\n\nEl K.","December 16, 2014","true","15.9"," 29 of 41 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","29","41","2","5"

I have no words. I love this game so much. This game went beyond my expectations by almost 500%. This game is so good, it's the only game I've ever written a serious review on. Where should I start? Amazing mechanics, endless hours of gameplay... This game goes beyond the limits of a roguelike bullet hell indie game. This game is at the same level of difficulty as Rogue Legacy, Nuclear Throne and Binding of Isaac: incredibly hard, but possible.\n\nPros\n-Amazing look. This is one of those retro looking games, but despite that, it still looks absolutely incredible. The lighting is awesome, the character design's are top notch.\n-The game mechanics are amazing. Its really "Escape the Lava" on drugs, and escaping isn't the only thing you need to worry about. There's hellish enemies, bullets spewing everywhere, explosives, and freaking buzzsaws waiting to chop your limbs off. Every so often, there's shops and treasure chests you can buy powerups from and holy hell, each of these power ups are just as good as one another.\n-This masterpiece has a tremendous amount of gameplay. I can literally plays this for a whole week and still not get bored. Not only is this game replayable, it wants you to replay it. Every character is very difficult to unlock. Most characters depend on luck. Which brings me to my next bullet...\n-The characters, the variety, oh my god. You have a total of 12 characters to unlock and each character is just as fun to play as. My favorite currently being Bloop who is able to spew ink where he jumps to stun enemies. Then comes the weapons. there are 3 unlockable weapons and each one are hard to unlock as well.\n-It's a roguelike. Is there much to say? Roguelike's are my favorite genre of video games. There fun, replayable, fast paced, and usually really freaking difficult.\n\nCons\n-Achievments don't really work. Not much to say about that.\n-I haven't played to much of this game yet\n\nTL;DR: This game is amazing. Replayable, fun, and difficult. My GOTY whenever it comes out of Early Access.","August 3, 2015","true","8.5"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"

The game has fun and varied gameplay, so two runs don't always feel the same. Different melee and gun variations make each run unique, and keep you playing. I've been watching the game since b15, and the developer, Vine, is really great with keeping updates coming, as well as letting us know what they will contain. My current biggest complaint with the game is the lack of letting us know how to unlock different weapons and characters. The starting screen shows many different unlockable characters, and I have a few ideas on ways to unlock them, but some form of hint as to how to unlock them would be nice. (Like, for an example, saying "Kill 5 bosses" on the character select screen) Over all, if this seems like a game you would like, you will probably like it. The infinite dungeon setting of the game suits the gameplay well, and the gameplay is fast and fluid. The game is really polished for a beta, and even if the game never gets updated (Which will not happen, the dev seems very loyal and trustworthy.) it's worth the price.","October 4, 2014","true","17.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Since the power ups are always random, you will never know what you can get that will help you alone your journey downwards.\nIt makes you just want to constantly get more and more power ups and try to find ways to save up and buy them from chests or just keep killing monsters so that you might get lucky to find one.\nI would say the only thing that drives me insane is how many stuff can be on screen at one time.\nThere's so many mobs, it's ridiculous, its crazy and yet it drives me to push myself to react faster and faster and faster.\nSo many enemy projectiles, better get the f*** out and try to kill them.\nBunch of elites that forces you to switch your gamestyle from close range to shooting.\nThere's just so many endless aproaches to this game.\nThe only complain I have is just not knowing what I need to do to achieve weapons/power ups/characters.\nThat would really help a lot knowing that I have to do that to achieve that level.\nOtherwise, this game is awesome.

This fast-paced action platformer features a multitude of unique heroes, tons of stackable powerups and frequent, content-filled updates from a dedicated developer.\n\nThe aim of the game is simple: to survive. You are chased from room to room by a large, deadly drill crushing the roof above you. In these rooms, you must destroy crates and kill varied mobs for money and health, using the money to purchase chests containing powerups. Theses powerups are sorely needed, as enemies become harder to kill and the terrain more difficult to cut through. Every so often you are presented with a boss, whether it be a house-sized laser-firing eye, a roaring worm with rapid cannons or who knows what else. Dig deeper and you will unlock more characters and items, gather more powerups and have much more fun.\n\nThis game puts a smile on my face every time I start it up, and has quickly become one of my favourite indie games from the past decade.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thedrastikmeasure/recommended/321830/","thedrastikmeasure","Draul","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thedrastikmeasure/","3257 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nRecently I got a chance to play some Cavern Kings by Vine. I am going to go ahead and do something that I hate doing but will then “flesh out” that comment a bit more. At first glance the game seems to be extremely similar to Risk of Rain which is published by Chucklefish.  Cavern Kings is listed as a Action, Casual, Indie game. The game has features of a Rogue-Lite style game as RoR was. Now the game is of course an Early Access game so many of the things I touch on are subject to change and ARE NOT reflections of the final product.\n\nCavern Kings while listed as a casual game seems to be a very hardcore game. It currently has no Multiplayer and that is one of the things I feel made Risk of Rain a popular and successful game. Don’t get me wrong the gameplay of both of these games are fantastic.  The store page for Cavern Kings does list Online MP as an upcoming feature so I think that will really push this game further along.  The biggest difference that I can see in the current game are that different classes in RoR play well different where from what I have played of the starting character and the character I unlocked were that they have no activate-able abilities and only have a passive. The starting character being Jack, says he is a jack of all trades. Doesn’t really help much. Then Misha, which gets more attack speed as they lose health. Where in RoR each character was entirely different.\n\nThen in Risk of Rain you have fairly large levels with statues, events, and shops to spend any currency you find.  Where Cavern Kings has a 1 map large screen and you dig/delve below into the next map. Layouts are different and you have different biomes. Such as snow biomes where you slide, underwater biomes where you move slowly but you have infinite jump, and move faster when jumping, then what appears to be the regular grassland biome.  You can occasionally find a crate to destroy which can have health packs, power-ups, or gyms in them after you destroy them. Cavern Kings does have gems that you collect from the mobs you kill, and you can spend them on chests to unlock them to get power-ups.\n\nPower-ups work the same way as in RoR.  It seemed power-ups varied the deeper you went.  Having multiples of the same power-up meant you had that many working at once. At one point I in a playthrough I had 11 of the missle powerup. Just lots and lots of explosions. Many explosions and it was a beautiful thing. I could use hear beethoven playing in my head as my missiles  and attacks destroyed any and all of the things….\n\nAs you progress through the levels you get a few different events, very few.  I fought a mecha worm and an eyeball boss of some sorts. Ive had to dig into hardcore blocks to break and sometimes I would get minions to kill that had keys and would have to get the key to the lock in order to get to the next level. Now the big thing here when advancing levels your timed basically as once your on a level to long a giant wall of drills starts pressing down towards you destroying all in it’s way. Touching it is instant death. So you farm while you can, and move on. There is often strategy to be had in using the wall of death moving ever so gloomily toward you.\n\nThe weapons… When you first start up the game you get to pick a character. You only have one character at first which is Jack. You also get to see any statues you’ve earned. Basically in game rewards/achievements, and of course… Your melee weapon/dig tool. I’ve come across three. A shovel, a jackhammer, and a pressure hammer or something. My favorite is the shovel, I don’t care for the jackhammer because it seems weak in damage and was just annoying to use. The pressure hammer was even worse however you could use it as an extra jump or a way to move faster across a level. I often found the pressure hammer got my killed more than it did help me. Then once you dig to your first level you get your weapon. A nail gun which is this games machine gun, a rail gun, and a saw-blade launcher or so it looked.  The saw-blade and nail gun were great but I hate… hate…hated the rail-gun. It knocks you back when you use it and fires slowly. It does however have a longer reach than the other 2 and has piercing damage. It doesn’t fit my play style well though but I can see how others could use it.\n\nThe deepest I made it was floor 18 so far in my few hours of play. I have really enjoyed the game and haven’t come across any bugs that I am aware of. My biggest issue with the game is that there is no options for the game and there is no control scheme setup or even anything that tells you what the buttons are. So I really hope that is something Vine brings to us before the final release of the game. I went into this game with no idea what it really was. I saw the art style and was like this looks awesome. When I got into the game I was a little weary of whether or not I was going to like it as all I could think of was Risk Of Rain… Risk of Rain, but as I played it really set itself apart so I applaud Vine on that. I cannot wait to see where this game takes us as it goes through development!\n\nWe give this game a Drastik Measure 8.2/10\n\n","October 3, 2014","true","5.0"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","8","13","0","0"

I haven't sunk a ton of time into it, but the game is very much worth the 10$. You collect items that modify your gun that you get at the beginning of the game, becoming more and more powerful as you face progressively fiercer foes.\n\nOnly issues I've had with the game is that some of the soundtrace sounds compressed and gets a little annoying after having it playing for the hours that I've sunk into this game. Otherwise, the tracks that don't sound compressed are everything you could want from a rouge-lite game.

In it, the goal is to go as far down into the earth as possible while collecting power ups, tons of cash, and defeat many enemies all while you wait for a giant drill to come down trying to crush you. The bosses take lots of luck with power ups and also take some stratagy to beat ex. The drill boss you want to lure him in one direction and move out of the way in a different direction. This game has a great difficulty as it gets harder and harder the farther down you go. There are also many kinds on room you will encounter ex.

The enemies bum rush you with beeline A.I. (walking enemies will even change trajecotry in mid-air if you dodge underneath). If you grind long enough, the game will force you to go to the next level with a slowly lowering ceiling of doom that instakills you.\n\nJumping is at a set height, so have fun trying to grab that HP and jumping straight into the instakill ceiling.\n\nThe eyeball motif just makes the enemies look really bland. It's like a cave was invaded by waddle-doos, or something.\n\nThe weapons are GARBAGE. You get a useless pea shooter, a slow-as-molasses heavy hitter, and then a sawblade-launcher that does insane chip damage because the spinning blades will roll around on the ground.\n\nEvery now and then you find an item shop where you get to buy as much as you can afford (enabling you to stack items)- I used to think item stacking was such a cool concept; but in reality it's a lazy and cheap workaround to making powerups balanced. Most of the time you end up spamming E in front of shops just so they can actually do something. But they're so spread out that they might as well not even matter.\n\n\n","April 25","false","2.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Perhaps I've been spoiled by other games with a similar nature, but this felt too bland and repetitive, not to mention it is surprisingly taxing on my computer.  Perhaps you can hide behind the early access curtain, but this felt more like an overglorified Flash game.\n\nFor a game that advertises variety, you see the same thing over and over.  The enemies quickly become familiar, and the weapons quickly become tired.  Three weapons with the same general mechanic do not "play and feel unique".  It's your standard set of light/fast, medium, and heavy/slow.  Plus three other weapons that, through a quick Google search, appear to be similar in nature with very minor variations.  I was disappointed.\n\nThe powerups are slow to come by, and a lot of them feel pretty useless.  The most useful one was a simple weapon upgrade for damage.  There were flashier ones out there for sure, but they were either very rare to come by, or their help was minimal at best, or both.\n\nPerhaps I had a certain vision for this game that I did not get when I played it.  When I heard procedurally-generated, with a unique variety of weapons, I thought I'd be getting a different gameplay experience every time.  That's the point, right?  But I did not get that experience.\n\nThis is not a bad game by any stretch, but it certainly did not blow me away.  Maybe if it's on sale for a couple of bucks it would be worth getting... maybe.  But at full price, no.  For ten bucks, there are much better games out there.","August 27, 2015","false","1.3"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","1"

While Cavern Kings has some fun and addicting features, it ultimately brings nothing new to the table, or necessarily does it better than similiar games. This is a pretty standard roguelite experience that is very similiar to Super Crate Box, except its not free ;). Each 'level' is a static screen that you try to grind out experience until a death ceiling comes down, and you dig deeper to the next level. Each level has increased difficulty. There are bosses and small two item shops. The item art is exactly like Risk of Rain, but they certainly feel more potent - which is a good thing.\n\nListen closely to this devs: fix your music - it is horribly loud and terrible sounding at this point. Allow options to manage music and sound volume seperately, and stop looping that single track. It is terrible to listen to. I feel so strong about this, that I could not recommend on this alone.\n\nPros:\n+I like the award trophies and unlockables such as the characters and various weapons\n+There is an addictive 'one-more-run' quality to this\n+Local co-op is cool, although terribly busy on the screen\n\nCons:\n-Enemy AI and tracking is terrible. It just feels way too simple - you actually have to 'bait' enemies around objects to get close to you\n-Sound is horrible, see above\n-It does nothing new in terms of anything, really (comment if you disagree and tell me what is new here)\n-Needs further optimization (I cannot play in fullscreen without it lagging terribly and I am playing on a gaming rig)\n\nIt is fun enough, but there is nothing new here. I will probably play a bit more, but I don't recommend this game to friends at this point.","August 22, 2015","false","1.7"," 6 of 16 people (38%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","38","6","16","2","7"

Every match has a slow build up to a crazy endgame.\n\nUnlike Risk of Rain however, there is no activating of teleporters or hunting down the last remaining enemies. Cavern Kings is significantly faster and lets you continue to the next area whenever you want (though that's not a very good strategy!). The game lets you destroy the environment with items, which lends the game to battles that feel more dynamic.\n\nIn some ways Cavern Kings does feel a little derivative (you'll encounter enemies and powerups which act very similar to enemies in Risk of Rain) but the game's mechanics are different enough that this never feels like a problem.\n\nOverall this is a great game in early-access.

I can use this game as just a mind numbing background when I want to relax or I can use it as a true challenge.\n\n\nPros:\n+Fast paced\n+A lot of upgrades that allow different experiences every playthrough\n+Local Co-op\n+Eventually online Co-op\n+Game pad support\n-I cannot say how well it is supported as I have not used one\n+2 different game types, standard and arena. Arena is basically the extreme difficulty (to me)\n+12 different characters. 11 are unlockable\n+Each character has its own unique play style and abilities\n+Changes every play through\n\nCons:\n-Some bugs to work out:\n-you can click locked characters and still be able to play them. this is the major one\n-Not a huge variety of weapons:\n-3 melee\n-5 long range\n-Steam achievements are not unlockeable\n-This is known and they are working on it.\n\n\nI love this game and I can only imagine that in the coming updates it will only get better. They are going to be adding some extras, which I am not sure what that consists of, and online Co-op which should be extremely fun. I would recommend this game to people who like rogue style games and mindless killing of cavern inhabiting creatures.","February 17, 2015","true","42.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a great time waster and delivers plenty of entertainment and replay value. As it is Early Access i have encountered my share of bugs / glitches, such as double clicking a lock character too play them, but it's still great fun and is worth the money if this looks every interesting too you.","January 31, 2015","true","10.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But now that I have played it I can say it is by far one of my favorite Indie games, I come close to putting it beside The Binding Of Isaac and the great thing about it is it's only in beta so there is much more to come, catchy sound track, cool weapons, cool melee/digging tools, AND soon there will be a multiplayer feature so I have very high hopes for this game, oh and lets not forget the awesome bosses.\n\nINDIE RATING OF: 9/10... to be fair I can't give it a full 10 until it is completed but for now it has exceeded my expectations\nGAME RATING OF: 8/10... Mostly because it's beta and there is one really long song throughout the game, ADD MORE SONGS PLZ!!!","April 18, 2015","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I would recommend this to anyone who has an interest in games like Risk of Rain, Nuclear Throne, and many other fast-paced rogue-likes. I've never played Super Crate Box, but I've heard that it's similar to it. Cavern Kings also reminds me of Risk of Rain from the powerups that you get, as they show a lot of similarities. This game does have its flaws, but it's still in early access and shows a lot of potential.","March 25, 2015","true","48.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For me and some of my friends that play it the fun comes from how hard the game is to progress in the normal mode. There is many chactarters to chose from and each has their own play style. Mishka the lovable bear attacks faster at low health where as yoaji is stronger mellea wise and starts with a sowrd. Arena mode can be hard for the first few min's of gameplay but after 10 min's you are on the verge of being unbeatable. I highly recomend this game. If you want a challanging game thats harder then binding of isac but is just as simple this game is for you","December 27, 2014","true","53.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
