Before I proceed, I have a suggestion; Do the following:\n\nStep 1.) On the Store page for this game, where it tells you whether the reviews are Positive, Mixed, or Negative, click on that (It says mixed for me right now, but there's no telling what it says for you).\n\nStep 2.) You should see a Heading that says "Helpful customer reviews".  Observe the filter.  I suggest you click on "Negative".\n\nStep 3.) Read a few of the negative reviews.  I read about 6 of them and noticed a trend.  See if you notice something as well.\n\nStep 4.)  Now, keeping everything you've read in mind, go back to the main store page and scroll down until you find the link on the right that says "View Update History".  Compare the content of all those negative comments with what you see now on the update history.\n\nNow we may proceed.\n\nDid you notice a pattern?  A trend?  My observation was that it appears that the bulk of the negative comments on this game consist of individuals who do not comprehend the meaning of "Early Access".  I say this because, before writing this, I did those above steps.  I read what they had to say, and compared it to what the game is now, as of this writing.\n\nI found all of their arguments invalid, because they failed to understand that what they were playing was a work in progress.  Their complaints are/were all worded in such a way as if they were reviewing a finished product.\n\nAll too often, we see detractors whine and complain saying that "Early Access" is an "excuse" for their poor quality.  I suggest that people who make this argument are either trolling, or lack the intelligence to comprehend what it is they are saying.\n\nThe entire purpose of Early Access is to allow the community to support and be involved in the direction and development of the game.  If you expect a game to simply spring forth, fully developed with all features intact and no bugs to speak of, then you aren't looking for an early access game at all, but an ordinary full release product like any other of an endless list of games elsewhere.  You cannot influence a game that is already finished.\n\nThis game was very rudimentry when it was first made available to the public.  Some basic block placement and a creative mode.  That was IT.  Early reviews claimed it was a "Minecraft Knock-off" and "Boring".  This is why I asked you to read through all the negative reviews.  Because if those people were to say those things about the game now,  any reasonable person would wonder if those people were even playing the same game.  Remember this when someone says that saying "Early Access is a cheap excuse".  Because those people obviously lack the reasoning to understand how this system works.\n\nThere are few games on Steam that I have seen with the level of developer interaction and update frequency observed on this game.  Look at the discussion threads.  You will find that the developers actually engage in conversation with, and consider the input of the players.   That interaction is the POINT of early access.  We as players get to influence how the end-product turns out.  You can't do that with a finished game (barring MODs of course).\n\nI have no way of knowing what your experience with survival sandbox games consist of, but if you're reading this review, there's a strong chance that you are not new to it.  If you are new to it, then you are fortunate to arrive on the scene when you have.  The genre has evolved quickly, and it is continuing to do so.\n\nThis game is still early access as I write this, and that's why I wanted you to follow the steps above before reading what I have to say.  I hope that ultimately, if you do decide to purchase this game regardless of it's state of development, that you will be pleased with the outcome.\n\nI myself enjoy this game.  I have watched as new features are added, changed and removed, tweaked, or radically altered.  Ultimately, only you can decide if you like it or not.  But I hope that you'll be able to make a more informed decision whether you want to invest in it's development.  Or if it's done by the time you've read this, only you can decide\nif it's worth your money.\n\nMy humble opinion is that it is/will be.\n\nHere's why (took me long enough didn't it?) :\nFortressCraft Evolved takes the basic block-based voxel genre and adds automation, tech trees to research, and ever increasing risks and rewards for exploration.  Furthermore (depending on the difficulty setting) you'll find complacency to be ill advised.  There are threats looming on the horizon and you can lose.\n\nSome of the more rewarding technologies require exloration into hard to reach areas, requiring you to upgrade your survival suit in order to acquire them.  Some of these areas require an investment in infrastructure and defenses.  Whether you are playing single or multiplayer, you'll find the whole thing challenging and rewarding.\n\nAgain, this is just my experience having played the game from very early development until Early Access 1.20.\n\nI have no regrets.","September 20, 2015","true","147.9"," 264 of 327 people (81%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","81","264","327","16","14"

Take the technic mod from Minecraft and make it 100 times better.\n\nThis is one of those games that are pretty simple to figure out, but as you progress it gets a bit more complicated.  Mainly this game is all about logistics.  Getting resources transported from your mine to your base so you can smelt it and make new items and do research.  All while defending your base from aliens that attack you if your base threat gets over 100%.  If you like a game about logistics you will love this game.  At first it starts off very slow and you manually do everything, but as you progress you start to automate.  It is when you get to the point where you start automating everything where it can either be a whole ton of fun or a logistics nightmare.  You have to make sure you have enough ore coming in to feed your smelters.  So you are always looking for new veins of ore to tap and send up to your base to be smelted.  Plus having to figure out how to get power down to your mine and also keeping a nice design of your base.\n\nOne thing to remember is you can just about move anything except for the CPH and the research station.  So don't be afraid if you build your base one way and want to change it later.  I have done so many redesigns to my bases because I didn't play far enough ahead and had to tear most of it down and rebuild it.\n\nI am not going to do a Pro's and Con's list.  Because it is still in early access and things change almost on a daily basis.  Also remember that this game is early access and things do change.\n\nOverall it is a very enjoyable game and I have put in tons of hours into it and I am looking forward to new things as they get added so I can implement them into my base design.\n\nI do recommend you run the Bleeding Edge beta if you are planning to play it because it has all the newest stuff in it.\n\nAlso the Dev is really awesome and have talked with him several times and he loves input about the game.  I stream this game and he has watched my stream several times and has even helped me out a few times because I didn't have things setup properly and he walked me through it.  He talks with others in chat in the stream and answers questions people have.  This is the first time I have actually seen a dev actually watch a stream of their own game and ask for feed back from those watching and from the person streaming.\n\nMy overall opinion of this game is grab it.  It is ton of fun and you can also play with friends (just gotta open up a port on your router).  One of the few games out there that is truely Co-op.","January 10","true","395.7"," 100 of 110 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","100","110","2","0"

It was rough, a lot of things didn't function properly and I was confused as hell. Went to the forums and almost 1:1 the dev was posting back and talking, on all the forums I checked. Big ups for that.\nWhat about the game? Well its minecraft style construction and world building but that's where the comparison ends. You extract ores to creat ingots to create new machines to support your lazy butt because the name of this game is automation. There's been more than once where I just sat back and let my machines work to produce some ingots i needed or research modules. This game has some serious depth to it and with all my hours I have in the game, they're all in ONE SAVE. Last game I played that let me do that was Dark Souls. So Yeah this game deserves your attention. It doesn't look the best but the gameplay is fulfilling and there's tons to work towards. SOme crack head said one of the end game items was a 20 hour work, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t 50 hours in and i ain't got it. I just finished the last of the tech tree so now I get to build the fancy ♥♥♥♥ i researched. So pick this up because its worth your money and if you're having issues ask the dev because i've had full conversations with the guy. He's really cool and helpful. He takes your complaints and suggestions into considerations.\nThey fixed more bugs than i can count when I started this game.

This game SUCKS my time. I can't stop playing it. Every time there is a couple of new updates (at least once a week) I start a new world to see the new stuff. I have yet to finish it. Something new will come along and some of the stuff on the old world just isn't as good, so start again. Every time I get a little bit faster and a little bit further along but I just like to try to build all the items and see how they work. I only wish that you could download all of the different versions to really see how far this game has come. The developers are on the forms constantly updating. The only problems I have ever had with the game is trying to run an old version after a major patch and then some items mess up. So what, start again and see all the new stuff. My favorite part is that I don't have to finish the game to play it. It's not linear. Do what you want.

Pls.forgive spelling :)\n\nWhen I first got the game I saw great potential in this game, I mean.. SPACE, Building, Tower defence, and combat... how could I go wrong. Well I will till you this, my first opinion was a negative review, the game was a resource hog, there wasn't much to do, was able to beat the game to my satisfaction in just one sitting on the weekend (-8 hours). But hey, it was EA and as such I do not give bad reviews to EA games that are still being worked on, because you never know right? However if I had, I would have given the game a 3/10.\n\nOver the year I have been part of the "Bleeding Edge" bate patch group. AKA the, "this game is now broken" patch where new stuff was tested. there were several hickups when patches were relised, however all you had to do was report the issue and 9/10 the problem was fixed with a new patch in just a few hours. NICE JOB DEV'S. main patches we constent 1-3 days apart, except when RL issues delayed the Dev. However being a one person team sometimes this happens. It was not uncommon to even have several main patches a day if the DEV was on a roll. So is the Dev dedicated to this game??? I would have to say he is more dedicated then 99.9% of the Devs out there. Just for that point alone the game then became a 6/10.\n\nWhat's my opinion now that the game is out of EA???  Well I have to be honest, the game isn't done to my hopes and dreams that the potential first showed. but I need not worry because the Dev still plans on putting in just as many hours a week now as he has in the past so MUCH more stuff to come. the game is still a bit of a resource hog on top settings, just when you take in consideration when I fist started the game I was on the lowest settings and getting lag, I can now play abouve recomended with little no no lag... 1000% improvment Many items, and tings to do have been added taking an 8 hour game well past 150 hours (depending on your play style) the dificulty with the added features have made a game that I use to play on hard settings into a game I need to play on below normal (still learning the new stuff).\n\nI have been typing to long now so I will give you my "out of EA" rating. I would love to give this game a 9/10 but due to some bugs and glitches still active I can only give it an 8/10. losing one point for the glitches (all games have them even "finished" games) and losing one just because you can always improve the game right? BTW 8/10 is the highest rating I have ever given a game... so that alone is a "WAY TO GO DEV"","November 9, 2015","true","508.1"," 94 of 112 people (84%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","84","94","112","6","0"

That's where the similarities end really.\n\nMy daughter plays Minecraft, she plays it for hours. However, whenever I sit down to have a go, I get bored after about 20 minutes. You dig. You build. You dig. zzzz\n\nFortressCraft is much more immediate than that. Your power is running out, you're going to freeze to death, so you need to organise. This forces you to think stategically, about power, about distance, about supply lines (and presumably, in the future, defending them from other players). It kind-of feels more like a RTS, but with blocks.\n\nIf you're used to other Mine games, this one IS even more complicated. But part of that is due to a very alpha GUI, things aren't as obvious as they could or should be. This will be fixed!\n\nfor example, bringing up your inventory, you have a bunch of blocks. What are they? no idea, a mouse-over tooltip would be nice :)\n\nAlso, I'd rather you only had things in  your toolbar that you actually owned, it's too confusing with *every possible thing* being shown, yet you can't use 90% of it. Again, early access, these things are to be expected.\n\nOne thing that is immediately "wrong" with the game - shelter. If you build a "house" over your base equipment, put a torchfire or two in there, surely it should be warm enough inside that you don't freeze? What's the point of building a "Fortress" if it doesn't have any benefits lol :)\n\nI absolutely recommend this, if you're a fan of Voxel miners or even RTS games. I see a bright future for this game, because unlike others, there is actually a game to be played, a point to it all. (you can, of course, go into creative mode and just build pretty stuff, but I kind-of don't see the point of that unless you can then turn the world into a survival one for you and your friends. No doubt that's coming too eventually).\n\nBuy it, try it. If you don't get on with it, try it again the next update. and the next. It's going to be a good one :)","April 30, 2014","true","81.5"," 99 of 131 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","99","131","0","9"

Since then it has degenerated into the mess that it has become today, an unfinished hodgepodge of ideas found in other games with no clear direction, no character and no fun. The mob graphics are shoddy and the loot system is incredibly weak. Players consistantly complain that they find progression to be awkward and the game has no real aim or endgame amongst other flaws in basic game design which prevent them from working through the messy research system but the one-man-band developer refuses to accept their concerns, maintaining that his design is flawless, and original of course, so they walk away having wasted their hard earned cash on a bad clone. This game should never have left early access at it stands and shouldn't really even be on Steam.\n\nI asked one of the devs why there were no building blocks available in the survival part of the game and they told me... and I quote from Skype...  "I can't be bothered to write the recipes"  I later find that they're selling the survival game blocks into the game one by one to Patreon supporters as though they're a commodity.  I've never heard of anything so stupid.  A voxel block game with no voxel blocks until Patreons 'buy' them for the playerbase?  What a joke.\n\nIf you're considering purchasing this game you should know that even though the base game is unfinished, the developer is now concentrating on a paid expansion pack which he intends to sell for $8 (subject to Valve approval). If you buy this game now you will not be able to use the resources you see ingame unless you pay an extra 8 bucks for the expansion. No, he didn't tell the rest of us that either and while comparable indie games like Space Engineers and Factorio are a huge success with 1,700 players ingame consistantly without this kind of failed-game pay-to-play mentality, these guys are either too lazy, inept or don't have the brains to see past their own short-term pockets and even though this game has been on Steam for years, are attracting less than 500 concurrent players ingame and trying to make up for the shortfall in popularity/profit with useless paid DLC. I'm all for buying good DLC for a good game but the game has to be finished and popular first.  God knows how much I've paid for Payday DLC but those guys deliver content.\n\nI'll move on to content after the next round of developer downvotes.\n\nThe biggest problem with this game is it's developer's attitude. A very rude guy who doesn't listen to players, is struggling to earn a living from the game because of that and is now begging for money in his stickies on the forum with threats that he will stop development and go & find a job if the game continues to fail.\n\nThe developers were also begging players for positive reviews a few months ago because the game had a red 'mixed' review tag, now each time a negative review is made he sends over his 50 cent army to falsely manipulate the Steam rating system and argue with the reviewer, incredibly obvious because the same names appear in the comments section of each negative review and they are mostly using fake, private profile, Steam level zero accounts. The same fake steam accounts are also being used to pump up the positive reviews for the game. Steam really should do something about it because they are cheating customers. People from the publishing house with financial interests in the game no doubt and it certainly doesn't help that a steam moderator is involved with this game's development, also fairly despicable that the same Steam moderator is fully aware of and allows this kind of manipulation of the Steam review system, time for Steam to remove him I think.\n\nNow for those who don't know, the developer's previous job was working in a limited role on Borderlands 2 which obviously didn't include game design. Most if not all of the 50 cent army downvoting this and and all other negative reviews for the game have only Fortresscraft, Borderlands 2 and a couple of other free games in their limited Steam level 0-5 game list. What conclusions can you draw from this? The developer's friends from his previous job who've been gifted copies of Fortresscraft are defending him? Or the developers friends have been gifted both Fortresscraft and Borderlands 2? Either way it sounds like they're cheating Steam and their customers to me.  2K Games employees too, that should be interesting.\n\nWhile the game developers and other financially or emotionally interested parties keep sending the 50 cent army here to downvote my review, abusing the Steam rating system I'll remove their abusive remarks and downvotes by posting it again, they just keep reminding me of more flaws in the game to add to the review & that way it will stay on the recent review list forever until they learn to accept genuine reviews with genuine ratings from genuine customers and stop manipulating the Steam rating system and cheating Steam customers.","May 12","false","801.0"," 126 of 182 people (69%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","69","126","182","15","6"

I've not yet seen everything from the new stuff, but I moved some outdated issues further down into an archive section and updated the text in general.\n\nThis game is voted more negative has it should be. It's quite interesting and plays like a big Minecraft mod but without the normal Minecraft features. It has many flaws, some easy ones like lack of help at the beginning and some bigger issues.\nThings that could be better:\n- needs cables. Using batteries as a replacement for cables for small distances is expensive at the beginning and also quite inefficient. The laser energy transmitter are bad for diagonal stuff. There should be cables for medium distances.\n- big lack of reasons to do stuff. You are only playing to produce more ressources to build more machines to produce more ressources... (minecraft and other games are having the same issues though)\n-- there should be more survival in there. There's only energy and temperature, build a solar station and you are fine forever. Needs food and the need to hunt creatures and build farmes. Creature breeding would be nice too, they could give ressources needed to craft stuff.\n-- there could be more interesting stuff deep down. Like stronger creatures who need better weapons. Like Minecrafts nether or ender world. The "goal" of the game could be to get super deep to the strongest creatures and best materials, build the best equipment and fortify a base in the hostile environment.\n- the weather. It's snowing all the time and snow everythere, that's depressing. Needs some sun and grass.\n- there's no reason to be on the surface. You are either deep down sitting in your hole, basement dweller style or at the ever snowing and depressing surface. Watching your machines doing monotone stuff makes the world feel even colder.\n\nUpdate due to good point from from WolfWrag:\nThe development seems really slow considering it's not much cheaper than Minecraft. I thought it was free or cheaper, maybe I got it cheaper due to a sale. It seems to be a side or hobby project of like one developer. I don't know how many people bought this game so it may be a bad ratio of invested time vs earned money. Though even the full price of 9€ is relativly cheap compared to normal/typical games (thought even Minecraft costs ~20€ I think). I played a lot so my ratio of playing & had fun time vs. price (even the 9€) is still quite good, especially compared to those triple A games for 70€ where you are finished and bored after like 20 or 30 hours (or even after a few minutes). So I would still recommend it for people who like Minecraft and want something different with a different focus.\nComparing it to Minecraft is also a bit harsh as Minecraft was a much bigger success, has a higher price, has/had more developers and was developed over several years until it was like today, as most people know it. I joined Minecraft in Alpha or Beta stage and that was much more buggy, unfinished and had less features as FortressCraft has now. FortressCraft could add more stuff like survival with farming, animals and maybe something like the logic stuff with Redstone in Minecraft and it would be quite comparable to Minecraft feature wise (both would have stuff that the other hasn't but the amount would be comparable).\n\nArchive with outdated issues:\n-- there are some creatures in there like those rock morph things but nothing that does anything or is useful. Some creatures should be hostile. It's interestingly scary to go deep but there's not really a reason besides sound and graphic effects.","May 4, 2015","true","126.0"," 41 of 48 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","41","48","0","7"

This is an actual review with actual details about the game and such. you may not want to read this. I know most people like to read / write reviews that only gives 1-2 vague sentences about the game.\n\nI’ve been playing FortressCraft for 4 years now. I originally bought FortressCraft on the Xbox when it first came out back in April of 2011. I have played the Xbox hundreds of hours and have been there through all of its development. I can sit here all day and tell you all about the Xbox version too, but this isn’t about that version, this is about the evolved FortressCraft, FortressCraft Evolved.\n\nFortressCraft Evolved isn’t a port or a remake of the original FortressCraft, it’s a reimagining. The game has been completely rewritten from the ground up using Unity as the game engine (They were using XNA framework on the Xbox).\n\nThis review is of version 1.15d. I’ve owned FortressCraft Evolved on Steam since the beta for the pre-alpha (You had to know someone to be able to play it, wasn’t available for purchase on Steam yet; It was hidden).\n\nStory:\nThere isn’t one currently, unless you count the 2 paragraphs of text in the help menu.\n\nMain Menu:\nCurrently, the main options in the main menu are the 'join multiplayer server" option and the world select option. You can create and select at least 10 worlds currently. You may be able to make even more than that, but I have never had need for more than 4 worlds at a time because the creative worlds are so large, I can just go find another place and start building.\n\nGraphics:\nThe graphics are great. There are shadows and mist, and dynamic colored lighting. The textures are HD and the models are very good.\n\nYou can change the resolution of the game, whether it is full screen or not, and the quality of the graphics.\n\nControls:\nI read a lot of reviews that say the controls are horrible and this and that and I don’t know about them, but I don’t have any troubles at all. You move with wasd and any command you need to press ‘on-the-fly’ are all within reach of your left hand. Keys that aren’t are things such as: The Help Menu (h), Toggling the headlight (L) (which requires power and glow sticks are better (g key)), Inventory (i), and that is it.\n\nAs for creative, you will have to use the F9-F12 keys to use the special build commands, such as super build and copy / paste.\n\nAny complaints about the buttons being in a bad place are really rather dumb though as you can customize any button. When you first launch the game, a configurator appears and you can scroll through every ‘control’ and change the key and also change / set a secondary key. Don’t like the “Toss a glow stick” key being G? Change it.\n\nYou can also change the sensibility of the mouse in both the X and Y position and you can invert it.\n\nPlayability:\nThe game does have a few bugs and mishaps, but as far as playable, it is very. I can get on survival mode and play for 5 hours straight and have almost no issues. Almost all bugs are found pretty quickly and are reported to the developers who are actually pretty active. For an Early Access game, I would say it is high on playability. Is it perfect? No, but it's...EA...\n\nAnnoyances:\nYou can not change worlds without exiting the game. This will be changed before it leaves EA though.\n\nYou can not change the graphics and controls in-game, only in the startup menu. This does not include sensitivity.\n\nCreative mode:\nThis first mode is creative mode. This mode has transformed a lot over the years and I think the best thing about creative mode are the custom blocks.\n\nCustom blocks allow you to create...custom blocks. You create what is called a ‘workshop’, which is a hollow cube that is 2x2, 3x3, 4x4,..., and 8x8. You can place blocks inside the workshop, like normal, but once you leave, anything inside of the workshop will be compressed to a single block and you can then go and place it and use it. Check out the 13th picture in the Steam picture roll for the store page to kinda see more about what I’m talking about (The train).\n\nThe other special feature about creative (and is in survival) is called build-to-me. You hold down control and click on a block out in the distance, and it will build the block all the way to you along the axis. This feature is amazing and I wish more games had it.\n\nThe other two nice features about creative are super build and copy and paste. Super build is kinda like WorldEdit (the Minecraft plugin) but way better. You can see what the build will create in real time and you get a simple GUI to customize the super build you are about to make instead of typing a bunch of complex commands. You can build a sphere (you can edit the radius), a rectangle (you can edit the width, height, and length), and a cylinder (you can edit the radius and height). You can change the size from 1 to 64 and you can make it hollow or solid. You can also make it build with the selected block, or you can change it to dig, so it will essentially add air as the block.\n\nCopy and paste also works sorta the same as WorldEdit. You select one corner, then you select the other corner. You then get like a preview type of a thing and can see exactly what you just copied and what you are about to paste looks like. You can rotate your paste and see it rotate in real time. You can simply press the paste key and it pastes. You can paste the same object as much as you like, it doesn’t go away after the first time. You can also save what you have copied and the developers have said that they will one day add a workshop where you can upload the copied items to.\n\nAs for blocks, there are over 200 different blocks you can currently choose from.\n\nA REALLY nice feature they added recently is called the paint gun. Some of the blocks are ‘paintable’. You can change to the paint gun and change the colors of the R/G/B. There are 16 of each color, so you can make a wide range of colors. You point and shoot and the colors of the blocks will change (but keep the texture). The feature is topped off with the fact that you can point at the block and middle click, and the block will be selected as your current block and keep the color that the block is painted.\n\nThe last significant feature is the Storm Staff. With it, you can use the scroll wheel to select different features and: change the time of day, make it sunny / thunderstorm, and spawn a meteor that starts in the sky and crashes and explodes wherever you point the staff. The latter is super cool to use and spamming it creates an awesome lag fest of awesome and explosions.\n\nAs a final note, the world goes 1,000 light years in all directions. This is different in Minecraft because Minecraft only goes about 1 million in length / width and about 128/256 in height. Another note is that while the world is still 1,000 light years down in survival mode, once you get at about 5,000 depth, the world gets super hot and you will die from hyperthermia.\n\nSurvival:\nSurvival mode is totally unique and really awesome. It has machines, kind of like Tekkit, but not really. When you start, you start off with a way to generate power, a crafting table, a smelter, and an ore extractor. Instead of health, you actually have power. If you fall, you lose power and depending on your conditions, you lose power more quickly.\n\n===================\n\nAs it turns out, my review is too long.

Unlike the others, though, ODP offers significantly more in the way of RPG elements.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, ODP is very much in the real-time roguelike tradition, with a series of rooms in which the player faces challenges of combat or dexterity. You are locked in a room until you complete it, and then may enter an adjoining one.\n\nPros\nCompared to other roguelikes, ODP has level progression per session, with choices of perks at each level-up. Your choices are effectively a build for the session, and reduce the randomness normally associated with roguelikes.\n\nThe gothic art style is a good choice, and was no doubt influenced by Edward Gorey, a personal favorite of mine, as well as more recent expressions of the genre, such as "Don't Starve."\n\nODP has a story that unfolds in fragments, and while it's hardly a masterpiece, it's far more than one would expect for the genre.\n\nCons\nThe lack of controller support is a big mark against the game, and an oversight that is more egregious considering the genre.\n\nI like the sketchy, gothic art style, but ODP's art style feels amateur and inconsistent. Some objects feature sharp, fine lines and hard edges, while others are soft and look like they've been heavily resampled. Also, there is insufficient variation in room props. I've seen many pixel-perfect-identical desks or chairs spawn in neat grids in the room.\n\nThe pacing is poorly managed, and the rooms quickly become boring and repetitive. Many rooms require far more patience than actual skill, at times making the game a tedious slog.\n\nPickups are mostly uninteresting and give small bonuses to stats like health, critical chance, and damage. Roguelikes usually feature a variety of highly powerful objects or abilities, or at a minimum, very interesting ones with multiplicative synergy. ODP's pickups lack synergy and (generally ) only linearly affect stats.\n\nThe game's difficulty is disappointing. The game is very easy when compared to hardcore roguelikes, and will probably disappoint players who expect a serious challenge.","November 12, 2015","false","79.8"," 222 of 350 people (63%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","63","222","350","12","36"

The devs are very responsive to the community and often respond within a day or less.\n\nEdit - as of release\nStill awesome, still a lot to do, a lot of improvements have been made to give you a more "isolated" feeling like you really crashed landed.  The difficult of this game can go between easy and holy crap stop it hard so I think thats a good range for both new and old players to voxel type games.  I can literally lose a weekend to playing this.  As to the rumors that it's buggy, unfinished, or abandonware.  The dev believes in complete transparency, he announced a feature lock on what would be in the release, and even slipped in some extra goodies in his spare time.  There are plans to add even more features beyond the hundred or so game hours you can easily sink in to the existing ones.  As for the bugs, this has far less than pretty much any AAA title on its release day (lets not even bring up every bethesda game ever), most of the so called bugs are not bugs, they are misunderstood features or someone feeling butthurt for being stupid, those that are real bugs, usually get patched within a day or two and eventually cycle up from the bleeding edge version to the mainline.","August 2, 2015","true","210.4"," 41 of 52 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","41","52","2","1"

The developer has now declared that it is finished, and all he'll be doing now is fixing bugs. Here are the remaining issues I have with this game:\n\n1. Consistent UI for machines. This one tripped me up repeatedly. I'd go to a hopper and press E to interact with it, because E opens the UI for pretty much everything else in the game, but the hoppers have no UI. Honestly it makes more sense to use T to Toggle the hopper settings, instead of Throwing selected item on toolbelt into it. Would be Consistent to have a UI for the hoppers, see exactly whats in it, then you could pull specific things from it.\n\n1a. When I finally started tossing iron in, I would have to press Q repeatedly to get everything out of the smelter feed hopper. Then drop the iron in, and if I dropped in anything else, it would randomly select what to make next. So I'd have 1 iron bar, and then a bunch of copper and tin. Although, it's indicative of not random, but a LIFO type system. Last In First Out. Since copper and tin were already automated to that hopper.... So in order to get JUST iron out, I'd have to rotate a belt, empty the hopper, put the iron ore in, wait for the iron ore to finish processing, then rotate the belt back, and drop stuff in again.\n\n2. Mobs pathing through solid objects. Got a nice recording of a slime inside my CPH and also inside the crafting machine. Can't shoot it there.\n\n2a. Kinda got lucky on my base placement, although at the same token, unlucky. It's been a while since I've started a world and had my base nestled at the foot of a mountain on one side. Because the last time that happened, I had to DIG OUT a mountain side, because the green balls of wasp vomit? poop? were flying out of the mountain side at my CPH. Once I dug out enough, I found 2 wasps just chilling inside the mountain, shooting at my CPH. Like solid walls? who cares! we don't have the programming to respect solids. With the slime just willy nilly oozing into and out of my CPH, I'm going to have to assume that nothing else respects solid surfaces either. Arther sure as hell doesnt.\n\n3. No display showing how much charge arther has. At least he's no longer holding a digital sandwich board, cracking jokes, but it's impossible to figure out how much charge he has now, except with a charging station I'm told. It's nice that his text now shows up over your toolbelt, but the sound is a bit obnoxious. Reminds me of an old NES game, where when the characters talk, it would make little blip noises with each character... like Zelda.\n\n4. Arther upgrades still reside in your inventory, and same with suit upgrades I'm assuming, since pressing S in the inventory screen opens a screen for suit upgrades that looks clearly incomplete. I made Arther's power core, why the heck does it live in my inventory? Why doesn't it go to it's own area? IIRC, you can take arther's power core out of your inventory and put it into a storage box. As long as you pick it up before you log out, and it's in your inventory when you launch the game, Arther counts it as having it.\n\n5. Still wish there was a compass. The holobase does seem much better somehow, and there's these red arrows in it, no idea what those are about.\n\n6. Logistics Hoppers, the white ones, although they still didn't spit things out as fast as a Large storage hopper, you could use them to empty a mining drill and send the contents onto a belt. Now they are slower some how. The point of the logistics hopper was to get the ore out of the drill and into transport. Now there's no choice but to stick a storage hopper on them. Which also seem slower in their dispersing speed.\n\n7. New Issue. The automation machines, the stamper, the extruder, the coiler, and PCB maker, used to just zip right along. Since they updated the recipe for laboratory pods, to use 1 PCB per three plates, for a total of 2 PCB to 6 plates for each lab pod... I would build a belt turntable, put a hopper on top of it, stick conveyers on each of the outputs, 3 sides leading to a stamper, 1 leading to the extruder, coiler, PCB maker, have the belts meet at the bottom and move up into a second hopper at the same level as the first one, so you could waste less resources and make lab packs... The whole build occupies slightly more space than the New and improved Behemoth of a CPH. But seeing as the speed of those automation machines is excruciatingly slow now, it causes a backlog, throwing the ratio's off. That's when I decided I'd had enough FCE for a while.\n\nThe early game of FCE is Excruciatingly slow. Now with the improvements to the speed of the automation machines, it's going to be EVEN SLOWER...\n\nWhat FCE feels like to me: Solitary Confinement.\nWhen I shut the game down, I don't feel like I'm leaving FCE, I feel like I'm escaping.\n\nI'm really happy I got two copies at such a cheap price, but to be honest, unless it goes F2P, I'd leave this alone and spend your allowance on a game that was made by a developer that cares more about giving you a quality game, rather than how much money they get for making it.\n\nI will delete comments on this review at my discretion. I'm tired of being harassed by FortressCraft Promoters for expressing my opinion. I'd like to lock it so no further comments can be made. But apparently I don't get that option. So if you love FortressCraft Evolved, write your own review and stay off of mine.","November 3, 2015","false","179.1"," 182 of 290 people (63%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","63","182","290","16","7"

The world looks like Minecraft, but feels more realistic, and your task is to gather ressources and build up a working factory (not like a big plant, but several small pieces put together to smelt, craft, shape, improve, research many things you find on the planet) so that you can finally be rescued or something (don't know, I didn't came so far yet). But (same as Minecraft, Factorio and similar) you are not alone on this planet. The more you proceed down the earth (or however this planet is called) the more you attract some kind of insectiods, which will visit your factory from time to time and check if you need anything (like terror and death). They seemed driven by a higher intelligence, and yes there is something like that. Either somewhere burried in earth are some huge globbing eyes hidden behind a undiggable wall of ... don't know what, looks like the stuff from the Alien-Movie. Those "Eyes" send small creatues to steal ressources from unprotected conveyors to reach with their ugly arms after your factory. The other ones are vastly huge, four-headed, brain-thingy, glowing ... things. Well, you will recognize once you see them. And, I don't know wether I was day-dreaming... but I think I saw something like that worm from Star Wars that was hidden inside that asteroid trying to eat the Falcon...\n\nConclusion:\nQuit your Job, break up with girl-/boyfriend, close windows and doors, headphones on, uhm... maybe VR if you have  and buy the game.

I absolutly adore this game and has tons of wonderfull ideas and features with literally constant updates. So lets get into the game. What is it? You could say its minecraft but in all honestly...it kind of isnt. It is its own unique game with tons of unique blocks and features that I would love to have in minecraft, that not even modded minecraft can offer. So lets get the good and the bad in the game listed in a nice little list. This is a little lengthy so if you dont want to read all of this and want to know the short version\n\nSHORT Version: Its a good game lots of features and updates, little bugs, if there are it gets fixed pretty quickly, dev streams and listens to his watchers. Also they look at feedback and love to get feedback on the game.\n\nLONG: If you want more depth here you go.\n\nPROS:\n-It is constantly updated on a daily baises. There are new features almost weekly and when they did a poll on their twitter, literallythe next day there was a solution and was implemented within a pretty short amount of time. A day or two before it was in the game.\n\n-Bugs are quickly addressed when reported and usually will have a patch in a decent amount of time, depending on how game breaking it is of course.\n\n-Multiple tiers that you work your way through as you go deeper into the world.\n-Researching those tiers. The deeper you get the more Research points you get (RP) The more blocks and flora you scan the more you unlock.\n\n-Replayability. Theres a lot of replayability in this game and with constant updates and a lot of features being planned it is always a new experience. (Especially if they add the planned features like space)\n\n-ARTHER. An amazing little robot that you can dress in a top hat, eye monocle and an good looking moustache. Love it! Though hes really useful ingame with status updates and back up power if you run low.\n\n-Much more to list that would just make this ungodly long.\n\n-Multiple game modes that are pretty fun ranging from hardcore and rush mode one or two others that I cant think of atm.\n\nCONS\n\n-Not everything is implemented yet. Some stuff is in there but it hasnt been properly fleshed out. (Though this isnt in early access, it still technically is because of a lot of reasons that you need to game developers point of view to understand. (Which the dev actually explained to us in a stream in depth which gives you a big understanding of the gaming industry. Like the top games make 90% of the money. Even though fortress craft is in the top 500 for steam games they still struggle, so even though this is the con section, I highly suggest if you buy the game you buy the DLC with it to help support them))\n\n-Things can be a little difficult to piece together, even with the handbook, so it may take a little bit of time to figure things out or do a little research (Again its being fleshed out and the handbook is still unfinished so its understable)\n\n-Your kind of stuck in spot defending the same area. Now Im sure they have plans to change that especially when they plan to implement space, so for right now your kind of defending your castle.\n\n\n\nHonestly Im just prying cons out of anything I can just to make this seem fair, but there really arent to many cons. If you cant launch the game then talk to the dev. They'll try to help you. Trust me, they want to help you and expand their player base. You can listen into one of their streams and their ideas and viewpoints are really nice to listen into and really put time into their game. It is a bit of a tedious game so it takes time to make things but once you get the hang of it you will surely have fun. This is truly a fantastic game and you should give it a chance. I would honestly even say that this game should be valued way more then 10-15$ for the amount of work they put in, so its a pretty good deal for a game like this.","November 26, 2015","true","149.9"," 31 of 38 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","31","38","0","0"

You can eeven rotate the whole thing before you paste it.... amazing\n\n"lighting"\nconfigurable lighting at that!!!! configure the colour strength and distance and even shadow type, individually for every single light you place.\n\nI could go on and on but then if you are liking whats mentioned above then you are most likely going to enjoy the game and enjoy exploring everything else out once you start playing it and creating anything you can think up.\n\nI hope this review is of help to you.

However, FC:E stands out from the crowd due to the rather powerful tools that are available to the player. The various tools that you are able to use allow you to make very large and very intricate creations. Copy/Pasting sections of the world can be done very quickly and the ability to create your own blocks using the ingame workshop function allow a level of creativity that has not really been seen in such voxel games previously. I myself have not spent a huge amount of time in creative, however from the limited hours I have put in it became clear rather quick that those who enjoy the freedom of making anything they want will really benefit from these tools and this level of freedom.\n\nSurvival\nHere's the mode that has stolen a huge amount of my time. In basic terms the survival aspect draws many of the gameplay aspects of those in Minecraft - mining, resource management etc. but here's where FC:E does it differently. A huge focus of FC:E's survival mode is based upon automation and logistics, creating large transport, mining and power networks to build a base and gather resources.\n\nThe blocks that exist in the game all have useful functions and although can be a bit daunting at first, are quite easy to use and options for creativity open up once you get the hang of things. If you've played anything like the Feed the Beast modpacks for Minecraft or Factorio then this is the game for you.\n\nCurrent state of the game\nAs far as I am aware the engine for this game was built by the developers themselves, allowing them to tailor it to suit the needs of a game like this. It's definately not perfectly optimised, but I have certainly seen worse and the development team are constantly working to improve on this as well as fix bugs, this is to be expected in an Early Access game.\n\nThere's a decent amount of content in the game to allow you to spend quite a few hours building and creating what you want. The development cycle is quite fluid and the creators are quite active on the forums, responding to questions, asking for feedback, addressing issues etc.\n\nMobs and combat are the next big thing to come, which will add quite a bit in terms of gameplay as you will need to defend your base and resources.\n\nMultiplayer in Creative is complete and as far as I'm aware pretty free of bugs. Survival Multiplayer is currently in a working condition although there are some bugs still to be ironed out, but as mentioned previously the devs are quite open and transparent about this and work on this is constant.\n\nOverall I believe this game is a steal at it's current price. Judging from what is already in the game and what has been discussed as the future of FC:E on the forums I really think this game sets itself apart from all the Minecraft clones on the market.","May 12, 2015","true","187.3"," 24 of 31 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","24","31","0","0"

Nothing has changed. I saw the devs update less and less. Then Nothing. Then almost Months later come back screaming "where not dead!!!!." with no updates since then or anythign else done.\n\nIts my assumption this game is dead.\n\nSure, some fun things to do in creative, but i bougth this for survival. And so its unplayable. So many bugs and glitches. You dig a hole and the wall disapears or you fall forever. Dig a deep hole to mine. No simple later to climb your way back up. Just that grappling hook which is ridicously stupid since you will grab a wall and will just fall instead of holding onto the ledge to regrapple to the next higher area.\n\nNo enemies even though they sit there. You can't find any specific ore, or be able to access the ones you need.The robots or other tech to help you gather the resources don't work and create a really big irritant.\n\nI spent majority of my time running between sites trying to repower them so they could work a little more.\n\nThen you die by freezing to death. Go underground Freeze. Search for deposits, Freeze. Lose your energy, Freeze. No way to locate your base? Freeze. Repower yourself and end up burning yourself Alive.\n\nSpeaking of which, No compass or way to find your base again! Yes the map is small (which is another issue), but you can't find your base, because everyhting looks the same.\n\nThe map is small and you can't find any materials you need. I kept digging and digging, not a single material i needed (Lithium) *cough* *cough* could be found.\n\nI thougth this game would feature defend you minning base or somthing cause aliens will attack. Nope....\n\nAnd oh yes the UI.... Looks like a kid in HS made it. I mean its bad. Majoirty of the items in your inventory don't have images. Half the items don't work. and when would I make more than one item at a time? unless I'm in creative mode where I'm just messing around.\n\nAt that point its boring to me. Sure maybe for you artsy ppl this is great. but for me its a waste of time and I find no entertainment out of it.\n\nOverall, A great concept.

I played it since early stages and seen it evolve and I can say that devs are really working hard to make this game aversome. There are of course bugs, but they not game breaking, and you can easly ignore them.\n\nWhat i feel playing only survival mode that it's Minecraft on steroids. You get building gun that has VERY long range, infinite world with no bottom and TONS of things to craft. And its not simply digging a few blocks and just making them into some items. You need to use machines to mine ore and coal, power it up and get ore to smelter to get bars for stuff to make. You need to research new machines and tools, and some research proyect requie several machines setup and TONS of power and metal to get.\n\nBut the best thing about this game is building automation. You can set up a mine, connect to storage, to engine, load with coal and just come back for ore later. Or you can connect conveyor belts and your ore is transported to smelter, power mine from some sorts of power that is supplied by coal from other mines and your mine will work by itself until it runs out of ore. You can sort your materials, set up complicated structures and watch how its nicely work by itself.\n\nThe only think that it's lacking is info how things work. You get short toturial, but basically you need to figure out how each machine works, and there are few dozens of different machines.\n\nThis game is great. Maybe not perfect, but it's something I've been looking to play for a long time.","October 6, 2015","true","760.9"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","0"

Two of the biggest advantages of FortressCraft (gonna call it fc from now on) are the superbuild tool and the copy/paste tool.  I find both of these EXTREMELY useful.  I can cut the time in half by just holding down ctrl + m1/m2, whereas in a game like Minecraft (I'm probably going to compare/contrast fc to Minecraft a lot in this review) it takes much time, patience, and effort to build things on a large scale.  Also, the way that the terrain spawns is pretty cool.  It moves in to take position instead of just appearing like in Minecraft.  Next, the list of blocks to choose from, in my opinion, is WAY bigger than that of Minecraft.  Configurable Lights, Ore Extractors, heck, even a huge laser gun!  Now before I start getting a lot of nasty comments on this review let me make one thing clear:  I do NOT hate Minecraft.  I actually like it. In some cases, I prefer it over fc, but remember:  this is the pros section. Okay, where was I?  Oh yes, the large library of blocks to choose from.  Ok, so moving on.  I also particularly like the lighting of the certain blocks that produce it.  I also like that the blocks to choose from are mostly sci-fi themed, whereas Minecraft has more of a 'survival' themed list.  Alright, I think that covers the pros!  Now to the cons.  Fc is probably one of the buggiest games that I've ever played.  Now, hold you horses!  This is an EARLY ACCESS game.  You would be a fool to think that an early access game wouldn't be buggy.  I'm sure that all of the glitches/bugs will be gone in time.  Also, after you fly around for a while and you land, your sight radius dramatically shrinks.  Sometimes, I can only see about 10 blocks in front of me, and that's it until I restart.  Again, early access game.  It will get fixed in due time as with the efficiency of the servers.  One last thing:  I know that it's being built/programmed as I type this review, but as of this moment, fc is ENTIRELY single player.  PLEASE don't leave comments about how it's being made right now.  I'm just saying that if you're planning to buy it right now then be prepared to play ALONE.  Obviously, the pros outmatch the cons by a landslide, so I give this game a 2 thumbs up!  I can't wait to see how this game adapts and evolves!!!","January 4, 2014","true","10.2"," 63 of 103 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","63","103","0","5"

But now you get so much info in game, you really don't need a wiki or forum for a long time.\nYou get a super cool elevator, so you don't have to walk all the way up and down.\nEverything is simple to use but but you have to think about it how to use it best.\n\nThe game is just pure fun.\n\nI was always looking for a Tekkit-Lite (MineCraft mod with technology) alternative. This might just be it.\n\nI love it, that the destroying of blocks is so easy, that the building is so easy, that you have no "realistic" ground where you always fight to get it nice looking. Here you work with cubes in MineCraft size, the difference is, everything is fast and looks good and there is so much to do.\n\nWhat I saw and what makes me wanne play a lot more but I  don't have the resources for it yet:\n- Defense turrets\n- Spiders\n- Threat scanner\n- Power storage\n- [...] (I have researched not much yet)\n\nAnd this is just the beginning.

By far not.\n\nIf you are bored with your current open world building, mining, crafting game, give this one a try.\nIt is not yet very good, but already good enough to be fun for minecraft fans.","April 25, 2014","true","37.4"," 26 of 37 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","26","37","0","3"

I am a veteran of Minecraft, FTB, MITE and various other custom maps and challenges particularly in survival mode. FCE is similar, but different, to all of these and is centered around your base. You get most of the tools you need from the beginning, and from there it is up to you to build your base around the ore you find, and to automate it. Automation is really cool - you can do things the hard way, yourself, or build a conveyer belt and laser power and it does it all for you! You can just stand there and watch it go, and I often do! After a while you will have to deal with mobs too, so base defences come into play. There is a tech-tree for you to discover which unlocks a lot more of the game, and the "limits" are not what you are used to - there is no bedrock, you can just keep going and going. Super-dig and build-to-me features are "wow" as is the x-ray vision mode, grappling hook and jetpack.\n\nYou might think that after all those hours I have done everything there is to do in this game. Well, I have played out a few worlds but no, I still have plenty of things I want to try.\n\nEven though there is Witcher III and Fallout 4 (coming), I'm already calling this my "game of the year". Stick with it and you will find it great fun. Sure, it is still in "early access" but this is already better than a lot of fully released games. What are you waiting for? get it now!\n\nps.

Also unlike minecraft, it has more of a longterm goal list then "Punch tree, make bed, find diamond, now what?"\nAs you decend into the planet you also face progressivly tougher chalanges, from both the alians and the enviroment itself.  it forces you to think out every action.\n\nOverall, it could use a little bit more work, but what would you expect from somthing labled "Work in progress" Can't wait to see the next update.","November 11, 2015","true","86.8"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

We can see that on their Youtube channel, FC videos are 2 years old or more. After this long time FortressCraft is still in early access with lack of most interesting features. I'm wondering why this game development is so slow when the original FortressCraft was sold and earned milions $... Or maybe they lied about FortressCraft success?\n\n- Game is still in early pre-alpha version where we have ONE world that looks similar every time we want to create it again, why to the ♥♥♥♥ there's always snowy biome?! Every new game starts in the same way, the same world, the same origin.\n\n- Lack of block, there are maybe 40 blocks in whole game\n\n- The original FortressCraft was one of the best-selling Indie games of all time. Maybe it was... but this one will be dead soon, only 300 reviews in one year. 100 of them are negative. People are not intrested in making ripoff of ripoff again.\n\n- Unique survival mode based on... well... nothing, because there's nothing hard to do. You as player, you are not forced to defend yourself using weapons, walls, shields, cannons or something. Game isn't challenging. The main difference between survival and creative is simple - there's no flying mode and you have to craft stuff.

This game definitely looks amazing and has equally amazing mechanics in how each machine interacts with the others.\n\nThe learning curve for the mechanics can be a bit steep but once you get the hang of it you'll spend hours building and changing things and still have more things to do! Defintely many many hours of fun to be had.\n\nFor single player I'd give it 9/10 and for multiplayer I'd give it 8/10.","November 12, 2015","true","125.0"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

My favorite part is the fact that this is a giant open world puzzle game that takes constant tweaking to optimize your setup.  There are some unpolished areas and annoyances but the developers are responsive and put out an impressive amount of work for the small team they have.

I have played for many hours(although a lot of that time was spent afk... I tend to forget I have games running) The basic concept of the game is great, gather resources, build massive assembly lines, defend against attacks, all to save yourself when you crashed on a freezing planet.  So then why the negative review?\n\nThe game appears to be a released title but upon deeper investigation (after I had bought the game, stupid me) I realized that it was still in Alpha/Beta but the developer wanted to make more money so he "released" it on steam.  The game has missing icons/textures, wonky AI, and is still has a MASSIVE list of features to be added, bugs to fix, and balance issues to address.  I havn't encountered the game breaking crashes/bugs others have reported.  IF I WANTED TO PLAY EARLY ACCESS I WOULD BE HAPPY.  The game is being updated and features are being added.  The negative review stems from the fact that it is not a complete game even though it appears that way at first.\n\nOh, also the dev has stated that he is breaking the game into several expansion packs.  So you only get part of the content for your initial purchase.  However he only recently decided this(or made it clear).  I can understand wanting to get paid but it is sneaky and dishonest to publish an unfinished game and then charge people more money if they want the finished product.  If all this were clear on the store page I wouldn't be writing this review(and would probably be fine with it... although i would have waited until the game was complete before considering purchase).  The sneaky way it is handled is what bothers me.\n\nSo FOR NOW I do not reccomend purchasing this game.

It is one of the focal points of the game and you can craft a variety of machines to do much of the mining, crafting and distribution of materials so you can research, mine and craft even more powerful machinery that takes increasing power to run meaning you will need to upgrade your power network to keep up with the demand of an ever growing base of machines.

Frustrating at first, but already the developers have made it much better.\n\nI've never played Minecraft but have always wanted to, but when I went to their website and would have had to sign up for an account before I could even see how much the stupid game cost, I became annoyed. I read on another site it was $30 (which I'm not sure is true or not, regardless I became more annoyed). Lo and behold, that same day on the front page of Steam I see FortressCraft for $4. Needless to say I got it.\n\nThe first hour was an incredibly frustrating experience because I had absolutely no idea what I was doing and the help menu wasn't helpful at all. Thankfully they have made it much more in-depth, so new users shouldn't have nearly as much trouble as I did. I read a guide and got into it, having quite a bit more fun even though finding ore was tough at first (they have also made this easier, using one key and scrolling to find the ping you want, whereas before there was a key combination for each ping type).\n\nNow that I'm getting my base set up and things automated, I'm having a lot of fun! It's always cool to see your progress so clearly.\n\nThere are some bugs which is to be expected since it's an early-access game. Most annoying is that the x64 executable likes to go missing, so I've been playing with x32. There are infrequent crashes, and if you quit when anything is in your smelter the items get lost. Not a bug but slightly annoying when I first started playing: menus that don't completely work. Now that I know the features haven't been implemented it's fine, but before I was clicking and totally confused as to why nothing was happening.\n\nThe roadmap the developers have is great, and they seem to be very active here on Steam. Nice to know they're listening! Things I would like to see added are some ideas or guides for power plants and things like that, more detailed graphics (though I'm fine playing with the current ones), and maybe trees that regrow themselves. That would be cool. Seeds and stuff would be neat too.\n\nAnyways, it's a great game and awesome for the price and all the stuff they have planned.","May 8, 2014","true","25.0"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","2"

Once I opted into the beta, and selected some easier difficulty options, I found a game that was somewhat similar to some of the tech mods for minecraft, but with far more depth and coherence.   But this game, unlike minecraft, or most other mining games for that matter, requires you to build infrastructure that mines and processes for you, rather than you mining yourself.   The early mining process requires you to locate a sutible ore vein, plop down a ore extracter on it, stick a storage hopper on it, and dump a bunch of power into it, and leave it for about 10 minuites before coming back, recharging it, and taking the ore to refine.\nHowever, every step of that process is automatable, from the very start of the game.   Progression gives you faster, more efficient ways to mine, and automate the mining devices, while encouraging you to dig deeper to get access to more valuable ores, to research and build more advanced and effective machines.\n\nPros\n-Advancing tech keeps you building and modifying structures\n-Tower defense aspect adds mid and end game goals\n-Scanning and visual tools lets you quickly plan out the most efficent way to set up and debug structures\n-All the information needed to progress can be found in game, no immersion breaking forum trips needed\n-Large difficulty range\n-Multiplayer (Still buggy, will likely be improving with time)\n-EXPLOSIVES that you can make as powerful as you have power for (maybe not so great in multiplayer)\n\nCons\n-Not much in the way of a wiki to look up information for optimizing setups, particularly base defense\n-Single threaded- hard to run unless your computer has relatively good single thread performance (I have an AMD 3.7 GHz processor, and I have to run it on a lower graphics setting to avoid framerate drops)\n-Mob difficulty tends to get grouped- if you want things to fight back, you also have to deal with ore eating mobs that spawn on your conveyers.\n-Falling too fast kills you, makes it somewhat hard to go down mineshafts, you have to spend a fair amount of time building and navigating stairwells or platforms\n-Some dead spots while waiting for materials to be mined or refined","September 10, 2015","true","118.7"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","2"

Just... Wow.\n\nWhere to start? This is a really well thought out, high quality game that encourages players to take advantage of its in-depth building system to achieve levels of creativity not found in other craft games.\n\nMixing exploration with creativity, the game world modes cater for just about any gamer. Survival mode is possibly the most interesting, feeling fresh and challenging to just about any gamer. Survival mode gives a subtle drive to the creative player, besides creating visually stunning environments.\n\nOther modes offer a more relaxed experience, with vareity to suit the player. All modes are customizable in terms of difficulty and resources, in order to create the most suitable game world for the player.\n\nThough in terms of fun, multiplayer is where it's at. Co-op mode is a blast and working alongside your buddies to create and delve is great.\n\nVisually the game blows most other craft games out of the water. The textures have a hand made, consistent quality not often seen in games today, and compliment the models considerably. The sheer level of effort put into the visuals is very noticable, and the torch light in underground areas is pretty cool, gives a real sense of exploration.\n\nThe sound effects are great and the music is decent, complimenting gameplay. Listening to the ambient wintery wind howl as you dig and search for resources in survival mode is pretty awesome. Gives a real sense of being in the game.\n\nBest thing though? The deep building system. You can do all kinds of cool stuff like powering generators with coal or materials for equipment energy, check out objects to find their hidden secrets with your laser scanner, craft new gear with materials you find along the way. It has to be seen to be believed really.\n\nSadly the game has had some slating in the past owing to early beta releases, though in comparison the game has gone leaps and bounds miles away from what it came from (and I hope past reviewers amend their posts.) and exceeded my expectations.\n\nOverall, the game is a great choice for craft game fans and players who want to dip their feet into the world of creative games. Highly recommended.\n10/10\n\n\n","November 4, 2015","true","3.8"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

Survival is NOT finished.\n\nThe game is cool,I do like building and mining.\n\nSurvival is fine but there really is no point in building defences there is no monsters no danger like in survival Minecraft.\n\nThe constant fear of freezing to death is very annoying,make sure to bring lots of torches if you want to explore and mine,everyone says upgrade your suit but its kinda hard when ya have to find the minerals to build the stuff to upgrade your suit. Most of the minerals are very hard to find except for the basic ores or if you do find them you don't get much of them,so its hard to upgrade your suit when the ores ya need are hard to find.\n\nThe graphics are nice.\n\nOver all the game is cool but its still in early development hopefully they fix things.\n\nI reccomend this game but don't expect it to be a clone of Mincraft,feels unfinished.\n\n","April 23, 2015","true","26.1"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","14","20","0","0"

However, you have to build most of your power and automation on the surface.  This basically means you'll spend a lot of time figuring out ways to ship ore to the surface.

They give you a little survival guide that helps you figure out how to survive initially.  Without that there's no way I would've made it.

The worlds are huge, it's easy to get lost and fall down to somewhere far below your base, but that's what the grappling hooks for!\n\nI don't have too many hours into it yet, but so far I haven't seen many bugs.  Occasionally the blocks go transparent if you're standing too close, and the pause menu doesn't seem to actually pause anything.  If you're going to walk away from it for a while, make sure you quit to desktop.

I mostly play games like terraria, FTL and minecraft. I make a new review so that I can point out the positive pieces.\n\nEnergy system, ores, ingots, intermediate building materials such as PCB:s, copper plates...\n\nIt is a bit difficult to move far away from your home base since the power quickly drains. Besides that, I say it's a challenge. So far, I haven't got to the point where I think this game has "everything". The most bothersome challenge is moving far away from the home base and finding the resources that you need. Canalizing coal into the main hub is one of the most usual things that you will do in the beginning. This is done by hand (taking coal from a mining block into your infinite inventory space, then staying at the base until it has enough power).\n\nI imagine that a larger operation would take a lot of time. I sporadically play games with or without liking them, so I would usually not recommend this game because "bitterness". But I got into it a bit more by watching someone making a let's play on it. For example, the tutorial in the beginning was added with the latest patch. Before that, I had to watch the let's play in order to know what to do. Mostly, games like minecraft gain introduction level experience by being simple. As complexity adds to the time that you spend fumbling around, these "cellular automata" games almost require an intro course.\n\nI have no idea how to get the complexity that the game promotes by its videos. As usual, the actual gameplay is similar to any minecraft-like game. As usual, there is some difficulty getting to the point where you feel you've achieved something. Things like putting coal in the main hub will predate the point where you've found your first source of copper.\n\nTips:\nX <--- changes to block breaker\nM <--- changes to block scanner/pinger\nL  <--- turns on lights (drains energy)\nThe scanner is necessary to find the first piece of copper deep below ground.\n\nRight now, candles are extremely cheap (infinite power!) and craves coal which you get cheap in the beginning (most of the times)\nC <--- open crafting menu, where you can craft candles on the go","August 15, 2015","true","3.5"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","7"

Sure it has some bugs and glitches but it is barely done! I want to go over the glitches and bugs before I get to the best parts first just in case someone wants to find out what the issues may be in the game.\n\nThe glitches are quite bad sometimes and can seriously affect the gameplay, the glitches come at random moments, usually when you least expect it. We have the problem with not being in control any more, this happens a lot, it causes your player to just fly up into the sky when you press space bar, this can also make it impossible to float back down and usually I just turn the game off after that. We also have the copy and paste option, sometimes it leaves blue and green lights stuck on your walls, sometimes the wall has holes in it where the copy and paste didn't work properly. You've even got a glitch that makes you walk around when you don't want to and you have to just move to a block and wait until the player stops moving, then slowly tap on the 'W' key to make sure he/she doesn't do it again. There is also even on fastest graphics mode it can have a huge drop in frame rates quite rapidly. Don't let this scare you from buying this game.\n\nI think this game is a must have due to its great potential, there aren't a lot of blocks but they are still developing the game and once it is done I am hoping it will have a larger collection of different blocks and materials. It's also a really big world and plenty of worlds for you to make, the copy and paste functions is pure genius and will definantly help to build huge structures! The little robot that follows you is helpful to show what block you currently have and for some reason it looks kind of cute. I'm very serious when I say this game has huge potential! I hope that more people buy this game so they can get more money to develop it better and faster! If you're looking for a game of fun and adventure then this game is for you! If you don't mind the bugs and just get on with it then this is extremely fun, this is my own opinion though so don't take it all to heart. But if anyone wants to join me when they have finished constructing the multiplayer then please feel free to add me. I hope this game gets the recognition it deserves! I remember first playing it on the xbox and it was a really good experience, I felt like I was playing something so different to games like MineCraft and it was a new adventure for me and that is why this game brings back that good feeling of change in the sandbox gaming category.","March 8, 2014","true","8.0"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","6"

But I've a simple rule: Games that are incomplete and not marked early access get the thumbs down.\n\nThere are many resources with descriptions like "not implemented yet" or "has no use yet, but will soon." There are big mechanics of the game (losing a base assault for example) which don't do anything. The game is quite playable and enjoyable, but it's not even in beta yet.\n\nAlot of people were complaining about this game, and honestly I think it was because they didn't understand the mechanics. I remember one guy complaining that generators don't work underground so you can't go very deep... i guess he didn't see all the power transmission devices? But then, blocky games with "craft" in the title are clearly targetting the minecraft audience, and I think this game requires a bit more maturity to understand.\n\nThe game really is pretty good, although a bit rough around the edges. I think the game could use a rebalance to make resource management less cumbersome. Specifically, late game components (mk III lasers for example) take quite a few resources to build. But hey, it's an automation game so that's perfectly reasonable, you just need to build more mines. The problem is that if you build enough mines to keep those your factory making those at a reasonable pace, the storage of resources becomes a nightmare.\n\nIn my situation, I've got two or three machines making late game components, and my storage facility (which is really big btw) is either completely empty, or overflowing to the point where my transit lines jam up. I'm constantly running up and down my mine to turning drills on and off so that my storage won't overflow, becase honestly (and here's the important part) it's easier to turn them on and off then to make a storage facility large enough to support the flow.\n\nI often see the developer on the forums asking things like "what would you like to see?" I'd like to see cheaper storage and transport in the early game (so you can ramp up faster without all the waiting for tin bars), and higher tier transport and storage in the late game. Just something as simple as a "super hopper" that's expensive but holds 1000 resources would go a long way. A faster transport system then the tubes would be nice too (or maybe mk 4 lasers and more powerful matter-movers). Just something along those lines.\n\nAnyway, that's my take on it. I love the factory games, and this is the best 3D one I've found, although it still has a long way to go. To those who like the automation aspects of this game, do make a point of looking at Factorio though, because it is the best IMHO.","April 13","false","330.3"," 22 of 37 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","22","37","0","5"

Taking advantage of the power of a modern PC with several times more RAM and processing power compared to that of the aging console, FC:E offers a more expansive world than ever before.\n\nThe game builds upon its success from the console version by offering the best creative tools available in any vox game including:\nSuperbuild - An interface to quickly build geometric structures of thousands of blocks to save time for the detail work\nPaint gun - Paint select blocks using nearly any color you could dream\nDetail blocks - the micro blocks of the XBLIG version have returned with even more flexibility.  Choose from 2x2 - 8x8 blocks in your detail block design to add a finer touch to your world.  The PC version allows a nearly inexhaustible collection so you'll have plenty of options to add more detail to your world.\nCopy and paste - Take a unique design and reproduce it to fill in your world with color or simplify a large project by reducing it to a set of duplicable pieces by copying and pasting elements of your world.\nBuild2me - Excellent for covering roofs, building bridges, or filling in gaps build2me allows you to place an entire line of blocks from your target all the way to your current location.\nHigh graphical fidelity  - Incredible texture resolution, whole array of shaders, and a lighting engine that must be seen to be believed makes an incredible project look that much better.\n\nAll of these provide the player with the tools necessary to build beautiful constructions of a scale that until now has been unimaginable in a vox game.  In this regard it is a huge step forward from the console version.  As of the time of writing this review the primary missing feature from the creative toolbox is animating the detail blocks.  This feature has yet to return but remains on the roadmap so expect it to appear before the full release.  I highly recommend checking out some of the Top rated screenshots to see some of the incredible things players have built already using the engine.\n\nOne of the most desired elements that I had waited on with the console version was the development of a survival oriented game to make the most of the engine.  That time has finally come as the survival mode has seen its public debut and with only a few weeks of development time it already shows promise for an entertaining experience that will last many, many hours.  The player is dropped into a world where the environment itself is hostile.\n\nThe early game has the player battling the cold by sustaining a supply of energy to power his high tech hazard suit to prevent freezing to death by hypothermia.  The suit also appears to be designed for heat, radiation, low oxygen levels, and toxic environments so expect to see a variety of hazards to face from the world itself.  As of the time of writing the cold is the only threat.  Although the suit can be heated up by standing on a torch there is no danger from heat yet.  It will attempt to consume energy to keep you cool however.\n\nThe gameplay centers around the idea of your suit energy being your life and that venturing far from your main energy network is a great risk.  You'll spend much of your time developing a network of power distribution to your mining network which is driven by machines called extractors which collect ore from resource nodes albeit at a slow pace.  This process is slower than the player's own mining ability however it is more efficient and automated as long as you sustain the machines with energy.  Later on you gain the ability to make batteries to store power and provide it to your machines, lasers which are used to move power between batteries, a generator for burning coal to produce power, hoppers to collect the resources from the extractors, and robots to move items among the hoppers.  The end result is the complete automation of your mining operations and the ability to generate and move energy around your base of operations to keep everything alive and moving including yourself!\n\nA few other relevant bits about the mode: torches can be placed as a source of light and heat.  They serve as little beacons of safety in the harsh world.  The player is provided with a grappling hook to quickly climb from the depths as the world goes down many light years.  Surival mode currently only utilizes the first several hundred blocks down but will eventually stretch to several thousand meters underground.  The player has a handy ore/cave sensor which consumes a quarter of your suit energy but provides an indicator of the closest ore/cave from the player.  This removes some of the tedium associated with finding resources and just getting about underground.\n\nAll of this is only after about a month of development.  There is already a list of planned features to expand upon the mode including suit upgrades such as increased energy storage, greater insulation from the cold, upgrades to the ore sensor to identify specific ore types, and more.  The first mob was added to the game which is a real treat.  The details of which I won't provide here as they are more fun to discover on your own. :)  He isn't much of a threat yet but I'm sure that will change as the tools necessary to combat him are added.  In the current state it takes several hours to proceed through the current tech tree and with additional features promising to fill out the game the survival mode is shaping up to be an incredibly entertaining experience that will be even more fun with friends given the natural scale of the game.\n\nIt is now I should probably place a reminder here of the normal warnings of early access games.  This is an early access title so it isn't complete yet.  Among the features still missing that is probably most desirable is multiplayer.  It is on the roadmap and even in development right now.  The devs have the game roadmap[www.fortresscraft.com] including multiplayer progress on their website where you can keep track of progress if you don't wish to buy in immediately.  As mentioned above the animations are not available for detail blocks and survival mode is only a month into development.  Other areas that still need work include the menus where many options are still unavailable and do not use a mouse interface yet.\n\nIn the end I guess the question that matters most is: Is it worth it?  If you enjoyed the creative experience offered by the XBLIG version or are looking for a more powerful block builder than you can get with other PC titles then FC:E is already a must buy.  If the survival experience is more what you are after then the answer isn't as clear.  Although the game is progressing very quickly it is still far from complete and there are many features required to fill out the experience.  There is also a lot of bug fixing and optimization needed as so much is being thrown into the game so quickly.  If you absolutely must have the end result then it is worth buying now at the introductory rate which is said to be 40% of the final price and will increase with each major milestone.  If you still are unsure then be sure to check out the forums regularly as new patches are released multiple times a week with fixes and new content.  At the rate the game is currently moving it will be making a big name for itself in voxel gaming this year.","January 13, 2014","true","691.7"," 46 of 83 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","46","83","0","3"

Plain and simple. It's like someone played MineCraft and thought, "Well, this is pretty fun. What else can it do?" So they dug through mods and found Technic. Then they played that for a bit and thought, "This, too, is pretty fun. But it wasn't really made for this...I bet I could make something like this, but better." And so they did.\n\nStarting out can be rough, depending on your world. I tried a couple before I found one I was happy with. It will take time.The game is heavily based around automation, so you can continue to dig deeper and find new things, then automate those new things to get it all back to your base. At first, you will have to babysit things. You simply don't have the resources to get things rolling on their own for the first hour, maybe two. Watch a couple of videos on it. You'll see how others do things, you'll get a good understanding of the basics, and you'll have some ideas as to how to set your own system up. It takes a lot of time to really get a lot going on, but if building up to that isn't your cup of tea, then I might advise a different game type. There are several more mechanics at play here than in MineCraft, and pretty much any other game in this vein. It takes a lot of the concepts explored in Space Engineers, removes space, and instead focuses on mining materials and setting them up to work for you.\n\nNever played anything else quite like it. As of this writing, the devs have moved to a new engine and made several quality of life improvements. There are more updates coming, and the community that I've interacted with is outstanding. This is a prime example of an early access game taking full advantage of what gamers can bring to a development cycle.","March 8","true","130.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

FE does'nt deserve the Mixed rating, is so much better than that. Sure, it's still rough around the edges and has still many (non game-breaking) little bugs, but the developer is very active and patching and updating the game constantly so that you can solve little problems in as short as a few days span.\n\nNow about the game:\n\n- Minecraft inspired (blocky world and such)\n- Story driven: you crash on a planet with your ship and only have some basic stuff to survive and your final goal is to find a way to go back out there where you came from\n- Creative mode too (with much more stuff than survival mode)\n- Most of the game is about setting up a mining operation and get the necessary resources/ores to finally build the stuff you need to leave the planet (game end)\n- Mobs / Tower defence mode has been introduced: so while building/exploring the alien planet you also need to fight and/or setup defences depending on how much you get noticed by the local aliens\n- There are "Hive Minds"! O_o\n- If you like crafting and building automated stuff this is the game for you!\n- This is mainly a single player game IMO but they put in a multiplayer mode too (I don't use it) which is a bit awkward to setup, but they're still improving it\n\nSo basically my tip is to go buy it!\nIf you're not convinced by now then just wait for the next sale and grab it, IMO you won't regret it.\n\n","August 26, 2015","true","79.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The developer is very active and actually reads and responds in the forums which is a big plus to me.  There are updates about every 2~3 weeks now that it has been released, which I am ok with (I am refering to the Patch # content, which are rather large updates).\n\nA lot of people have compared it to minecraft but main difference is that there is no weapon or armor upgrade for your character.  This is mainly because this is more of a tower defense type game, so if you are looking for a shooter this won't be it.\n\nMy only gripe with the game is that you cannot move your starting Central Power Hub (CPH) which basically forces you to build at your start point since that is what you have to protect.  It would be nice if you could relocate your base.","April 19","true","438.5"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

There were probably three or four minutes in the entire day of total playtime that I actually enjoyed myself. But the more I invested myself in the game, the more I felt determined to get something out of it, and the more time I shoved into it. I spent almost all of yesterday (5/16/2016) playing, desperately trying to make progress.\nThere are several problems with making progress.\nFirst off, this is not a single player game. It may have the ability to be played single player, but it's not single player. There just isn't enough progress for it to be single player. In order to make a reasonable amount of progress on my own, I edited files in order to vastly speed up my gameplay. Somehow, that made it go from very boring to incredibly boring.\nNothing happens quickly on your own. Even with the game settings set all the way to the quickest, easiest, fastest settings. You need 32 bars of something to build x. Well, settle in, that'll take a while unless you've already got five or six systems running. And it's not like setting those up is quick. Or cheap.\nAnd don't get me started on how long it takes to research pretty much anything once you've got the laboratory. The projects take ages to complete, and enough resources that after a day of highly sped-up gameplay, I was barely able to make some of it.\nBut that's not the worst part about this game.\nThis game is NOT finished. This game was early-access, and still should be! It's nowhere near complete. I find bugs everywhere I go. I come back to my base and all my turrets are facing firmly in one direction, a giant laser firing out. The ship I crashed in is on fire (it's only been two months in-game since I landed, I'm sure that's normal). The CPH is projecting some kind of field that is making it awfully hard to see. Various other things are making all sorts of very bright frames of animation that make it practically impossible for me to see what the hell is happening in my base.\nMy laser turrets are still working fine. It's just impossible to tell that.\nI place another laser turret on top of another block I've placed, and all the bugs disappear in an instant.\nBefore I do that, the ship hurts me if I get too close.\nNow? No worries, I can walk straight through it.\nI assure you, this is one of many, many bugs that I've encountered. The list got so long I didn't bother remembering them.\nThen, there's the simple fact that some things are either badly implemented, have missing icons, mismatched icons, or maybe their help file doesn't exist.\nMake some iron pipe if you can. Or find something that requires iron pipe and look at the picture. As of this moment, the picture is a big red x and the words "NO ICON". Go grab some cave flora from the cold or toxic caverns. One of each. Then, place them. Place them against a wall, and turn them twice, so they're actually right-side-up. Don't ask why. Now, compare the flora you just placed to the icon. They're mismatched. A is B, B is A, C is D, etc.\nHow about auto-excavators? Place one on a wall, and you'll probably think it can dig a 3x3 hole horizontally. Maybe if you place it on the ceiling, it can dig down, instead of up! Why would you think that? Because the column of light indicating where it can dig shows that!\nYou'd be wrong. Once you power it up, no matter where you're trying to 'aim' it, it shoots up.\nThe list goes on. There are things that are just plain problematic. Things that are useless. Things that make no sense. Things that are poorly implemented, buggy, unfinished, and more. It is, quite frankly, awful, and if you look at the pictures saying "Oh, I want that!", then either join a server with a dozen other players or be prepared to keep playing for WEEKS (Actual time played, not number of days you played for a little while) in order to get there.","May 17","false","24.4"," 21 of 36 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","21","36","0","8"

Want it to go faster? Simply increase whatever factor is limiting your progress, be it power, materials, or machine throughput.\n\nJust as you're getting the hang of all this, you'll come across the Threat Analyser and probably end up building one out of curiosity. This will warn you of incoming attacks and keep you informed as to how much attention your base is drawing from the native life forms. Very useful in determining when you really need to change your focus to building defences against said life forms, but again on the easier settings the only penalty for failure is that it temporarily stops your source of comepletely free power.\n\nI've restarted this game several times now, because after developing my base setup a certain way I get further then come up with a better way to do things, which would almost certainly be easier if I did it from the very beginning. The fact that this game can still cause such epiphanies is to me a mark of a very well thought out game indeed.  That said, I could just tear it all apart with no penalty, and rebuild, but I prefer a clean slate.\n\nThe game is undergoiong continual development on a daily basis. This does not mean that the game is unfinished, having watched the developer's daily live streams of the work being done I can say that it if the game had stayed in Early Access until he ran out of ideas and had implemented all the current thoughts he has for late-game content, it would still be Early Access ten years from now, and the game already far surpasses many titles that I've seen launched from EA.\n\nIt's true that the developer is planning explansion packs as a way to introduce large chunks of extra content to the game, and a lot of people have slammed this decision, despite the fact that he has clearly said that if he can afford to do so, these will be free expansion packs rather than paid.  Given how many games are released in an almost episodic fashion these days, this is by no means unreasonable, especially given the exceptional value for money the FCE represents. How many games can give hundreds of hours of enjoyment for £10?\n\nAt this price give it a try, it's a steal and if you enjoy any kind of tower defence, voxel building, crafting, gathering or logistics/assembly line games you should have a blast.\n\nTl/dr: A great game that keeps getting better.","April 18","true","408.5"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

Its a port of a game that's been on consoles for some time now, and is still a work in progess so things are going to be pretty rough. Despite its shortcomings this game has a lot of potential to be serious competition for Minecraft, which up until now has had no real competition on the PC side.\n\nThere are things that need to be fixed. You still get the Creative Mode item list in Survival Mode, making it hard to determine which blocks you have available, and you cannot use the mouse in your inventory screen. In fact, you can't use the mouse in any of the interfaces for the game except for the ESC button menu while in-game. This needs to be addressed, especially for this PC port of the game.\n\nAs I said, this game has massive potential, so while its not quite ready yet if you buy the game now you're helping the developers out so they can finish it that much faster. So, while its very rough as an alpha this is one worth investing in.","January 10, 2014","true","2.6"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

It's like a cross between Factorio and Minecraft like others have said, a couple key features that really stand out though. First is the fact I'm pretty sure there's no limit to how deep you can dig. Gameplay zones right now go as deep as what, 1000 blocks or something? A minecraft map is 128 blocks from the tip top of the ceiling to the very bottom of bedrock, with only around 60-80 of those being actual land blocks and not empty space. In Fortresscraft, you keep digging down to progress further in the game, and right now I think the last zone is around 1000 blocks or so with plans to develop layers even deeper than that.\n\nSecond is the uh, the holoview or whatever, where you hit a button and you can see all your constructions through walls. So when you're digging around and trying to get all your power lines to match up underground, you don't have to count blocks. You just hit a button and bam, everything is visible. It's truly amazing. Also yes, there's elevators.\n\nIf you have any interest in this kind of thing whatsoever, give this man your money. Even in its current state you'll have a blast messing around with stuff, and future plans to develop it into a full PVP base-versus-base type game have already been stated, so seriously, give this guy your money. If development ever makes it that far, this will be one of the greatest games ever made. It's already extremely well optimized and well put together as-is.

If you play the other voxel based survival game you should do yourself a favor and try out this one, or check out one of the several streamers on Twitch, or YouTube. We are trying to get the word out and dispel some myths about this game.\n\nIf you like Factorio and Voxel Based games you really need to check out this game.","March 4","true","315.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

I enjoy playing something that requires a bit of OCD, creativity and structure with its playstyle.  What can be more fun than building your own defense while mining and exploring i thought to myself!  600+ hours later i still enjoy the game, starting a new world and looking for the ore to upgrade my base.  I enjoy how i can automate the entire production of items and ore.  Place things as far away as i want and transport them to where i need.  I do not really have anything bad to say about this game, specially since many of the complains that i did have are now mute since the developer pays special attention to what the supports of this game wants to see.

Most of the game is based on automation of resources or manufacturing, similar to Factorio. The game play in single player seems to flow through 3 distinct types of gameplay: you start off in a survival game, fighting the elements and trying to just manage; mid-game is filled with automation of all sorts, from power generation and transport, to quarrying, refining materials you obtain, and auto-crafting items; end-game is similar to a tower defense game, fighting hordes of enemies, trying to keep them from destroying your Central Power Hub and resetting the charge on your end-game structure.

Fortresscraft Evolved is a complete remake of the original Fortresscraft in the Unity engine and was released on Steam Dec 10, 2013.\n\nA lot of people will go ahead and compare this game to Minecraft and, while it does share some similarities with my all-time favorite game, it is actually quite different, especially in terms of creative building. There is a survival mode in the game, but when I tried to start a new world with it, I was placed in creative mode. No idea why that happened.\n\nThe creative mechanics in the game are fantastic. There are many features that make building a lot easier than what you'd probably expect from a game like this (try shift+left clicking with a block in hand). I was even able to whip up a quick tree house in about 30 seconds, and this was no ordinary tree house, it was massive. I really love what the devs did to make creative building as painless as possible.\n\nThe game does have some technical issues however, with the game sound being my major complaint. They seemed to lag behind. Oh, and is there supposed to be game music? I heard some at one point, but, other than that, it appears to be nonexistent.\n\nAnyways, the game is fun, if you know what you're doing. The survival mode, however, simply is not as fun as I had expected it to be. Recommended purely for its creative capabilities!","January 30, 2014","true","0.9"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

This fact is worth it's own merit since most games nowadays have beyond ♥♥♥♥♥♥ developers who lack any care for their community. Overall, this game is great as it is and it has for more potential being added every day.\n\nEdit: Some people are commenting about a virus link within the help pages via. a mislink to a youtube video. They are saying the developer doesn't care enough to fix it, etc. Currently the developer has a fix releasing in the next patch releasing in a few days. The reason he can't release a hotfix is he simply doesn't have enough manpower to update four  platforms running different versions easily and release the new patch on time. The developer also adressed this issue and replied to the thread talking about what he's doing. Some people simply can't think and start blaming a developer for "having a horrible attitude", when they see a small issue not being fixed quickly enough (it's been less than a week...). Just keep stuff like that in mind when planning to buy the game. It's worth it if you're into factory, progress oriented gameplay.

Let me first start with my opinion. I love this game. However, I can not recomend it as of yet. I spent 24 hours fo game time as of the time I've written this, and I still don't really have a clue what's going on. It's advertised as a tower defense mincraft clone, but I've never played minecraft, so I'm not really sure if it is. I really like the idea of having to dig to find minerals, the blocks you can remove, the things you can research, but I don't like having to search outside the game or go through a million other steps to get a general idea of what I should be doing.\n\nLet's start off with the 10 second tutorial. It sucks so bad, after the first time I booted the game up and watched the unskippable (in this day and age, really?!) opening scene, I had no real idea of what to do or how. Sure, there is a help menu that gradually fills up with more information as you need it, but isn't the point of the tutorial to teach you what you need to know? There's no real explination of day or night, no real explination of what you can craft, and nothing tells you what you're research unlocks until you've already researched it.\n\nNow the community is great, and all the answers can be found someplace, but to me, that takes time away from the game. It's advertised as a tower defense, but it's more like a base defense, eventually. I'm not going to get into the nitty gritty, but this game needs a ton of polish before I can actually recommend it to anyone. The learning curve is HUGE in this game, and I'm still finding things out the more I play, but if that's your thing, feel free.\n\nUpdate: With the new patch that came out, I truly do love this game more. I still can't recommend it though until it does some serious polishing. No game ever should keep basic things away from the player, and that level of transparency is exactly what this games lacks. It's also unbelievably slow. I've been playing for days and there are still things that are hidden from me and I have no idea what they do until I actually spend the 5-6 hours unlocking it. As a player, it's truly the only reason I keep this game thumbs down.","March 27","false","86.8"," 14 of 24 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","14","24","0","3"

It has all of the creative potential of minecraft, but automation removes all the boring negatives like manually mining and smelting and even building block by block. Instead of wasting time on that boring nonsense, FortressCraft Evolved allows you to focus on advancing your tech, building your base, and defeating your enemies!\n\nThere are tons of awesome aspects of the tech aspect of this game, with my favorite being the ability to build blocks from a specified block to your location using control-click. AFAIK, minecraft doesn't let you do this. At least, it didn't back in the day when I played it. Also, this game has a grappling hook. Let me repeat that for you. THIS GAME HAS A GRAPPLING HOOK. AND YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO UNLOCK IT. There are multiple power source types for your machine, and your enemies (bees native to the world you're stranded on) provide you with valuable building materials. There's a lot of variety in every aspect of the game: building, smelting, mining, etc.\n\nAlso, this game is gorgeous for what it is. I'm running it on an intel g3258 that I haven't gotten around to overclocking yet and an AMD r9 270 and it still runs decently on high-ish settings. And it works on linux! :D\n\nThere are a lot of complaints from earlier in the game's development about the creator abandoning the project. He came back, and has been consistently releasing updates since the beginning of the year. He's a bit snarky, but he's really fun to interact with, and he actually listens to player feedback.\n\nBasically, this game is everything an indy game should be. Fun, inventive, varied, cheap, and available across all platforms. What are you waiting for??

The concept of the game is awesome, but gameplay is a bit confusing. Tooltips would be great on graphics options and maybe a bit more perfomance optimization because I seem to get a huge amount of lag, whether I'm recording or not, and I've turned all graphics settings way down. The lag is a lot less, but still too much with all graphics settings set so low. That being said, the game is in early access, and there's always going to be issues with early access. The future of this game could bring a lot of positives, and I am hopeful for this!

You'll certainly feel the grind early on, as you work to gather resources. Getting to know the controls is a must; mining ores using only the automatic things is slow, so make sure to read through the controls to get to know all the stuff you can do to save time (Superdig is invaluable). I never really got to any of the advanced machinery, as the grind just got a tad boring. Also, the creative mode's fun, I guess. All the block textures are highly situational, which is my main gripe with the game. Other than that, it's a fine game.\n\nI'd recommend this game to anybody with some time to burn (this game is great for passing time; one moment it'll be 8PM and the next it's 2AM) and a bit of money to spare. It's nothing outstanding, but it is certainly the sort of game you can use as a filler between games.\n\nEDIT: After some of the more recent updates, I've found that the game can be a fair bit more fun. I found the combat (while flawed in some areas, like the lack of a crosshair and the charged shot doing nothing more than the regular shot) to be rather fun.\n\nAlso, after messing around in creative (I was exclusively playing survival to this point) I found that the detail blocks have been MASSIVELY improved since Chapter 1. The ability to have the block textures as either scaled or not is a brilliant addition, because that was one of my main issues with the original. The detail blocks can actually be used for seamless detailing, which is brilliant.\n\nIt certainly is an improvement on Chapter 1 in near enough every way, and (in some ways) is better than Minecraft for building larger creations. With the addition of texture pack support, I should hopefully be able to customise the game to the way I would like, which is a brilliant feature.\n\nOverall, I'm changing my rating from "time waster" to "generally good game". It's a good game in pretty much all aspects (if a little buggy at times. I'm looking at you, spiderbot on hills. But that's just hilarious) and great in others.","September 18, 2015","true","23.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","2"

This will be complicated.\n\nFirst off, full disclosure: I recieved this game from the Dev after expressing my doubts and disbelief on the forums. The topic can be found here: http://steamcommunity.com/app/254200/discussions/0/528398719792747294/\n\nAnd on to the review itself...\n\nFortresscraft is something I have difficulty playing objectively. I snagged the original back when I was a gamer on the Xbox 360 before switching to PC, and I was not impressed. It was a 'Minecraft clone', in the sense that it was blocky and HD and there was not much value in it other than blowing up the water and watching the broken physics for it cause it to spread across the entire world, but only after you had reloaded the level.\n\nUpon seeing this title on Steam, I was, understandably, not impressed. So, after downloading the Dev-given game and booting it up, I found a few things out.\n\nFirst, the game has some derps and issues. The tutorial can be confusing and derped at times, leaving you with little idea of what to do. I have heard there's a wiki up at this point, but there was not one when I started.\n\nYou enter with little idea of how to do things, which can honestly be great. I've played Dwarf Fortress with less. Still, however, it's not a great introduction.\n\nFurther on, I can see hints that this is something that I might enjoy and thrive in if I could only get it, for lack of a better word. It's not that the game is complex, it's that I just can't figure out where to go, after a bit. So many things that would really improve things for me are either missing, or I am not finding them.\n\nI know, and I can see, that this is really a good game, especially where it came from. I did have a bit of fun, and the mechanics are mostly solid, but I just couldn't get very far.\n\nOverall, the reason this is 'recommended' is because, in the end, I know it's a good game. It just isn't my type of game. I'll stick with my complex RTS addiction for my fix.\n\nIn numbers: 6/10. Above average, at least. Steam really needs a 'mixed' review setting.","March 7","true","3.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

This game is interesting and has some fun ideas. If you liked the old Tekkit Minecraft mod then you will like this game as well. The game involves finding resources, automating those resources to bring it back to base, and setting up defenses against a world that doesn't like you. A very fun game but, like minecraft, will absorb your time. If you need to keep a GPA up I would probably wait till a break to play the game, otherwise give it a try.","November 11, 2015","true","14.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It's not your standard dig and build. You really need to put thought into how to get ahead.  A lot of exploring to research new ore types.\nPros:\n- Really colourful graphics and textures\n- Environmental effects (AFK in the middle of no where with no heat... you'll die of hypothermia)\n- Huge environment\n- Tons of items to research/build/craft\n\nCons (1 dev? And still alpha)\n- Not very intuitive controls (took awhile to figure out what each button did)\n- Not many creatures to hunt/kill\n\nOverall, I find this game very enjoyable and hope to see the production continue.

The world made of cubes and mining had already been around before minecraft, and moreover its an aesthetic that is not something minecraft owns. If you can't get past the "all cube based games are minecraft copies" then stop reading here, onto the meat.\n\nPros:\n\n1. This is a common one yet still important, the option to play with high or low difficulty in finding ore, the strength of hostiles, and even obtaining the energy you will so dearly need throughout the game. This is important as being able to enjoy the game from both a higher level and casual standpoint is a must.\n\n2. The hostiles, they are exactly what should be in a game like this, instead of only straight forward hit you and the face type ememies you have an enemy that will attach itself to your conveyor belts and such and devour all your ores making its nest ( the hivemind ) larger, and a little stealth cube thing that will drain power from your mining set up underground. Better yet, they still include a straight forward hit you in the face mob, and a little or dropping resource mob to boot for your tin needs.\n\n3. Instead of making you dig out a staircase, one of the most tedious  hardships one usually faces in "cube games", this game offers a high powered grappling hook, you can dig straight down and then grapple back up, this may seem overpowered however it will already take you quite some time to acquire resources and set up your automated mining and power system, if getting back to the surface were to take forever each time this game would be rendered unplayable by those of us who just dont have enough time.\n\n4. The automation that can be achieved in this game is satisfying, when you go from having to run back in forth to your copper mine set up to watching the copper roll in on a conveyor into your hopper then into your smelter, and at the moment you are looking at the 200+ stack of copper, you will feel a level of satisfaction on par with properly heating a plate of pizza rolls and not burning your tongue and throat.\n\nCons:\n\n1. Despite what I said earlier about the hostiles, the game could probably use a bit more in this area, if you know what you are doing they are pretty easy to handle as is, there doesnt need to be too much more of this but some for sure.\n\n2. The learning curve, if you dont watch some videos, you are likely to flounder about having no idea what you are doing, this does hurt the game quite a bit. If you are against checking out some videos to figure things out this might be the deciding factor for you.\n\n3. Being a little to intense with the autmation, if you arent a fan creating (sometimes) complex systems to acquire, smelt, and convert your ore into useful objects then this game just isnt for you.\n\n4. The name, if you have played the old fortresscraft, then you go in expecting something quite different from what you will get, it is misleading and could be the leave a sour impression depending on whether you did your research or not.\n\nConclusion:\n\nI gave an equal number of pros and cons, what comes down to is if you enjoy automation, and thinking, then theres a pretty high chance you will enjoy this game, if not continue on, and if you arent into that, but you still want to give it a go, thats awesome.","January 6","true","9.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

So I'd like to say my expectations were high. I had read FC Evolved was similar to Tekkit modded minecraft and I was getting excited.\nFirstly I dislike space themed anything - and this is definitely space themed - but I've found it to be fine.\n\nMy first 10mins of gameplay I was confused AF. It's fun to learn and work out what you have to do - which could be avoided by watching a gameplay of FC Evolved on YT, but I wanted to throw myself into the deep end. I'm at 20+hrs in, 17hrs of which in this one world, where I like to pretend I know what I'm doing. And I feel I've barely scratched the surface.  Once you figure out a methodology and approach, and are fast acting on it, I think you could have a world up and running a LOT faster than what I've done in this first attempt - and that's one of the selling points, become efficient.\n\nPros/ConsPros:\n+ Loads of gameplay\n+Looks pretty [I run at good, and occasionally stutters - my gfx card runs Farcry 4 at decent settings]\n+I love the mobility [compared to MC]\n+I love the grappling hook mechanic\n+I love ctrl+clicking to build 30blocks in a straight line\n+I love seeing a base grow and become automated\n+I love pressing K to find where I placed that ore extractor, because I totally forgot where I put it\n+Addicting gameplay\n+Always something to do/alter/change/move/collect/kill/mine/ping\n+You can leave it in the background/ALTTab and even on single player, the world continues to simulate - so if you have automated mining set up, you can do other things away from your PC and come back to collect smelted ores.\n\nCons:\n-I wish there was lights - early on. Throwing a bright green torch is ugly and hurts my eyes :')\n-I wish conveyor belts could be placed with ctrl+click, as that would save me time\n-I wish the music was better? A lot of annoying sounds. I find it actually nicer to play with sound off becaues of this.\n- Confusing progression.\n\nOverall, I paid ~$15.00 for it[?], and it has been worth it. I plan to put a lot more hours in.\n\nPS.S.\nI walked upto that giant squid monster and instantly died. My reasoning being I saw an unknown block at it's centre and I wanted to collect it :^).","March 15","true","135.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

Really like this game. I find it hard to remain interested in games after a day of smashing them, but im still playing this one. So that says something pretty big. Also my mrs is starting to hate this game as im on it too much.\n\nPros\n-Exceptionally fast load time. once you double click the games shortcut, you are in world within a 15-20 seconds. great for those of us impatient or busy people. I really really hate bull**** loadtimes. I want to play a game not make a cup of coffee and come back while waiting for the main menu.\n\n-Good game progression.  for once a game that doesnt bog you down waiting for research, construction, or resource gathering/grinding. It has a nice balance of automation to the point where all that stuff can be done while you are off exploring. Ive often been off exploring a cavern and come back only to find that the slowest part of the system is myself and it is easy to get to the point of automation that most things become trivial (Wtf do i do with 5k copper now?)\n\n-enemies and death. you can make the game as hard as you like, and the consequences of death as permanent or trivial as you like in world gen. Which is really nice when you are still learning how to grapple around a massive cavern or falling down a really big hole.\n\n- The world. OMFG it is huge. The underground caverns are enormous, like really really really big and the terrain changes with depth, always serving up something different.\n\n-in game help. it is incredibly intuitive. It could be a little more indepth with some items but still very well thought out and just a blessing.\n\n-holobase function. you can track realtime how your network is functioning and where any bottlenecks are\n\n-good steam community who have most answers for you.\n\n-developer that is active on forums and takes interest in our feedback.\n\ncons\n\n-there is no way to pause the game as yet. you can camp out next to a torch or leave and come back (which is not that big of a deal due to fast load times) but pause would be awesome when you have the mrs trying to talk to you or a baby screaming at you. I understand the dev has said that it is a survival game but it could be a deal breaker for some gamers.\n\n-controls take a while to get used to. now and again im still trying to access hoppers with e.\n\n-the options could be a little more in depth with the sounds and music. took  google to find out how to turn off music (ctrl -m)\n\n-a coordinate system would make digging holes to your mining operations soo much easier.\n\nall in all a great early access game. very well thought out and designed. a clear development roadmap and it gives you what it promises. anyway back to the mrs tasks","January 24","true","32.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Unless you are grossly incompetent, you won't lose the game, and there is no feeling of dread that you are in deep doo doo and might lose.\n\nI do recommend the game and I do find it fun, but after awhile you realize you have reached a point where you have so many resources, you just don't have to worry about nothing and the challenge is all gone.\n\nWhat the game needs is random events of some type that force you to cope with the unpredictable, or some sort of boss creature that attacks once in a while and might destroy parts of your base.","February 28","true","118.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

This game MAY be blocky as minecraft, but the textures are detailed, and pretty, with out them being blocks. They do have blocky hit box, but hitboxes aren't that important ;). So beck to the topic. You can build BIG mining operations, and factories, and what not, on pretty much anything. Because of the worlds size that is 200 LIGHT YEARS (or 1892146155423912000 meters !) long in every direction from spawn, you can build what ever. It's kind of hard and challenging to start up, but when you get a bit automated, you are all good (and challenges are fun, right?).\n\nNow lets talk about mining. You get an ore extractor, that mines ore veins. Each ore vein is different in size. Some can be up to 32 mil. ore!. That is going to last a very long while. But to do that you need to send power down, and then with conveyors, pipes, ore matter movers, up to the surface and smelt it.\n\nGoal in this game (right now) is to kill 4 overminds, with orbital strike. Now there is at least 100h of gameplay. But this is not like factorio (I still love Factorio tho), that you win, and not play anymore. If you win here, you can still do stuff! But if you kill them, nothing will attack you (for now)\n\nNow about updates and performance. Well, updates are often, and also you have different "betas" to play on, like Bleeding Edge. That is game where is new stuff, that will be put into mainline. But this comes at the risk. You can crash, your world can get corrupted, and bugs. Well, that is why its called "Bleeding" edge ;). Preformance is pretty decent. I have 8GB, and this game is in Unity 5, and I use only 40% of memory. FPS are very high, but if you request too much FPS, your world may not load fast.\n\nNow final part, the devs. As far as I know. There is one Developer working on this game, DjArcas. He has few other devs to help out. Also he streams on Twitch like 8h STRAIGHT! He shows all the programming, and how he works the game. Also, because Direwolf20 have played this, more people came in :D. But I don't think that DJ is getting enough $$$, for what is he doing. He indeed deserves more. You know, he needs food, and personal things. Also you know how models of blocks can cost?! Up to 10k$! those are some big bucks. But this means, more people = faster game development.\n\nSo from this review, you can tell that I LOVE this game. This is legit, the nicest comunity, that I ever met. You need help with Game? just post a thread, and people will anwser :). Lots of nice people, and if the thread is something big (sometimes even small), even developers themselves will help you! Actually, they are on 80% of the threads, so that speaks for it self :).\n\nThanks all! Keep it up!\n\n\n","March 11","true","118.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Most addicted I’ve gotten to a game in a long time. Buy it!","January 5","true","98.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The world made of cubes and mining had already been around before minecraft, and moreover its an aesthetic that is not something minecraft owns. If you can't get past the "all cube based games are minecraft copies" then stop reading here, onto the meat.\n\nPros:\n\n1. This is a common one yet still important, the option to play with high or low difficulty in finding ore, the strength of hostiles, and even obtaining the energy you will so dearly need throughout the game. This is important as being able to enjoy the game from both a higher level and casual standpoint is a must.\n\n2. The hostiles, they are exactly what should be in a game like this, instead of only straight forward hit you and the face type ememies you have an enemy that will attach itself to your conveyor belts and such and devour all your ores making its nest ( the hivemind ) larger, and a little stealth cube thing that will drain power from your mining set up underground. Better yet, they still include a straight forward hit you in the face mob, and a little or dropping resource mob to boot for your tin needs.\n\n3. Instead of making you dig out a staircase, one of the most tedious  hardships one usually faces in "cube games", this game offers a high powered grappling hook, you can dig straight down and then grapple back up, this may seem overpowered however it will already take you quite some time to acquire resources and set up your automated mining and power system, if getting back to the surface were to take forever each time this game would be rendered unplayable by those of us who just dont have enough time.\n\n4. The automation that can be achieved in this game is satisfying, when you go from having to run back in forth to your copper mine set up to watching the copper roll in on a conveyor into your hopper then into your smelter, and at the moment you are looking at the 200+ stack of copper, you will feel a level of satisfaction on par with properly heating a plate of pizza rolls and not burning your tongue and throat.\n\nCons:\n\n1. Despite what I said earlier about the hostiles, the game could probably use a bit more in this area, if you know what you are doing they are pretty easy to handle as is, there doesnt need to be too much more of this but some for sure.\n\n2. The learning curve, if you dont watch some videos, you are likely to flounder about having no idea what you are doing, this does hurt the game quite a bit. If you are against checking out some videos to figure things out this might be the deciding factor for you.\n\n3. Being a little to intense with the autmation, if you arent a fan creating (sometimes) complex systems to acquire, smelt, and convert your ore into useful objects then this game just isnt for you.\n\n4. The name, if you have played the old fortresscraft, then you go in expecting something quite different from what you will get, it is misleading and could be the leave a sour impression depending on whether you did your research or not.\n\nConclusion:\n\nI gave an equal number of pros and cons, what comes down to is if you enjoy automation, and thinking, then theres a pretty high chance you will enjoy this game, if not continue on, and if you arent into that, but you still want to give it a go, thats awesome.","January 6","true","9.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

If you like minecraft but sucked at building and making things look nice, or like playing with redstone, then you'll love this game without a doubt. It also makes buidling a breeze with the ability to place an entire row of blocks in a single click. I don't usually go out and buy games, espically if I've never head of it. But after watching video's of it for a bit I really became interested. And man it's the best game under $15 i've ever bought. You won't find much of multiplayer quite yet (it's still somewhat of a wip) but there is so much to do even so. The future of this game will only get better.\n\nEven if it's current state was it's final state, I wouldn't feel like I wasted my money.

I'm in the beta (which is a step higher) and even there you get a lot of nice updates still. The core version won't tend to see updates often, so i recommend opting into beta.\n\nOnto the review!\n\nThere is so much potential for this game. If you like minecraft but sucked at building and making things look nice, or like playing with redstone, then you'll love this game without a doubt. It also makes buidling a breeze with the ability to place an entire row of blocks in a single click. I don't usually go out and buy games, espically if I've never head of it. But after watching video's of it for a bit I really became interested. And man it's the best game under $15 i've ever bought. You won't find much of multiplayer quite yet (it's still somewhat of a wip) but there is so much to do even so. The future of this game will only get better.\n\nEven if it's current state was it's final state, I wouldn't feel like I wasted my money. So come join, support this game, tell your friends and your free time will never be used for anything else again.","February 19","true","146.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I decided to test this and built a structure going from the surface (Y:0) and built all the way up to 3,254...  I could have kept going, but let's be honest, that would have been pointless.  So then I decided to find the floor of the world, and dug down to 9,153...  And I could have kept going.  Minecraft's 256 block height limit is put to absolute shame, as this game shows its beefy and well-constructed voxel engine.  I'll admit, I'm going to use Minecraft as my comparison here, because Minecraft is the definitive voxel game to compare to.\n\nThe game's view distance is comparable to that of Minecraft's 15 chunk view distance, which means you can see a lot.  In Minecraft there's a survival situation which revolves around food.  Currently in FortressCraft Evolved the survival situation revolves around body heat.  You're in a constant struggle to keep yourself cool enough and warm enough at the same time.  Standing in fire makes your body overheat, draining your power cells, and will kill you of heat exhaustion.  Staying underground or out in the elements at night can cause you to begin to freeze, and you can die of hypothermia as well.\n\nThe game is looking good already in its pre-alpha state, and I absolutely can't wait for the full release.  Normally I'd say "don't buy this early access unless you're ready to deal with bugs," but in this case, the sooner you get it, the less you'll end up paying in the end.  So it's at your discretion, buy now and save, or buy later for peace of mind.\n\nSome of the features work, some of them don't, but you'll still find plenty to do in this game.  Better pack yourself a lunch, because you're going to be playing this for long hours.","October 17, 2014","true","4.7"," 40 of 77 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","40","77","0","2"

You remove or shuffle the blocks that make this world and make a place for you.  Survival leaves you on an unexplored world after your ship crashes fighting aginst the cold  and much more.

If you want to compare this to Minecraft, you can because I did. In comparison, to me, it still lacks "Creativity" in survival which so many people in minecraft love to do, grind away at a descent amount of time for resources and building something either amazing or practical to how they are playing but stop right there, you can't exactly do that yet in Fortresscraft.\n\nFortresscraft is about Industrialization, automating the mining and also adding a unique twist with AI enemies. Sure you can construct an artistic factory but thats about it. Early on, its quite a grind to get things moving and automated which is a turn off to quite a lot of players, the farther away the resources, the more the grind. Once you grind away those hours and get a descent flow of resources going to your base, things start to get pretty easy but its the grind it takes to get there. Intricate base layout and resource organization gets people involved.\n\nMy recommendation, its still a unique twist and its not a bad title to have in your library to pick up and play when you are bored with Minecraft.\n\nOld Review.... outdated... below.\n\n\nThe game has potential. The core game idea seperates this game from other games in the genre, if you think this is a Minecraft spin off, its not. The idea behind automating everything is very cool, you build infrastructure and let the machines do the work.\n\nPROS\n\n-New gameplay concept with the looks of minecraft but completely different spin and gameplay.\n-Machinary concept keeps you intrigued and it adds a new strategy to the game in building your base and infrastructure.\n-Descent graphics\n-Dev Support - Actively engages community in the forums (Huge plus for me).\n-Stable - No issues at all playing survival, some cosmetic bugs but nothing that stops you from enjoying the game in the current state it is in.\n\nCONS\n\n-Content seems limited\n-Need a tutorial world for the new guys\n-Pretty time consuming... definitely watch some videos before jumping into the world\n-Everything is focused around the machinery part of the game, so theres not too much in customization that I saw while playing survival... creativity content in survival.... not sure if the game will focus on it but would package the game up a lot better.\n-It feels very repeatative in survival at the moment, I would suggest modding the game to help curve this a bit, if you don't know how to, just ask before getting upset with it. Using all the features to the fullest makes this game pretty awesome.","January 11, 2015","true","160.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Still very much "in development" even though it's missing the EA tag...\n\nUpdated Dec 2015\n\nWhile this game is no longer in Early Access, some of it still feels very much "beta".  This is not a bad thing, at least not in this instance.  For example, the graphics settings are very basic.  You'll be forced to live with Jar Jar Abrams due to any light source emitting massive amounts of bloom.  So your options are going to be darkness, one light, or blinding nova of brightness.\n\n"So what?" That's pretty much what I mean by still feeling "beta".  Don't like music?  Better also not like other sounds, it's all one slider: Volume.  Some other GUI issues pop up, like no exit to menu.  You must always head to your desktop, and since the game has stringent survival mechanics and no pause...well it's either full exit or no bathing.\n\n"Just GUI issues?" So far, that's about it.  I mean there is a lack of content (trees that grow, plants that grow, a sun/moon/sky/weather) But these, to me, are fluff.  The base game is there, the mechanics are sound.  It just needs the finishing polish to make it a full game.\n\n"Lack of Documentation" There is still a big issue with information in game.  You need to craft item "Thing" which is made up of items "A" "B" "C" and "D".  Item "A" is made up of "B","C", and "E".  Item "B" is made up of "E".  Item "C" is made up of "F".  And item "D" is made up of "E","F" and "G".  Confused?  The help menu helps, but it's just a start.  (Back to feeling beta...)\n\nLastly, I feel the AI is just not there.  I see some slugs, and other minor mobs.  But nothing that screams "life".  The planet (always snow, nothing else...) you land on is a dead husk, with aimless monsters.  Again, the mechanics are there they just seem under utilized.\n\nNo modding that I can find, can't even change textures.  Might need to use a fancy program to edit files though.\n\nAnyway, do I recommend the game?  It's hard to say, I really enjoy playing it.  Would enjoy it more if modding was there, or at least information as to how to mod.

Enemies were not implemented yet, instructions are far from appropriate… If you bear this in mind, you are ford of creative mode and in survival you tolerate many aspects missing, you can like it. Otherwise give it another year and return then for better game.\n\nDetailed Section\nCreative mode\n\nI tested only few minutes to get achievements, it seemed to work, but i tis not my cup of tea so for feedback on that check other reviews.\n\nSurvival mode\n\nThis was the part I bought the game for and put full day of play in. The name „Fortresscraft“ evoked in me that I will face enemies and build fortress to repel them… well, no. Enemies are not implemented yet and so this part of game does not exist.\n\nThe survival in current game is about energy - how you prevent to lose it and how you handle when you on zero not to freeze/burn/die from falling damage, nothing more and nothing less. So far I play my first play and have not died once because I am cautious (although I twice did mistake nearly costing me life).\n\nInformation / Tutorial\n\nOn start you have few pages to read – and frankly, who wants to read so much text? Afterwards, although there is nice feature of research of everything, it is not used to serve information in nice small relevant packets. What a shame.\nI fear that this part was heavily underestimated with regards of „early access“ – and by that discouraging many new players not able to absorb the game system.\n\nMovement\n\nGame gives player very powerful tool – grappling hook. It seems to me that easiness of movement around is dependent on mastery of this helpful companion. It allows quick ascending, but also horizontal movement.\nAnd for moving down there is falling… 20 blocks of fall being ok was something I had trouble with in the beginning, but then I got used to it and started to make my digging to use this as advantage.\nSummary: if you will make ways minecraft way, you will spend a lot of time makong stairs where they are not needed and simple shaft-mining is more rewarding.\n\nResources / Automation\n\nGame has two types of resources – blocks and ores- Blocks are rapidly mined by hand. There are many types of blocks but sadly with nearly no difference – why is there hewn stone, stone and deep stone is quite a question for me (it is not even to mark depth, as for that you have your HUD. And why only hewn stone can be used as item for crafting is again very questionable.\n\nOres are mined through mining devices – and are probably intended for core concept of automation (so you build way to provide them with fuel or raw energy and to bring what they dug back). But that is simply not working for me and is demotivating by fact that the ore vein is depletable so what I build will stop to work sooner or later. Also smelting the ore in smelter is example of punishing mechanism – if you do not set it right and provide not enough energy, all will be wasted on failed attempt to heat it up with no real smelting in the end.\n\nSummary\n\nAlthough my comments are showing mainly negative aspects of current state of the game, I believe it has potential and as it is in early access, I give it positive result. Still, there is much to do and I believe that some of core concepts will need revision, especially when enemies will be added – they can change the game to be addictive… or not. I hope for the first.","May 13, 2015","true","36.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Looking for a minecraft clone? Then you're not going to find one here. After many years of running modded minecraft servers, I was quite sick to the back teeth of the game. That being said, I did get this game thinking there would be some similarities and expected to get bored very quickly. This game, quite simply put, is amazing. The developer is nothing short of a genius!\n\nThe game has you start with afew supplies, after crash landing on an Alien planet. You are given a small tutorial, and then thrown into the deep end. At this point, I went and watched a few episodes of Direwolf20's lets plays. After being educated a little.. I jumped back into the game.\n\nYou begin by scanning for various ores, and setting up mining equipment. While this is happening you will be also scanning new blocks and plantlife. This accumulates research points which you can use to unlock new research projects and equipment.\n\nIt's not long past this point, you realise that 5 hours of game time has passed, and you've simply got lost in this enormous game! By this point I had found my first 4 ore types, and had begun building a system of convayors that could fill my smelters on the surface. Research seemed very simple at first.. but another few hours in and I was now constructing a lab and researching new projects was taking several hours at a time. This was ok though because I had so much other stuff to do while this was happening.\n\nHowever.. the bigger your base becomes, the more power you use.. the higher your base threat becomes.. and it's not long before you threat analyser is telling you.. "Attack immanent!". Now for those like me who love the tech, and the factory side of the game.. the invading alien swarms will only attack your central hub.. and once it's health is 0, it just reboots. That is unless you're playing hardcore.. and then its game over.\n\nSo as I went deeper into the ground, I realised just how big this game was. Some of the caves, from top to bottom, were bigger than minecraft, bedrock to sky... I would liturally hold my breathe incase I fell off a ledge, as death meant I would drop all my equipment. So far i've been 1,187 blocks deep.. and everytime I go exploring, I just can't explain the feeling of being so small, in caves so large..\n\nThis game is great for those wanting some survival, some tower defence, and some tech. I love all the machines that automate the ore collecting and the minecarts that collect the ores.. the way the power system works, and the defending of my base. It really is very well balanced... and it has just the right difficulty level to keep most playing, and not getting bored.\n\n10/10","February 2","true","61.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I honestly didnt think i would like this game now im hooked i Dont notice what time it is till its waaaay past the time i need to get off. it is a lil slow in the beginning but once you start getting conveyer belts going you cant stop.\n\nSo I crash land first time nooo idea what I'm doing. scan some blocks research some stuff find some ore. make trips back and forth to charge power and get ores. thought this is tedious make some belts n laser power no more trips. look for more ores.... WTF im under attack by what ... ooooo i made the wasps mad. set up turrets go back lookin for more ores. died died died some more. ooooo im to cold down here make better gear go deeper. ... how'd i die that time ... oooo toxic fumes..... make more gear go deeper. build lots and lots of more goodies. go exploreing ..... wth almost craped my self when i ran into a giant worm spittin acid.  more turrets ( feels safer .... )\n\n\nHonestly i could go on and on but theres so much to build / explore n do in this game it would take a long time to explain it all. but if you enjoy crafting / survival / builder games with logistics n factory line setups i would suggest this for you its waaaaaayyyyyyy better than minecraft it just has blocky voxels that look waaaay better than minecrafts anyway.","March 26","true","164.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Quite easy to mod the game to your own liking, if unsatisfied with the balancing of the game.\n\nAfter 500 hours, the game is still offering new challenges, with the newly redo of the Hard Mobs difficulty, whole new challenges appears.\n\nThe new Casual mode offers a great alternative for those who might not have unlimited time to play the game, with a little boost to early game infrastructure as well! :D\n\nCommunity is very helpful, and the modding community as well.\n\nHaving completed the game a few times, on different difficulties, I believe the game still have more to offer for me, as there are still machines that I havn't played around with. As well as a major rebalance that I havnt tried myself yet either.\n\nA lot of hours for a silly low amount of money.

And I am not a reviewer.\n\nBut I love this game.\n\nYet I realise it will NOT please the masses.\n\nAlthough you can play slightly faster modes, the default mode (that I'm playing on) is quite slow. (at start at least).\n\nYou get to explore as in Minecraft... yet the surface "world" is not pretty and a lot less varied.  There's nothign to do on the surface anyway.  It's a desolated planet. (I do not see this as a problem... I'm just stating that the "exploration" part is not as fun as in Mineraft... no sense of wonder as of "what am I going to find !!!???" since the answer is simple : snow and mountains.)\n\nBut there are stuff to find and explore carefully under the surface.\n\nAnd then there is the logistic part.  [I'M NOT USING THE WORD "CONSTRUCTION", BUT "LOGISTIC"].  You want to build a logistic network to make mineral extraction, transport and transformation 100% automatic.\n\nThis is fun.\n\nThis is slow.\n\nSpecially at start.\n\nThere are means to make it faster when you create the world (accelerated modes where receipes are simpler).  But the default mode, per exemple, require 8 Copper ore to make 1 copper bar.   But the mining-machine extracts 1 ore every 22 seconds, costs a LOT of mineral to build, and requires power that will cost a lot of materials as well.  You will be manually feeding your extractor for quite a long while.\n\nBut I don't mind as much as I though I would.\n\nEach time you manage to make something 100% automatic and manage to double the speed of a process.... you'Re proud of it !\n\nYou should eventually be able to have something massive and super-productive.  AND THAT IS AWESOME.  It's rewarding.  It feels great.  Specially when you start from such ♥♥♥♥♥♥ installations.\n\n\nI have 14 hours played.  I have 9 extractors working yet ( 2 coal, 1 lthium, 2 iron, 2 copper and 2 tin ).\nThey are now all automatically powered.\nThey are all connected to VERY SLOW conveyor belts bringthe mats to my base. (except the lithium, I'm still fetching if manually... but that's ok!)\nNow working to building faster conveyor belt and automating the melding of the copper.\n\nSlow progression.  But as ressources are being produced faster, progression is also getting faster.

The Fortresscraft I knew was on the 360 and I played that nearly 2 years ago. I was happy to find out this game was for steam, I saw it looked different but I bought it anyway. I almost have regret on my purchase because after playing for some time now I clearly see that this isn't how I think it should be. They have put a fair amount of work into it but I'm just not as satisfied with this as much as the other one. The graphics still are fairly amazing but I just don't like the tools or having to build around machines. Lastly I was hoping it'd be about building in a cave deep underground or making a nice house. Perhaps they can hopefully go back to some origins.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/The_Hinsonator/recommended/254200/","The_Hinsonator","Hinsonator","http://steamcommunity.com/id/The_Hinsonator/","252 products in account","I am addicted to this game at the time i wrote this review, while the game is still in development i reccomend getting it. Basically this game is what you get when you mix Minecraft, a few of it's more technecal mods like Industrialcraft and Buildcraft and turn it into a full blown game. If you're a fan of Minecraft with those two mods then you should definitely play this, if you're a fan of voxel games in general i also think this is worth a try.\n\nWhen you start off you're about to dock at a space station in the middle of a meteor shower when it's hit by an asteroid and you come crashing down to the planet below because of that. At the moment your goal is to build up a base, research the local enviroment for things you can use and send some power in orbit so your buddies in orbit can get the damaged station running. While you're doing this you have to defend yourself from the local wildlife and trying to prevent the illusive hive mind from spreading and destroying any clump of resin you find on your travels as these will give you useful rewards.\n\n\nLet's start off with the bad:\n\n- The game is still quite buggy and unstable (when i wrote the review) and multiplayer is even more unstable. Running the game at a graphic quality setting higher than good will almost guarantee your game will crash if not your computer at the moment.\n\n- Enemies are quite buggy, going through blocks and if they die while inside of a block they could end up breaking the block they're inside.\n\n- The game punishes you if you mine ores yourself as you barely get any ore out of veins which forces you to rely on your trusty ore extractors.\n\n- This game is fairly hands off especially late game.\n\n- The game is also quite CPU heavy, if your computer has a weak processor i'd say either upgrade or avoid this game until you do get an upgrade.\n\n\nNow the good:\n\n+ The worlds are randomly generated which can be good especially if you get a good seed with loads of bigger ore veins. You can even change a few settings in relation to the map such as how common ore is, how fast conveyors move items about and how strong the enemies are and so on.\n\n+ While the progression has a few places that can be improved i think the devs have more or less nailed it.\n\n+ There are a set of upgrades for your suit, your floating bot called Arthur and later on the massive spiderbot that helps you defend your base.\n\n+ Automation is fun, especially when you get all four of the starter ores and you can build a basic power grid with coal generators, batteries to store energy and lasers to transfer energy from your generators to your extractors, turrets, even your forward outposts which you will need later on as you go deeper into the planet.\n\n+ This game is so much better with friends, although you can only play cooperatively at the moment as everyone shares the same base but you do all have your own inventories.\n\n+ The devs are very active, they try to push a patch out every month and sooner if the game has a massive problem. Every now and then they'll even throw in a feature that someone has suggested, complete with an achievement if you do use something a community member has suggested.\n\n+ The game has a creative mode which has been massively improved upon from the original Xbox 360 game, even the detail blocks have come over from there.\n\n+ If you have a massive problem with your game or computer there's a neat little system which aims to lower the chance your world will break as a result.\n\n+ Research is interesting especially when you get the lab, you scan the local enviroment and analize those scans to find out what they are and get a few research points for your efforts which you spend on new recipes and early on new technologies. When you research a new technology you'll either get something useful or a new technology which can give you something useful.\n\n+ On the technical side (at least i've heard) FortressCraft is one of those few games that makes good use of all your CPU cores no matter what so if you have a CPU with loads of weaker cores so if your machine doesn't have a CPU with a set of fewer, stronger cores then you might be in luck. This can be good news especially for AMD people as AMD CPUs (as far as i know) tend to boast a higher CPU core count compared to Intel CPUs of a comparable model.","March 26","true","197.8"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

I done alot of research on the trains and could not find anything :(\n\nSend me a message on steam GT:jro7563  to help me\n\n\nthanks\n\nPS thanks to gadgetgaz for helping me :D\n\n\nAlso is multi-player out i say this because when i look there is no players along side with no servers\n\nHmmm wierd\n\nI know how to use the workshop but on some pictures there some rounded objects.

The only thing it shares is the "block building". Vanilla MC does not have process automation such as mining ores, ore processing, power distribution grids and so forth. I've played both and they each have their strengths.\n\nEven though the game is in early access, the devs are very active in both updates and in the forums.

Make sure to read instructions on how to play, it can be a little confusing at first. Digging is a lot faster and you do not need to make tools.  The game focuses mostly on creating automated resource managment.   The game is really fun to play and I am looking forward to seeing what they are going to do next.\n\nPros:  Digging and block placement is easy and fast, you get a Grapple gun, can create elaborate automated mines.\nCons: Graphics is a little off, not many blocks in the game yet, no multiplayer yet.\n\n","June 28, 2014","true","13.5"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

Everything else is good as well.  Not quite sure what else to write here, so here's a recipe for homemade napalm:\n\nFill a large container about half-way with gasoline (diesel works best).\nTake a Styrofoam plate and break it into small pieces.\nAdd the pieces to the gasoline mixture.\n\nThe gasoline will dissolve the Styrofoam into a jelly-like substance. Pour out the extra gasoline leaving the white, jelly-like substance – this is your napalm, which when lit, will burn for several minutes. Engine oil can be added to to the mixture to reduce (slow) the burn time of the substance.\n\nThank you for your time.\n\n","January 2, 2015","true","318.0"," 14 of 27 people (52%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","52","14","27","13","0"

If you are a voxel/sandbox/survival fan of any sort or even if you are familiar with the concept i highly recommend this game it is worth every cent and then some.It is like a Fortresscraft original and MC modpacks had a baby and shot it up with steroids and it is only alpha the finished release will be godly compared to any sandbox type to date. The greatest thing about this game is the tech/research/automation system they have going on it is complex but at the time simple to understand the basics and i love the challange of the different enviromental hazards you have to counter\ncold/heat so far have not come across any other types but the bases for other hazards are already implemented.

And that's a good thing!  I find myself constantly experimenting, changing, and iterating my systems to take advantage of new tech or just to maximize efficiency.  As of this writing, I have 200+ hours in game and I plan to at least tripple that.\n\nAt first glance, it might look like Minecraft or Factorio.  But this game is much more than that and really isn't comparable.  This game rewards efficient, scalable design, not one-off systems.  You can do many things by hand, but eventually, everything must become automated.  And that is a good way to understand the game.  You must automate everything.\n\nFor the price, this game is definitely worth it.  I've spent more on games that I've played less.  Additionally, the planned expansions sound exciting and definitely something I will want to play.\n\nMy recommendation: if you like designing or building systems, this game is a must-have.","May 10","true","302.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Fortresscraft Evolved has a lot of features I like in a game and has kept me attached to my computer screen for way longer than my girlfriend would like.  “Yeah, cutie, I’ll be to bed soon.”  But that never happens.  One recent (and ridiculously long) negative poster had 801+ hours of play!  He must have enjoyed the game much more than he admits and definitely got his money’s worth!\nOn a side note first: I did not get this game for free, am not being paid to post a positive comment, and aren't using some fake account to skew the reviews.\nSo for the TL:DR portion of my rant....\nI'd like to rebuttal some arguments about the game as to prevent misconceptions.\nThe game is a complete, but open ended, fully playable game, and is constantly being updated with more features added and patch fixes for minor glitches.  If there are resources with descriptions like "not implemented yet" or "has no use yet, but will soon", it’s because that is a new feature only recently added to the already expansive game!  Anyone complaining (IMHO) about the game not being complete, is really only complaining that the developer refuses to stop adding more and more features to the game!  And how is that a valid complaint?!  If you think you’re going to jump into a new game, play for a bit, with the sole intent on “beating” it, you’re looking at the wrong game.  I’m sure one day there may be an end-game, like Mojang added to Minecraft much later after release.  But for now, feel at ease about spending your hard earned cash on this title. (which is cheap in comparison to much lesser games) Watch some videos.  Learn some strategies.  And enjoy the open ended-ness of the gameplay in its current high-content state.\nI’m looking forward to the upcoming Frozen Factory and Magma Core expansions and am fully willing to buy those as a DLC if that’s the way the dev chooses to go, because I’ve already gotten way beyond my money’s worth with the way the game is now.

As mentioned in other reviews, think tech modded MC and Factorio had a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child. Hate using MC as the reference, as it seems almost every vox type game gets compared to it....but, unfortunately popularity & timing made it the "benchmark", and in my opinion, this game will well surpass that mark in unique playability. Love the fact that it's not overly easy to "run away" with production like some of the MC mods....you know, the ones that you play 3 hours and you no longer have to do anything except design a new house....the exploration & mining remains a requirement. I love laying out mines & methodizing my gathering/processing lines....Not much of a "builder" fanatic, I stick to industrial style buildings, so my typical asthetic is: square, gray, door, mine, the end....so can't really comment on the building aspect.\nAlready polished for the stage it is in, going to enjoy watching it grow....at the time of this writing, dev released another primer for the next update, so no worries about the "dev mysteriously disappeared after selling X amount of unfinished product" as I've bought into many times prior, I'm pretty sure they're here to see it through.\n\nLove the game, love the genre.....if you're reading the reviews, then you should probably grab it before it hits the finish line & prices go up to what it's truely worth!!\n\nFinally found a gem!!","February 27, 2015","true","47.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I was hoping Anthony's review was a bit of an exaggeration, but even after dozens of hours playing Minecraft, I was pretty lost after about a half hour playing this game.\n\nThere were birds flying around that I couldn't kill, with text attached to them about crafting (Not sure if this is a bug or one of many confusing features), and even with tutorial screen at the beginning, I was still clueless. It kind of feel like it was written for someone who already has a lot of experience playing this game.\n\nI think I was supposed to find my crashed ship, but when I went to the area where it seemed to have gone down, there was just some "power thing" floating well above where I could reach it. I was able to mine a few rocks and trees, but couldn't seem to craft anything with them but torches. Even after chopping down trees, I saw no way to turn those into planks, or construct anything.\n\nSurvival mode in Minecraft starts you with nothing, and no endless menu of things you could eventually build, which eases you into what eventually becomes a very complex game. I'm not sure how much more complex this game is supposed to be, but it's almost impossible to get into a game when I don't have the slightest clue what I'm doing.\n\nI'll try watching a Youtube tutorial on how to get through the first few days, but since this is still Early Access, I'd really recommend to the developers that they consider a very basic, starting from scratch, survival mode, and slowly introduce new features. I usually don't need my hand held figuring out games, but this one almost requires it. Assume the people playing your game have never even heard of a game like this before, and teach them how to play it. Right now, a 6 page tutorial on topics that make no sense to a beginner, isn't helping.\n\nI think I could really get into this game, but right now it's almost impossible, even if I wanted to. Please consider a more basic starting point for beginners, Devs, and teach as we go, rather than bombarding us with a bunch of information and features from the get go.\n\nBut all in all, I'm going to recommend this game because it is Early Access, and the Devs do seem dedicated to making improvements.\n\nTL;DR: Survival mode is incredibly difficult to figure out, even if you've played Minecraft, but at this price point, this game is still worth picking up.","May 5, 2014","true","1.0"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","4"

However, with a little time, reading, and work I actually started to have fun playing this game. The confusing interfaces, controls, and something else about the general feel of the game is outputting, and when I first launched it, within 10 minutes I slammed the book shut and stored it on a high shelf. But I gave it a second chance, this time more open hearted. The game is playable and fun, you get to mine, use the resources, build machines, and expand. You just need a guide to do so. The interfaces? Very counter-intuitive and inconsistant. Overall the game is rather well done, has room for improvement, uses a great concept I'd love to see more of in gaming (automation of resource refinement), but just has some painfully rough edges. If the developer(s?) would devote one long, productive day solely to interface enhancement and a bit of easier to understand starter stuff, then the game would feel a lot better. Also, remember, this is early access! It definitely feels it deserves this flag, and I hope it can fix these issues. If so, this game can definitely be something great in my library.","February 25, 2015","true","115.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Do you enjoy hardcore-esc environments? Do you enjoy standing by a lamp, hoping you won't die of hypothermia? Then this is the game for you! In it's mechanics, it is kind of like minecraft. You need to mine to collect ores. But it isn't just "Punch tree, get wood". You need to loacate your crashed spacecraft. You need to fend off againts enimies. You need to stay warm, to prevent hypothermia. You need to cool down, so that you don't get heat stroke. No matter what it is, the game can prove to have difficulty. You can't simply afk and let all of your ores melt, you have to sit in just a precise place, so that you don't overheat, or freeze.\nBut, it's not all hard. The game also serves with a small robotic friend(Who needs power, go figure) that helps you out. He doesn't do much, but he can keep your suit powered, so that you can maintain your heat levels. You can explore giant underground tunnels and caves, with boundless possibilities! You could simply enjoy walking around on the surface of the planet.\nI reccomend this game.

As mentioned in other reviews, think tech modded MC and Factorio had a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child. Hate using MC as the reference, as it seems almost every vox type game gets compared to it....but, unfortunately popularity & timing made it the "benchmark", and in my opinion, this game will well surpass that mark in unique playability. Love the fact that it's not overly easy to "run away" with production like some of the MC mods....you know, the ones that you play 3 hours and you no longer have to do anything except design a new house....the exploration & mining remains a requirement. I love laying out mines & methodizing my gathering/processing lines....Not much of a "builder" fanatic, I stick to industrial style buildings, so my typical asthetic is: square, gray, door, mine, the end....so can't really comment on the building aspect.\nAlready polished for the stage it is in, going to enjoy watching it grow....at the time of this writing, dev released another primer for the next update, so no worries about the "dev mysteriously disappeared after selling X amount of unfinished product" as I've bought into many times prior, I'm pretty sure they're here to see it through.\n\nLove the game, love the genre.....if you're reading the reviews, then you should probably grab it before it hits the finish line & prices go up to what it's truely worth!!\n\nFinally found a gem!!","February 27, 2015","true","47.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

As such, you can create large numbers of machines (with animations) working in one area without the performance issues minecraft encouters. Also, the multi-tiered ore system is enjoyable, with different environmental hazards at different levels making digging deeper interesting.\n\nThe downsides I find with this game are primarily in its aesthetic. There are no biomes excepting the default snow/hill template. This makes the surface world uninteresting to explore. Also, the lighting effects need some tweaking as they reflect off of machines/conveyors in odd ways and make playing the game at night, or attempting to make the factory indoors less enjoyable.","January 24","true","62.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Quite feature-rich and playable, while still being in active (and community engaged) development, yet designed with the innate desire (I would say promise, if this wasn't the world of software with its ever-emergent unknowable bugs) that its development will never force a world reset.  The dev is on the forums almost daily, actively engaging with users re: feature tweak/addition suggestions, bug reports, balancing issues... rather than buying a buggy in-development game and getting cryptic or dismissive responses to your suggestions/issues from the obvious PR arm of things (as opposed to the techies who know what the bleep you're talking about), you're buying Minecraft-esque access to a living, /thriving/ beta version, with much less endemic issues than Minecraft, ALONG WITH front-row tickets to real-life large-scale game development unfolding in front of your eyes.\n\nAnd, it is incredibly well-optimized when it comes to visual/computing-resource playability.  My favorite feature of the game, far and away, is found not in the gameplay, but in the settings menu: click a checkbox, set your target framerate, and the game will take ahold of the quality and render distance settings in order to keep you achieving that.  In a frenetic base with umpteen-gazillion things going on, it'll automatically turn down shadows and maybe kill the render distance - just like our IRL brains would tend to focus on a small subset of the goings-on in a real hectic factory - while during landscape exploration, you can get the voxel equivalent of Skyrim's brilliant vistas.  (Hint to DJ: World-gen structures of awesomeness maybe?)\n\nGeeky stuff aside, the gameplay... wait, never mind about "geeky stuff aside."  If you just want another alien shoot-em-up with resource management and base-building mechanics in the tactical background, then this game isn't for you.  If you want a tower-defense game where mobsKilled is proportional to resourcesAvailable through some arcana, this isn't the game for you.  If you want another (Modded) Minecraft, where you have the option that the base can be there just for aesthetics, or for helping you The Player become the Great Lone Warrior and Loot-Collector of Your Infinite Domain (not that many take this option, but from some of the forum posts, quite a few do), this isn't the game for you.\n\nBUT, if you want a game that blends ALL these elements, plus ever-present environmental factors, automation systems that would appeal to Rube Goldberg and Henry Ford alike, and a strong requirement to Go Forth and Explore... then as long as you can handle the irreducible complexities of such a system, this IS the game for you.  This is the game for the MacGyvers of Minecraft, the Fords of Factorio, the Kings of Kerbal, who want to apply their problem-solving, epic-failing, and grand-constructing skills to an infinite-yet-efficient landscape and a stable-yet-expanding game mechanics platform (with official modding support much closer than with Minecraft).  If you're geeky, 10/10 would recommend.","January 6","true","39.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The player just thrown to the middle of some labor situation and takes time to figure out the machines, and what is the benefit to doing this and that. You research but you have no log about the results just unlock the possibility of the thing to use according to its purpose.  A droid hanging around with messages what is often difficulty to read.

I say "could have been" because development has all but stopped, even though it's still in Early Access. There are currently game-breaking bugs, such as segment loading/saving errors that result in lost items/constructions, invisible walls, unloaded blocks, etc. Sometimes half the world just doesn't load and everything you've built gets deleted.\n\nWhat is FortressCraft Evolved?\nThere are two modes: Creative and Survival. Creative is the same as any other generic Minecraft clone. Survival is a bit more interesting, and it's where I spent most of my hours in-game. The premise of the Survival mode is a mix between Factorio and Minecraft, where your mission is to basically collect resources and build infrastructure with the end goal of...automating the collection of resources to let you build more stuff. There are "plans" to include enemies/combat to give a bit more of a challenge for players who don't just want to mine. Right now exploration isn't that fun. It's a fairly bleak surface world with repetitive caverns below.\n\nWhy Should I NOT Buy This Game?\nGame-breaking bugs\nLack of updates from dev team\nPoorly thought out game elements (e.g. The math behind power delivery is completely broken. When you connect batteries, they do not share power instantly, it "leaks out" over time. Even with fully upgraded lasers, which transfer power from object to object, it's impossible to fully power the most advanced types of objects currently in game, such as MatterMovers)*\nFairly boring/lack of content after first few hours (Granted, that would be fine for any Early Access title, but this game has been in Early Access for YEARS now and has completely stalled)\n*Note: Some of these issues have been fixed by a third-party mod, called LazyMod. Yes, a player made fixes to the game that the developer wouldn't/couldn't. The game Developer then asked the mod author on a Steam forum how he was able to manage these things...that's a bit disheartening.\n\nWhy Should I Buy This Game?\nYou enjoy automation/upgrading/resource collection\nYou don't mind weird glitches, placeholder graphics, or reverting game save files\nYou want to support an independent developer who has, in all honesty, probably lost interest in the game","June 1, 2015","false","67.6"," 148 of 298 people (50%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","50","148","298","10","38"

(you click the button - wait for a second or two, click again, ... until you are thrown into the world)\n\nIn game there are some nice mechanics, namely the survival against the wild system. (your suit keeps you warm on a frozen planet and if its power is fully depleted, you die after a short time).\nBut in my opinion, this is one of the biggest flaws at the moment:\nThere is a brutal world out there, trying to kill you and you have to fight it from the very beginning - without much help or direction from the game.\nWhile several games have recently tried this "do what you like and see what comes of it!"-approach, this game has you fighting for your life from the very first moment and thereby hinders any attempt at  a shallow start (again, think Minecraft: hacking away at those mud-cubes, only to find out they're almost worthless - but you didn't die from that and could switch over to actually mining something useful)\n\nHowever, there are too many unexplained phenomenons to actually rush into this game without any knowledge.\nAfter reading a few guides it might start to make sense that you should simply search for coal to power your equipment - but if you've yet to read those guides you might spend the first attempt at survival cursing.\nSimply because you start with several fancy technologies in your inventory and can't place them or know what to do with them in the first place.\nThen there is the awkward mining process - it feels counterintuitive having to repeatedly press the mouse button to mine. (why can't I keep it pressed like in Minecraft and it simply keeps mining?)\n\nI'd say its got potential once several flaws are fixed.\nBut at the moment there are simply too little hints to actually get started and enjoy the game without reading several guides.","February 21, 2014","false","0.9"," 29 of 59 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","29","59","0","15"

After that,well..there is not much to do,it's hard to get pretty materials in survival mode to build nice looking houses with. I give the game a 4/5, or a 7/10.\n\nOnce finished,I can see it being an amazing place to spend most of your time.","November 7, 2014","true","173.9"," 17 of 35 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","17","35","0","0"

It's hard even on the 'easy' settings to do anything really. With the combonation of heat/cold, energy storage of your suit only one begginer smelter and a whole lot of things early game take way too long! It is a time sink that is in my opinion far worse than other 'builder' games. I will compare to one that most everyone should know: Minecraft.\n\nComparing Minecraft to Fortresscraft\n*You can easily build multiple smelters right from the start really/ Fortresscraft you may finally unlock a basic smelter after a few hours play.\n\n*Ores are generally spawned with more of a pattern/ Fortresscraft is more luck based. Meaning it may take a few hours to even build the basics.\n\n*You already know all crafting, you just need the proper tool/ Fortresscraft you need to scan almost everything, and research it. Use the researcher to gain building rights. Making the beginning game so long and tedious.\n\nThese are just a few issues I have.\n\nOne could argue: Recode the recipes in the data files. I shouldn't have to. One could say use creative mode. Then I lose out on needing anything and lose on battling enemies. Plus you don't get all the energy stuff or anything. Or none that I could see.\n\nI wish there was a kind of hybrid creative/ survival mode. Kind of like how you can switch between the modes in Minecraft with commands. And the creative mode in Fortresscraft had ALL the blocks plus being able to battle enemies should you choose to.\n\nSo unless you have hours to sit down and figure this game out, don't expect anything to be built quickly. As it is, I can't reccomend it. Maybe it's not for me since I don't have hours and hours to sink into it to find everything and such. Which is why I like Minecraft better. If you want something that does similar to this but qucker, Try Factorio. You can even cheat if you wish, and I don't feel cheating ruined the game for me on that as I still do a lot.\n\nIt has potential. I love the idea of having a factory with belts/ transporters, and building a defensive base and all that. So I WILL check in on this game from time to time as I do like the ideas. It just needs to be a little more open I guess you could say. Allow us to do what we want, if we wish to speed things up some allow commands to do so or something. I'll keep watching it for updates and such and may update my review at a later date.","March 16","false","18.1"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","9","19","0","2"

I have not played a lot, but from the meager 2 hours there are a lot of things that, unfortunately, made this a waste of money for now. The price tag would be justified if the game weren't the mess it is now. There are ofc a lot of pros to it but the amount of cons, and the form they take, is just a little too much. Also, as much as people would love to say it is a Minecraft clone, the similarities end at "block based building" and "mining". You could just as well place Space Engineers in the same category then.\n\nPros:\n\n- Infinite worlds, a la Minecraft (better than the 256 block height it has anyways)\n- Good potential for a crafting system, unlike any other Minecraft-ish game\n- Research, blueprints, power system, different mining modes\n- Much more realistic processing and production, with ore smelting, refining, and producing items and gear\n- "Health" system with temperature, power levels and hypothermia\n\nCons:\n\n- Buggy UI and menus, to the point it becomes very annoying\n- Lack of a proper tutorial (there is one but it's messy and sometimes unclear)\n- Buggy creative multiplayer with no proper netcode or player sync\n- Extremely buggy survival multiplayer (lots of ore duping without even trying and more)\n- Very odd color scheme and graphical design choices for blocks and machinery (more of a personal opinion, but ir sure seems off)\n\nIt's a good game, with a lot of potential, but it's a shame that the bugs and clunkiness of it made it very hard to play. I will definitely check back in a couple updates and hope it still was a good investment. For people who can cope with bugs and still enjoy a game, go ahead, but there are too many things either unfinished or (partially) broken right now. I still recommend it tho because of this future potential.","October 25, 2014","true","1.9"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","0"

I tried a couple before I found one I was happy with. It will take time.The game is heavily based around automation, so you can continue to dig deeper and find new things, then automate those new things to get it all back to your base. At first, you will have to babysit things. You simply don't have the resources to get things rolling on their own for the first hour, maybe two. Watch a couple of videos on it. You'll see how others do things, you'll get a good understanding of the basics, and you'll have some ideas as to how to set your own system up. It takes a lot of time to really get a lot going on, but if building up to that isn't your cup of tea, then I might advise a different game type. There are several more mechanics at play here than in MineCraft, and pretty much any other game in this vein. It takes a lot of the concepts explored in Space Engineers, removes space, and instead focuses on mining materials and setting them up to work for you.","May 14","true","1.9"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

The first 15-hour playthrouh I had was boring, dull, had little content, and progress was unrewarding. Now, what playtime i have that makes up the rest, I have had a lot of fun. Progress has a much more rewarding feeling to it, setting up automation and watching something automatically complete itself (Which before needed you to move seperate parts all over) it the best. Exploring this game on my own, with little to no help from outside (other than asking wikipedia how much power a solar generator makes) is one of the most fun things I have done in quite a while. When I found out there was actually some degree of threat found in the wasps, I was amazed. My first playthrough had these little robots floating around occasionally, but nothing like the threats I have seen here. I'm not even mid-game and I still enjoy the slow process of manually carrying ores to the surface, because I know that these ores are going to be turned into bars, which will be turned into circuits and plates, which will be turned into research pods, which will be used to research automatic transportation methods for those ores I have been bringing up manually. When something comes full circle in this game, it is probably one of the most satisfying feelings. On a side note, the amount of fun I have had in this game is comparable to the fun i've had in Factorio.","June 2","true","61.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

At its core it is a game where you attempt to maximize your automation for crafting. Overall, I think it works well.

This game realeased in early access more than 4 YEARS AGO and I still have a better time playing the orignal one on the XBLA. This game completly fails to motavate you to do anything at all. It starts you out with a drill gun that can dig through ANYTHING IN THE GAME so I had no reason to craft a better one even if you can. It also starts you out with a ♥♥♥♥ING LASER CANNON so there is also no reason to get a better weapon either, y'know im not even sure if theres enemys in the game to shoot at. I did find little flying robot things that I could'nt collect like a perk (like in the first one) and I tried to shoot them with the Mega Death Death Ray Gun that it just gives you and it just wizzed right passed them. Speaking of robots you have a little robot thing that follows you around and shows you the block you're carrying incase your completly brain dead. Lastly, it spawns you with a 3 tourches  that emit enough heat to burn through the earths crust. See, there is this system much like thwe hunger in minecraft in here but with tempeture. And scince it spawns you in the middle of a blizzard I decided to make a house to get warm in. And after I made a house of wood and stone and waited for 5 minutes I did not get any warmer. So I dug in the middle of a moutain hoping to get warm and littarly nothing happened with 5 blocks of stone on either side protecting me from the cold. So the only way to get warm is by getting items that emit heat. But scince the crafting system is as easy to work as rubber stilts You're. Basicly. ♥♥♥♥ed.

I say mining-ish because your resources are 99% dug out of the ground, but this isn't just a dig and build kind of game. You need power to live, you get power through different means. One of these means that takes it away from just mining are things like solar energy and the ability to store the electricity in batteries. If you like a sandboc voxel game and the idea of building a self-sustaining operation this game is for you. There is also a creative mode, but I can't speak much on this because that is simply not my general area of interest. The early game has a very good push to make you want to expand and evolve. The energy requirement to keep you alive feels very real when the game starts and after about 30 minutes of keeping yourself alive I most certainly experienced the wanting to keep myself alive with less direct input and the only solution to this was building things to sustain themselves. I would say I have done about 50% of what can/could be accopmlished in an average scope of the game (not a 100% copmletionist have to get every achievement kind of view). One way I like to way games is how many good hours a got per dollar. Currently I have 65 hours and I believe I bought it at $10 (USD). That's 6.5 hours per dollar which is far above my threshold of a game that should be considered bad if you play it less than 1 hour per dollar. I definitely got hooked on this game and stayed up late hours wanting to keep playing.\n\nOne of the best things I can say for this game is the small development team. The developer is ALL OVER THE FORUM. The developer always wants more feedback and seems to spend all day speaking to players and improving the game. It gets updated constantly and has a well thought out road map of what is next.\n\nI would say invest now. Get your money's worth and enjoy I great new take on a voxel game.\n\nAlso, I forgot it is moddable and the community will help with that.\n\nTL;DR\nIt's a good game. (I don't give 0-10/10 because it is meaningless in a 1 paragraph review). This game is worth your money and has a great theme and support to become even greater.","November 9, 2015","true","975.7"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

Game loads very quickly as well as the world generation or world loading as you move around.\n\nAt the time of writing this I'm 14 hours in and still haven't reached mid game.  I would guess even at the early access level of development there is at least 60 hours of entertainment to be found.\n\nIf you're a fan of minecraft you might like this game, if you're a fan of factorio or crafting / automating style of games you'll really enjoy it.\n\nThe only negatives at the moment I have is that there is no real threat in surivial mode death just spawns you back to your base, and mobs have not been added yet, but again, still in development and the games current status works well.  Also the progression to being able to do anything efficiently besides manual filling/unloading miners, hoppers, etc. is a little much.  I ended my last game session to finally being able to build my 2nd smelter, which is a bottle neck that limits progression more so then having a consistant progression of acomplishments.  But as i've said several times it is in beta so I'm sure as more mid game and end game things are added smelters will be more available early on.\n\nOverall the game is great and quite entertaining.  $9 bucks for what I expect to be 30+ hours minimium of enjoyment is better then any cost to entertainment ratio I expect from most AAA games.  And once they start doing more patches I'm sure I'll get even more enjoyment out of it.","March 21, 2015","true","198.7"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

The game, however, is not really worth a thumb-up at the moment, because the game is not really playable now.\n\nThe developer says that the creative mode is easy to use, but I didn't see how 'easy' it is. Well if you have played Minecraft, and you like building, you should probably know the plugin WorldEdit, and that really make building easier. But although this game have a 'powerful' building tool, it can't really make any different. If I want to place a chunk, that's OK, but it's really a challenge to make the chunk in proper size and position. The 'powerful' building tool seems to be more like a terrain brush rather than an assistant tool. In my opinion, something that can be called building tool should at lease have all the function that WroldEdit have. And the build to me function didn't work at all.\n\nBy the way, there are no slopes, even no slabs and stairs in the game. Although I can make it an model manually, is that really easy that I need 8 models of one meterial in order to create the roof? And I REALLY want some furnitures but I can't find anything that really seems to be furniture, and I even can't find doors.\n\nAlso the survival mode is really hard to play. The ping tool in the scanner really fustrate me a lot, because it can make the screen bright violin and it's hard to see through with these on. Energy things is almost OK, but why can't power centre charge the research centre? Every time I have to move the energy cell right next to the research centre in order to charge it, and transfer energy manually.\n\nAnd the UI is hard to use. Something that I really want to complain is that, could I have an inventory? And also, drag-drop control is not featured, and I should first select the item in my hot bar, and then open the UI to feed it, and the energy centre have no buffer, so I have to throw in a coal every minute, before I can have any automatic machanic.\n\nSo with all these problems, why I still give it thumb-up? The main reason is that I only get the game for 2.24USD (and I purchased 13.44CNY), that's far cheaper than Minecraft. And also you can't expect a lot on a game in technic preview stage. 4 years ago, I used to play the classic version of Minecraft, and that has even less function than this game in this stage, but everyone enjoy that. There's still a lot of time for this game to be improved, and I hope that my 2 USD will worth 40 USD in the future.\n\nSo, it's still worth to buy it, but don't expect too much too soon. Buy it and put it aside for several years is OK.","December 14, 2014","true","5.7"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Read on if that confuses you.\n\nI've played a lot more Minecraft in my time than I'm prepared to discuss. There's a lot wrong with that game, and FortressCraft Evolved seems to be on the right path to fixing it. I've always found creative mode in Minecraft to be dull - for me, there needs to be the chance of failure/death, no matter how slight.  I've always hated the amount of time that goes to waste just trying to mine blocks in Survival, though, and FortressCraft has taken a great direction mixing the two. I don't really appreciate that the only way you can die is freezing to death... I know you can take some form of fall damage (with a really annoying screen effect), but I don't actually know if it can kill you. But! It's Early Access, and I can appreciate that these things take time.\n\nA few suggestions I would make, assuming that the developer(s) read(s) this:\n\n-Portable block identification. Some way to make it not a pain to go back to "home base" and have to identify things before you can use them. I get that it's unrealistic for Steve? the wandering hobo to magically know what iron ore looks like and how to use it, but it's willing suspension of disbelief. Honestly, I would more readily believe that a space-man on what was probably a mining ship has basic earth metals committed to memory.\n\n-Make the particle effect for "home base" visible on low graphics (that is, if we really have to have home base to begin with). There was an interesting glitch when I first started up the game that made the ship just fly off into infinity instead of crashing to ground. Since I started the game on fastest graphics, the purple light particle never showed up... unless the ship legitimately never crashed and flew across the endless map. I reset that world anyway, so we may never know.\n\n-The way chunks load is entertaining, but I feel like that has to be taking up CPU that could be used a bit more responsibly. I don't personally know enough about this to go in depth about it, just kind of suggesting that the animation be dropped in favor of chunks "popping" into existence.\n\nIn the end, the game is solid, and I really believe it has potential. It's not going to be the Minecraft killer, but that's alright, since Minecraft is enough of a danger to itself. There's plenty of bugs to iron out, but like I already said, these things take time.

Survival is basically nonexistant. No enemies, broken game mechanics (many many basic menu options are unclickable), and quite glitchy even for my taste.

Sets itself apart from Minecraft in countless ways\n2. Multiplayer servers are free to set up\n3. Game is cheap-ish\n\nThe Bad:\n1. Game is too glitchy and surivival is basically unplayable in current state\n2. Graphics are worse than Minecraft (but not by much)\n3.

How about 2 hours to be able to safely explore away from your base for more than 5 minutes at a time? And that's in what this game calls easy mode - "Casual" mode it literally say is for people with jobs and families. (Who is the target audience, then?)\n\nEvery upgrade and machine will cost more resources than it should, and perform below expectations. The game's basic generator can only function in the shallowest biomes (not enough oxygen deeper apparently), and even then it will decline to near 0% efficiency before you reach the next layer. Said layer will freeze you to death in under a minute until you build a suit upgrade... using ore from the layer below it. Everything about the gameplay feels like it's punishing the player.\n\nApart from the mindbogglingly slow gameplay: The graphics are generally unappealing - it tries 'realistic' textures which don't look good in voxel games in my opinion, but I will acknowledge that's subjective. The surface is ugly as sin - you will never go exploring looking for a pretty place to build an outpost, because none exist. The 3d models are passable for an indie game. Animation is barebones.\n\nThe sound design is decent, the effects get the job done, some of the (brief and intermittent) background music is nice.\n\nI didn't notice any bugs whatsoever, so good job on that.\n\nMuch of the flavor text in item descriptions includes the author's attempts at forced humor, which I found grating.\n\nI actively played this game for about 15 hours, with several more afk idling while waiting for automation to process materials. I did my best to give this game a chance, I kept waiting for it to become fun, and it just never did.\n\nIf you're one of those GregTech-type masochists out there, you might enjoy this.

Because it was originally made for the Xbox, the controls on the PC feel terrible and stiff, and the frame rate is consistently below 6o fps. This could be just me due to not having a high processing power but while I had Skyrim on my PC, it was never as bad as how this game performs here. Building is slow and I feel like the UI is far too much of a struggle to put up with. Furthermore, this game is still in early access even though it's been in development for more than two years. What has hindered te development this long, I really can't imagine. I enjoyed what I could do when it worked, but I feel like compared  other titles of this genre *coughcough* Minecraft/Terraria *coughcough* Fortresscraft doesn't add up in end.

It seems you 100% need to do this to get your smelter operating with any sort of efficiency.  It should be part of the tutorial.\n\nIt feels like giving players access to the research path before they have _built_ the smelter upgrades and the suit & robot power upgrades is a mistake.  It consumes a ton of resources and takes focus away from the income engine.\n\nThere's lots of other odds and ends you can waste resources on early game, research is just the one that got me.\n\n\nSo the early game is not as broken as I thought, however I suspect it's been optimised for someone who already knows how to play.  New comers without existing knowledge are likely to get harshly punished for sub-optimal play.\n\n\nThis is something that both minecraft and factorio seem to handle quite well but this game drops the ball on","December 28, 2015","false","37.1"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","5"

I've already run into a LOT of bugs within my playtime already, below is a list of them.\n\n-- The 64-Bit Version may crash upon Quitting the game to desktop.\n-- Having more than one ore type in your inventory will confuse the smelter's "Feed Ores" button. (You cannot make a storage system without multiple ores.)\n-- The A.R.T.H.U.R or whatever it is called, requires a Power Core to be crafted for it to work proper again. However, you do not know this recipe, even after researching the black box and power suit upgrades.\n-- Right-Clicking items in your hot bar (using the mouse-enabled HUD) removes them from your inventory, forever. You cannot collect more of the item, you cannot see the item when using scroll wheel, etc. It's gone, forever.\n-- Using your mining laser on coal ore (or any ore) constantly will seem to continue mining the ore incredibly faster than an ore extractor, this is not the case, the blocks that appear dropped are ghost ore item drops.\n-- Game on "Fabulous" has issues with block animations, etc. The loading screen also freezes on that setting, even though the computer can handle said setting over 60 FPS (IE: Getting screen-tear since my computer can process faster even on Fabulous.) The setting can also lag computers that are far, far above the recommended requirements.\n-- The spider mech enemy does nothing.\n-- Your gun cannot hurt the spider mech enemy. (IE: The spider mech has no hitbox.)\n-- Sometimes, during the day, the solar cell on the suit does not work.\n-- Sometimes, even if you have enough power and research points, some research items will say they can't be researched.\n-- The world select button on the Escape menu does nothing.\n-- When creating a world with a custom name, the world's name reverts to "World" on game reload.","October 6, 2014","true","1.5"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","2"

I especially enjoyed the idea of creating zed spawners. I must have created thousands of those things...\n\nBut anyway, on with THIS game.\n\nI had to say this: it's not easy starting out. I had little time to read the help and starting tips before I realized that my suit energy was dropping fairly quickly. To top it off, I had to also wrestle with the controls before I was able to make my way to my crash site.\n\nBut once I managed to get the controls down, I was able to start mining for resources. I got lucky and found a tin and coal vein inside the mountain I set up camp on, and eventually found iron and copper (though they were a long climb down into the earth.\n\nI think the suit energy idea is a good idea. It's going to keep you alive, and it allows you to stay out in the cold a while longer before you need to recharge. And the scanner idea was nice as well, though I think I know a tree when I see one. Unless it suddenly grows tentacles and tries to eat me. Then I'm just being eaten.\n\nAnd the new entities in the the game have given me more questions than answers. There are these flying robots that, when I kill them, drop ruined stingers. Not sure what to do with those, or what they are suppose to do for the bots, but it's interesting. And let's not forget the wacky-looking spider thing I found stuck on the mountain. That thing wouldn't die, nor would it move. I'm curious as to how all of those things got there.\n\nWhile this game is pretty fun to play, and the creative mode is a blast to mess with, I did have some general issues, ones that I'm sure some or most players will have run into.\n\n1. Resource Management.\nWhile I can understand that resources are going to be important for your survival, it just seems kind of ridiculous to have to travel hundreds of blocks away in order to find even basic resources (it took me over an hour to just find copper). And the majority of the time, my energy is being used to keep my few ore extractors going, or scanning for more areas to mine new resources. I've yet to find anything new.\n\n2. Control Layout.\nThis is one of my biggest beefs, and for a good reason. As I said before, I had to fight with the controls for a minute before I could get moving, though it took me even longer to learn how to switch back to my scanner from my gathering tool. It also feel a little clunky, having to reach across the keyboard to hit a certain hotkey. I know the keys can be rebound, but I tend not to mess with that. Maybe a few minor rethinkings of the layout would be nice. Or controller support! I'm honestly one for full controller support, so maybe that could be a future addition.\n\n3. Crafting.\nThe crafting system is relatively straight forward, which is nice, but requires resources that could take a lot of time to find, and even more time to gather. And even with the resources that are almost immediately found, the process requires more time and more resources. To illustrate my issue:\n\n8 iron=1 iron bar, 15 iron bars=1 ore extractor.\n\nIt just seems a little tedious.\n\n4. Environmetal Hazards.\nNow, honestly, this is a cool feature, but one that needs some working. Heat keeps you from freezing to death, obviously. But what makes me a little irritated is the fact that you can't make heated rooms. It just seems like one of those things that you'd think would have been implemented a while back to help players better manage themselves. I'm really hoping it's added in a future update, though. Cold nights would be so much more pleasant.\n\n5. Terrain.\nThis one is just something small, nothing major. But I feel like it's something that could be implemented at some point in even a minor update.\nHaving to jump to go up another block gets a little tedious, not to mention it's a little hard on the spacebar (at least mine, anyway). Maybe the option of automatically climbing up one block could make an appearance in a future update.\n\nBut other than that, this game is looking pretty good! I'm looking forward to seeing what the Devs have in store for futue updates, as well as what other players will suggest adding to it. This is a game that certainly has evolved from it's console predecessor, and it's done so pretty well.","September 7, 2014","true","13.1"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

You start off in the middle of no where freezing to death with only the energy in your suit and a couple of torches and ore extractors.  You immediately have to set off to find your crashed ship to try to salvage whatever you can to just survive the first night on this planet.  Once you're accustomed to surviving the night, you can start exploring all that FortressCraft has to offer.  Building automated bases, suit upgrades, crafting, etc.\n\nThe UI still needs to be cleaned up and more intuitive, but the devs are working on core functionality of the game first so expect a bit of a learning curve (if you have any questions the devs and other community members are always available on the forums),\n\nNew updates and features are being released all the time, multiplayer was just recently released (there's still a lot more work to do with multiplayer, but at least it's under way).

However now, in it`s current state, it has two problems. First of all, it is vey, very buggy. Look at any part of the game and you will find bugs. Player falls through the floor, items cannot be moved to inventory, capacity of smelter changes randomly, sometimes items just disappear while dragging.\nSecond problem is balance. Prepare to wait a lot and to make many monotonous movements. Dig and recharge, dig and recharge, dig and recharge, dig and recharge, dig and recharge, dig and recharge, dig and recharge, dig and recharge. Then go to smelter and smelt for an hour. Capacity of smelter is low (and changes randomly) so you cannot just leave game and go for a walk.\nOf course, there is automation in this game, everything can be automated. But you`ll spend hours and hours to craft automatic resource processing. And these hours will be very boring.\nI dont recommend this game untill all bugs are fixed and long hours replaced with brief breaks.","December 16, 2014","false","8.8"," 35 of 75 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","35","75","0","6"

I cannot find time to continually update this review as time goes on, though.  I will come back to the game someday just to check out the finished product.\n\nHere are the pros:\n1. Good graphics, the game is pretty in terms of lighting and bloom and so on, but it is a blocky style... though you should know that already.\n2. Has a survival mode for game-like experience (not yet playable) and a creative mode for just building and chilling out.\n3. The main menu looks kind of neat with all the sliding camera animations and dark techie rooms.\n4. The way you enter worlds is cinematic and exciting the first time you play.\n5. The worlds are huge.  I mean huge.\n6. The game is a lot more affordable than most other commercial games in the genre.  (Minecraft was $25 last I checked.)\n\nCons:\n1. Terrible UI/menu design/implementation, no mouse input!  what da hell.  That said, the game is in Early Access, and the devs admit the menu needs improvement.\n2. Creative mode controls are awkward and simply not fun, feels very technical and poorly designed.\n3. Many features do not seem to be working yet.  (Duh. Early Access.)  Some of these non-functional features are very hard to ignore.  For example, you cannot exit a map; you have to exit and reload the entire game to go to a different map.\n4. Creative mode does not offer a survival mode toggle for testing the map.  (Or does it?)  I would have liked some level-editing capabilities for building survival mode levels with enemy placements and NPC dialogue scripting.\n5. Achievements are bad.  An achievement for dying... riiiight. Perhaps the devs should refrain from adding achievements until the game is nearly complete?\n6.  Multiplayer is not available at all and probably will not be available for a long time. (Clarification needed.)\n\nCurious about the game's roadmap?

I don't know the first version on X360 but Evolved, in this Alpha stage, isn't so appealing. Wait until Early Access ends.\n\nWhy i didn't like it so much:\n1- Graphics is the real problem. Low framerate on Good preset (but it's good on Simple, so kind of OK). Models are horrible, especially block ones (like ore deposit boxes, ore extractors, ore refineries etc.). Also still buggy, time by time i see through blocks; can't see distant lands.\n2- Survival mode? What is that? The only survival in-game is hypotermia which doesn't affect your gameplay. You only die and respawn. Ah, and your robot companion needs a power core. That's all.\n3- GUI isn't so useful.\n4- You have to identify every kind of block which i found it as a donkey work.\n5- This game needs small amount of interactive guides imho. Only a small amount of them.\n\nI'd like to make a more solid recommendation but it's unbearable in this state so wait, don't buy it now. This is my last Early Access title, i guess. I'm not a type of feedback guy, so, i shouldn't buy alpha and beta stage games.

Multiplayer is very glitchy, and messes up your inventory, among other things. You can only go a few minutes away from your base because you have to constantly recharge or you'll die. Even worse, the station you start out with can't be moved, so you're stuck in the same area. The ores required to advance in the game are so rare that you die before you can bring them back and recharge. View distance is limited, making it look awful.

There is pretty much little to no content that really keeps it worth while in the current state. I played 1.2 hours of this in survival mode and pretty much just gave up on it because, for one the content that is in survival mode is little to none other then just ore automation and two once you get it all up and running there is nothing to use your precious ores that you have collected and you just feel like you have wasted time. The upgrades in the game are all still in development so you cant really upgrade anything either so you don't really win at all.\n\nOne huge mistake is they went upon development backwards in my opinion! They started the game out as multiplayer and did single player as a add on when they should have focused upon single player which would provide more things to do. Without a good single player core how do you expect to have a good multiplayer? It doesn't really make sense at all to me at least... Which makes me kind of sad cause this game looks like it has a lot of potential but in the current form I really just cant say too much good about it.\n\nPlease Dev's don't give up on this game because of all the hate! Just keep working at it :) If the game gets to a more playable and enjoyable state I will change this review! What we need is more things to craft,upgrade, and just simply do more then building a red and blue house with our buddies.

My suggestion? Buy "Minecraft", instead; if you want straight out building, crafting, and exciting adventures with battles involved, that is your kind of game; and you don't even NEED the most advanced computer hardware, for that one! (And besides which; it's got MODS! Making it MORE fun!)\nWhile this isn't terrible, and the building system DOES have potential, it still needs easier controls, to support easy, quicker building.

Sadly, there is no option of just clicking on your steam friends name and sending an invite.\n\nI ended up spending over 3 hours troubleshooting this error to finally give up in frustration and decided to refund this.   UPNP was enabled on both PC's.  Port 27012 was forwarded in the router and added to the firewall exemptions. I even went as far as to drop all the firewalls and see if that would allow the games to communicate. It did not.\n\nIn this day and age UPNP enabled on both PC's should just work. It doesn't with this game, or at least, doesn't with me.\n\nThrow me in the "computers for dummies crowd" or whatever, but I can say with complete confidence that many titles on Steam and elsewhere have a very smooth multiplayer connection system that works with a few clicks of the mouse. This does not.\n\nWhen I spend more time troubleshooting a games systems than playing the game, it's time for me to move on.\n\nIn summary, right now the multiplayer connection system for this title  is archaic at best. It feels and looks like something I'd play in a Early Access game.\n\nI suppose it could be a good game, and I'd love to revisit this title once they clean up their attempt at multiplayer connectivity.\n\n","February 16","false","1.1"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","4","12","0","3"

The graphic doesn't build up anymore and the keyboard get's disabled. Please don't tell me, it's because my PC is too weak. The game runs allways at 60 FPS, so really no lag at all. Only the graphic doesn't build up. One of my biggest issue is, that there is no playable tutorial at all. It has so many new functions in comparisson with Minecraft, that a player can't know all that. To figure it out, would be probably a very long try and error. If the heavy bugs get solved and a short tutorial get's implemented, I give it another chance. Else I declare the game as dead. -.-'\nI can live with not achieveable achievements, they're a nice add to games, but not necessary. ;)\nBut bad controls and tons of crashes are an absolute no go. :'( (\s/)","May 11, 2015","false","5.5"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

You'll literally have to spend at least 20 hours with hidiously boring grinding to make any form of automation possible.\nIf you want to play a basebuilder that isn't a minecraft clone but is ACTUALLY FUN TO PLAY, dont waste your time with this and go buy "Factorio" instead.\n\nPS: I know this is just in early access, but that is not an excuse for not having actual gameplay.","January 28, 2015","false","19.7"," 27 of 60 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","27","60","0","3"

I've been playing for a few hours now and I find it rather frustrating. Mainly because some of the features just don't make sense and are not well explained and the worst of all: survival you're basically locked to just one world, it's NONSTOP snowy and windy and all you actually hear is the generator's humming and the wind blowing. So not only does the frustration add up, it's basically also very frustrating.\n\nI made the mistake and got my brother a license as well as multiplayer was announced and again... was very disappointed as many features were not included and to date I have not managed to actually get a server running and even if I managed, it basically would only be a creative server. No thanks.\n\nIt doesn't help that the EarlyAccess information box targets a release towards the end of 2014. It's 2015 now and still far away from release. Worse: if you follow the dev's twitter (or twitch) account, you can actually follow him streaming other games. I think I stopped following him after he started playing the borderlands pre-sequel and even gloated about how much he played and streamed recently... at the time mostly borderlands. I wonder at what stage he actually tries to finish the game, rather than playing and streaming other games but his own. Obviously not much, otherwise the game probably would have been finished before the end of 2014 as promised. And I will not go into all the whining he does on Twitch and Twitter how bad money making is via steam and that he could do with a bit more games being sold etc...\n\nSo far, I cannot recommend this game at all if you're interested in the survival part. I cannot talk about the creative part, but then again - it says it's survival... and as that part is certainly by far not close to be finished or any good for that matter.\n\n- world setup basically non-existant (other than free name choice)\n- world setup features that are in with placeholders restrict to things like difficulty, and I think the amount of resources\n- world setup cannot change the world you're landing on, or the weather, so you'll forever be stuck with annoying nonstop wind sounds... snow... cold... and wind... and snow... and wind... if you don't die of hypothermia, you'll either die real-life of boredom or the after-math of a depression\n- it's nice that conveyor-belts etc. are being big announced in the screenschots but what's the point if it doesn't explain how the system works (and that's a big downer in general... many features have no explanation, i.e. research, what gives points, why would you scan things, what's the point... etc.) and for some of the resources I ran back and forth (very repetitive) for an hour and only had enough resources for one item, far away from any automatism... I wonder how some other players managed that.\n\nAnyway, the game has been released December 10th in 2013. It's January 2015 and game is still in EarlyAccess.\n\nThat should answer if you really want to buy this game or not. If you don't believe me, feel free to follow his twitch and twitter accounts. I unfollowed the dev on all platforms shortly after his borderlands streaming, if I could, I would have requested my money back at that point.","January 14, 2015","false","6.1"," 14 of 33 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","14","33","0","1"

Amazing performance compared to that other block-based mining and crafting game, but spoiled by ugly over-the-top design. Visually, it's very confusing in Survival mode, with half your time spent in darkness and the other with snow in your face, not to mention that f***ing robot flying up into your face all the time, all of which makes me itch to hit Alt-F4. The keyboard interface is weak and unintuitive, eg. ESC button takes you to options menu instead of out of your current inventory or interface screen like every other game I've ever played.

I would normally change it as the game improved, but I'm not going to because the developers swarm anyone who posts a negative review. You should avoid buying this game just because it's made by a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who try to shut down any criticism with ad hominem attacks. You're not missing anything anyway. Game's pretty crappy.\n\nOriginal review:\n\nSurvival game is essentially unplayable in it's current state. Multiple menus don't work, large "under construction" images appear in critical places, like say THE INVENTORY. You have to stand exactly 2.5 blocks away from torches or you die. To place a dirt block you have to first find it in a list of 150 items. Critical functions are hidden in multi key commands . Want to progress at all? Better hit alt-M to locate minerals, had to dig that one out of an online guide, along with everything else because the game options menu doesn't even work enough to look at the controls.\n\nIt's an early access game. I get that. What I'm saying may not apply in a few months, but for now, version 1.8, that survivial trailer on the steam page is misleading at best, an outright fabrication at worst.

This happens with no other program and I have throughly tested my memory.\n\nThe menu does not pause the game, so you can die from adjusting settings (especially in the first 5 hours in a world).\n\nYou're in constant peril of death for the first several hours of the game and after patiently strategeicly attempting for almost 12 gameplay hours in a world, I just got to the point of crafting the first 2nd tier item. Survival is frustratingly slow.\nYou start with a single device to smelt ores, and to build another is a 3rd teir build and reportedly among the community takes roughly 30 hours of gameplay to get to. I have more than 20 hours and can still not yet survive going deep enough to *find* T3 resources.\n\nCan very easily jump into a block and see through the level. There is even a four-click method to see through the world reliably at any time you want. Major game breaker.\n\n\nPros:\n\nThe mining is automated for the most part as you grow. Then the smelting becomes automated. Then the building.\nCool system, allows for huge top-end growth.\n\nReally nice voxel graphics.\n\n\nSummary:\n\nThe ore mining/energy/processing is a really cool idea, but this game has screwball glitches, partial graphics failures regularly, inventory failures often, and total system lockups on a healthy computer. Lets be honest, this is a minecraft clone, and not worth the money.","December 30, 2014","false","79.4"," 22 of 50 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","22","50","0","2"

Granted it is still in development so I'm going to forgive a lot of things, but anyhow.\nThis is by all accounts a MineCraft copycat with a few extra features. The graphics aren't nearly as pixelated as minecraft but most of the blocks 'glisten'. though one good feature is the fact that I can copy and paste structures to quickly create buildings and landscapes and the number of block types is also really nice. controls are a bit unresponsive and result in a lot of misplaced blocks. there is also a seemingly infinite range for placing/removing blocks which, while at sometimes is really nice, is actually quite frustrating when you accidentally delete a block on the otherside of your building and have to trudge all the way over there to place it again. FortressCraft Evolved has a lot of potential to be better than MineCraft but at the moment I recomend sticking with MineCraft.","March 26, 2014","false","27.6"," 8 of 21 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","8","21","0","1"

I decided back then to let it mature before buying it. As such I was excited to see it was out of early access and the full release was out.\n\nAs another voxel based survival game this one seperates itself from the pack by focusing more or automation and refinement, matched really only by Factorio (but in 3D!!!). It looks great, at first glance, until I bought the game and played it...\n\nIt played smooth. REAL smooth, in that it was between 150 and 200 FPS. There is an option in the Settings menu to change that, but it didn't do anything. No change whatsoever. So you try restarting the game, and there is still no difference. Now that is a pretty basic thing to set up, so why it doesn't function is beyond me (again, in a full title out of early access). It hogged all my computers resources to keep up with that rediculous update speed. But ow well, let's play on!\n\nSo you start in a tutorial setting, protected from outside influences by a forcefield, which lifts when the tutorial is done. Awesome! The tutorial is short but informative, so even after restarting hundreds of games I can't see much of a speedbump there, and it's practical...Until the shield lifts and a giant spider robot walks over your base, its feet several blocks away from its legs (assuming said legs aren't jerking over it's head).\n\nAt this point I noticed the text at the bottom right of the screen saying Development Build...Okay, probably started a Beta through Steam???...uhm...no...the game is still in beta...and the spider is supposed to be some kind of boss enemy to be encountered later in the game, which was left at the players spawn probably to debug / test.\n\nWhy do I have a Development Build for a game that has been out for 5 / 6 months and without running a Beta?\n\nThis game is not done, and it is out of early access. I concider that seriously disrespectfull towards the customer and a violation of my consumer rights. I don't mind buying a product that isn't finished, as long as you're honest about that and don't play morally and legally questionable games.\n\nIn 10 years of Steam patronage I have never ask for a refund, and to be honest I thought Age Of Survival warranted it, but at least they are honest about the game not being done yet...\n\nEDIT: People don't seem to understand, so to make a bit more clear: I liked this game, I really did, but there is no excuse for selling a game that isn't finished, that is still a 'Developer Build'. The moment we as consumers accept that as 'okay' we collectively accept blatant disregard for our consumer rights and those rights will disappear.\n\nSteam has agreed with my complaint by refunding my payment, so at least I know I'm not entirely wrong by fighting this...","March 1","false","2.5"," 7 of 19 people (37%) found this review helpful","37","7","19","0","15"

So I did, i used super dig, used up all my power, made a HUGE cave from my super dig, and found nothing but rocks....\nThe guies are very unclear about what you need to do, and the machines are very hard to understand, I wish they made like a video about how to get started or something.\nDid I forget to metion that there are few bugs?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DocLazy/recommended/254200/","DocLazy","DocLazy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DocLazy/","156 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nShort version:\nFortressCraft is basically a Minecraft + tech mod clone, minus Minecraft's charm. With a side of difficuilt and awkward to use interface. Plus an extra helping of bugs (even for early access). Not recommended.\n\nLonger version:\nOn startup Fortresscraft greets you with possibly the most detailed and intricate menu ever. This turned out to be a bad omen though as it's also possibly the most difficuilt to use menu ever. Difficuilt to the point of needing a tutorial to navigate. However after much random mouse button mashing I managed to overcome this hurdle and start a new survival world. Alas, I was one of the lucky few. We should spare a moment of thought for all those poor souls who failed to navigate the main menu, and instead flocked to Steam's forum for a solution... on how to use the main menu.\n\nOnce the world had loaded and the ringing in my ears caused by the really LOUD crashing ship passed I came to another hurdle, the help screen. I quickly browsed over the help text and tried taking in as many hotkeys as I could. There are a number of them as the only way to select a tool is with a hotkey. Which you can't rebind.\n\nAfter skimming the help screen I tried to close it by pressing escape, nothing. Tried clicking on stuff, nothing. Only after rolling my face across the keyboard, not once, but twice! Was I finally rid of the cursed help screen. (edit: The escape key sort of works in the latest version)\n\nWith arch-villan help screen defeated I was finally able to take in the world, the very bland world. This is where the clone shows through. Even the block's textures have that familiar MInecraft look, albeit high resolution. All other voxel games have moved away from cubes into their own form of voxels, and all of those new voxel games feel nice and fresh.  So coming back to a cube game can feel a bit underwhelming. Made worse by a world that has nothing going on. It's just snow and the occassional tree. Totally lacking in features that convince you this is an alien world.\n\nThe actual game, in it's current state, is centered around building an automated mining network similar to many Minecraft tech mods where you have mining machines that feed a conveyor of some sort. You then need a power network to run those machines etc.  So far the stuff in game is similar to stuff I've seen in mods. Which isn't a bad thing. Expanding on these ideas could lead to somewhere interesting. But.\n\nAnd it's a big but. This game has a lot strange design features that either take away player agency or are there to ♥♥♥♥ you off. Like the decision to go against the convention of every other game in this genre, and reverse the block breaking and block placing mouse buttons. Those buttons are so ingrained now that I'm constantly wrecking my machines or digging holes when I meant to place a machine, infuriating. Then there is the bizarre inventory mechanic where you can't choose what you put into a machine. The game decides for you and it's pretty much always the wrong choice. So you have to wait around for the machine to finish then hope it chooses the correct material next go around.\n\nFinally the inventory or lack of. The inventory is just for show it lets you know how much of each block you are carrying and that's it. Since it's non-interactive you can't organise it or anything you can usually do with an inventory. The only thing it lets you do is spew blocks everywhere via another hotkey. A number of those blocks will often get lost because of physics bugs. Spewing is the only way to get stuff from your inventory into a storage container. The problem being another container in the vicinity will suck up your block spew. Meaning you need to empty that container then try again. As you imagine can this becomes a real chore, real quick.\n\n","May 1, 2014","false","29.5"," 6 of 17 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","6","17","0","2"

I see this because of some of your responses towards negative reactions and to normal questions, many of these reactions are quite bluntly and in most cases when you get a reaction like that in a store you walk to the next store.\n\nAnd who are your clients ?? ..... I a gamer and beside me hundreds of other gamers. We have not always right but we do have when it comes to our game experiences. Besides, we are not your enemy but an ally (as gamers we want to help you), but we take care of our own brothers (fellow gamers) protects for mistakes we have experiance our selfs.\n\nLast week began Fortress Craft Evolved again, because i got new information and I went deeper into the game. Because when I bought the game a year ago, the game was a disappointed for me and I marked it as not playable - Creative mode was boring for me and i didenn't have a goal and i didden't know there was a survival mode back then.\n\nNow I'm starting over again (I discovered the survival mode) and I try to find some reading matirial on the game, but there where nearly none (there are a number YourTubers). Unfortunately, that is because there is no community behind the game.\n\nHow come there is no community? Then I come back to my beginning, by the failt of communication from you as developers, what result is that gamers have no connection with the game and walk away. Why should I as a gamer take part of a community when the developer think they are better than me?\n\nI also know quite annoing to read bad things of your game, it's your baby, I also know that a bad reaction can hit hard and that the first reaction is to hit hard back in respond to it, but usually that is wrong. I would recommend writing a response, wait a day, after reading your responce like you  get the as customer get the response, throw your reaction away and write a respones you as your customer would like to get. It is all about your customers not about you as a developer/person. Every reaction you get is not an attack on you (exept this one), every reaction is there to make your baby better.\n\nGive customers love you and they give love back but give them hate you get hate back.\n\n\nI also promise to them when I notice that you as developers improve your behavior, my opinion (like many others) wil chance to the better. Because we as gamers want the best game as posable game and a few even better developers, but like the game you are not at your full potential and i feel i have to call you on your bad habbits.","January 6, 2015","false","79.7"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","3","11","0","0"

You can't just step away 10 hours and then have a ♥♥♥♥♥on of ressources, the limited automated storages make sure of that.\n\n\n\nAll in all\n\nI get the feeling that whoever programmed this is potentially a great game designer but shouldn't be the person who pushes out any releases. Have someone that does quality control and treat this as a conceptual prototype. The game lacks an overall control / ui concept and now wants to leave Early Access.","August 30, 2015","false","23.4"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","3","11","0","9"

The graphics are indeed quite good, and there are some improvements over minecraft (Yes, I am comparing this game to MC + Tech mods) including the jetpack, the flashlight and large ore veins.\nBut there's also a bunch of problems which might be because this game left EA too early.\n\nLet's talk about progress. I normally play survival in MC, but in this game I got bored by it. Actually bored, not the casual play-something-else bored. If I want to progress, I need to produce a lot of bars, which means a lot of ore miners and even more power to power my equipment. If I do that I'll attract the attention of mobs. I could run my mining operations at a slower speed, but where's the fun in that? To make matters worse, the base income in ore, metals and power is so low that you REALLY need a lot of everything, for which you need a lot of resources. And you don't have those.\n\nARTHER, that tiny flying thing by your side. I guess having it give you energy is neat, but I don't get how a tiny flying robot has better power cells and solar panels than you do in your space suit. In addition it's supposed to display vital information to you. But you can't really read that if it points away from you, or is sitting inside a wall.\n\nThreat level, while a good idea, is simply not working out. In the very beginning of the game you are not getting attacked because you're not mining/smelting enough to attract any mobs. But once your base evolves, you'll suddenly get multiple waves of wasps every 10 or so minutes. And your turrets don't target mobs immediately, so you need a lot of them.\n\nWasps are the main enemy (before the heavies and bosses appear). But they are only a way to make your base receive damage, they aren't fun to defend against at all. If you build a wall around your base they fly through it, if you shield your CPH they shoot through the wall, they can turn invisible and invincible, etc.\nFortunately there's that big spider robot which is supposed to defend you. Unfortunately it doesn't. When a wave begins it starts walking away and doesn't defend the base. I guess that it is actually heading towards the wasp's spawn location, but I'm not convinced that it does anything once it's there.\n\nFinally, the CPH. It is just an excuse to slow you down. In the beginning you may depend on it, but later on it is just useless. It is called Central Power Hub for no reason, it's like a PTG at 30% efficiency and you can't feed power into it from your power plant. It is the one and only target for wasps, yet it doesn't have any means of defending itself. It fires a beam upward in which you can't build at all, despite having no effect whatsoever (no it's a bad beacon). The worst part is that you can't even move it. Spawned on a hill? Too bad.\n\nThis game would have been very good if you didn't had to constantly defend against wasps.\nOh wait... I can change that :)[imgur.com]\nI had to stop playing or I would have wasted countless hours modifying the game and still not have the fun I was hoping to get through it... progress is still too slow.","January 23","false","28.3"," 4 of 14 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","4","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HiggsBonbon/recommended/254200/","HiggsBonbon","Higgs Bonbon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HiggsBonbon/","94 products in account","Fortresscraft: Evolved is... awkward.\nAlright... where to start? Well, I suppose I should start off by saying I can tell this game takes inspiration from "industrial"-themed Minecraft mods, in that you're setting up production chains and transporting items and mining and all that stuff. The problem is it's only taken inspiration, and pretty much fails in every other regard.\n\nThe good:\nFortresscraft is initially simple and you might have fun for the first hour, but the fun soon stops as the game becomes a parade of annoyances, either due to bad game design, intentional grinding, and a slew of other bullcrap that keeps you from that carrot on a stick; progression.\n\nThe bad:\nNow, you may be wondering, "Higgs, what's so annoying and bad about the game? Look at all the positive reviews!" To that I say; everyone is stupid except me, and you... if you listen to my gripes about this game.\n\nStarting off, the graphics. Now, I might be playing this on an ancient GTX630 graphics card, but that's still no excuse for a game with these sorts of graphics to not be hitting 60FPS, at the very least on low settings. The models are simple and bland, they look like they're out of a PS2 game (a bargain-bin one at that), and the blocky terrain clashes with this. The textures are muddy, dull and needlessly high-res, and have parallax for the most mundane things. The developer seems to have slapped on as many special rendering effects on top of the game to cover up the mediocrity of the art style, to the point that it can be difficult to see when some of the bloom effects or screen overlays do their best to blind you. As a result, the game tends to chug despite the low poly-count.\n\nThe gameplay itself is, to a point, what you'd expect from a Minecraft ripoff. Break and place blocks. Simple enough, if the UIs weren't a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ nightmare to navigate. Every single screen seems to run on a different set of rules, and despite what might seem like a solid framerate your clicking and dragging will be laggy as hell. The focus of the game, the machines, are obnoxiously unexplained; even with the in-game help it either seemed to gloss over the function or rules of things lioke hoppers, which never EVER behaved in the way you wanted them to. I'd be fine with that if I could mine by hand, but you CAN'T. Ore blocks aren't supposed to be broken apparently, and yield junk when you turn your laser onto them. You have to place a grinder thing beside an ore vein, then wait for it to chew through it sluggishly. It's obnoxious and it just doesn't make sense. Even breaking normal blocks manages to be awkward and clunky, they break far too fast and the range for the laser is too far, making digging stairwells a chore when you accidentally dig at more or less than a 45* angle, meaning you have to dig out the ceiling or place blocks to make the stairs smooth again. With the way blocks break in Minecraft, you have far better control over what you're digging, to the point that I find mining to actually be one of the more enjoyable activities even after at least 5 years of playing the game, Fortresscraft's awkwardness just vomits all over that sense of zen that I get.\n\nIt's worth mentioning again that almost nothing is actually given context in the game. Despite dismantling a tree with my laser I can't make planks to make a crate to store all this garbage in my inventory. What do all these over-detailed glowing plants do? Slimes everywehere? Are they bad guys? Sometimes when I'm underground a block decides it hates me and kills me (dying has no consequences outside of respawning, yet another annoyance). Are THOSE bad guys? How do I fight them? I had to go down to -150 meters to find lithium ore, yet the device that beams power underground requires that I already have piles of lithium? Why do I have to nrun back and forth between my power station because there's little option for providing power to underground drills? How many times am I going to get HYPOTHERMIA?\n\nAlso, no pickaxes in the game apart from the logo. That really miffs me for some reason, maybe because I can't mine myself and the machines are frustrating to deal with. Placing conveyor belts is an exasperating chore; they never go the way you want them to the first time, and you'll often need to dig a hole to stand in to get at the right angle to place them up a wall (that doesn't even make SENSE).\n\nThe ugly, ugly, UGLY:\nDid I mention this game is ugly? Holy hell is it ugly. Again, I have to reitterate that the flat, blocky terrain clashes with the semi-detailed models; Minecraft might be ugly too but at least it's a consistent sort of ugly. Every texture is far more detailed than it needs to be, to the point that it looks less like a texture and more like a grey blob at every distance apart from directly in front of your eyes, in which case it's got so much detail it looks almost uncanny valley in a way. The lighting SUCKS, it hurts my eyes. I hate looking at this game.\n\nIn conclusion, if you really, absolutely must play a voxel-based mining game with machines, buy Minecraft and install Technic launcher, there's dozens of well-made and POLISHED mods for you to play, with far more content and without the graphics drain and constant frustrations.","November 15, 2015","false","5.7"," 6 of 20 people (30%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","30","6","20","0","2"

However as a full release, there are some glaring flaws I noticed in just the first hour.\n\nForemost, the tutorial for a game this complicated should continue through the first five hours, lightly stepping in whenever the player encounters a new mechanic to explain it. I spent over an hour in this game trying to do one thing, and one thing only. I wanted to automate power transmission from the main generator to the coal mining drill, and subsequently automate coal transmission from the drill to the generator that burns it. In over an hour, I came no closer to figuring this out than I did watching the video at the top of the page.\n\nSecondly, the crafting system interface needs to be scrapped and redone. Impossible to find crafting requirements without more than a minute of searching through menus and lists, meanwhile 60 percent of the screen is taken up by ridiculous "sci-fi" window borders that do LITERALLY NOTHING AT ALL. If you are going to copy minecraft, at least copy the parts that were user friendly.\n\nThirdly, do you know why blocks take a few seconds to break in minecraft, but appear instantaneously when building? ITS BECAUSE IT WARNS YOU WHEN YOU HAVE ACCIDENTALLY DONE THE WRONG ACTION. I spent more time than I can measure switching from the thing I actually WANTED to build back to BLOCKS OF DIRT just to fill in A HOLE I DIDNT MEAN TO DIG. This is utterly ridiculous.\n\nHOWEVER\n\nThe concept has incredible potential. Adding automation and base defense to a minecraft style operation creates both drama and empowerment, and it would be something I REALLY want to enjoy, but these initial issues with the OBSCENE learning curve, clunky interface, and other oversights overshadow a very good idea. Fix these issues and the game will improve.\n\n2/5","April 23","false","1.1"," 4 of 18 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","4","18","0","6"

Went to main menu, no controls there, had to close the game and start it up and before clicking play change the controls on there.  Fixed what I didn't like, played a bit more, noticed I had a key mapped to multiple actions (Shouldn't it stop me from doing that?).  closed the game reopened to change the controls back to default.  Find there is no reset button to do that.\n\nRedownloaded game, and left the controls normal.  Started a new game, went through tutrial.  still no idea how anything works, or how to collect things (walking over them didn't work all the time).  No idea what the power is for, or how to get more.\n\nWent into creative, no idea how to make conveyor belts or anything in there, none of the blocks I can place are anything but blocks, and all of them float. Glass isn't see through, but there is a rocket window that is.  There are also multipule blocks that are either "Testing" or have no graphic on them, and I couldn't even place TNT.\n\nMaybe I'm missing something, but I couldn't do anything, and there arn't any helpful guides that I found either.\n\nEdit:\n\nUninstalled and reinstalled, started up a new game on the standard settings.  Couldn't finish the tutorial because I died of hypotherma, but did notice a new exctractor thing.  Also when I looked at the big thing in front of me (CPH) and pressed "e" like it said nothing would happen.","April 6","false","0.7"," 3 of 17 people (18%) found this review helpful","18","3","17","0","4"

The default lights in the game are yellow and you cannot change that color unless you buy some DLC. Requested a refund and turned down, because I've played over 2 hours. So my advice watch some youtube videos of people playing the game for 5 hours, full screen and see if the yellow EVERYWHERE bothers you, if not, buy the game and enjoy. Better still, save your money and buy Factorio (not on steam yet) it's basically the same game, but without the awful lighting.

I gave it a shot before and after major updates, and it's just depressingly bad. As soon as I made it through the clunky tutorial, the first thing I see is some random giant robot near spawn with it's limbs freaking out. When I went to investigate, I noticed the "feet" wear moving along the ground with the limbs flying in every direction. There was also no collision box with the entity... Anyways, I just felt like in both cases this game repelled me from any desire to really advance in the tech and get immersed.\n\nIt's also worth noting the lacking visual impact of the intro cinematic.

Every time I tried to do what the game instructed me to do during the tutorial, nothing worked or happened. I was just stuck within a small bubble/force field, trying to figure things out. Then, all of a sudden, it works for no reason at all. About 4 instructions were given, none of which actually taught me how to play the game, and then the tutorial ends and leaves me to learn by myself. I see plenty of potential in this, from the game trailer to gameplay videos, but the learning curve and dynamics, not to mention the graphics, all make the actual gameplay and experience dull down.

I advise to steer clear of the developer because he will just be sarcastic and rude with all his advice and assume you have been watching his twitch for months on end and that you have to know by now what each research unlocks and how to build some of the more complex setups that he cant be bothered to write in the help menu inside the game. after a few months i returned to the game saw some updates and progress and started a new world only to find much of the research had been jumbled up a bit. not a huge issue but when i had asked the dev where certain things were he just said "its in the help menu" well the item was in the help menu but all it told me is what is crafted with the item not how to craft it or unlock it in research... he swore up and down that it wasnt in the lab and that it was researched early on ingame. it was in fact in the lab and using the lab is a hit or miss on getting what you want unless you search the forums....\n\nsearching forums would be great and dandy but the information is not always current like i said he moves things around changes where they go which means an old topic could tell you to research something entirely different and researching in the lab isnt an easy thing that takes a little power and a few moments.\n\n-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-\n\nuntil the ingame help menus actually give helpful information i cant reccomend anyone buy this game and put up with this cranky developer. its still a fun and interesting game and i will continue to play but i cant advise anyone to pay full price for this game. pick it up on sale or spend your money on a better game, also the early rush from EA was a bad move and its really not ready to be sold as a full complete game.","August 23, 2015","false","304.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
