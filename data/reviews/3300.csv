In it, you are presented with a series of maps which have a variety of jewels of different shapes/colors, and can swap any two adjacent tiles in order to get three in a row, which will cause them to disappear and those above them to fall, potentially causing a cascade. Additionally, getting either 4 or 5 in a row will provide special power ups which can also help.\n\nIn addition to the classic "high score" mode, there's a variety of other levels with puzzles where you try to clear the board, etc.\n\nIt holds up well after all this time, and is certainly worth the asking price (or especially a sale price) if you're looking for some classic match-3 fun.","October 6, 2015","true","1.2"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

Swap-three games are not particularly complex, nor should they be, so the question on whether or not a game is good has to more with execution. Bejeweled 2 stands as a healthy compromise between being absolutely bland and having obnoxious amounts of pointless bells and whistles - Bejeweled 1 and 3, respectively. As a result, it's my choice between the three.\n\nBejeweled 2 features four game modes. Classic is one of these modes and functions, in essence as the original game. Puzzle mode plays like a campaign of sorts, makes you think in different ways and is a decent way to burn through a couple hours. Bejeweled on 'endless' is still, to this day, one of the best stress-reducing games I have. Before the days of Steam, it was a great way to pass large blocks of unwanted time. After all of the puzzles, dozens (hundreds?) of action mode games, and the endless wheel filling up at least three times, I wonder just how many hours Steam doesn't know about.\n\nNowadays, the graphics have lost most of their shine and appear pixelated on 1920 x 1080. But the game still does its job - simply, which is more than I can get out of its competitors. It is, as well, why I still play it occasionally, even in 2015. And how can you say no to that 90's music?","March 24, 2015","true","7.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Each Bejeweled is practically the same and delivers the same amount of fun in each. The goal of the game is to switch around a certain amount of jewels to put together a series of 3 or more in a line to make that line or set disappear. The graphics are perfect for the game. The sounds in the game can feel repetitive at times. The overall gameplay of the game is awesome and really burns some time for when you have time to spare. There are endless stages it feels like. Each level of the bejeweled series has its own tricks and treats for you to enjoy. I highly recommend playing these and getting any of these great Bejeweled games when you have a chance. I love playing them and these are highly recommended for anyone working in the office or at home.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/girlkillscomputer/recommended/3300/","girlkillscomputer","Girl Kills Computer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/girlkillscomputer/","158 products in account","I might be a fake casual gamer girl, but I'm a connoisseur of match 3 games since way back in the day.  No shame, no regrets.  Bejeweled 2 was the last of the really great old-school match 3s.  I'll tell you why!\n\nMatch 3 games, at their core, are just about matching and watching the matches, watching stuff fall and maybe cascade into more matches or blowing up and stuff.  It's a simple pleasure, and it's a kind of game that's always fun.  It doesn't require you to be in any kind of special mood, you don't have to not be tired so your reflexes work, you don't have to grind or farm.  It's just matching, and trying to get as far as you can until you can't match anymore, then starting over.  I love hardcore platformers and rpgs and all kinds of other more particular games, but Bejeweled 2 fills the gaps when I don't want to play anything else.\n\nWhat do I mean by "old-school" match 3?  After Bejeweled 2, match 3 games started doing other crazy ♥♥♥♥.  They started letting you slide gems all the way across a line or column instead of forcing a match right next to it, which made these kinds of games way easier.  Just a little bit of challenge is important; this isn't They Bleed Pixels but it needs to not be completely mindless.\n\nGames like Puzzle Quest and its sequels added rpg mechanics, but then you're spending time in menus (i.e., not matching things), and plus the computer cheats in that series and it's very frustrating.  Match 3 games aren't about frustration and menus, they're about matching.\n\nCandy Crush is designed by the devil, and plus it sucks anyway.  Weird, offputting graphics, flat boring sounds, candy gems that fall too slowly and match in strange ways, arenas that aren't a simple square anymore and instead have holes and other ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t going on.  Easily the worst match 3 I've ever seen.\n\nCome back to Bejeweled 2.  If you add it to your collection, you will have something that will never not be fun, forever.  The gems look good, matches sound nice, after a match the gems fall really quickly, nothing about this game is designed to get in the way of just pure matching and watching.  It's very satisfying.\n\nProtips:  Pick a gem type that you're going to ignore as much as possible.  Just don't match them until you have no other options (I like red for this).  Then you always have extra cascades happening from the surplus, and you've got a store of gems to draw on when you feel it getting close to No More Moves.\n\nWhen you make a bomb gem or a clearing dealie (match 4 or 5), resist the urge to use them right away.  They can really help in later stages, when the game isn't being so generous with dropping things in nice orders, to shake loose some more matches.  Just be careful not to accidentally blow up your clearing dealie!  That always sucks.\n\nTry to keep your matches low on the board.  If you match up high, you're eliminating the possibility of cascades from stuff above you getting shuffled around.\n\nThere's some RNG involved.  Part of the reason games went to letting you slide all over the row/column (or like Puzzle and Dragons where you can just put it wherever the ♥♥♥♥ you want) is that after a while, it will become impossible to make matches.  Sometimes you can get really far, sometimes not.  But Bejeweled 2 isn't designed to be played forever.  Just start again if you like, or go do something else.","February 22, 2015","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I personaly think that Bejeweled 2 is better because of the cool music. I recomend this game to people who havent played Bejeweled before even though I started with Bejeweled 3.","September 30, 2015","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
