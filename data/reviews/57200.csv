"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aussiedroid/recommended/57200/","aussiedroid","Aussiedroid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aussiedroid/","744 products in account","Challenges you to think; solving increasingly complex puzzles in three dimensions. Up can be down, and down and be up which can be disorienting from time to time. It does add great depth to the levels & used with strong effect by some excellent level designs.\n\nTen zones with ten puzzle levels in each. I found that the difficulty fluctuated somewhat between zones and levels, sometimes dealing a relatively easy one you complete in mins, to others that had me scratching my head for a long time. Saying this, overall you do still feel the levels gradually get harder as you proceed further through the game relying more on your spatial awareness & reflexes.\n\nBig Picture friendly, the controls are simple to learn and most forgiving (that's not to say you won't fall to your doom a multitude of times regardless lol). Unlike the free movement in Spectraball for example, Puzzle Dimension works off a grid layout, moving you one square at a time in the direction your camera is facing. Each surface may be different though, and you need to calculate their effect into your moves as well as the layout of the level. These increase the complexity (gradually introduced) and includes such modifiers as ice (can't stop on square), fire (can stop, but can't stay long), spikes (jump over) or limited use squares that disintegrate! There are many more.\n\nThe high quality environments have a bit of a surreal feel, with the levels themselves floating in a virtual void. They look great! I would recommend putting v-sync on for those with higher end graphics cards as the game seems to run my card full throttle making it run hot. Sounds have a very 'arcadey' feel to them and are pretty good too.\n\nThere really isn't much that detracted from my experience, although it can get frustrating on some longer and more complex levels to have to start from the very start again (there is no mid-level checkpoints). You almost have to memorise the entire run and practice and practice and practice some more to complete it. Adds to the difficulty, most certainly, but sometimes results in shorter sessions later in the game. Think an easier difficulty with checkpoints on longer/complex levels could help keep more casual puzzle players engaged and progressing through.\n\nAll-in-All, Puzzle Dimension is an underrated title, offering excellent value for the amount of well-designed levels you get. Impressive overall quality from graphics & sound, to menus, to gameplay. Well worth checking out for those who like to flex their mental muscles!\n\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations!","November 28, 2014","true","3.6"," 26 of 26 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","26","26","0","4"

You'll also need to be able to master many different tiles while you get the sunflowers to open the portal on 100 levels. If you think you're the right person for this game, it'll keep you entertained for hours, probably stuck for half an hour on some puzzles, but ultimately feeling a great sense of achievement when the promised "Aha" moments come!\n\nPros:\n100 levels that will keep you entertained for hours\nCustomizable graphics, depending on the theme you pick (fire, ice, forest and water)\nGreat difficulty level--each level may start looking impossible, but you'll pick it up after some trial and error (you should have an explore approach before you actually try to solve it) and, by the way, I didn't use any guides\nNice variety of puzzle experience, since there are many different tiles and level layouts for you to try\nGraphics may seem simple, but I find them really beautiful and there's a nice amount of detail when you take a closer look, like the interaction between the ball and the flowers\nThe BGM is nice and varies from each of the 10 level clusters to the others\nCons:\nThe controls aren't exactly bad, but they're not great either. It will take a while before you get used to them. Also, jumping proved to be annoying at some circumstances, especially when you try to jump vertically, but if the ball was still rolling, it will jump to the side and probably get you killed\nThe point system is unnecessary and only adds some stress level to puzzles that could be just about the eureka moments, not about speed\nAgain on points: there should be a score table somewhere so you can see your points on each level and cluster, instead of making me start the level to find out\nBought on / for: Steam Store for R$ 1,24 (it was US$ 0.74 in the US when I bought it). Divide that by the roughly 13 hours of great fun and you'll find a really nice cost-benefit ratio!","December 3, 2014","true","13.9"," 23 of 24 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","23","24","0","1"

You navigate a ball around various stages picking up things (flowers, in this game's case) in order to move to the next level.\n\nThe levels are all quite smartly made, introducing new concepts and obstacles as you progress through the game in a timely manner. Being able to roll around on more than just the top of some levels is another neat feature from Kula World.\n\nOverall, Puzzle Dimension is one of those nicer puzzle games on the market. Nothing overwhelmingly difficult, but provides enough challenge (and a decent aesthetic for an indie game) to make you feel good about yourself after beating a few levels.\n\nIt's definitely worth getting for the price of £1.99, especially if you enjoyed Kula World.","July 24, 2013","true","2.6"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","18","19","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/57200/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Puzzle Dimension is the first title created by the company Doctor Entertainment. While the company itself might be brand new, the founders have worked on games before such as The Darkness, Riddick, some of the Battlefield games, and Kula World. Puzzle Dimension shares a lot in common with Kula World and those who loved that game, will love Puzzle Dimension.The gameplay for Puzzle Dimension is pretty easy to sum up and like most puzzle games is simply meant to challenge and keep the player focused and challenged.The game has the players controlling a little golden sphere as it rolls around on a 3-D labyrinth trying to collect little flowers and then get to the portal at the end. It sounds simple, but 'dimension' isn't in the title for no reason. As the player moves around on the playing field he will roll up, down, and all around in a crazy gravity defying path. No matter where the player is gravity is always down and as such gravity changes based on where you are.While this makes for some interesting puzzles and engaging environment, it can be a problem at times if you rush due to the camera changing.One of the upsides to Puzzle Dimension that makes it superior to its predecessor Kula World is the removal of the time limit. There is no rush to complete the puzzles other than a high score so people who simply want to focus on thinking ahead and solving the puzzle don't need to feel rushed.Puzzle Dimension mixes up each puzzle by adding different tiles that do different things. Ice tiles cause you to keep rolling until you reach either the edge or a different tile, cracked tiles break after you jump off them, sand tiles force you to jump and make rolling impossible, and many more.Graphically speaking the game is interesting. It's HD and supports 3-D and while the graphics are cool there is only so much you can do when the entire game is a ball rolling around on square tiles. The concept is original though in that before you roll over a tile it is a pixalized low graphic tile, however, upon rolling over the tile it transforms into HD graphics.Puzzle Dimension features one hundred different puzzles to solve which means you will have hours of playtime as you try to solve each puzzle. The game is also relatively cheap meaning tossing down the money for it if you love puzzles should be a no brainer.Overall, Puzzle Dimension is a simple, yet fun and addicting game that most people will enjoy.","December 15, 2014","true","13.4"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","16","16","0","0"

There isn't much can be said about the game's audio asides from that they're top-notch and it kind of reminds me of the audio from Mario games. The visual and audio can be adjusted in the game's option menu.\n\nGameplay\n\nThere are four different themes, the first theme is automatically unlock, but the other three themes are locked; they all required certain amount of flowers in order to unlock them.\n\nThere are roughly hundred unique puzzles to solve. They're divided into ten clusters with ten different unique puzzles to solve. Each of the clusters are locked with a requirement. The requirement is the number of flowers that's needed to unlock them. The first cluster is automatically unlock.\n\nThe developer of this game has given an option to replay any or all of the puzzles for a better score.\n\nThis is a fair warning, there's no reset button in this game, the puzzle will reset itself if an error has been made by the individual. Solving these kinds of puzzles is all about trials and errors. If it doesn't workout then keep trying until it does.\n\nCollecting the sunflowers is the main objective. The amount flowers varies from puzzles to puzzles. The scoring multiplier is connected to how fast the puzzle is completed. The scoring multiplier increases as the game progresses on.\n\nIt's recommended to play through the tutorial to understand how variety of puzzles functions before actually playing them.\n\nThere are twenty-five different achievements to be earned while playing the game. Each of these achievements has certain requirements before they can be unlocked.\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nFinal thoughts, I definitely enjoying playing this game all the way through to the end.

The game adds a new element to each level grouping and trains you to overcome those new variables progressively through the levels. The music is decent, but it can get stuck in your head.\n\nAt a price of $3 (as of 11/05/2015), it's a steal.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lostleader/recommended/57200/","lostleader","lostleader","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lostleader/","179 products in account","Puzzle Dimension was a game I got on a whim because it was on sale for 79 cents. I figure that there really wasn’t much to lose for a puzzle game like this, and much like my other purchases I get for a really low price, I loved it. It’s a really fun puzzle solving game that really twists the way you think about a puzzle. Like 3D chess, Puzzle Dimension requires you to look at all the right angles before pushing forward.\n\nThat’s what I like about puzzle dimension so much, it made me think of other ways to approach a problem. Much of the game relies on camera tricks and thinking in more than one dimension. While the objective is simple, collect all the flowers and leave through the portal, getting there usually isn’t. And while most of the game certainly isn’t as challenging as say Toki Tori, Puzzle Dimension focuses on a different mindset to solve a puzzle. It’s not trying to outwit you, more so it’s making you think differently about solving a problem. While some puzzles in Puzzle Dimension do require a certain order to solve it, if you know how to do all the right tricks and what to leave in and out in order to get to where you want to go, you can solve it however you see fit. As long as you get that marble to the end, it doesn’t matter how many trips you took to get there.\n\nI really don’t have so much complaining, but more of a warning that some puzzles are simply harder than others. While I did the majority of these puzzles without any help, a few select number of them I needed to look up. The game simply didn’t set up a well enough overview for me to see where I was going, and having only a few chances before I messed up again meant I wasn’t always so daring. Such a case could be solved with a rewind button or something like it, but the puzzles were never too trying for that to be a complaint.\n\nAesthetically the game looks beautiful and the music has a nice chip-tune beat too it. The standard settings of the game don’t really ruin the puzzle solving and provide for a better standing of what you are doing. Although a lot of the newer tiles you unlock throughout the game do provide to be far too distracting compared to the first one.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nPuzzle Dimension is a different kind of puzzle game; it’s not really one to challenge your mind as it is to challenge your view on how to solve problems. Aesthetically the game looks great, but when using the non-default skins the game can be a bit more distracting. The game can also be a bit of a trial and error run, but it never gets too mind numbing to turn the game off. Overall Puzzle Dimension was an enjoyable puzzle experience that any fan of the genre should play.","November 10, 2013","true","14.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Do not buy this game.  It is defective and full of graphical glitches.\nPC users - Also not recommended for the fact that this company, Doctor Entertainment, just doesn’t give a crap about anything other than lining their pockets with your money.\n\nSorry for the long read ahead (feel free to skip to the bottom if you don’t have time).  If I am writing a negative review, I’d want people to know exactly why since I don’t do this lightly.\n\nI do not write negative reviews lightly.  In fact, this is my first one and I’ve given Doctor Entertainment more than enough opportunities to address my concerns.  Their lack of care towards maintaining any semblance of customer relations is abysmal.\n\nThis game is full of graphical glitches that makes it near unplayable.  None of the texts are readable and makes the game very unenjoyable to say the least.  As far as I can tell, this seems to be isolated to OSX but I am not the only user affected.\n\nSomeone on the forums had posted about this issue a year ago, in which the only response from the developer at the time was to send an email directly to them.  I reached out to the developer via the provided email and did not hear anything at all for a week.  I then sent a follow-up email that was still polite but more assertive which actually got me a response.  I was assured that there was a real person there and that they would “check with someone about it.”  Another week goes by and….nothing.  I send another follow-up email asking for a status update and also linked them to the forum where more users have recently also reported the same issue.  I urged them to post something on the forum to let people know they actually care and are looking into it, but they couldn’t even be bothered to do that.  This was 2 weeks ago and I haven’t heard from them again.  The bottom line is they’ve known about this glitch for over a year and have made no efforts at all to address the issue let alone fix it.\n\nNow, I understand that some things just won’t get fixed whether it is due to a lack of resources, funds, or whatever.  In that case, most companies would at least offer the option of a refund or an apology.  All I wanted at this point was just to get some sort of a response.  The lack of response is just rude on a personal level, and inexcusable on a professional one.  I do have access to a PC at my house so I could theoretically still play this game, but my experiences with Doctor Entertainment are so sour at this point that I don’t even want to bother.\n\nTLDR:  NOT RECOMMENDED.\nBad glitchy unplayable game with no developer support.  Taking your money is the only interaction with them you’ll get.","July 18, 2014","false","0.3"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","8","16","0","11"

The concept is simple: collect the sunflowers to exit the portal. The different kinds of tiles are logical and are introduced well. The puzzles ramp up in difficulty at a great pace and are never rage-quittingly annoying (at least thus far). The controls are intuitive and responsive.\n\nMy only annoyance is that my Macbook's graphic card doesn't appear support Shader Model 3 even though I purchased my laptop the year the game came out, but luckily it only seems to be affecting the menus, not actual game play.","March 10, 2014","true","5.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The puzzles are mindboggling and each one is both clever and unique. You're goal is simple: traverse the puzzle to collect all the sunflowers and get to the goal without falling infinitely, being spiked, roasted alive, or otherwise incapacitated.\n\nThe game creatively adds new mechanics as the levels get more and more difficult, and each add a whole new level (or should I say, a new set of levels, for each mechanic has its own group of levels focused on intorducing and using it) to the already deep puzzler that it is. The levels complement the mechanics well, and they are all challenging and fun to solve. I've finished about two thirds, and it never stops dropping new ideas and challenges on you.\n\nThe graphics are simple, and they do the job well. There are four options to choose from (all showcased in the trailer), so you can change how the game looks to your liking. In each texture, you can still easily tell the difference between the different types of tiles, even if it does take a little getting used to if you just switched. Music is also quite catchy with a nice retro-ish style to it.\n\nThe biggest issue with this game is the controls. This is a console port, and boy do you know it after a minute of rolling the ball around. Arrow keys for movement, okay. WASD for six-directional camera, I'll live. The jumping however, is very clunky. Once you hit space to jump, you cannot change the direction you are going. This means you have to time your jumps between the time you press an arrow key to the time you roll off the edge of the block. This certainly isn't a dealbreaker, and I stand by my reccomendation wholeheartedly, but this is easily my biggest gripe with the game. That and invisible platforms.\n\nAll in all, Puzzle Dimension is certainly worth the low price of admission, and if you can get it at one of the many times it is on sale, it's a steal. It is easily one of the best puzzle games I have played and one that uses 3-D space in ways most puzzle games don't bother to explore. At the very least try the demo. It will show you if you can stand the controls and how much this game has to offer.","April 29, 2014","true","14.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You're allowed to choose a direction when stationary, not while moving, and are charged with traversing courses filled with varied obstacles while picking up the required sunflowers, which then unlocks a gate through which you must exit to officially solve the puzzle.  Through 100 levels the game builds to some difficulty; only one solution exists where in earlier levels you could wander without worry of destroying your exit path.  And actually, though I said it ends with a challenge, puzzles 96-100 are an easy respite to bow out on, and 90-95 are the hardest.\n\nSimple to learn, difficult to master; good stuff.","August 13, 2014","true","32.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The only timer seems to be for score multipliers. The achievements are very straight forward and do-able, and the game is easy to play without getting boring because the puzzles stay challenging enough.\n\nIf you need a time-waster game that you can turn off whenever you want and not lose a ton of progress though a level, this is a great game to choose.","December 8, 2010","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
