And the most accomplished narrative experiment seen since The Stanley Parable. An unforgettable experience about the necessity of communicating with others to overcome our traumas\nWe currently live immersed in the most creative an eclectic single period in videogame history thanks to the current indie scene. Not only as a consequence of the creation of new game concepts, but also to the revision of genres of the past adding new innovative elements. It’s amazing to think that only in the JRPG influenced genre using 16 bits aesthetics, we have seen in a year interval 5 of the all-time greatest classics in the form of Lisa, Always Sometimes Monsters, Undertale, Hylics and Why Am I Dead At Sea. With each one being a different deviation of the classic structure putting a lot of new ideas to the table. While they maintain some recognizable premises and mechanics to appeal to the players most beloved memories, using the nostalgia as a tool to generate vivid emotions. And most importantly, each of these 5 masterpieces can equal and even surpass the original referenced titles. If we look at the past, we can see that not even in the most creative and fertile period for JRGP games in the mid-90s, we could find a single year with such a sum of instant classics.\n\nBut between all these masterpieces, Lisa, Undertale, Hylics and Always Sometimes Monsters, I think that Why Am I Dead At Sea is a leap forward from the rest. Because it is not only a brilliant and almost perfect JRPG influenced classic with a plethora of charisma in which every second is an immense pleasure, full of magic and unforgettable moments. It’s also a great achievement in its use of an interactive narrative element to create strong emotional ties between characters. With each one being infused with his own and complex psychological behavior. That can evolve based in the affective interactions created with other persons as part of life.\n\nAnd with one of the most mature writings seen in a videogame. Introducing a lot of complex subjects like suicidal motivations, illness, unrequited love, consumerism, third world poverty, psychological reasoning beneath violence, youthful frustrated dreams, lack of communication, isolation, false appearances and the existence of two personalities living inside every single person, the one that he shows to the rest of the world and how he perceives himself. And all of this without forgetting its videogame nature, emphasizing the fun factor with the use of fantastical elements and a lot of winks destined to drawing a joyful smile in our faces.\n\nIts playable mechanic is based on the idea of being the floating spirit of a dead person that needs to reconstruct his memories. So he/she needs to posses the body of the rest of characters in the game to gathering information. This idea on paper looks simple, but has an infinite number of variations and complex sub-mechanics. There is two types of possessions. With one of them, we incarnate the role of the other person, seeing the world from his eyes perspective. And with the second possession, we supplant his body, acting based on our own conscience that is molded by the clues found in the form of saved memories. And finally, we have a mental skill that permits us to trespass the subconscious of a character without taking his body. This mental plane is expressed in the form of a psychedelic alternate reality.\n\nBased in the person or role that we incarnate, every single character in the game will react in a different manner and the subjects of conversation will change. Also, each possessed character has his own special ability. While we incarnate the role of a female writer, we can push a button during a conversation to analyze the psychological motivations of the other character. With a thief, we can see the objects that the other character carries in his pockets. And the special ability of a depressive person is to ingest antidepressant pills, seeing a distorted reality for some seconds.\n\nIn order to be able to possess another person, we need to previously reach a spiritual connection with him. Learning about his feelings, hopes and inner fears. And about his world envision and philosophy of life. To could reach this short of spiritual connection with a character in the game, we are obligated to interact with him using the rest of bodies and personalities until he opens his heart.\n\nWhy Am I Dead At Sea is a piece of interactive fiction that primarily talks about the healing effects of communicating with others as the only manner to overcome our traumas. Under the assumption that no man is a desert island.\n\nThis accomplished use of narrative comes accompanied by an evocative graphic design inspired in Earthbound. An by a captivating soundtrack composed by Bill Kiley, that with a single game has put his name close to some of the most iconic musicians in gaming history, evoking Yasunori Mitsuda or Jake Kaufman most iconic works.\n\nIf you are one of these people obsessed with numbers, I can say that Why Am I Dead At Sea is a perfect 10/10. And my most firm candidate to the Best Game of 2015.\n\n( The writer of this review is not an English native. So you should expect occasional grammar errors.

Salinger, The Catcher in the Rye\n\nWhy Am I Dead At Sea is an underrated gem created by Peltast Software just a year ago. Aside being an incredibly well weaved murder/mystery, it is a unique game that presents the rare opportunity of taking a glimpse on the human nature and the perpetual failure to communicate with one another, keeping unintended secrets while failing to hide things that they intended to hide to begin with. Through associations of the language and the mind, we are to investigate a horrifying affair. You should remember that you can only discover what people do care about the most by taking note on what they do not care about.\n\nOur story starts with a brutal murder; a soul is snatched away from its mortal body before its time. We start as the fragment of this soul, as a piece rendered out of personality due to shock and we remember not a thing about our former mortal identity. Who were we? What happened? Who killed us? With all these ominous questions at mind, we awaken. A young boy medium seemingly managed to help us manifest at the last minute, thus our scarred consciousness has taken form in the cruise ship he's been travelling in as a ghost. We are to wander around, listen to passengers and the crew, and influence their actions by possessing them in hopes of revealing the vile businesses going on in this ship to reach some kind of closure.\n\nThe game manages to present a unique atmosphere with a limited environment. We are in an old cruise ship with 3 floors: the residential floor for passengers, the residential floor for the crew and the deck, alongside utilities and recreational areas. Graphics-wise, it's nothing exceptional, but these limited areas are well used in both in display and story purposes, harboring countless unique details that you may investigate and discover. All characters have their own background music, dominating the game according to your interactions with them - and with your ability of taking a glimpse to their minds, you'll gather uneasy clues about their goals and pasts.\n\nWe are given unique gameplay dynamics and a well written story. All characters involved has complicated personalities, various conflicting motives and secrets to keep depending on their situations. With all parameters involved, Why Am I Dead At Sea may be interpreted as an Agatha Christie novel with supernatural undertone. You are welcome to possess people if you are to grasp a basic understanding about their personalities and motives only - and still then you can only present subconscious suggestions to manipulate their actions. They cannot talk about a subject they have no idea about to begin with! For the full control of people, you should first reveal the fundamental drive that each of them possess. Only then, you can completely control their actions and speak through their mouths. Each character has a unique ability that could become useful in your investigation, including your ghost self. By revealing details of your own past and personality, you are to gradually gather your former self and memories, presenting grander abilities with stronger manifestations. As the story progresses, you'll find yourself in a web of intrigue, lies and misconceptions.\n\nThis whole experience takes 5 chapters to wrap up - 4 investigation chapters and one conclusion chapter - and contains 5 different endings according to your ability to conclude the interrelation of all happenings during the last chapter, presenting you genuine replayability. All said and done, Why Am I Dead At Sea is a noteworthy experience and a thrilling story with more than decent narrative and personality depictions.

Before I start let's state the obvious.  Why am I dead at Sea  is less of a classical game and heavily story focused. But it is a story supported nearly perfectly by its gameplay mechanics. Most time you will read text. If I had to label the game I would probably call it an adventure. Not the ones where you search and combine items but where you acquire and combine information. It is a story about people on a ship.\n\nThe game starts rather unpleasant for the protagonist. He is dead, he doesn't know who he is and he can't remember anything else as well. Why? Most of those questions will be answered over the course of the game. As a ghost you have different abilities, some which you will gain only later on. At the beginning you can read the mind of the people on board. Not word for word but as an overall impression. Later, with learning more about the people on board you will be able to control them, first partially and some completely. This is interesting as a gameplay element because as player you know more than the people you control and you can't ask the right questions because your current character doesn't know what you need. But if you control them completely those characters gain this knowledge for the time. There is for example a brilliant scene where you look up a "locked" place with one of the characters and then confront the same character with another one although he could actually never obtain this information. You also have to regard the relation between the different characters because they are not willing to tell/ask everyone everything. And with the game going on you will learn more and more about the tragic to happen and the people on board.\n\nThe game is divided in different chapters. To complete each chapter there is a certain amount of information needed to be found. But there can be found more than that (especially in the last chapter) which may lead to a different ending.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised by  Why am I dead at Sea  and as such it is the first game I recommand which I have not completed to 100 % at the point of recommandation. I wouldn't call it actually "fun" to play but interesting. It is not the most epic story ever but is surprising at points and the way the gameplay is used to unfold the story is intriguing. So go and buy the game and support the developers. Do not let the game become bundled -_-\n\nPS: If you have any question just ask. I will try to answer them as fast as possible.","December 27, 2015","true","13.8"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","2"

The character sprites felt derivative of a certain console RPG franchise depicted in my profile pic; the chiptune soundtrack suggested a by-the-numbers approach to game design. I am relieved to report that these initial doubts fell by the wayside after only a little play, and surface concerns of this sort disappeared once I submerged myself in the mystery.\n\nThe central conceit is that you're the spirit of someone recently killed, and you can inhabit the bodies of people you know to access their abilities and research the circumstances of your death. If you learn enough about your host, you can take full control, doing things that they wouldn't normally or discussing subjects of which they know nothing. This didn't seem very original in my initial (uncharitable) assessment—Double Fine's "Stacking" treads similar ground. However: "Stacking" is a high-concept artpiece puzzler that I couldn't bring myself to finish. "Why Am I Dead At Sea" is a thriller. It has suspense. It has characters that appear to inhabit straightforward archetypes—and then it challenges you to figure out whether those characters have contradictory depths, or complementary depths, or no depth whatsoever.\n\nI played through it twice in eight hours.\n\nHighly recommended.","January 12","true","8.2"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","12","12","0","0"

Keep that in mind for the review in question.\n\nWhy am I Dead At Sea hits the points it needs to for the genre, as the narrative and interesting characters set a decent backdrop for this murder mystery. Attempting to figure out how you died and taking control of people via possession is a fun mechanic, and there are little touches that really help the game out like characters having their own music, and their own abilities. This does have the old school adventure game logic however: you will get frustrated wondering what is going on and will run around trying to figure out what you missed. And certain bugs can pop up that can halt all progress, which is a problem. But even with that said, it's a great narriative that will help those gamers lookinjgj for a mystery experience.\n\n+:\nGreat narrative and a good set of writing here. Gives you reasons to get into the plot in question and makes you really want to see what happens next.\nCharacter variety is strong and keeps the mystery going, even when a character or two is eliminated as a possible suspect. Backstories help connect you to these characters on an emotional level.\nMusic is appropriate for every character, and really helps bring their mood and emotional state to life.\nGood visuals, and change of scenery when it happens. It's not a big game, but something has changed (in particular the outside), it works rather well.\nGets the mystery portion of the game down without reaching to do it. Doesn't force the element, which is critical in a good mystery plot.-:\nTrial and Error gameplay logic. Keep a notepad with you to write down what you did and didn't do. A couple of tools could have been used to help this in terms of not repeating actions you've done already.\nSome bugs seemingly (this is not CONFIRMED on my side) stop progress entirely.\nSome characters lack of personality change with unveiling of certain items hurts overall connection to characters.\nWish the mind reading mechanic had a tiny bit more use to it. Was fun, but ultimately didn't do much overall.\nFor First Impressions and Gameplay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g27FrJ0yhH8","May 18, 2015","true","11.6"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","12","17","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/recommended/359400/","Humanure","Belphegore","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/","1597 products in account","Why Am I Dead at Sea is an adventure mystery game, wherein you play the role of a ghost who has no recollection of who they are, how they died, or why they were killed. Throughout the game, you are set upon the task of finding out the answer to each of these enigmas, and in doing so you will also learn much about the passengers and crew aboard the ship. I've been waiting almost a year to finally play this title, so needless to say I was hoping that I wouldn't be disappointed; I definitely got a lot more than I expected out of this experience.\n\nThe game plays out like an incredibly gripping novel, and at any point it's overwhelmingly difficult to put it dow for even the briefest moment. You will want to continue playing through until the end, so that you can unravel the questions that were roused from the beginning. You will initially start off by getting to casually know the people aboard the vessel, but as you progress throughout the four chapters you will get to know their most intimate details and innermost thoughts. The character building, and the relationships that are formed between them, are key points to the success of Why Am I Dead at Sea; many of the details that you will learn later on in the game, and especially what lies in wait at the end, will have many players on the Feels train, headed full speed towards Feelsville.\n\nSo as you may be able to determine, the title relies heavily on dialogue. That being said, the actual gameplay is minimal; as a ghost, you are able to possess the other people on the ship, as well as use their unique special abilities. These special abilities range from extremely beneficial, such as Donnovan who can highlight interactive objects, to utterly useless, like Darryl who can walk faster but at the disadvantage of having the screen become disoriented. Needless to say, you probably will not utilize of most of these special abilities, despite possessing the characters multiple times. To fully understand the story, and to uncover your "true" self as the ghost, you will talk to everyone around the ship at least once on every chapter, and at some point you will also be tasked to investigate every room aboard the liner. These are not incredibly daunting or time consuming tasks, as the boat only has three floors and ten passengers.\n\nOnce you get to know a character completely, you are then free to fully possess them; doing so enables new dialogue options to appear at certain stages of the game. Once you reach the end of the fourth and final chapter, you then proceed on to unlock an array of different endings. While the endings are somewhat diversified, there is in fact one true ending in the mix; however, you are still left to piece together, yourself, many of the riddles that the game presents. This is a nice change of pace, versus games that feel the need to explain their outcome in excruciating detail; it also leaves an air of mystery to the title, and one that is open to interpretation.\n\nAs a final note, I will say that the soundtrack by Bill Kiley is an absolute masterpiece. I never found myself getting tired of the amazing retro, Sega Genesis styled bytes that were infiltrating my ears; from the downright creepy, to the dubstep influenced, to the upbeat. The only gripe that I do have is that each letter of dialogue makes a sound, and it overtakes the background tracks. These sounds, however, can be easily bypassed by pressing the action key; although it would be nice to have the option to turn it off completely. It's also worth noting that if you enjoy retro soundtracks, the one for this game can be downloaded for free, or pay what you want, at Bill's Bandcamp page.\n\nWhy Am I Dead at Sea is one of the best mystery games on Steam at this point, and it's unfortunate that it's severely underrated and often bypassed. As of now, this will be the 55th review for this game. The depth of the characters is really where this game shines, without that element, Why Am I Dead at Sea would not be the diamond in the rough that it is. The only way that the experience could've been improved was if the ship was a little larger, and the story a little longer. With talking to everyone, obtaining all of the endings, and earning all of the achievements, I clocked in at a little under 5 hours. Despite the compelling story, I have a hard time recommending this title at the price of $10.99 CAD due to its short length; which is why I waited for a 50% off sale, which for this game is especially rare. If you can get it on sale, grab it without a second thought. Otherwise, it's up to your discretion on whether you want to wait. Either way, Why Am I Dead at Sea is a must play in my books.\n\nRating: 4.0/5.0 - Excellent, highly worth playing.Belphegore's Hell House Reviews (Group)","March 16","true","5.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

I've not really heard of anybody mentioning it, and well, at this moment, it only has 50 reviews!\n\nI would have to say that I would recommend this game to just about anybody that I know. I imagine most people would really enjoy this game - if they truly enjoy story focus, that is.\n\nThe whole premise of the game is to find out what is going down on a supposed "cruise" ship, as you are the ghost of someone who has died while the ship was sailing. Further, you do not even know who you are when the game begins, and you have to find that out as well - however, that question is a lot simpler, and is easy to figure out before the game actually confirms it.\n\nIn order to gain more information, you meet with a kid who seems to be able to communicate with ghosts, who will guide you as you go along. Using his advice, you possess other passengers and have them communicate with others on the ship, or go investigate rooms, attempting to gain any bits of information possible. Of course, you can't just possess someone and have them do crazy actions; your capabilities are limited early on in the game. However, once you learn more about the characters, you seem to be able to channel a stronger connection with them, and can then have them say or ask things that do not fit their normal actions.\n\nAs a whole, that is pretty much the setup of the game. There are a few other things here and there, like each character has a special ability that you can use while possessing them, but for the most part, it is really just to possess, ask questions, and sneak around.\n\nThe story of the game is both really well-done, but at the same time, has some very large cons to it, at least for me. I am going to avoid any spoilers and will be high-level so as to not completely ruin the game, so don't worry. But if you choose to avoid even broad complaints of the plot, skip the next two paragraphs.\n\nIn any case, there was one particular character whom I thought very early on was the problem - but as the game went along, it definitely leads you down different passages of thought, making you question yourself. That in itself is a pro for the story, but my con is that I ended up being correct about my initial thought, and the ending of the story somewhat cheaply threw it together to prove it, based on a singular minor detail.\n\nSimilarly, some background events that happened during the story ended up being connected to something a lot bigger by the end of the game, even though it did not really make sense to me when it happened. Perhaps it is because I played the game across multiple sittings, I don't know... But I just felt like the finale did not set the story up well enough.\n\nEither way, the game has nice graphics and indeed looks Earthbound-style as many people say. I do not remember there being that many distinct songs in the game, but the ones I do remember were definitely nice. My main complaint in this area is that the game did not have a resolution setting to fit my laptop (1600x900), and during certain cutscenes, the screen seemed to get "stuck" and wouldn't re-focus to fit the entire event happening.\n\nThe game is decent length, but could probably be done in one sitting by many people. My time is over 10 hours, but that is both with pause/idle time, as well as collecting the achievements that I didn't obtain by the end of the game. I would probably suggest that you try to do it in one sitting, actually, since it would be more beneficial to keep all of the information fresh in mind. For me, it was 3 sittings across 4 days, I believe, because I did not know how long the game would be and so just played it late in the evenings.\n\nSo go ahead, get the game, set sail on the ship, and find out whodunit!","March 6","true","10.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

Every character has its own personality and motivations (some of them lack of both btw) so is nice to see how different can be one character when talking to two different people. Nothing is as it seems to be at first and the characters will surprise you with their real personalities.\n\nAs I pointed before the idea behind gameplay is cool but its not so well implemented, leaving you several times with no idea of what to do next or letting stuck physically on some points like doors or stairs. Luckily, the set of characters is pretty limited so the same are the options to interact to.\n\nGraphics are pretty simple, but effective. I understand that the main focus of the game relies on narrative rather than any other aspect so it didn't bother me at all. But for the same reason, you can't afford to have narrative inconcruencies in your game, like possess a character and talk about yourself in 3rd person as it wasn't you. (i.eg. with Gwen at the end).\n\nAnother disappointing thing are the endings. Yes, the game has 4 endings but all of them are pretty similar and kind of lame. Plus, some of them overlaps with the others so you can't properly trigger them in order to get some achievements. Even if you try following a guide. It would be great that this thing is corrected in future updates.\n\nAs I sad before the spoiler tag, all endings are similar and none of them have a real conclusion for the main character. That's pretty disappointing. You lead the main role and you don't know what happens to you at the end. I didn't expect a happy ending (you are dead from the very beginning afterall) but I was willing to know more about the captain background and that wasn't the case, leaving you with the feeling that your death was just the excuse for playing the game. The endings leave the story unnecessarily open.\n\nTo sum up, I think it's an interesting proposal and pros overweight the cons but not for the current price. Before buying this try the original Flash game "Why I'm dead" and if you like it buy this game during sale.","February 17","true","20.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Some have been good, some fantastic, some you should never touch, luckily this one's a good one.\n\nPROS:\n*Opinionated but, the art style is great.\n*Multiple Endings. I've only gotten the one so far, but I actually want to go discover the others, which I never do unless the true ending is only unlockable after doing all of the others. This doesn't seem to be the case here, though, it's all based on what all you can discover.\n*Great Soundtrack.\n*Fantastic Story.\n\nCONS:\n*Bugs. Bugs everywhere. Granted I'm writing this a couple days after release, so they may get patched.\n*As much as I like the game's storytelling, getting to that storytelling can be a bit of a hassle sometimes. Even if you listen to everything a person has to say, you may be doing it as the wrong person, and in some cases, it isn't really apparent who the right person is, so you just have to talk to everyone as everyone. There are slight clues tucked away sometimes, but there was a small chunk of the game early on where I just had no idea what I was supposed to do next.\n\n7.5/10 Right now, 8/10 When certain bugs are fixed.","May 13, 2015","true","6.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/359400/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","The Basic Concept: The primary concept of Why Am I Dead At Sea is a simple one – you need to find out what led to your murder aboard a cruise ship. While it’s not a unique concept for a game – a similar title includes Square Enix’s Murdered: Soul Suspect among others. However, I argue that none of the games that I have come across does the concept as well as Peltast Software has…\n\nBrilliant soul jumping mechanic: An important part that the game absolutely nails is the soul jumping mechanic. As a dead spirit you’re able to jump into the souls of the living characters on board the ship. Before you can solve your murder, however, you will have to find the clues and help these other characters solve their own mysteries or complete the quests that they have waiting for you. For example, the first such major quest, has you finding out who stole a family heirloom in the form of a vase. These quests first introduce you to the characters on board the ship then is utilized as a vehicle to enhance character development and to tell the narrative of the game. It was an intelligent design decision that keeps you immersed in the game. This soul jumping mechanic also enables you to read the minds of the characters who you have possessed. In order to take control of a person you must have achieved a spiritual connection with them previously – a further intelligent decision that makes players realize the depths of the story.\n\nSuperlative writing: What suckered me in most wasn’t actually the soul jumping mechanic even though I compliment it highly. Rather, it was the superlative writing. A lot of titles these days claim to be story driven experiences but few are able to maintain such a clarity of focus and achievement as what Patrick McGrath has. To think that this game was designed by just one person is quite remarkable. There is quite a significant amount of depth to the story and it handles a large number of real world issues inside a single game tackling them all with poise and grace beyond McGrath’s years. Each contributes wonderfully to the story without ever distracting the player from the game. A rare achievement.\n\n16-bit and soundtrack mastery: The screenshots of the game tell you exactly what to expect from a graphical standpoint. It’s your traditional 16-bit game. I never had any issues with the graphics, I never found any bugs and do not have anything to say negatively about them. In fact, I would suggest that McGrath has done a very reasonable job in realizing his game world through the utilization of these graphics. Some may argue that this a simple achievement but I am certain that we have all played 16-bit games that have been riddled with annoyances. You will not find that here. The game’s soundtrack has been composed by Bill Kiley from Eugene, Oregon and who has quickly developed a very good reputation in video games. He is currently working on music for Katana Zero which will certainly be a game to keep an eye open for. Kiley is at his very best throughout the entirety of the soundtrack and I would wholeheartedly recommend that you not only purchase this game but the soundtrack as well. Best of all is that you can name your price (no minimum) for the album. You can purchase it here on Kiley’s bandcamp page.\n\nDifficult to criticize: In my opinion there really isn’t much to critique in regards to Why Am I Dead At Sea. If I had to pinpoint anything at all it’s that I found it very simple to accidentally re-talk to a character. This may lead to you replaying the same dialogue that you’ve read multiple times. Although I find this to be a negative there is also a positive in this for those of you who accidentally skip a line of dialogue – which may ultimately prove to be essential to understanding the solution of the story. Otherwise this is a truly special game that has been criminally overlooked.\n\nWhy Am I Dead At Sea is one of the most intelligently crafted games that I have experienced to date. The grace in which important social issues are tackled is astounding. It is sincerely a must play title.\n\nFor more reviews similar to this one and our daily giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/","January 20","true","9.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Story driven games like To the Moon and Last Word are classic examples of narrative over action. You don't need flashy graphics and explosions to make a good game. Dead At Sea captures this in natural style with its supernatural themes. From the moment you begin to play, your immediately entranced. You are given the powers of possession and to read minds and set loose aboard a vessel with a unique ensemble of characters. Someone aboard the vessel is your murderer. Can you find out who? Through conversation, puzzles, and a little bit of trickery. You will guide your ghastly visage in a tale that takes many twists and turns. With multiple endings adding even more layers of complexity to the story. Graphically the game is akin to a darker Earthbound style of avatars. It feels like an RPGMaker style game but is different and unique enough that I appreciate. The music is used quite effectively as the tone of the game shifts. As you possess different characters, enter different rooms, or read minds. I liked this quite a bit. The music gave personality to each of the characters and scenes.\nIn all it was very difficult to find anything really wrong with the game. It's bug free and plays well. The only problem I found was that the momentum of the game was hard to maintain. With little direction given to the player as to what to do next. The goals were sometimes obscure and confusing. Only being made clear by constantly running back to your guide. This caused the game to drag a bit. As I constantly kept having to find the target I needed to possess over and over as they move about the ship. This lead to some frustrating moments. Nonetheless Why Am I Dead At Sea is a fantastic story and a example of how to do story driven game.\n\nI made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!\nhttps://youtu.be/KGSbCC5jDzM\nI hope you enjoy!\nMartyr","June 10, 2015","true","2.0"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

This review being constructive feedback is not because the game is not excellent.  I expected it to be great and it is, there are just a few things I think could make playing it a bit easier.\n\nHaving the full unlock on the characters just essentially double the number of characters I had to control to test all the conversation options.  It would be nice if the characters whom you could share knowledge with, just had that added when you possessed them instead of having two kinds of possession.  Some characters were also unable to start conversations with certain people or open doors when super possessed.\n\nAlso programming the boy to tell us which character we need to talk from, or which character we need to talk to, in order to advance would be very helpful. it was 8x8 conversation testing to see if any of the conversations changed sometimes, and 16x8 with the second possession type, and then another multiplier of like 4 for each dialogue the new content might be in.","May 18, 2015","true","13.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game has so much development and so many curveballs to through.  This games gameplay is everything that is presented in the games trailer, but if you don't know I'll explain.  You play as the ghost of an unkown person who was on a ship so, as said ghost, you get to possess people and use them to interact with other characters, and learn more about their past, find out their purpose on the boat, and gather evadants to find out who killed you.  The controls are perfect and very simple, which is good because what more do you need to do than interact, and possess.  The EARTHBOUND style graphics really make this game feel special for some reason, and every character is presented well through there sprites.\n\nThis games feature's and game mode's are standard.  There is the very enriching and indepth tale that is filled to absolute brim with fun and sad character arks, and lots of moments to pull at your heart strings.  I won't spoil to, to much, but this where I talk about the story, so stop if you wanna keep everything a surprise.  SO.  The characters will never be what they seem like and always are very much the opposite of what you will first perseve them as.  Every chapter is going to shock you, and people are going to die in the story and it will always surpise you who.  Finally the game has a few nods to the original flash game which is kinda cool.\n\nThis is probably one of the best story telling games that I have ever played, and It held my attention to the very end.\nSo I think with what this game offers, I give it a rating of 10/10.","December 18, 2015","true","5.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

Great character development is portrayed in this game. As you get to learn more about what the characters, it also lets you learn new things about yourself  and how you feel emotionally.

For me, at some objectives it took awhile to figure out what to do but eventually I did find solutions. There are times where you may get stuck, and repeat conversations with different characters to see what you missed which can be quite time consuming. Despite that, the storyline is amazing; sometimes humorous, other times really dark and leaves you thinking alot about...idk life and reality.

It's an engaging simple story where you have to use your own initiative, logic and connections to piece together who you are, why you died and who did it.\nI liked this game because it rewards you for paying attention and seems to play out logically. Even at points where I didn't know who to talk to or what to do next I still felt engaged enough to carry on playing because I wanted to know who did it. If you like mysteries and don't mind having to actually piece together a lot of the info without it being expressly pointed out then I really recommend this.\nOn the downside I did encounter two glitches which meant I had to reload and back track, one where my character flew out of the room into the black space and couldn't get back and another early in the game where I accidentally left the cat in Gwen's room blocking her in but it wouldn't let me possess the cat to move it. Of course saving regularly helps to avoid these problems.\nOn the whole though I really enjoyed this and hope they make more :D","January 5","true","14.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

None of them were annoying which is great.\n\nGameplay : I mess up with the controls all the time, especially between actions and possessing, but this is just me I guess.\n\nPlot : a 10/10. I'm a sucker for whodunnits, especially when there are in-depth character backgrounds. I love how it slowly built-up from the first day to the last, how the secrets start to unravel, and how you get to know more about what's going on in each and every person's life.\n\nPuzzles : frustrating but totally worth it! each and every one of them made perfect sense.\n\nOverall : 11/10. This is the first game I ever purchased from this developer, and I heard there's a "Why Am I Dead" before this one, but can't seem to find it. Anyway, will purchase again from them.","November 7, 2015","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

It distinguishes itself from that clear lineage by being very much an adventure game, You, the ghost of a murder victim, spend the game inhabiting members of this 'cruise' ship and talking to each other, trying to figure out why you were killed.\n\nThe game is quite well written, with an intriguing story populated with empathisable and very realisitc characters. Aesthetically it's great, with evocative pixel art (espsecially when you dive into someone's mind) and a fantastic soundtrack. WAIDAS uses its limited scope effectively, with the confines of the ship not feeling constrictive.\n\nOccasionally it can be obscure as to how to progress (this was apparently worse before a recent patch) but it's not especially difficult or full of puzzles. Why Am I Dead At Sea is memorable and interesting enough to warrant a purchase, in my opinion.","November 17, 2015","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"Why am I Dead At Sea" is a wonderful narrative-based game that desperately needs more love. Its influences are clear; Mother 3's art style, Phoenix Wright's murder mysteries and Ghost Trick's possession mechanic..., yet it still manages to stand on its own as a unique and immensely gripping adventure, with plenty of brooding atmosphere to spare. These small 2D characters have more dimension to them than most from AAA releases; they're broken in sympathetic and often relatable ways, and the methods used to convey them show how effective games can be for storytelling.\n\nI do strongly recommend the game despite some faults; a few story details weren't elaborated on as much as I would've liked, even after the 'true' ending. Progression can be a little tedious or obtuse at times, mainly due to having to exhaust dialogue options with every character combination. Also, I did come across a couple of game breaking glitches (usually getting stuck somewhere with the cat), not to mention issues with music cutting out. Hopefully these can be resolved, not deal-breaking due to frequent saves but still something to be aware of.\n\nIf you look at the game's Steamspy sales, its sales numbers are criminally low. Let's change that folks! If anything that you've read on this page sounds appealing to you, I can't recommend "Why am I Dead at Sea" enough.","March 9","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TBDHanasakura/recommended/359400/","TBDHanasakura","Bear","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TBDHanasakura/","74 products in account","For me this game was easily one of the best games I have played through so far and the first game I have felt passionate enough about to write a review for. (I also think I annoyed everybody I live with by discussing where I was in the plot and my suspect pool during Dinner...)\n\nAside from it's quirky pixel artwork style and chiptune soundtrack; I loved how you were able to travel as a "ghost" orb around the ship  and over time became whole again. It made me feel that someone had put a lot of thought into how to show progression in the story in terms of finding out who you were. The Characters are charming, interesting to learn about and I liked how deeply personal the Characters would become the further you progressed into the game.\n\nThe game will keep you guessing who dunnit until the very end. Several times, I was so sure I had figured it out, only to be talking to another passenger and go "Wait, that contradicts what so-so said" or "WHAT. No. Are they implying what I think they are?"\n\nIt's not a scary game as such, but some of the dialogue does catch you off guard and creates a sense of dread and eeriness to the gameplay. Some of the evidence/clues you find in game, don't appear to mean anything early on, but at the end it all clicks into place and shows you exactly what is implied. One noteable example of this is  at the very end of the game, where their "ambiguous job" becomes clear. All through the game I thought nothing of it, until the end when I finally realised what it meant. Ugh...how could they boil it down to that like it was nothing? Ugh...\n\nFor me it's a little bit difficult to heavily criticise the game but I did find one thing that i'd put as a con:  If a Character is standing in the path/blocking a door, you can't just move past them unless you are the "ghost". I found that a tad annoying that I had to wait for them to move, or posess them to move them. When I did this, sometimes the person I needed would run back to another floor and I had to chase after them to get them back!\n\nOverall, I'd definitely reccomend this if you want both a deep meaningful story and thought provoking mystery game with a slight twist.","March 28","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
