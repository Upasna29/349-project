"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ladyoberon/recommended/414920/","ladyoberon","LadyOberon [#GamersRule]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ladyoberon/","2871 products in account","I've spent several hours playing Corgi Warlock, and overall, I have to say that I'm impressed with the game. It's a side-scrolling action platformer with monsters to kill, loot to collect, and upgrades to attain.\n\nThe graphics and soundtrack are good, and the controller mechanics are both consistent and responsive. I enjoy gaming with a controller, and nothing disappoints me more than a game that advertises full controller support but doesn't deliver. Corgi Warlock delivers.\n\nThere are 10 levels to the game, and so far, I've made it to level 7. What I thought at first was a casual gaming experience is actually really quite challenging. The layout of the levels isn't where the challenge comes in, it's the progression of monsters with varying degrees of health coming across the screen at a steadily increasing pace.\n\nThe additon of obstacles such as platforms over water, jumping sharks, and fireballs flying across the screen add unpredictability and the need for quick response time to the mix. As the levels progress, response time gets shorter and shorter while the difficulty increases, meaning that even the most hardcore gamers will find a challenge during the latter portions of the game.\n\nI did experience a few oddities that I want to point out. The first is that killing a coin-dropping monster with a tower in the background results in coins getting stuck in mid-air on the screen. This can be re-created most easily in level 6 or any level where there are step-like platforms leading up to a higher level. The bottom level ends at a gray tower, meaning that you can't advance any further to the right. However, the monsters are coming from the right side of the screen, as well as the left, so if you stand right at the end of the bottom level and shoot, or jump up on a right-side platform and shoot, coins will regularly drop and fly up into the tower, getting stuck on the screen where your character cannot go.\n\nThis brings me to the second oddity, which is that the Steam Overlay doesn't seem to work with this game, and neither does the F12 button for taking screenshots. I wanted to take a screenshot of these trapped coins to publish, but I couldn't figure out how to do this. Neither F12 or the Print Screen button worked for me, and I was unable to use Alt-Tab and snip tool to clip a JPG. Anyone determined to get a screenshot would likely have to clip a frame out of a video streaming session.\n\nOther than those couple of things, which really didn't reduce my enjoyment of the game, overall, I didn't experience anything that would cause me not to recommend the game. It's appropriate for young and casual gamers as well as experienced gamers looking for a challenge.\n\n*This review is featured on the curator page of Review Experts.","May 3","true","14.6"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","11","13","0","0"

But it seems to be missing a lot of those little things that make a videogame whole.  Fireballs just kindof appear out of the end of a tiny spear, for example.  When you pick up coins they just disappear instantly rather than some kind of sparkle.  THings like that.  But I could overlook those things if the gameplay wasn't so basic.  Maybe it's more fun on co-op but I didn't really enjoy it.","December 6, 2015","false","1.4"," 20 of 31 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","20","31","0","0"

The gameplay is repetitive, but the controls and actual gameplay itself isn't that bad and has some good design elements to it. It had some good balance of the skills and cooldowns against the different enemy types, and when it decided to change things up in enemy types, it does lead to some good challenge. It's definitely on the more casual side of the market however, and the game shows some lack of experience in the game design element.\n\nAgain, it's hard, the game is definitely got a niche audience from its combination of its artwork and it's goofy nature. If you're looking for a hardcore challenge, it's not here in the gameplay area. If you're looking for a nice walk in the park, this game can deliver in that area. It's simple, but still enjoyable to some extent. Its not going to set the world on fire.\n\nGameplay Footage and Video Review: https://youtu.be/C8MvjqOyaJo/b]\n\nLists:\n+:\nGreat artwork. You can tell that the artist has worked on Pixar and high quality things before: the artwork sells the game frankly. While there's not a lot of “unique” animations, the artwork is sharp, the design is great.\nTo the artwork portion, despite the resolutions not being selectable, it seems to scale well surprisingly to the screen. I was a bit surprised by that.\nThe cooldown on skills is balanced for what the game is going for.\nControls work perfectly fine on both the controller and the keyboard. Jumps can feel a tiny bit floaty at times, but it's consistent and the amount of jumps you have to make with precision isn't that high up there.\n-:\nToo stretched out. Variety of combat is a bit of a problem, and it shows especially in the boss fights. The content is definitely stretched out over it's run time.\nAnybody looking for complicated mechanics will need to look elsewhere. The game is simple at its very core.\nA lack of options. Actually, there isn't any options at all. I mean, I expect very very basic things at this point, like sound sliders, to make the experience at least adjustable.\nSometimes the background and foreground is hard to tell the difference on, and you go and jump to your death.\nCould have done a better job of involving the “story” into the gameplay/world.\nThe game starts very easy. Has a weird difficulty curve. Does bring the challenge later on.","December 17, 2015","true","2.2"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","13","18","0","2"

It is an amateur attempt, but one with its own charm. It's also fairly easy, so it should be suitable for kids. I picked up the game for US $3.49 (about €3 or £2.3) which is about as much as I'd suggest paying, though if you have a few kids that want to play together, it's worth the normal price of $7.\n\nGoodStraightforward platformer design - nothing tricky or hard to learn.

I must have left it running.\nBad#1 issue: While the game has full keyboard and controller support, you can NOT play with one person on the keyboard and on on the controller.\nGraphics are amateur, but as a mitigating factor, they're also charming and well-done for the price.\nGraphics are often scaled sloppily, resulting in sprites with blurry or pixelated lines.

Do you like warlocks? Have you ever thought about combining them!?!? Well neither  had anyone else. Until now! Corgi Warlock follows the 'epic' quest of Maia the Corgi who is attempting to free the world of the evil forced of the undead rabbit king. Along the road, in this throw away story, Maia and up to three other friends (through local only co-op) must fight through waves and waves of enemies and bosses.\n\nCorgi warlock is a side scrolling... game. It's one that doesn't really fit into any of the current categories. It's most like comparison comes from the old 'Armour Games' that you would play through whatever site your school hadn't managed to block. Things like 'Black Knight' and such where your main aim is just to move to the end of the level in a beat 'em up style but without any of the combat complexity. You start with just a simple fireball and throughout the game unlock more powerful spells. However these spells are really just larger beams that do more damage with a longer cool down and that's about it. There's not much complexity to the combat even with the added special 'Corgi Power' and shields. It's really quite simple.\n\nAny complexity then comes from the sheer variety of monsters in the game. There's a huge number and many of them act very differently. Ultimately the combat comes down to avoiding any projectiles and ensuring that most things are dead before they can reach you. This mostly requires learning monster attack patterns and being able to act accordingly. Most likely as a direct result as this the game is not very hard at all. I died a handful of times at the most and the majority were from missing a platform and falling into the water/lava.\n\nFor a game made by a former animator for Pixar, Sony and Dreamworks that animation is nothing to write home about. Much of it feels quite slow and without much of a flow. What the animations do have however (and the rest of the game for that matter) is character. This game oozes character. From the stylistic choices of the characters and backgrounds, to the dialogue and animation. Every single bit of this game feels somewhere between a Saturday morning cartoon and the old flash games we loved growing up.\n\nAll in all Corgi Warlock isn't great. It's repetitive combat gets boring quickly and it's lack of depth means that whilst it only takes 2-3 hours it starts to outstay its welcome. The Co-op battle arena is fun for a few rounds but again quickly loses its appeal. But if you're looking for a fun little experience you could do far worse than this.\n","December 10, 2015","true","2.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is clearly a labor of love and one that succeeds on many levels, but is a little shallow and repetitive. The game only lasts for a few hours, and that is long enough to keep you entertained while not overstaying it’s welcome.\n\nThe setup is simple, you are Maia, a Corgi dog, who also happens to be a warlock. You need to use magical powers that you pick up along your journey to defeat the evil that has invaded the land. The story is extremely basic and is all conveyed through text blocks. It’s really just a way to move the action forward and never feels forced upon you in anyway.\n\n\nThe story telling is very simple, but never gets in the way.\n\nThe gameplay is also very simple, you move forward through largely linear levels blasting every enemy in your path. You start out with a basic fireball spell, but pick up all sorts of new spells along the way. My favorite spell was a laser beam that is both powerful and capable of hitting multiple enemies… It also sounded really cool. You also get access to a basic shield spell and multiple healing spells throughout the game.\n\nOne major issue I had with the game is the lack of enemy variety. While new enemies are introduced at a steady rate, the variety in their attacks and how they moved is very limited. In my opinion, too many enemies are damage sponges that require you to attack, run, attack, run, and attack until they die. This gets tedious very quickly. That’s not to say the game isn’t challenging, because it is. Some of the boss battles are very tough and mix things up, but unfortunately all the stuff in between gets very repetitive.\n\nThe game offers four player local co-op where the other players take control of either a pug dog, a pig, or a fish. I was unable to try out the co-op mode for myself, so I am not sure if the difficulty scales based on the number of players or if stays the same. I can see how it would be fun to get some family members or friends together to blast through this game. It has a similar look and feel to Castle Crashers, which is another great co-op experience.\n\n\nThe game looks great!\n\nThis game’s art style really shines for me. The game looks deliberately hand-draw, with thick lines like a cartoon. The characters and enemies all look unique with some fantastic facial expressions. It also runs smooth for the most part. I will say that the background seems to move and animate more smoothly than Maia, so sometimes when jumping or moving forward it can feel like the game is stuttering. The developer has been good about releasing updates since launch, so maybe this will be addressed in a patch. Chances are you won’t notice it, but I felt like I had to mention it. Other than that everything looks and plays very well.\n\nI do want to mention the music and specifically the main theme. It reminded be a lot of the Minecraft theme music and that is a good thing. It is appropriately whimsical and relaxing; very enjoyable.\n\nIf you don’t expect the world from Corgi Warlock you won’t be disappointed. The game is a fun romp that lasts just as long as it needs to and seems like it would be a blast to play co-op. While there are a few issues with enemy design and repetition, it is hard to complain too much at this price point.\n\nCorgi Warlock is currently 50% off on Steam right now for the remainder of the Steam Winter Sale. I’d recommend you grab it now if you’re interested.\n\nA code was provided for the purposes of this review.","January 8","true","2.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hunterbond/recommended/414920/","Hunterbond","BondHunterBond","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hunterbond/","168 products in account","I really wanted to love you, Corgi Warlock. I like goofy games with flash art that looks like it was drawn by someone who played a ton of games from The Behemoth. Even when a game lacks overall polish but has a lot of heart I’m often ready to defend its merits to anyone who wants to point out its shortcomings. Sadly I don’t think our romance was meant to be.\n\nCorgi Warlock’s gameplay is a variation of the standard side-scrolling brawler, except unlike many of these games with horizontal and limited depth movement field, Corgi Warlock’s enemies all attack in a single-file line. Because of this, the player has only the option of jumping from the ground to have any variation in position. The game is designed to support play for up to four players, though this is local multiplayer only as of the time of this article’s publication.\n\nThe player will fight wave, after wave, after wave of identical mooks, and then possibly more waves of functionally identical but reskinned mooks after that. Once you have survived these waves you will fight a mini-boss, which is generally a larger mook with a health bar to tell you that you’ll have to hit them more than just once to get the job done. Don’t worry, most of the mini bosses stand stock-still and assault you with no more than three variations of their attack, in a cycle, forever. Should you survive the mini-bosses you’ll probably kill a flying enemy or two that have been tossed in for fun, and by fun I mean totally randomly for no discernible reason before running into an open doorway at the end of the level that automatically teleports you away once you’re over it, ending the level.\n\nEach section of the game is broken into multiple sub-levels leading up to the final confrontation with the Level Boss. Between the sub-levels, the magical transport doors will take you to a town where the NPCs will shout dialog at you as you pass that doesn’t really affect the game at all. There is also a store, which is a fancy way of saying that text floats above orbs you can grab if you’ve murdered enough mooks to get gold, which you have, because otherwise you’d have died because you can’t avoid combat. Neat, right?\n\nAt the very end you’ll battle the Level Boss, which you can tell is happening because you’ll door-port into a room with a big sprite that attempts to murder you. Just a little though, all the bosses in Corgi Warlock are unable to move, and like the mini-bosses, limited to the same three-variation attack cycle. This makes defeating them more of an exercise in timing and pattern recognition than it is a challenge.\n\nOverall, Corgi Warlock suffers from some serious limitations because of the way it was designed. According to the developer’s blog the game was created in Construct 2, which is a game creation engine that allows code-free game building. As with most ready-made engines, you have to work around the limits imposed by the simple options if you want any hope of having a game that isn’t brought down by them, and Corgi Warlock just isn’t up to the task.\n\nFor a game from a single person, and what seems to be a freshman effort, I think it could have been a lot worse, but I don’t think it was ready to be on Steam Greenlight. This feels like it would have fit right into the throngs of free flash games on sites like Newgrounds in the mid-2000s, where its lack of polish and variation would have been so much more forgivable.\n\nReview originally written for http://press2reset.com/reviews/review-corgi-warlock/","March 1","false","1.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Despite its tags, it is local only. I bought copies for myself and friends to play only for us to discover we can't. The game is also extremely loud, has no options menu and does not play well with dual monitors. This is the first game I have bought on Steam that I will be returning, not because it is horrible, but because it lacks basic features and I don't like being lied to about the game's capabilities.","January 2","false","0.2"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","38","3","8","2","2"
