"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/308580/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2973 products in account","Orborun is a game that requires skill. It’s a game that can easily be picked up and played for a couple of minutes but it can also be played for hours on end. The kind of game anyone can enjoy. It’s a game about a running (and rolling; or vice versa) robot and your goal is to set the best time and have the highest score.\n\nThis isn’t one of those puzzle games that desperately feels like it has to tell you a story just in order to make sense of it all. The game has several modes - Haste, Puzzle and Hazard – and each mode seems to have 15 levels. A new category will unlock as soon as you finish one of these. So finishing Haste will unlock Haste 2, which has more obstacles and is generally more difficult. As you probably would’ve guessed already each mode is focused on something specific. So Haste focuses on speed, Puzzle focuses on getting as many points as possible while sometimes figuring out where to go and by flipping switches and Hazard is focused on avoiding obstacles and falling down holes. Of course, your main goal is to still set the best time and score.\nOverall the levels are enjoyable and require good skills and timing. Finishing a level will also earn you coins that can be used in the in-game store to buy cosmetic items for your robot.\n\nThe game gradually introduces some new objects every few levels like ramps, walls and portals.\nIt makes the game more interesting and difficult at the same time. The camera does get in the way of the action sometimes and I think it would’ve helped if it was placed just a tad higher.\nCollision detection is also a bit flaky; some of the levels require that you bounce off of walls in order to make a left or right, but bouncing straight into the wall will reset you to the last checkpoint. Confusing and frustrating. So you have to move slightly to the left/right before crashing into it. I understand that the robot isn’t built for high speed crashes but if you implement a mechanic like this you have to ignore these kinds of things if you ask me.\nThe game also doesn’t always register when you pick up (collide with) an item. I’ve had several times that I was 100% sure I picked something up but the game didn’t process it. For me it’s not that big of a deal but if you want to set the high score then it most certainly is.\n\nGraphics wise the game is simple. Simple but pretty. The robot is well animated and textured, and the way it morphs into a ball (or the other way around) will look good and cool to anyone who likes Transformers.\nThe level design on the other hand is a bit uninspired. The level is set in a gigantic cube with lots of platforms and each of the game’s categories has one primary color. Haste uses a lot of blue colors, Puzzle has an orange colored look and Hazard uses a good amount of green. It’s certainly distinctive.\nBut then again, the colors aren’t the problem; it’s the fact that the levels feel a bit empty. There’s nothing happening in the background. You can argue with me here and tell me that this is for serious gamers that don’t want to be distracted, but then I’d say that any serious gamer could probably look past those things. I don’t want to see a level full with animated stuff, but a few things wouldn’t have hurt.\nThe soundtrack is electronic and it usually has a good, solid beat. You’ll probably have heard all of it after just a few levels, but I guess most of you won’t even notice because you’ll be too focused on finishing a level. The sounds effects are kept to a minimum and can usually only be heard by collecting items, or by the occasional crash into an object (which is rare).\n\nOrborun isn’t a very long game. A level usually takes less than a minute to complete. If you can complete it in one turn, that is. A lot of the levels will definitely take a few tries in order to complete them and if you’re a true completionist than it will take you many tries more. Since there are 6 categories consisting on 15 levels each the game should take you at least 90 minutes to complete. And that’s a best case scenario. I think you should add at least a couple of hours more if you want to be truly accurate. And afterwards there are still the Bonus levels to be completed. So all in all there’s a good amount of value to be found here.\n\nOrborun doesn’t really reinvent the wheel  but what’s there is (mostly) solid, and fun. Sure, there’s always room for improvement but anyone looking for a game to set a new record (time and/or points) will have a blast with this one.\n\n[Rating: 75/100]","September 5, 2014","true","3.3"," 36 of 43 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","36","43","0","0"

It's pretty well done and I really like some of the levels. The game is challenging, especially the hazard levels are hard.\nBeat the game after a little bit more than 4 hours. I'm now aiming for 100% at the Haste and Puzzle Levels. Hazard is mechanically impossible for me, as i'm always struggling at hazard.\nI recommend to use a gamepad, it is possible to play with keyboard but in my opinion it's harder.\nSo if you are searching a new game, which is a little challenging, definitely give it a try.\nThe graphics are good, the game is running fluently even on my crappy laptop. The levels are designed well.\nThe music is ok. I'm just tired of it. The sound is also okish. It's is rather annoying. This is my personal opinion though.\nThe only thing is that the game does overall slow down my laptop a little, which shouldn't be a problem because as I mentioned, I do play on a crappy laptop.\nI also apologize for typos, english isn't my native language :D\n\nStory Time\nWHERE'S MY PRINCESS?\n\nMy friend is currently struggling at level 9 at hazard 1. You should hear him at skype. He's complaining about the "story" of the game. He wants to rescue his princess so badly. "WO ISCH MINI PRINZESSIN?" (Where's my princess in swiss german). So I beg to you, please add a princess to the game, which the mighty hero orbo needs to rescue.","May 27, 2015","true","9.9"," 29 of 32 people (91%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","91","29","32","10","0"

People calling this the Super Meat Boy of rolling games, and I don't think I could put it any better than that. You're going to get angry, you're going to wail in the agony of defeat, you're going to bask in your victories, and you are going to hammer that retry button until there's a hole in your screen. It's hard to find anything bad to say about the game apart from the control option showing up so often and slightly uninspired visual/audio design. If that all sounds great to you, give Orborun a little of your attention, it's dying to meet you.","July 29, 2015","true","1.4"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","15","20","0","0"

The music is generic and obnoxious, for starters. I feel like I have heard these songs in other games. The graphics are about the only thing here that looks decent, but they're simple and kind of samey.\n\nAnyways, gameplay-wise... what the hell. You simply cannot demand precision from a player when 1. rarely is indication of what you're supposed to do given 2. the controls are loose and imprecise, heavily physics-based. The first two worlds are decent if rather mediocre, but I gave up in the first hazard world because the game was demanding something and I had no clue what it was asking, and doing anything other than what it was asking kept getting me killed.\n\nThe levels are short but there's a lives system, which is 1. an instant mark-down in 2015, jesus christ guys, seriously? 2. Almost pointless due to level length. For some reason you're always moving forward, just like, natural movement, so you can only steer left and right which makes correcting mistakes basically impossible, and it's easy to make mistakes with how loose the controls are.\n\nThe scoring system is broken as heck, it actually encourages dying to get a better score because points don't reset when you die. Doesn't seem to have any reward for scoring 3 stars though so I never bothered.\n\nThis game isn't very fun and isn't particularly worth your time. I got it free, which is about what it's worth. It does nothing other games haven't done better.","December 12, 2015","false","0.7"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

The controls are surprisingly sluggish for a game that requires a good amount of precision.  Also, there is a wall-bouncing mechanic that is infuriating.  If you don't hit a wall at just the right angle, you simply die instead of bouncing off it.  This sounds like fairly common sense, but the way it's implemented with slow turning in the game doesn't work well.","September 9, 2014","false","0.6"," 25 of 41 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","25","41","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/recommended/308580/","fandango89","Apparently Kid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/","599 products in account","4.5/10\n\nKind of like a marble endless runner mixed with speedrun. The game is somewhat fun at first. The problems is with the mechanics and control. You always move at full speed and instead of having a jump, or slow down, or any sort of control, you don't. This means many times you won't be able to make a turn, or do anything, if you aren't in the perfect position. This is also due to the terrible slow turning radius which is equal to that of a semi-truck. Since you auto lose in certain parts because you didn't come in perfectly, the game is less about reaction time, and making good decisions on the fly, and memorizing the entire level and doing it over and over. This is also because every part has instant kill walls and jumps, meaning you start the level over again. All the levels look and feel basically the exact same, and more variety would be nice. Many marble games provide good control, while this game takes it away. If you ever lose momentum or anything your ball will not be able to make jumps. Half the time your ball just breaks, which is annoying if you bump the side of the platform, or with any boxes or walls that slow you down.\n\nSome parts require you to run into walls but for some reason if you take the perfect angle your guy won't be destroyed. Many parts that flip the screen around and have you jumping from thing to thing or going upside down, its hard to staty focused and keep track of where you should be moving, which causes another problem with the trial and error gameplay rather than the skill based gameplay. Some parts you have no idea where to go next but since you cant stop or anything you just die. Other parts if you don't hit the jump perfectly you will automatically die or miss it. Other parts require you to turn way too sharply and quickly for what the game affords. Go get "influx" for ball rolling or something like audiosurf or endless runner for that type of game, this is a combination of the two that loses the best of both worlds.","September 21, 2015","false","0.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

I absolutely hate writing negative reviews.\n2. I got this in a bundle for next to nothing, and still feel like I got ripped off.\nGames of this type generally aren't my style, but I very rarely feel the need to write a negative review even with that being said. The graphics, while somewhat bland, are fine. I wouldn't say they're fantastic, but definitely acceptable. Now that we've got the good stuff out of the way, let's get to the rest of the game. You control everything with two buttons. Just the right and left arrow keys. This game needs far more precision than these controls offer. (I played before writing this review with an Xbox 360 controller, and I will say it was better than without the controller. Definitely. However, the controls were still sloppy at best, and attempting to correct any mistakes is almost certainly fatal.), The levels look all pretty much the same, and it gets very tiresome. The levels are also all very short, but despite this they have a lives system? This honestly makes no sense to me, and half the time you'll respawn in a spot where it's literally  impossible  to avoid dying. The music is also incredibly generic, and in my opinion very annoying. I also didn't find the levels to be particularly challenging, and when it was it was simply do to s***** controls. I tried to put more game time into this before writing a review, but I literally couldn't force myself to do it any longer than half an hour.\n\nPROS:\nDecent graphics\nController support\nCONS:\nHorrible, sloppy controls\nGeneric, irritating music\nLevels grow very repetitive\nLittle instruction as to what your objective is\nAn overall, generally unenjoyable game\nAs much as I personally disliked this game, and cannot in good conscience recommend it, I do hope the developers continue to make more games. With more effort and practice, I'm sure they could make something great!

There are not many PC games like it.\n\nCons:\n- Obviously meant to be on mobile phone.\n- Without a Gamepad, you are limiting yourself by using the keyboard. The Gamepad is just way easier to use.\n- Can be very repetitive if you go with the flow, and don't mix it up.\n- Very Challenging, can be a pro or con.\n- If you're not skilled, and not determined, you can EASILY get super frustrated and stop playing after only 1 hour.\n- It takes "Hard" To a whole nother level, they clearly made this game knowing it had to be hard, but they went as far as making you hit 1 specific spot, at the exact right angle, or else you fail.  Hard is good, near impossible is not.\n- Very limited options in menu screen.\n- Makes you collect coins, but you can't do anything with them, and they dissapear forever after you beat the level.\n\nOverall, yes. I recommend playing this game, but I was very close to deciding no, If there was an imbetween button, i'd press that. Like I said, this game is only appealing to a certain group of people. I suggest waiting to buy it on sale.","September 22, 2015","true","2.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Within the levels are various obstacles and paths that block you from going to the end. The level design isn't that bad and the courses are sometimes challenging. However, they are limited and they get repetitive very fast. The controls are fine (?) but simple and the soundtrack is just 2 tracks which play when the other one finishes.\n\nJust keep in mind that it is an iOS port and you can still see the micro transactions button. Due to that, the controls are simple and there isn't much you can do. The emphasis is on getting the most amount of points with the fastest time. That’s where the game shines because there are various paths to take and if you are into scores, go right ahead.\n\nThere are a few issues with the checkpoints where it will spawn you in a way that you will just die again. Additionally, there are bugs which didn't reset the level when I died making it impossible to progress unless I did it in one try and ♥♥♥♥ that noise. The camera also needs work when you go through loops because you don’t know exactly when the controls are inverted.\n\nOverall, it’s ok? If you are bored and a few bucks, spend it. However, for 5 bucks, you can buy a lot better games.","April 5, 2015","true","3.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

For the most part, there's not much to complain about; it controls well, has great level design, and looks pretty good for what I believe is a mobile port. The only problems I have with it are some design flaws.\n\nThe main one being that if your momentum is ever completely stopped, you auto-reset to the last checkpoint. This is where part of the infuriation stems from. Many of the levels require you to hit into walls to slow you down, and if you don't hit at the correct angle, it's back to the checkpoint. And if you don't hit a warp or end portal dead-on? Also back to the checkpoint.\n\nThat brings me the next problem: the checkpoints are often bafflingly placed, and if you happen to trigger one as you're about to fall off the stage, you'll have no option but to restart the level, because it places you back exactly as you were when you triggered the checkpoint. The final problem I have with it, is that it actually pays to die a few times before you complete a level; all of the pickups reset, but your score doesn't. So you can get 3 star ratings on most levels simply by playing poorly.\n\nFor the current price of 'free' over at Indiegala, it's a no-brainer to at least try this game out. It may be frustrating at times, but it never feels impossible, and it's a rewarding experience to finally make it through a particularly tough level.","July 29, 2015","true","4.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The 3 different modes allow for diverse gameplay. "Haste" is mostly easy to finish but hard perfecting your time. "Puzzle" will require you to combine the speed with some thinking. "Hazard" reminds of a skill platformer in the 3D world, comparable to the trickier maps of Trackmania (or some 2D skill platformers around). The levels might lead to one or another rage quit when you mess them up just at the end. Since they aren't too long individually and there's an instant restart option you can however try again and again and again ... Sometimes you stop rolling and start running, and it feels like the character controls slightly different than when rolling. I still don't know what triggers that or if it's just built into the level.\n\nMusic is ok. Local multiplayer is provided as split screen allowing up to 4 players to play the map at the same time which might actually be nice if you have friends over. Gamepad worked, but can probably be played with a keyboard too since most of the time you will want to go as sharp as possible.\n\nRuns smoothly at 60fps. Graphics are simple, nice and clean.\n\nPS: Looping control is a bit fiddly, you need to change button just at the right moment. Control as a whole gets pushed to or over the limits in the trickier hazard levels and since you can't always see where you're going guessing or learning the course by heart is required.","September 5, 2014","true","1.6"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

There are no audio sliders (only toggles) and the keys can't be rebound...luckily, there aren't that many controls to worry about.  The game runs on the Unity engine, so you'll be able to adjust screen resolution & graphics quality as well as toggle fullscreen via a pop-up at launch.  I tested both ends of the graphics quality settings and didn't notice a difference, which was odd.  The game does award you with coins to unlock new skins and bots, but there's admitedly not a lot of toys to choose from.  I'd recommend "Orborun" to those who enjoy being perfectionists and wouldn't mind playing levels over and over again to get the perfect "run".   It's not something I'd personally play over the long haul, but for price it's asking, there's a lot of content and play time to be had.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtrPaMCkxyA","September 5, 2014","true","0.4"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

It has a nice presentation to it and it's fun to play.\n\nPros:\n\n- Nice graphics\n- Cool character(s)\n- Interesting puzzles and modes\n- Precise and intriguing gameplay\n\nCons:\n\n- Camera pans down at the start, which may put you off when you need to see something ahead of you.\n- Spawn locations can be cheap and may make you die a few more times until you reset or adjust yourself quickly.\n- Sometimes the game allows you to fall off and watch, other times it instantly brings you back.

First level: press A or <- to go left. A few seconds later, as if it wasn't already obvious enough, press D or -> to go right. It's on the first level, fair enough there are some idiots who would probably complain that it doesn't explain or something, but it comes up every now and then, pausing you in the middle of a run to explain to you the umpteenth time.\n\nThe music isn't all that great in my opinion, it's somewhat repetitive and boring, much like the gameplay.\n\nThe worst offender is, "free coins for liking us on all our social media channels". I'll tolerate this on free games (A free game I would recommend is Eternal Senia, who does this, but for items you can get from grinding anyway), but any game that does it after charging money gets an instant negative review from me.

Its not a game with a massive story to it, its not insanely indepth, its a fun party game and its fun. Half the fun is yelling at the screen that you didn't complete the level within the amount of lives you're given. Have to say though, that the checkpoints should be removed as they sort of spoil the achievement of getting through the level.\n\nBest played with 2 or more people, you can play with up to 4 (including yourself).\n\nIt works well with in-home streaming from steam, and it works with my usb controllers too, so it can be used with them.\n\nIts not got 100hrs of content, but it sure as hell can keep you occupied for a hour or two when you need something to do, especially if you've got company and wanna play a laid back game. (Levels are prettie quick, so you can pick up and leave whenever you want without consequences.\n\nYou can buy new skins for your orb ingame with currency you earn from doing levels, extremely easy to unlock when you play multiplayer.","June 5","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
