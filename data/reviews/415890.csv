The game is fairly well-done except for some problems currently existing. I will add a TL;DR at the end.\n\nGameplay\nCrystal Picnic is an RPG designed with colourful creatures and interesting characters. You start off as Egbert a kind-hearted and pure Duck who has been trying to join the Royal Guard for quite some time now unsuccessfully, and he is with his good friend Frogbert, a common gardener who helps his friend. You are near the castle when all of a sudden ants dig out and walk right on by with crystals from the castle, which begins the main plot of the storyline.\n\nControl-wise the game is fairly simple, however do note that the controls are not actually introduced to you at first. This makes it so that depending on how you play (Controller/Keyboard) you will have to do a bit of a guessing game. The combat portion of the game is not like most RPG games with a turn-based mechanic, but rather has a real-time combat situation where you and your computer controlled companions will fight against whatever you come across. The combat is not bad at all, however the programming of your companions is another story. What would usually happen is that I would fight and my companion would end up running into the enemies usually getting themselves injured or killed. It became a tad bit frustrating and I would prefer it there was an option to not include them in combat (You would fight independently and if you fall you can come back as your companion to help minimize the mistakes a CPU is capable of making). The game also has a nice mini-game of whack-a-skunk and overall is a very playful and nice environment. The maps however can get a tad bit large and annoying to traverse especially with the ability I can always slip over a banana and get attacked by one group, then another, and one more just in case. Once you are able to grasp the controls nicely this becomes quite a relaxing and enjoyable experience for the more casual gamers, and the story is just a tad silly.\n\nGraphics/Sound\nFor an pixelated RPG the graphics are rather impressive and overall polished for the characters and level design. Very reminiscent of the older days of gaming when it all started to develop. The music in this game is superb and I honestly loved it, it was perfect for the game and was able to make a very relaxing experience and improve the game's overall quality. The only problem is I'd like an option to disable all other sounds except the music at some points so I can just listen while playing.\n\n\nPros/Cons\nPros\n\n+ Very polished Graphically\n+ Fun style of combat\n+ Good relationship between Egbert and Forgbert making an authentic feeling of friendship between the two\n+ Music is beautifully relaxing\n+ Not hard\n\nCons\n\n- No introduction to controls\n- Random combats can become annoying when you get caught in a loop of more than one battle with no time to even move\n- No sort of map system or assistance with objectives\n- Problem where to consume the potion/item you want you have to first use whatever item is first then you can select the item you want\n- No options menu\n\nSuggestions\nThese are suggestion that I feel should be added to the game to polish it and make it more enjoyable\n\n- Quick introduction to controls at the begging or an options menu where you can see the controls\n- Option to fight independently in combat so you don't have to worry about your companion\n- An objective assister or local map which can help guide you\n\nFinal Thoughts\nCrystal Picnic has overall done a good job expect for the problems which have already been listed. I was able to enjoy my time playing this even with the little snips that gave me a bit of rage. The music always helped me to relax into this game and I honestly love Egbert and Frogbert's relationship, truly enjoyable there. The storyline was quite silly in my opinion, but I was a duck trying for the royal guard and whose best friends was a frog. Overall yeah I'd say this game was worth my time and be for a more casual gamer who simply want's to relax and enjoy something silly (I especially love the "The Accused" achievement showing the developers have a sense of humor).\n\nTL;DR\nAlthough an enjoyable experience, Crystal Picnic has its fair share of issues. The most annoying being that there is no introduction to the controls. The game succeeds in its goal of feeling like a classic RPG from the simpler time of the gaming industry. The soundtracks helps to fully immerse you into the game and overall is one of the things I was able to love about this game. Crystal Picnic is definitely enjoyable for those who like the genre and are not too picky,\nso I would recommend this to more casual gamers who are able to look at the work and effort seen in this title, because once you figure out the controls (whether it be controller or keyboard) it's actually a pretty fun title.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","January 23","true","2.5"," 30 of 31 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","30","31","0","2"

Join a sarcastic gardener and a wannabe knight as they journey across the kingdom chasing after ants who stole magic crystals from the castle. With hours worth of exploration, RPG stats, platform style combat and crazy enemies, this is one Action RPG I'd recommend.","November 8, 2015","true","0.2"," 25 of 31 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","25","31","0","0"

This is a nice little RPG with good looking pixel graphics. I honestly wasnt expecting much from this game, but, once I played a bit of it, I soon learned that my 2$ was well spent. Its an RPG for casuals, though. Which isnt a bad thing, but its worth noting that you cant really expect much difficulty from this game. I havent played much and what I was playing was on normal difficulty, so this is for you to judge. The game itself is really polished. Nothing really looks lazy in this game, the overworld seems to be pretty big and I havent run into any crashes/glitches yet. A fitting word for this game would be "cute". The way it looks, the name of the characters and just how it feels is pretty cool actually. The story isnt bad either (I wont explain it though, that part is for the game to do). All in all, its an alright game. I recommend it to you if you like (Or dont mind) casual RPGs and/or enjoy the pixel graphics and, previously mentioned, "cute" art style. And I can assure you, Ive seen MANY worse games out there for this price (And higher)","November 3, 2015","true","1.0"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","0"

That's what makes it good.\n\nCrystal Picnic is a very short (yeah, short-short) game, styled to be like 16-bit games. I'm tired of looking at games that claim to be "8-bit" or "16-bit" and turn out not to be. That's why I was hesitant to buy this game. However, Crystal Picnic is different.\n\nThe graphics (while the color pallete might be off a bit) do, for the most part, represent 16-bit perfectly. The controls really feel like I'm playing it on a Sega or something, and the music is probably the best. It just feels like I'm on a Sega.\n\nThe game is cute, so are all of the characters, and their world is just built so perfectly, everything is so humble. The soundtrack is good too. It's a very lighthearted game with fairly nice combat. The combat is my favorite part. You adventure around like classice RPGs in a tile-based (I assume) world, but upon entering combat, you're suddenly tossed into a platformer-like game, which I loved.\n\nMy only problem was the lack of direction at the beginning of the game. I had the hardest time figuring out where to go, and that you could actually walk over that dark grass that previous RPGs taught you that you can't. Another thing this game needs is a MAP. It has a world map, but nothing for the specific area you're in. You can't pull up a map while you're lost and go "Alright, I'm here." That was my only main problem because the last two areas in the game REALLY need a map.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nI only have one heart-breaking problem... On the world map, there are areas that are very detailed and look as if you could go to them somehow. You can't. It breaks my heart because as a child I would always dream about being able to go to places you're not supposed to in games. I would dare myself to go beyond, to believe, to dream that one day I'd find some secret in the game that would actually take me to these hidden places. But you just can't. It's not physically programmed into the game. I'm not asking the developer to add these areas, but I was just wondering why they decided to detail the map so greatly in certain areas you can't go to, but then make it so plain in others...","January 30","true","5.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The musical score is really well done. The game features wonderful dreamy tunes that would have been right at home coming from a SNES rpg circa 1994. Graphics are cutesy and fairly good for a 16-bit style game. Each character you discover features their own unique ability to help you out in different situations. The characters and plot are fairly basic. Help restore the Kingdom by gathering the magical stones back from an evil Ant kingdom.\n\nThe main things I dislike are the combat areas. They tend to be a bit of a sprawling mess. The lack of control you have over your NPC companions can be annoying at times. While in battle they tend to just run straight foward to attack, and take alot of damage in this way. Luckily you tend to come across plenty of chests that contain health vials and you're able to stock up on items wherever you come across the helpful Flea brother merchants.\n\nAll in all I'd recommend this game if you're looking for a touch of old SNES era action rpg fun. The game is fairly short, but for such a cheap price it's worth buying.","November 21, 2015","true","3.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

All i found were accessories and weapons but not a single piece of armour, so points off for that.\n\nFourthly, finished the game in 1:30ish, game too short\n\n\nAlright onto the good:\n\nFirst, The game looks nice and cartoony, I like this style.\n\nSecondly, It had a nice little story to it, i could dig it.\n\nThirdly, It's a nice indie rpg without it being another RPG maker game\n\nFourthly, GLORIOUS BUNNY ♥♥♥\n\n\nWould i recommend?\n\nSure, it's only a 2 dollar game, currently CDN$ 1.46 here for another 23 hours.","November 22, 2015","true","1.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Meandering, complex areas with no local map system.  The view feels too close, causing it to further complicate while navigating.    Pointless (and unpleasant to me) combat system with the illusion of avoiding fighting enemies, except you slip on banana peels every three seconds forcing you to fight all enemies on screen.   There is no xp to and only the chance to get a couple coins rarely dropped, where the only things to buy are a couple different healing items you probably wont need anyways, so it really is pointless.      I honestly cannot see why people have found this so appealing.","December 15, 2015","false","2.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The story focuses around a sarcastic gardener and a wannabe knight as they journey across the kingdom chasing after ants who stole magic crystals from the castle.\n\nThe main story is linear and quite simple and I haven't found any side quests in two hours that I've played.\n\nItems don't tell you what they do neither what is their purpose in the game. They don't show any stats and you must try it to know if they affect in some manner to the result of the battles.\n\nFight mode is strange. The game turns into a 2D platformer where you can hit and run ants, sunflowers or birds but you've no idea how much damage could you make with your weapons or how affect every hit in your stamina. You also see the main characters on the screen but I don't know how to change between them.\n\nThe map is full of empty space and empty of life. There are some key npc if you need to talk to them, some pots with potions inside the buildings and some decoration.\n\nThere isn't any zone map to know where you are in the world .\n\nThe main character is easy to control using four arrows and some other keys but you must discover them, because there aren't keyboard settings neither somewhere where they are listed.\n\nGraphics are japanese SNES style. It's seems that the only resolution available is a fullscreen 800x600 because the game have no options to change resolution and there is no window mode.\n\nMusic and sound are quite normal.\n\nIt has achivements but not trading cards.I encourage to developers to add them in next releases.\n\nIn my opinion, there are a lot of games better than this to play.\n\nPD: Thanks to Shade00","November 17, 2015","false","1.9"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"
