While Star Trail is the real shining star of this series, this is a great introduction to old school gaming. I have no idea if they fixed the bugs (save game destroying errors) from the original, so be wary of certain siutations such as starting a fire in the spider cave or gathering coins in the final tomb.\n\nI'm a big fan of realism in my RPG, even when it can be frustrating. The idea of having to plan for weapons breaking, illnesses, cold and wet weather, equipment wearing out, as well as climbing and swimming challenges is something often overlooked in most modern games.\n\nIf you love all-inclusive details, where you build your characters from scratch and have to plan your quests tactfully, this is your game!","January 12, 2014","true","25.9"," 74 of 79 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","74","79","0","2"

The game is very rough around the edges with stiff controls, repetitive graphics and micro management and instant kill dreath-traps; and yet the world of Aventuria is fun to explore and RoA is one of the few game series that tried to get the pen and paper rules as closely as possible onto the screen.\n\nWith the classic RPG party of up to six heroes (plus an occasional NPC) you have to travel through and explore the viking-inspired country of Thorwal to find pieces of an old map showing the location of a legendary sword. Find the sword to thwart the impending orc invasion and save Thorwal. The story is as simple as that - but it's not an easy task.\n\nTravelling Thorwal is not a cakewalk. Find food and drink or your heroes will die of starvation or thirst. Gather herbs, brew potions and poisons or use them to cure death threatening diseases. Protect your camp or you risk enemy surprise attacks at night. Try to climb a mountain without a rope? Your party better have proper climbing skills or you can wave your heroes goodbye as the game cruelly hurls them down chasms to their deaths. Bottomless pits, rocky old boats that sink without warning - the game loves to kill you without giving you a chance. You better save often. Not enough? One wrong word may upset an NPC carrying one of the precious map pieces you're looking for and you will never get it. No second chances. Miss too many and you cannot complete the game (without the game telling you).\n\nTowns and dungeons are explored in old fashioned 3D view à la classic Bard's Tale and Ultima Underworld. Combat takes place turn based on an isometric grid. Traveling across the lands happens on the large map of Thorwal itself.\n\nOver twenty years later there are many things that will turn gamers away instantly. The game gives you no quarter. But if you give it an honest chance you may find that exploring Thorwal and its dozens of villages and towns and numerous dungeons will be an adventure to remember for a long time to come.","June 26, 2014","true","51.2"," 38 of 39 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","38","39","0","0"

If you're into P&P RPG this game and series is a must have. If you want HD graghics and intense 3D battles with fast and furious leveling and rewards this is not for you. What you do get is a challenging game with a high sense of accomplishment.\n\nOther games of the time did not go into the game management required by the Realms of Arkadia. Just covering the basic needs of food and water can be difficult if you don't select the right characters and skills. You must then place points into your skills when leveling or allow the computer to do it for you but not always getting logical reulults. With improperly placed skill points some skills will never be successful.\n\nNot to mention casting spells. Of the 5 different magic using types each have their own strengths and weaknesses in spell casting. If you don't plan ahead some spells will remain unavailable  or extremely difficult to cast, depending on spell strength, and Attribute score. which is also new to video games as most if not all games before simply required you to have enough spell points to successfully cast.\n\nIn other words, challenges that other games did not have and alot still don't.\n\nBeing able to replay a game is a major bonus as you can try different characters to receive different starting skills and spells. You can then place points differently and at the end of the game have completely different characters. Another bonus is being able to use these characters throughout the entire series of games.\n\nEven if you don't like the video game you can print out the manual and sit down with friends and have a great time rolling dice and complaining how the game master hates you. Even if you do like the game it's always fun complaining how the GM hates you.\n","January 18, 2014","true","54.8"," 33 of 38 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","33","38","0","0"

If you mind oldschool, this game is not for you. The interface is primitive even compared to the sequels. That is not the the problem.\n\nWhat IS the problem, though, is that they spent the minimum possible effort getting it to run on modern computers. And that was already little, considering DosBox is free software. The sound is poorly configured, and choppy. On Ubuntu, the whole game doesn't even run thanks to a broken library that is included.\n\nDo not buy this game or any other retro/dosbox-based games from this publisher until they clean up their act.","December 1, 2014","false","4.1"," 35 of 53 people (66%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","66","35","53","2","4"

The graphics are basic, but they are without doubt not the worst feature of the game. It's the user interface that is too poor for words. Back in the days before Windows, there was no general consensus in how interfaces should behave with regards to mouse clicks. I find myself regularly stabbing at keys in order to try and figure out how to do something, and the music is just an irritation.\n\nIt's not that I am basing this opinion by comparing this kind of legacy game to newer ones. Instead it is just that the game lacks intuitiveness. When I play a game, I at least want some kind of tutorial in order to know how to do the basics. Realms of Arkania has none of this.\n\nUnless you were a fan of the original, I would stay clear of this. It doesn't come close to games like Eye of the Beholder. There are better options out there. Perhaps the later versions will sort out a lot of the controls, but the first release is just weak.","January 18, 2014","false","0.5"," 12 of 39 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","12","39","0","3"

I know I know, it's from 1992, but the severe lack of user-friendly interface or any kind of tutorial makes it not worth the effort for me.

You are first plopped in a temple with a full party but without any kind of introduction about your goals or background story or anything else than a random guy's conquests and death in the 5 minutes long but extremely slowly presented introduction video slideshow after a totally irrelevant and long-ish credits list.
