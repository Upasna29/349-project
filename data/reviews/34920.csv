I played up to the first boss and then quit out.\n\nBasically it's a bullet-hell game like '1942' with futuristic 3D ships and a horribly restricted field of view.\n\nIt's something you've seen a million times before and does nothing to improve on the formula. The shooting just requires you hold down 2 fire buttons and let them auto fire as you try to dodge the incoming while nabbing the upgrades as they drop down.\n\nThe Good:\n*Looks pretty decent.\n*Controls work well.\n*Sound is ok.\n\nThe Bad:\n*Lack of impact and satisfying enemy destruction.\n*Field of view is too close in a tight downward angle.\n*Boring enemy attack patterns.\n*Cheap enemy tactics, attack from behind, really suck.\n*Weapon pickups have no discernible impact on your killing power.\n*Just holding down the 2 fire buttons and moving is not fun.\n\nRecommended for:\nFans looking for an updated '1942' type game.. but even then it's a hard sell.\n\nConclusion.\n2/10.

Sure, It was probably easy to make things like the art bland and the music painfully generic, but in other areas it seems like there was some real effort to make this properly terrible.\n\nA camera angle which makes it difficult to place where your ship is relative to bullets, that's some effort right there. Ship movement which seems oddly disconnected from controller input, hit boxes that float some distance away from the actual target, sound effects that scrape against your will to live.

The menu selection is just awful, especially for the upgrades, it's not clear what each upgrade of your guns, rockets, power, shields can do, no idea what each gun is, everything is trial and error. Even so, it starts with such a fury and speed, the bosses are almost unbeatable, and it feels like all of the time someone's attacking you from behind or just trying collide with you. This game feels like nightmare even if you selected easy.\n\nMy advice: This genre is best portrayed in the old "Raptor: Call of the Shadows" game. This game should have been influenced more from that.","November 29, 2013","false","0.6"," 33 of 41 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","33","41","2","0"

It may perhaps be more on top of that pile as there are worse shooters but that doesnt help much. Why so? As other reviews have accurately described this game suffers from hard to tell hit collision as enemies alter altitude and often approach you from behind. I'd also add that pacing is a problem. Evidence? Find a Let's play video about the first level -> notice the attack patterns and hit boxes? Long long chains of repeating patterns come at you. And then without much ado the boss crawls forth to battle you.\n\nI must also point out it's by far biggest sin: Pricing. there are other shooter games that i won't be naming that score points as they are simply so incredibly cheap you can get them for some coins and they give you that 30-60min of mediocre fun. This one is overpriced and gets annoying quickly and thus it's price/quality is bonkers.\n\nI like to see past problems of games and find redeeming qualities in them that would make them different and perhaps place them in a niche. Alas i can't find any redeeming qualities in this game considering the competition on steam AND pricing.","May 7, 2015","false","2.1"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","19","21","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/irishcream/recommended/34920/","irishcream","Whiskey","http://steamcommunity.com/id/irishcream/","718 products in account","Razor2: Hidden Skies is a sci-fi "bullet hell" game made by the Brazilian studio responsible for Bad Rats - Invent 4 Entertainment.  The numeral "2" appended to the name of the game begs the question as to the whereabouts of the original game. There was no Razor 1 listed on Invent 4's website which leads me to believe this is the only publicly available game in this series. Unable to find any mention of an original game, it leads me to speculate that the developers artificially appended the title with a "2" to make it seem like a more successful franchise than it actually is.\n\nRazor2 seems to make strides in being as mediocre as possible. Much of each level seems to insult the value of your time by presenting you with repetitive and uninteresting fill content. Most attacks simply vanish into the enemies and offer little to no indication that you're actually doing damage which both makes you wonder if you're using the right weapon and leaves up unsatisfied in the shoot 'em up experience.\n\nTo the game's merit many of the enemies have a very appealing design albeit a bit generic. The game's soundtrack is very orchestral that made the game feel a bit like a movie. The boss fights offered a fair challenge but enduring the levels of mediocrity to get to them failed to make the endeavor worthwhile.\n\nThe game offers you three lives and a single continue. Once these are depleted you are forced to start the game from the beginning.\n\nThe game does support USB controllers but only in game as navigating the menu seemed to require the mouse at some point.\n\nScore: 4.5/10","December 23, 2013","false","1.0"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/finalohmega/recommended/34920/","finalohmega","FinalOhmega","http://steamcommunity.com/id/finalohmega/","386 products in account","Razor2 has some fantastic visuals and a great soundtrack with the gameplay one would expect from a standard SHMUP (shoot ‘em up) but doesn’t bring anything particularly new to the genre. Expect cool upgrades, boringly repetitive enemies, and a complete lack of a defined hitbox! For SHMUP enthusiasts. Get it cheap in a bundle or something, otherwise it’s not worth it and certainly not worth $10. I personally found it to be enjoyable.\n\nTHE GOOD\n- Lots of pretty action, massive bosses, and bright bullets all over the place.\n- Upgrade your ship between the eight stages with new weapons, shields, and equipment.\n- Easy achievements. You can earn all ten simply by playing through the whole game.\n- Epic orchestrated soundtrack! Can’t complain about the musical selection.\n- Decent replay value.\n\nTHE BAD\n- Poorly defined hit box. This is a huge flaw for a SHMUP in my opinion.\n- Undefined “edges” of the playing area make it difficult to gauge where to dodge.\n- Repetitive enemy patterns make the 5-minute stages seem boring and long.\n- Numerous typos and language errors make any attempt at a story meaningless.\n- It’s just not noteworthy in any way. It’s very “run of the mill” in terms of gameplay.\n\nTHE MEH\n- Limited controller support. It works in most places, but not in all menus.\n- No tutorial or practice mode and the controls are not exactly intuitive.\n\nOverall, I found it to be fun to play through a full run or two but repetition will leave you bored and unimpressed. There is some solid strategy available in the form of ship customization but in the end it’s still the same repetitive stage battles, and if you use up your single continue and all your lives then you’ll have to start over from the beginning again. It has some redeeming qualities in that the soundtrack is pretty awesome and that the achievements are all pretty easy to get (aside from maybe the “no continue” one). The visuals are not overly remarkable but they are well done. The typos and spelling errors are painful to read through though.\n\nI highly recommend using a controller. I use a Logitech F310 and have no issues with the gameplay itself, although menu navigation is wonky at best.","June 3, 2014","true","5.7"," 13 of 21 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","13","21","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hecatoncheire/recommended/34920/","hecatoncheire","Hecatoncheire","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hecatoncheire/","446 products in account","Razor 2: Hidden Skies tries gallantly to emulate the shmups of yore, but falls flat not for want of creativity (though it could certainly use a bit more), but inexcusable ♥♥♥♥-ups on the game mechanics themselves.\n\nThe game attempts, in some places, to be a bullet hell game but the hitbox of your ship is extremely large and does not even match the graphic - it awkwardly extends out an uncertain distance to both sides, but does not seem to include the nose of the fighter. Furthermore, the areas extend visually farther than your actual range of motion, but this is impossible to tell without running right into an invisible wall. In several areas, enemies park right on this wall, giving the illusion that you can zip around them to avoid fire and take them out, right up until you crash into them headlong making the attempt. This is made even more unweildly by the boss fights that zoom the camera out, supposedly to impress you with how big the boss is. Sadly the net result is that now you can see even more but have the same narrow movement lane, exacerbating the problem even more.\n\nTwo subweapons are heat-seeking with auto targetting, but there is no mechanic to choose what you'd like to target - the game seems to completely arbitrarily choose for you, and even if the lock-on happens to be a priority target, anything flying in the path of your slow-traveling relativistic missiles will intercept them and explode instead. (Which prompts the question of how does a missile travelling at relativistic speeds even work, and if it does why are they so bloody slow?) The bosses are all recycled variants of each other - fight three tanks, then fight three spinning satellite things, then... etc.\n\nUnfortunately the problems do not stop there. Movement is imprecise and jerky. Combine this with the awkard hitboxes and you've committed a cardinal sin in the shmup genre - dodging is effectively impossible in places, though this doesn't matter a terrible lot since to cover for this the game slathers you in multiple shields which partially refresh upon each pick-up. Despite that fact, you still take a lot of hits simply because your hitbox isn't where you think it is, and it's nigh impossible to guage where its limits are precisely, since it extends well beyond the ship graphic. Unfortunately, the pickups themselves don't make a terrible lot of sense. One of the most common is Energy, which restores a pip on your Energy meter. Which is grand, only the game never quite explains what Energy is for or why you want it, despite being able to upgrade your ship batteries to have more of it. Oh well, free shields I guess!\n\nIn general the game is horridly unpolished. The translation is riddled with grammatical errors, word misuse, and typos (I'm not sure what a Gravity Riffle is). Each mission has a cheesy low-quality text-to-speech mission introduction voiceover, only it gets a few words into it before the explosions start and the rest is completely drowned out. Oops. Hope it wasn't important. Soon after starting the second mission, the primary fire input became stuck and I was essentially on autofire for the rest of the game. Which isn't all bad I suppose, except with the input stuck, I became unable to read mission briefings (not a tremendous loss since they're an exercise in bad English and misspelled words) and upon finishing and going to the main menu it would spam me right into a new game on Easy Mode, not allowing me to change settings or even exit the game. I had to alt-tab and manually kill it.\n\nIn short, I can't recommend this game at all, even to die-hard shmup fans, unless you seriously need a fix and simply cannot find something else to scratch the itch.","April 3, 2014","false","1.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","1"

You'll often take damage without even touching the incoming ship. The bullets are ok though;\nThis collision issue gets worse when you notice the area you can move in around is much smaller than it looks;\nIt crashed a few times which is really annoying;\nNot all menus can be controlled by keyboard, for example I couldn't close the medal earned windows, it's rather annoying to have to click it with the mouse when I'm mostly playing this with the keyboard;\nSpeaking of the menus, their click area also seems to be a bit off. Sometimes the option doesn't get lit up even though the mouse is hovering over it. Should respond to a rectange that expands well beyond the text to avoid such annoyance;\nSome weapons seemed clearly more powerful and useful than the others, so that got me into not even bothering with the other ones;\nThe default options have to be changed. I only noticed there was a woman talking on the second time I played the game - the default Music Volume value severely overpowers both the voice (which is quite useful) and the game sounds;\nThere is a large number of resolutions available... but not mine? (1600x900) Really? C'mon...\nAlso, the W resolutions (which I suppose stands for Widescreen) for some reason make the game display wrong. It'll not show up fully to the top, so you'll not see most enemies that appear near the top. I don't know if I crapped the configs up to get that effect or what, but it happened, so I switched to windowed mode at 1024x768 I settled with that;\nThe time limit for the bosses is annoying. I killed a boss at the last few seconds of the time limit, and it ran out and killed me while the boss was exploding. It offered me to continue, which I accepted, it completed the mission and for some reason the next one no enemies could shoot and they would die a few instants after entering the screen. Not sure if related, but, that's a glitch right there....\n\nThat aside, it was pretty fun, though nothing memorable.\nI personally found the soundtrack a bit weird, I felt like I was playing God of War or some ♥♥♥♥ lol","December 15, 2013","true","2.9"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

So when this was on a special, I was really excited. Firstly, this is an indie title, so mentioning anything about graphics is really quite daft.  So I will only mention the gameplay control elements.\n\nAnd with that, the game is honestly very dull.  The boss fights are tedious and frustrating.  You dont get any sense of achievement during a boss fight as you dont notice if you have destroyed a part of it or not, and you dont really get to focus on the boss as the devs decided to add spawns of continious non-bosses in the boss fights.  So yes, the boss fights are "incredible", but not in a good way.\n\nThe collision detection is also really awful, most of the time I dont know whether a bullet actually hit me or not, even though I could swear that it should have hit me.  This is also true in shooting enemy planes, I shot down enemy planes where I could swear I shouldnt have been able to.  Then there is also the fact that enemies just spawn randomly all over the place and that they just hammer and spam attacks in every direction that all you really do at the end of the day is focus on is trying to dodge while just jamming the attack button while you have your homing laser equipped.  The entire combat system thus feels like dumb luck and an exercise of chance and pointlessness.\n\nThe controls are also unitiative and silly.  There isnt a brief tutorial to familiarise you with the keys, so it forces you to look up the key config. Sure, it might be better on a controller, but to be honest, I am not going to bother with a controller if there is only partial controller support because I really cannot be bothered to fiddle with a keyboard+mouse AND a controller while playing a game.  Though, this complaint generally stems from my complete disinterest in the title, and I guess if you really manage to get into it, this isnt really an Issue, but I couldnt, so it was an issue for me.\n\nOne of the large draws of these action games is a sense of excitement, achievement and skill, and this game does not provide any of it.  There are too many games on the market, and while this would have been worth a go a few years ago, there really are just better alternatives, as it has been done better multitudes of times, and I can therefore not recommend this game.","November 26, 2013","false","0.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Stages consist of the same formation of enemies, that only have one flight pattern and one bullet pattern, and just repeats over and over.  Fifteen seconds into any stage, and you've already seen everything there is to see for the next few minutes.\n\nPowering up your weapons works in reverse.  That is, leveling up your weapons only lets you keep up with increasing enemy hit points in the next stage.  Whichever weapon you choose not to upgrade becomes completely unusable.\n\nI also had some issues with controller support, which others noted in the forums as well.  However the game is playable on keyboard, so there are workarounds available to those who seek them out.\n\nFor some better shmups on steam, I can recommend:\nAlltynex series (Kamui, RefleX, Alltynex 2nd)\nAstebreed\nCrimzon Clover\nDanmaku Unlimited 2\nEther Vapor Remaster\neXceed series (mostly 2 and 3)\nGundemonium series (Gundeadligne, Gundemonium Recollection, Hitogata Happa)\nJamesdown\nSatazius","December 18, 2013","false","2.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Hold the button down and blast away everything in sight. I was hoping Razor2 would scratch that itch - a 10 minute pick-up and play game. How wrong could the game go? Pretty wrong in fact.\n\nFirst of all, for a game that was released in 2010 this game doesn't run well. My computer isn't a monster, but it should be able to run something like this. Judging by the screen tearing, rapid drop in frame-rate, and dodgy animation, maybe I'm wrong. Bear in mind the game doesn't run at full resolution, it vertically blocks either side of the screen to squash the image. This is a poor show, even with all these solutions the game runs badly.\n\nThe gameplay isn't any great shakes, but after playing the first boss for 10 minutes and not getting anywhere, I decided I was done with this game. The most frustrating thing is there was no feedback whether I was hitting the right part of the boss. The small enemies line up like pawns in a chess game taking all the hits and doing nothing but make the game more frustrating. If a game can't tell the player whether what they are doing is right or wrong - as in you hit the enemy and it turns red - then how does the player know whether their actions are effective or not?\n\nI'm done with this game.

If you set a widescreen resolution like 1980*1080 the ui will fill up almost 50% of the screen, the controll is like if you play with a wet sponge.\n\nIf you are looking for a good shmup : Go by Syder Arcade or Sine Mora, those two games fit the slogan Old school with new technologie and are worth every penny.","January 14, 2014","false","0.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Razor2 is a complete joke as compared to many better shooters you can grab in both the arcades and online.\n\nGameplay is very poor and unpolished as it gets repetitive, cheap (as in enemies coming in from behind unexpectedly), and boring (predictable and lame enemy patterns, and bosses take FOREVER to kill without appropriate weapons or upgrades).\n\nEven as a fan of shooters (like me), it's still not worth it.\n\n...I guess the ONLY possible reason for grabbing this is the orchestrated music, but still no. The music is so incredibly loud that you will not be able to notice over 50% of the sound effects in this game (voices included).\n\nLong story short: Save your money for better shmups.","February 19, 2014","false","1.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Upon loading the game you will immediately noticed the extremely low production level in which this game was created under. Everything feels dated in this game, the menu feels like it came straight out of a 90s videos game. You start a new game to see that this game offers a nifty upgrade system that lets you pimp out your ship. Too bad you will need credits for that, most of which will require you to replay though levels of boring repetitive crap. The enemy ship shooting patterns are hardly interesting or inventive; the boss is just a normal ship with bigger gun and a faster shooting rate. In other words if you beat the first level, you have seen all this game has to offer. To add to the insult, this game does not have a save function, truly atrocious modern gaming design.","September 24, 2011","false",""," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

My first complaint are bosses WHY WHY oh WHY do you have just a billion enemies spawn already cutting of what little mobility you have (Pet Peeve). The 2nd is the upgrade system, because of how I feel damage is dealt ,and how the stages tend to play there really is no point to upgrading anything but the spread shot beacause your shots are either going through which tells me that only one is hitting at a time afterwards just go regen you can't die unless you actually try to. As I said before the controls (I was using a PS3 controller) for some reason I kept switching sub weapons for no reason I had to check if I accidently assigned something to the same button but nope.\n\nAll in All just avoid this game I feel awful for installing this game on my PC","April 4, 2014","false","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
