(Brazilian Portuguese)\nReview of The Song of Seven: Chapter One.(English one - A bit below)\n\nResumo\nThe song of seven é um incrivel jogo criado pela Enlightened Games. O jogo conta a historia de um garoto chamado Kiba, que passou sua vida inteira preso em sua vila pacata(kami), intimidado pelos boatos, crenças e ensinamentos de seus pais e todos da vila de que fora dos limites/cerca da vila existe um mal terrivel crescendo para destruir seu mundo. No entanto tudo muda quando parte da cerca é quebrada , e Kiba é enviado para concerta-la, la sua curiosidade toma o lugar do medo,e ele começa a se aventurar por esse mundo lindo e cheio de mistérios.\n\nGraficos:Os Graficos desse jogo são ESPETACULARES (acredite em mim, não estou exagerando quando uso letras maiusculas), o estilo de arte, as cores, os efeitos graficos , são um imenso deleite para os olhos , parte do estilo me lembra do "Brothers: tale of two sons" só que bem mais bonito e detalhado. Abaixo algumas Screenshots tiradas por mim.\n\nTrilha Sonora: Outro Aspecto onde esse jogo me surpreendeu , a trilha sonora desse jogo é completamente original , linda, suave , harmoniosa , assim como os graficos são um deleite para os olhos, a trilha sonora desse jogo é para os ouvidos. O unico jogo que me surpreendeu nesse aspecto tanto quanto "The song of Seven" foi "Ori and the blind forest" então da pra imaginar quão bom ela e ^^.\n\nGameplay:Apesar de ter parte do seu sistema de jogo baseado na solução de quebra-cabeças utilizando items encontrados ao longo do mapa como nos jogos de point-and-click, The song of seven oferece algo que até então eu nunca tinha visto junto com o estilo: A capacidade de mover o personagem livremente usando as teclas do teclado ou controle analogico , sem ficar preso ao uso do click/mouse para locomoção.\n\nThe song of seven é um jogo magnifico, é um daqueles jogos que é otimo pra jogar em qualquer situação , principalmente depois que você chega cansado ou estressado do trabalho e quer relaxar. Tanto os graficos quanto a trilha sonora são agradaveis , eu confesso que fico feliz que esse seja o capitulo 1, por que nao vejo a hora  do proximo capitulo. Vamos ajudar os desenvolvedores com esse jogo magnifico que na minha opiniao deveria estar na primeira pagina da steam.\n\nEnglish Version\n\nSumarry\nThe song of seven is an incredible game created by Enlightened Games. The game tells the story of a boy called Kiba, that has passed his whole life "traped" on his little village(kami),intimidated by the rumors, beliefs and taughts of his parents and the whole village , that outside the village's bounds/fence exist a great evil growing to destroy their world(Pria). But everything changes when part of the fence gets broken, and kiba is sent to fix it, there his curiosity takes the place of his fear and he starts his adventure on this beautiful world full of mysteries.\n\nGraphics:The graphics of this game are SPECTACULAR(belive me, i'm not exagerating using caps^^), the art, the style, the colors and graphic effects are a huge delight to the eyes, part of the style reminds me of "Brothers: tale of two sons", but more beautiful and detailed. Below some pictures taken by me.\n\nSoundtrack: Another aspect where this games surprised me, the soundtrack of this game is completly original, beautiful,soft and harmonious, like the graphics are a delight to the eyes so is the soundtrack to the ears.The only game that surprised me on this aspect as much as "the song of seven" was  "Ori and the Blind forest", so you can imagine how good it is ^^.\n\nGameplay:The gamestyle It's surely a combination I never have seen: a gameplay that hearkens back to old school point and click, inventory-based adventure/puzzle games but uses third person analog controls for a more updated, immersive feeling.\n\nThe song of seven is a magnificent game, it's one of those games good to be played in any situation, mainly after a tiring and stressing day at work when you need to relax.Either the graphics and soundtrack are are pleasant, I confess that I am happy that it's the chapter 1, because can't wait for the next chapter. Let's help the developers with this game , that in my opinion should be on the 1st page of steam.\n\nScreenshots:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=687085743http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=686948726http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=687454854\nGraphics: 10/10\n\nSoundtrack: 10/10\n\nGameplay: 9/10\n\nGame: 9.5/10.\n\nEnlightened games team support: 10/10.","May 19","true","4.4"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","22","25","2","0"

To an extent where I can fully immerse myself into this game and take on the role of young Kiba as he explores the vast world around him. He is a solitary boy, who only knows the fences of the village he was brought up in. But one day a storm has struck the peaceful village, and an opportunity of a lifetime strikes Kiba. Will he take it? That, my friend... is up to you!\n\n*cough* Ahem! In all seriousness, if you want an alluring adventure filled with fun, fantasy and mystery then The Song of Seven might be just right for you.

So what are you waiting for, go and start your adventure in this world of mystery and find the purpose of the lands around you!\n\nI hope you enjoy the game as much as I have and I cannot wait for the second chapter. Best of luck!\n\nFootnote - My new favourite instrument is the lyre... I want one!\nFootnote #2 - Luna will keep you hooked on this game, she at least did for me...","May 17","true","3.4"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","20","22","0","0"

It's like a mix obetween exploration, point-and-click/visual novel'ish. Normally, I'm not a huge fan of the latter, but there's a charm and beauty to this game that trapped my fascination and curiosity. However, I experienced a serious lag issue playing with the lowest resolution when I went to the other side of the fence, which ruined the peaceful, atmospheric feel. And the character showing me around would get stuck next to rocks, so I'd have to try to fish her out. The way my characer moves is also very.. unique? But I did get used to it and didn't really mind, once I got distracted by the lovely music, amazing colors, lighting and stunning scenario. Somewhat unpolished, but to me it's so aesthetically pleasing and artistically inspiring that I'd recommend it either way.","May 18","true","1.1"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

On one hand, there's a good set of themes regarding curiosity versus safety and what it means to live. Characters are reasonably developed for the 2-3 hours that it takes to beat the first episode. The game is nice to look at, in particular regarding the environment backdrops and the scenery that's created. The basic puzzles do the job, and it's your typical point and click adventure experience. However, it becomes clear early on that the game is really rough around the edges, as the lack of kickstarter budget of the title shows in rushed narratives and a lack of polish of the central engine of the game. It's biggest flaw is its pacing: as story elements drop out of nowhere, or characters undergo massive changes without reasonable events to cause the change in behavior. There's little issues with the presentation as well, as the game didn't do its best of complementing some sections with lighting changes or character appropriate animations. You'll feel like the game fell short of its potential, which makes this determination really hard. I want to see more of this universe, and the base story does enough to tilt things toward the recommendation side. But those getting the game know this: you're getting a deeply flawed experience, and it's a good title to target for a sale.\n\nVideo Review:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq4QyIPrIAA\n\nLists:\nPositives:\nGood themes of fear versus curiosity are present.\nCharacters are simple but easy to understand, and have easily identifiable traits associated with them.\nGood background design and drawing talent on display. Can look beautiful at times.\nSome good puzzle design, in particular with a music puzzle and figuring out what notes are missing through tones.\nDeveloper seems to be rather responsive with multiple builds released during the review time.\nNegatives:\nStory rhythm is a major problem. Characters undergo radical changes without the appropriate events corresponding to them. Feels like a game stuck on fast forward, and that may come down to a lack of funds. It just feels like it was held back from its true potential.\nReally rough around the edges all over the place. Suffers from a lack of polish in several elements, including graphics and story.\nLighting is an issue in several scenes. Unable to see proper emotion, or able to complement the scene well.\nCouple of bugs, including a progress breaking one. Developer is responsive, but still, dragged down the experience.","May 24","true","2.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

Right away the aesthetic  is amazing. The use of color and light tells a story itself. About halfway through I got a big "final fantasy" feel from the game and I really liked that. It's not a long game, but by the end you really want more.\n\nAll in all i give this game a 9.5/10","May 17","true","6.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The trees especially...they are so detailed, and the grass and leaves move side to side in the wind. It's really quite impressive for a game like this.\n+ I found the story to be very whimsical, you start out in a village surrounded by a wooden fence/wall where no one has ever left or entered. A closed off society, and one day you encounter a girl on the other side of the fence, and she convinces you to come out and explore the land beyond the walls.\n+ The character dialogue feel genuine, and each character has their own personality.\n+ The puzzles / quests are nice and casual\n+ Great soundtrack\n\n- No voice acting...  I mean this isn't a deal breaker, but in a game where the developers have invested so much time into making the world look so beautiful....Voice acting would have brought the characters and story more to life...\n- The "interaction detection" is a bit narrow although this is really a minor problem. For most things you can't just click on something to proceed, you must be the correct distance away from it. if your character is too close nothing will happen, or too far away nothing will happen. Sometimes it feels like you can't interact when things, but you are actually just not the right distance away from it.","June 6","true","0.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The backgrounds are gorgeous though, and the music helps pull you into the world as well.\n\nThe pacing feels slightly slow at first, but once you hit the world map for the first time things get more interesting. The whole of Chapter 1 took me around 2.5-3 hours.\n\nI enjoyed what I played and I'm looking forward to playing future chapters.","May 23","true","2.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I read development logs and kept up with everything, and now that its out I really want to play it, but there's one big problem that no one seems to be mentioning. This game runs awfully. I am well above the system requirements (i have a 760 3gb and a i7 920), and I cant get it above 60 in the outdoor areas (I get high 30's on high, high 20's on low, and yes those are the only 2 settings). This world is beautifully animated and textured, but it doesn't seem like it should chug a system that runs most games at medium high setting at 60 no problem.(see edit) Also, I haven't played through the entire game, really just that starting area, but the dialogue system is really strange at times. It isn't always clear what will end the conversation, and certain choices are way to similar.\nEdit: The developer contacted me and has been trying to help me fix what might be wrong. I'm still not getting a solid 60 outside even on low, but its improved. The developers have been fantastic in working with me, so top marks on that. Apparently more granular settings are coming and Ill update when that happens.","May 26","false","0.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","1"

It starts out with a basic concept of how these puzzles work but doesn't really go indepth with them. Letting the player figure them out for the most part. The game overall looks beautiful. The different enviornments are really pleasing to look at. They have an abundance of color and detail to them.\n\nThe only problem i'm seeing is the lag it generates when playing at a higher resolution. I really want to play this game at the highest resolution but i'm fine with a lower one. Hopefully it will be fixed soon.\n\nI do recommend it.","May 17","true","2.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","4"

Despite being a complete game it feels...incomplete. But that's just because of the length. It's short. Really short. I took my time and finished in 2.6 hours. I hope chapter 2 comes soon.\n\nStory For an indie game to have a good story is key. The Song of Seven has a good story.\n\nWhen the story progressed and revealed more and more of the world, it felt natural and right. Very kudos.\n\nVisuals Importantly, and ultimately why I recommend the game – it's pretty. Like. Very pretty. The aesthetic is an extension of the story and of the game. It's not pretty just to be pretty.\n\nGameplay Gameplay is...fine. The world map and location areas remind me of Final Fantasy in a different art style. The click-to-solve reminds me a bit of Myst.\n\nThe biggest cons: you don't control the camera most of the time and when you do, it's awkard.\n\nOther stuff The game sorely needed voice acting. Only the animals make grunts and it was really disappointing. I don't think voice-overs are necessary for all games, but this one felt like it needed them.","May 22","true","2.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The art direction is an original, breath of fresh air with obvious thought given to the mood established in each of the sections though the music and environments.  I enjoyed the purposefully naive dialog in the sequestered little village and how it contrasted to the more "worldly" characters.  The puzzles were thought provoking, striking a nice balance between being solvable without overly simple, and made sense in the context of the story.\n\nThe overall message of the piece is an important one and its simple, one line dedication struck an emotional chord.  It is clear that great care was invested in the creation of this game and I look forward to seeing how the story plays out.  I tip my hat to the development team.  Well done.\n\nI definitely recommend this adventure to anyone looking to spend a few enjoyable hours capturing some of the magic from the days of imagination and bedtime stories.","May 30","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
