In both an obvious way and a non-obvious way. Essentially, the idea behind Master Reboot is that you are in a future where people can upload their memories, personality, and other traits into a cloud service, and then family and friends can visit these memories or download and install these peoples personalities into robotic shells to continue living with them if they desire. However, there was a crash in the system that caused the whole cloud service to have a reboot, which lost and corrupted some data. And now you play someone delving into the memories of someone with said corrupted data looking for something.\n\nIt's basically a walking simulator experience game, except not in a typical sense. The game is split-up into memories, with each memory being a stage. They're called memories, but they're more like surreal dreams, with a lot of odd and abstract imagery and logic. Each memory also is different, and not just in themes, but with what you do. Some are literal walking simulators, but others have elements like puzzles, or things you have to avoid or sneak past or else you'll die.\n\nThe stages have some good variety. Some are more relaxing, like this beach stage where you look for items with a metal detector. Others are a bit obtuse with what you must do, like this one amusement park stage you attend too. Some take on a horror tone, with creepy atmosphere and things trying to kill you.\n\nOn that note, my favorite stage, and something that was legitimately scary, was the plane memory. With memories in the game like a hospital and school and graveyard, you'd think one of those would be the scariest stage (and they do have some creepy factor, to be sure), but the actual scariest stage was definitely the plane one. It scared me pretty bad a few times, and this is coming from someone who plays a lot of horror games.\n\nThat's the thing I think this game does best. Atmosphere. I think the people who will enjoy this game the most are those who like atmosphere and maybe some oddities in their games. It was a bit longer than I was anticipating, but I did like it. Not the best thing I've ever played, but I liked the variety of tasks and settings, even if the basic concept of the game's story was more interesting than the story that develops in the game. But I'd say worth checking out if you're into this kind of thing.","March 3, 2014","true","15.3"," 113 of 124 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","113","124","0","5"

Featuring gorgeous art direction, great sound design, an interesting plot, and an atmosphere that can get really creepy at times for a game that isn't strictly a horror game.  It feels low budget and rough around the edges in places, but it's a great effort and a certain audience will absolutely love it.  There's some actiony gameplay in here and a little bit of platforming, but the playtime is dominated by puzzles which are typically engaging but simple.  Really, the puzzles are just a way to get you to explore the environment and the storyline and could have been cut without losing much.\n\nThe whole futuristic posthuman idea has always fascinated me, and I'd love to see a sequel that goes a little deeper into the world of the soul cloud.","November 3, 2013","true","8.3"," 50 of 56 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","50","56","0","0"

But what if they didn't have to? What if there was a way to live on forever; to visit those who's bodies have long since fallen away, indefinitely, even after passing away ourselves. Thus is the idea behind the Soul Cloud, a device capable of recreating someone's personality, their likes and dislikes, and all of their memories in digital form where they can be visited by loved ones, and continue their life without the fear of death hanging over them...that is, until the server itself begins to die, and all those inhabiting it.\n\nHere lies the basic premise to Master Reboot, a wildly ambitious project from the small team at Wales Interactive, which places you inside the Soul Cloud at the point of its downfall as an unknown protagonist just as lost as you are admist its bizarre architecture and endless hallways. It's a game that is hard to categorize because from each moment to the next you are found doing something entirely different, though all in the attempt to discover who you are and what has happened to an invention hailed as one of the most important in recent memory.\n\nThe narrative unfolds in a nonlinear, but structure format, with each memory you revisit giving you but a small piece of the overarching plot, until it finally falls into place and you're clued in on what all of it has been for. Unfortunately, that revelation falls a bit flat, switching gears at the last moment and leaving you with an empty sort of nothingness that doesn't sufficiently wrap up the myriad of lose ends that have been scattered before you during the course of the game. As the credits began to roll, I couldn't help but feel the developers had forgotten I was still expecting an ending, and had decided to simply go with the last minute plot device to close things off.\n\nUp until that point though the game is an entirely different beast, one that reinvents itself with each level giving you a new mechanic or puzzle to work with. The variety is great, and certainly welcome, but it also creates Master Reboot's biggest problem, its terrible inconsistency. Moment to moment it manages to reach both impressive heights and dreadful lows, fluctuating between the things that work and mechanics that never should have been in the game at all.\n\nThis is most apparent when the developers attempt to juxtapose in horror elements which create aggravating instant kill scenarios that both break immersion, and are completely off from the emphasis on atmosphere and exploration that is found in most of the game. Along with these come arbitrary time limits that force you to continually replay segments, one off action sequences that aren't properly explained, and an abundance of odd elements that don't have time to be expanded upon into anything meaningful. I can appreciate all the ideas at play here, but find it hard to ignore how only about half of them actually work and fit within then game.\n\nSimilarly, the ascetic is one of the game's biggest assets, with a creative and engaging art direction and some stunning lighting effects. It's a huge shame then that so much of the game is inside cramped, dark environments, with blurry textures and some truly horrific pop-in (even for a game running Unreal Engine 3). When you're taken out of the buildings and hallways, it's truly a sight to behold, but these moments are fleeting to the point I purposely stayed longer in them to appreciate how beautiful they are.\n\nPerhaps more aggravating than the discrepancies in the art design is the constant awkward cuts away from your perspective. Games like Bioshock and Half-Life proved that you can tell a great first-person story without the need to continually take control and the camera away from the player, so the fact Wales Interactive opted for such a graceless method of showcasing  important moments is frustrating, and greatly impacted my enjoyment. The off putting animated cutscenes that cap each memory were also an odd choice, feeling completely disconnected from the rest of the game even after you learn of the reason for them being there. Poor sound design is also disappointing, as the actual music and effects are quite good at immersing you in the experience, but were not even given a proper stereo directing to where everything sounds as if it's coming from the everywhere.\n\nIt might sound as if I abhorred Master Reboot, but in truth I actually enjoyed it to give a cautious recommendation despite its flaws. It's a surreal adventure with big ideas, many of which it disappointingly can't pull off, but when it does is truly fantastic. Wales Interactive has the definite makings of a great indie developer, with a uniquely imaginative vision that could lead to something great down the road. It is certainly disappointing that they also inhabit the other end of the indie spectrum, with a significant lack of polish and numerous amateurish design choices. Master Reboot has some great moments, and some truly terrible ones, but in the end I was still happy to have played it and look forward to what will come out of the newly christened developer. Hopefully they will be able to learn from their mistakes, and build off the strong foundation here.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","March 11, 2014","true","4.6"," 52 of 60 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","52","60","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/and_stay_out/recommended/251850/","and_stay_out","Zombra","http://steamcommunity.com/id/and_stay_out/","297 products in account","A beautiful, freaky first-person puzzle game that takes place in the virtual reality "memory city" of the protagonist, whose identity is obscured at first but ultimately emerges as the player explores various memory fragments.  What appears garbled and contradictory at first transforms into a pleasing, coherent story.\n\nThe only story beat that annoyed was the use of the "scary little girl" cliché, but it's forgivable, largely due to the dynamics of the story itself.  In short, it makes sense.\n\nThe game takes place over three acts, the meat of which is the second act, featuring twelve levels over three stages; within a stage, levels can be visited in any order and abandoned temporarily if a puzzle is too difficult at first.\n\nBy and large the puzzles are easy to solve with a little persistence; often the trick is to simply find and figure out which objects in the world are puzzle pieces.  I did consult a walkthrough once for a challenge that appeared particularly nonsensical (at the end of the School level) - I sadly stand by that decision as the solution required previous memorization of an image not to be found in the puzzle area itself.  There were a few other puzzles that I didn't "get", but which were quickly solvable by "brute force" combination of available elements.  Also, there is a series in act three that will require the use of Steam's built-in screenshot function ... or fraps if you get the non-Steam version.  This was  irksome, but by contrast the great majority of levels are engaging and fun to figure out.\n\nMy entire playthrough took just over five hours.  A short game, but it's all quality time.  If you aren't confronted with a puzzle, you are observing memories and piecing together the story of the central characters or running through the occasional action sequence.  These elements are well mixed with good pacing.  For the completionist, a couple extra hours might be had combing every level for the collectible memories.  I wish I had seen all of them, but I preferred to finish the game rather than essentially "pixel hunt" for every last story clue.  Personally, I dig short games.\n\nOverall, I unreservedly recommend Master Reboot.  It's worth a few hours of your time to find your way through this weird virtual world and resolve a compelling, sympathetic story.\n\nAlso, duckies.","October 28, 2014","true","5.2"," 40 of 43 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","40","43","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/251850/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","Master Reboot is a Sci-Fi First Person Exploration game, set in a virtual world dedicated to store dead people's memories and personalities, so that they're able to relieve their life, and also contact their family and friends, even after their unfortunate death.\nAs you play, you'll uncover more about your past self and a bit about the world by visiting different memories.\nSounds promising, right? Well, it certainly did!\n\n\nSo, let's start with presentation.\n\nFor me, the graphics were a mixed bag, to be honest.\nIn the first level, you're greeted with amazing colors and lightning effects and just really polished graphics overall. While there are sparks of that throughout the rest of the game, it unfortunately falls a bit short of what it showed at the start.\n\nTexture work is almost inexistent at times, with a lot of the game beings mostly shaders and lights/shadows, and not a lot of details on textures, it's mostly just blurred colors.\nThis makes the game look cheaper than it needed at times, specially since we had already seen a better work overall.\nOn the other hand, the lighting effects are still awesome, and it's clearly a focus of the game's artstyle, specially inside the Hub World, with a very Neon feel to it.\n\nBesides, a really huge problem I had was with the brightness balance. This game is way too dark. Seriously, I wasn't able to see, at times (at the Hospital level, experimenting with the achievements). It was literally pitch black. I could change the brightness, BUT, you can't change the settings as you play, and the brightness meter isn't well calibrated, meaning that you can't really know when to stop.\nThat's a bummer. I'll talk more about technical issues further.\n\nAs I said, a mixed bag. Sometimes it looks awesome, other times it just feels rushed and cheap.\n\n\nRegarding music, though, I mostly enjoyed it. It has an eerie feel to it, but it's also beautiful, not just there to make you feel uncomfortable. Besides, it helps create an atmosphere in the several places you visit (i.e.: a circus).\nSoundEffects, on the other hand, felt a bit unbalanced (some of them genuinely bad), sometimes being too loud to the point of distorting the sounds. But, overall, they helped the atmosphere of the game.\nI think it has done its purpose, but overall, it could have been better.\n\n\nSo, how's gameplay, one might ask?\n\nWell, this is where the game falls a bit too short. The game is mostly comprised of several areas (essentially 3 tiers that you unlock as you complete them), each with a certain memory. While there are bits of the game outside of memories, that's where most of the gameplay and exploration is set, so I'll focus on that.\nThere's a hub area, in the virtual world, from which you can choose any of the areas of the available tier. These include place such as an Hospital, a Fairground, a Library, a Flight, and so on. You visit several places from your past life, trying to uncover exactly who you were, and who you were with.\n\nSo far so good, I actually liked the structure of the game.\n\nIn each area, it's more like a puzzle game. You'll have to explore the areas, and try to find out exactly what needs to be done.\nWhile you do that, there are little blue ducks, that give you pictures of a certain memory, a little piece of the puzzle of your past, if you will. These are usually fairly well hidden, and they're basically their reward for exploration.\n\nThese areas, however, have two main problems. The first one, is that they're fairly small, rendering exploration a bit of a relative term, as there's not much to explore. Instead of exploring a big area, you're just looking under benches and the sort. Not very interesting.\nThe second problem, is that most of the puzzles are fairly counter-intuitive, and have barely anything to do with your own purpose or memory. They're just... there. Acting as a hinderance more than a vehicle for the story. And that's unfortunate.\nThey vary from too easy to random, for the most part.\nOn their side though, is that they were certainly varied and SOME of them were pretty well thought and design. Unfortunately, the exception doesn't really make the rule.\nMost of the puzzles feel out of place and with solutions that aren't in any way tied to the memory.\n\nHowever, the areas weren't all just puzzles. They were actually very varied. The Hospital was more of a Horror-themed area, while the Flight was a stealthy mission. It certainly had more to it than I expected, but, the developers didn't seem either experienced or resourceful enough to do it all. The Stealth level was just frustrating at the beginning, but laughable once you figure out what to do. And the Horror level, somehow, managed to be less scary than other levels that were far more oppressive in a subtle way.\nIn general, Master Reboot tried to hard to make a game out of the concept, and feeling a bit to shallow in that regard.\nI can understand why they've done it, but I think they only got sidestracked from the initial concept and ended up not doing either very well.\n\nOne important aspect (for me, at least) is how they've done the achievements. Most of them are only there as an additional bit of challenge to the levels, but, once again, it doesn't add anything to the game. On the contrary, the way you're "encouraged" to play is actually less fun.\nOn the Hospital level, for example, the achievements was to play without the Flashlight. "Well, bring it on, then!"... Boy, did I regret it. It didn't make it scarier. It simply made it frustrating. In many corridors there was literally no light. It was pitch black. I didn't know where to go, and there weren't really any distant visual or audio cues. It was just a case of pressing WASD and hoping I wasn't going against the wall. It was... not a good experience, from a gameplay standpoint.\nThe other achievements seem to follow the same rule, being more of a problem than a cool incentive to play the game in interesting ways.\n\n\n\nAlright, gameplay is out of the way. Now comes the really disappointing part for me.\nYou know, as this was an Exploration game in such a promising world, I didn't care about gameplay too much. I was just expecting great encounters and insight into this future society. Maybe even questioning Death. But... it barely happened, unfortunately.\n\nThis game seemed the perfect way of throwing some ideas at the player through the world itself, but it did none of that. It simply turned into a dramatic story about 2 random people who created the Soul Cloud... just because. No philosophy behind it was explained or even refered throughout the game. It was created in the same way as Facebook, which is disappointing, to say the least.\n\nThe world was there, and you were in it, but you didn't really feel a part of it in any way.\n\nIn the end of each area you get a cutscene about your previous life, but it's just a story about love and friendship with a murder thrown' in the middle to make it seem dark. It's just... shallow, forgeting the initial premise.\n\nMaybe I was expecting too much. Or just something different. And this game wasn't aiming for it.\nWell, maybe. But even in that case, looking back at the game, there's no reason for it to standout, aside from the pretty lighting. Gameplay is just there just to call it a game, as it wasn't the focus at all. The story was far more generic than it could have been with the endless possibilities of the Soul Cloud. The world was far too empty as well, with more focus on real world memories than the virtual world of the undead.\n\n\n\nAll in all, this game is just a missed opportunity. It was set in a great world, full of very interesting concepts. But, it does nothing with it, trying to be too much at once, ending up missing most of its points.\nIt has impressive lightning effects and great audio design, but as a game... there's nothing I can't think of to justify a recommendation.","April 29, 2014","false","4.8"," 56 of 69 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","56","69","0","11"

Missing things like a key/controller config, multiple save slots (or a persistent way to view ducky and animated memories), borderless window, etc. are all minor quibbles that at worst I'd appreciate seeing in future projects.\n\nBut the game so masterfully tells its story that the technical deficiencies don't really diminish my opinion of it, in the end. While there are no major plot twists or unexpected turns, the revelation of the plot as well as exposition on the settings and characters are all slowly dripped to the player in an epistolary style, primarily via documents and photos unlocked by finding the blue duckies in each level. The bits and pieces found reveal just enough to the player that unlocking a new one feels like satisfying detective work.\n\nFurther, the setting and plot serve one another well and like all good sci-fi, they form a sort of feedback loop to make a greater whole than either aspect alone. The concept of the Soul Cloud and all of its implications are borne from the mundane human stories, and the regular lives of the characters are made extraordinary by the cyberpunk setup. Yes, cyberpunk. The game is set in a much nearer future than most cyberpunk sf but the concept of the Soul Cloud would be right at home in Ghost in the Shell - it's essentially one big shell for many many ghosts. The near-future setting helped rather than hindered my disbelief and I could believe that this sort of tech would exist in "tomorrow's tomorrow".\n\nThe only criticism I might lodge at the plot and setting is that there's absolutely no falling action or an epilogue of any sorts, so the end feels just a bit abrupt. This very well could have been intentional as it leaves the player to consider what might happen next, and the ultimate outcome of a "happy" or "sad" ending depends on their own perspective and conclusions drawn. I understand a sequel is also in the works, which at this juncture I am quite looking forward to.\n\nA quick note about the audio/visual aspects, since I feel a review is incomplete without SOME words on that front. The flat-shaded, low-poly look was very effective in cooridination with the shader and lighting effects. I don't have much more to say on this front, but I mean- I took a couple of dozen screenshots (http://steamcommunity.com/id/Junon/screenshots/?appid=251850). The game looks good! As far as audio, I have even less to say here. The soundtrack is largely ambient and the sound effects did their job - I ran into no technical issues or points of aural annoyance.\n\nAll told, Master Reboot is a diamond in the rough. I would heartily recommend it to anyone who can look around a few technical and gameplay frustrations to find an exceptional story. Games like Master Reboot are why I carry a torch for indies.","May 7, 2014","true","15.0"," 30 of 35 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","30","35","0","1"

The whole idea of being in the future where something like Soul Cloud which is storing dead people's memories and souls exists is very interesting. So what happened? Well, the Soul Cloud had crash which corrupted some data. And you have to restore some of them by looking into memories of somebody with said corrupted data. The whole game is split-up into a lot of levels, each one is representing some memory. So you can expect child memories, memories from school, flying, being on beach, everything you can imagine.\nBut it's not a hippie game like you would expect from what I just wrote. I mean, few memories are nice and pleasant, but you will be surprised how scary some of them will turn. And I mean it when I say scary. This is what is this game good at. Atmosphere. Absolutely amazing atmosphere that will suck you into the game. Second good thing is its own art and design style. Music is well placed and everything fits together. The only thing I could reproach is that sometimes you can see that some objects are made pretty poorly. There are just few of them, it doesn't disrupt the game, but let's not pretend they aren't there. Overall the game looks just great. Oh, and I almost forgot! There are puzzles in some levels, but don't worry, if you're not into them. There aren't a lot of them and although they aren't extremely easy, you won't get stuck, I promise!\nSo what is the summary? 9/10.

During the game you get the idea that things like the cyberworld weren’t common, so the memories you visit are relatively normal, like current 21st century experiences people might have as opposed to experiences in the transitioning cyberpunkesque world that the cyberworld exists in. However, the visuals in the game are just what you would expect from a game in the cyberpunk genre when not in the isolated memories. The visuals are relatively simple looking as far as being like crysis, but the style is appropriate for it and works well with the game. The sound in the game is pretty decent, but one of the added things that some may love or hate is that you constantly hear soft shouting or other horror tropes to give off a horror game atmosphere, even when you aren’t being chased by enemies or dangers that should actually give such a feeling.\n\nIn the beginning you are stuck in a town of 'memories' in the cyberworld where you must experience groupings of memories ranging from school to childhood, although you start at childhood, so it reminded me like it was a reversal of the initial memories you go through in To the Moon, although you can choose to complete the memories in each grouped set out of order. As I said before, in each of these memories you must experience, you must find hidden objects and use them, solve puzzles, and avoid possible death as there are sometimes enemies that will confront you. Hidden in each of these memories are blue ducks that will give you some memorable info that adds to the game such as pictures of people the main character knew. I usually don’t collect unnecessary objects, but collecting these really adds to the story and narrative of the game, so gotta catchem all. Every time you complete a memory, you go to a post memory sequence which is usually somewhat unrelated to the memory where you have to solve a puzzle and/or do something under a time limit. Most of the puzzles aren’t too hard, but sometimes it won’t be obvious what to do.\n\nOverall, I found Master Reboot to be a fun game, and if nothing else, its probably one of the few games on steam with the Welsh language option.","May 25, 2015","true","9.6"," 28 of 35 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","28","35","2","0"

Step into the Soul Cloud yourself and learn about the Mysteri Corporation and those involved in it's origins.\n\nSome of the "horror" aspects of the game are predictable, but still managed to frighten me.

I can't believe the 59/100 Metacritic rating, because this game is a masterpiece, BUT not for 14$, which is actually EUR here. The game sure looks a bit outdated, but it's moral question is a thing, which is worth thinking on. So basically we are playing as an unknown girl, who has to relive a person's memories. The connections will be revealed later in the game, and damn, the story is awesome! Each memory is a little puzzle, but unfortunately a very basic one. Each memory consists of two levels. A real memory level, where you relive the person's memory, sometimes interrupted by Seren, and a Zero level. Zero levels are really twisted maps. They aren't the person's memories, but something different. Okay, okay, but you may ask, who the hell is Seren? Well Seren is the character, who gives a little bit of horror to the game. Don't worry, the game isn't a fully horror one, but some levels give me chills on my back, when I play them. Seren's appearance is really cliché, because mostly she can't hurt you (á la F.E.A.R.), and if there is a dark hallway, you can expect her appearance. I think she can only hurt you in 2 levels, but I'm not so sure. If I were a Journalist I'd give the game an 85/100. Why? Because it's really unique. I've never seen any game like this before, and thanks to this game, I will buy Soul Axiom too. Master Reboot is kind of a visual novel in first person view, and a really well-written one. So I'd suggest EVERYONE to pick it up, when it's on Sale (like right now). For 3.50$ / EUR it's a short, but amazing game!\n\nP.s:: If a developer sees this, can you tell me, where should I know the "password" in the library memory?

Master Reboot is plagued by quite a lot of flaws in its execution, from the fumbly aiming to the god-awful and at times pretty annoying sound design (especially the sounds that are endlessly repeated, like Kali's laughter) and the bland music. But these aren't necessarily deal breakers.\nUnfortunately, there's the gameplay. Where other story-centric games of the walking simulator variety have wisely chosen to be as free of traditional gameplay as possible, Master Reboot makes you jump through a series of hoops consisting of disjointed puzzles, brain teasers thrown in your way to slow you down. This, for me, made Master Reboot impossible to enjoy. Where I wanted to simply explore the levels, find snippets of the story and immerse myself in the game's atmosphere, it made me complete unrelated and pointless tasks that caused quite a bit of frustration.","November 9, 2014","false","4.0"," 38 of 57 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","38","57","0","0"

Controls are clunky and the game demands a certain rate of precision, this goes for both mouse / keybaord and controller. It's sometimes unclear what to do and the game offers no help most of the time. Not possible to check keybinds once ingame, so you'd best not forget them. Lastly, I discovered a point where if you click too fast, the whole game crashes to desktop, yet you can only get past the obstacle by clicking fast enough. I know it's called Master Reboot but when I had to restart the game multiple times due to this happening, it turned out quite ironic.\n\nIt's a shame, because the story is good. I could even have forgiven the childish art and basic 3D graphics had the rest of the game been better. But now it just feels like quality control was skimped on entirely. Not sure why there are so many positive reviews, perhaps people hold back because it's a small studio?\n\nAnyway, since I could no longer get a refunds, I decided to give it a go and get the achievements, hoping my mind would get swayed at one point. Alas, it didn't, so unless you want to see for yourself I would not recommend you buy this game.

The self is apparently a collection of ducks that form your memory by that aside… the impending question over the playthrough is what defines us, and could it be possible to clone ourselves in a way so that we are exactly the same without losing something beyond our memories. You play as a female protagonist piecing together the puzzles of both the story and environments she has to explore within Soul Chamber.\n\nHub - Memory replayability\n+Central Hub to play memories again and unlock other ones\n+Lights show status of the doors (open/complete/closed)\n\n-No backtracking once you reach the final level (train)\n-No extras in main menu to visit memories you unlocked\n\nThere is a central hub with doors that lead to certain areas marked with images for the theme. Hospitals, schools, highways, and other themes have all their own puzzles and elements of the story to present to you. You are required to do a set amount of puzzles before the other doors will unlock for you. The doors themselves have light indicators to tell you the status of them, along with bookstands in front of them that allow you to revisit memories. Bookstands outside door shows all info you collected from ducks\n\nAtmosphere\n+Nice Atmosphere and art style\n-Sound quality could be better\n\nThe atmosphere is very eerie with a general feel of isolation from the world. There is just as many environments as there are puzzles. The environments allow you to freely explore to a degree but the area of which you can do so is very small with linear segments. The areas tend to have their own way of artistically showing you hints, from symbols in graveyards to color coded pieces scattered amongst the playground. There are even segments where you have to listen closely to sounds and repeat them in order to proceed though many deem this the most annoying part of the game.\n\nPuzzles - Interaction\n+Great puzzle diversity (sounds,cryptic,etc)\n-Difficulty Inconsistency\n\nThe puzzle diversity in this game ranges from replicating sounds, pictures and figuring out how to navigate through mazes to deciphering symbols, messages, and images.  There are some places where you can do them out of order which tends to lead to inconsistent difficulty, most notably near the end of the game there is 4 puzzles that are simply varying difficulties of the same exact puzzle.\n\nStory\n+Fun Theory Crafting\n-Unsatisfactory Ending\n\nThe ducks (memories) give you hints and glimpses into the memory of your character and the events that have unfold. It is fun making a theory of what occurred as the story unfolds from scenario to scenario until the end of the game though due to lack of backtracking its rather hard to revisit the memories you spent time finding and uncovering. The ending however leaves rather open-ended to speculate to what really happened to your character.\n\nConclusion\nOverall, I would say master reboot is a good game for not only for theorycrafting but for the variety of puzzles that makes the experience kept fresh throughout the game. The main complaints I have is that the rushing I did to collect all the ducks (information) made me incapable of backtracking to look through it all. I plan to play the game a second time and take as much time playing the memories as I do the puzzles in order to get the most enjoyment out of the game possible.\n\nImportant Note: Got paid to do this review by reviews4views","January 21, 2015","true","9.8"," 34 of 51 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","34","51","0","0"

Unfortunatley that's all the positive things I have to say about the game.\n\nThis game would be better off having gameplay similar to Dear Ester because the puzzles are some of the most simplistic and badly designed puzzles I have ever seen. As a toddler did you ever have the toy were you have to fit certian shapes in the right holes? That's the most complicated the games puzzles will get.  On top of that some of the puzzles make absolutley no sense. Heres an example:\n\nDuring the park memories there is a yellow traingle trapped under a jungle gym with no way to retrieve it. How do you think you solve this? Dig under it? Pry the jungle gym open? Nope. There is a triangle shape on the outskirts of the level that you are supposed to fill with a triangle block that is also on near the borders of the level. This items are a decent distance away from the puzzles themselves which in itself makes little sense. So how does placing the yellow triangle in the yellow hole solve the puzzle you ask? It causes a crow on a nearby branch to squawk and the jungle gym blows up.\n\nThe game may have simplistic puzzles by concept but they are made difficult for the player to solve through terrible design. Here is a description of another puzzle:\n\nThe first sequence of the airplane memory has you collecting three key cards that open a door and allow you to proceed. Seems easy right?  The keys are in various different rows of seats in the airplane that all look identical. While looking for the cards an enemy will spawn at the end of the level walking in a straight line towards you. There is no way to avoid this enemy without opening the door so you end up rushing (I would say frantically but that would imply the situation was even remotely scary.) to find the key cards in 30 identical looking seats while the girl comes closer to you down the aisle. It ends up just being a game of constantly respawning while memorizing where the last keycard you found was.\n\nYou may think I'm cherrypicking here but that couldn't be farther from the truth. Every puzzle so far has either been extrememly simple or also confusing and illogical even in the world of the game.\n\nThe game also has a deviant art tier artstyle that makes up the cutscenes and clash extremely with the decent in game graphics. It has horror elements too but they couldn't even scare a skittish cat.\n\nDo I recommend this at full price? No   On sale? Can you stomach crap puzzles for a decent story? If so then yes.","January 5, 2015","false","1.5"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","15","20","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yukichigai/recommended/251850/","yukichigai","Y|yukichigai","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yukichigai/","463 products in account","Master Reboot is one of those games that was not quite what I expected.  I figured I would be playing a tightly plotted sci-horror adventure through the metaphysical realm of someone's digitized mind.  Instead, the game is a far more loosely structured affair, leaving much of the plot and the significance of its setpieces shrouded in mystery and up to the player to figure out on their own.  While it's not what I was expecting, I'd be lying if I didn't say it was still quite good.\n\nAs seems to be a trend in my recent game choices, Master Reboot may be played from the first person, but it is very much in the same thread as the point-and-click adventures of old.  The bulk of the meat the game has to offer comes not in the game's mechanics, but in the information and secrets uncovered as the player progresses through it.  Very little of the game requires fast-twitch reflexes or quick aiming under pressure, though there are a few sequences which will test that.  Overall though, this game is more about piecing together a story.\n\nThe somewhat rudimentary graphics might be a stumbling point for other games, but in Master Reboot it helps set the tone wonderfully, a constant reminder that you are in the digital world, not the physical world.  Even the game's 2d animated memory sequences are explained in game as a limitation of the system, which is a somewhat obvious excuse but a wonderfully executed one all the same.  The impact of the story is not overly dulled by either, and in some cases it makes the experience hit that much harder.\n\nTone-wise, the game rests firmly in the sci-horror camp throughout, with variations in how effective the horror side of it is.  Some of the individual areas are tonally perfect, setting a low background tone of unease and general mistrust of the reality you occupy.  One area in particular presents with strange sparse, generic, unrealistic architecture over a landscape of water, fading into the distance under torrential virtual reality rain, but it's not until you are sent flying from platform to platform that you realize that the water is rising impossibly fast for as far as you can see, and if you don't move quickly it will cover you too.  It's moments like these that Master Reboot delivers.\n\nOther levels do not fare so well, unfortunately, particularly those which rely heavily on jump scares and other such tricks, which may work for a few moments but largely fall flat.  Jump scares in particuar are a bit overused in this game for some things; a ghostly blur running across your vision quickly while a slam sounds in the distance might be spooky at first, but when it happens every single time you come to a specific area in the level it just gets boring and old.\n\nThe takeaway I got from Master Reboot was largely bittersweet but satisfying.  Without spoiling anything, the endings (yes there are multiple) are neither purely happy nor purely sad.  Each is somewhat appropriate for the underlying tragic plot behind the events of the game, though still not as satisfying as they perhaps could have been, in part because the minimalist narrative-free delivery that worked so well for the backstory does not work as well for the ending.\n\nUltimately, I got my money's worth from the game.  It presents gameplay wrapped in tantalizing hints that promise an interesting and unique story, then delivers.","April 11, 2015","true","10.0"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

The game has a very potent and compelling story, that drops inklings along the way, unfolding in clues and in your mind as you piece it all together. If one thing sold me on this game, it was that story.\n\nThe artstyle is interesting - while not the most polished, it is still very alluring and beautiful, landscapes and scenery feel sprawling and endless, and you feel like you could walk forever in a memory (game-sense literally) till you hit the digital perimeter that reminds you that you are in a digital world. It does an excellent job conveying a sense of the surreal, and while not perfect, is more than sufficient.\n\nI could see where elements within the game (as well as moments) tie it to horror, though I would define horror as much more, this game certainly had it's moments that startled me, which I did not forsee being a thing, and to be surprised in that way is always a good thing, feels refreshing and not a rehash of "seen-it-coming"s, though towards the last quarter of the game these moments become more of an annoyance than a genuine disturbance. I would have liked to have seen more of the type of scares you get in the early game, around the late game.\n\nVery little choice, so to call this an exploration game would be inaccurate. The game probably closest fits "Adventure" and "Puzzle-solving" in the Myst-type (showing my age) sense, I suppose but I feel that it doesn't exactly take away from what the game is aiming to offer.\n\nAnd what it is offering is a story. Hands down the #1 reason to play this game. I'm sure you've seen variations of this story elsewhere in other media, but that's likely because it is such an intriguing concept and one that I feel cannot be explored enough so I welcome this game and anything else that shares in the theme.\n\nI vote you play it. Screen shot it, film a "Let's Play!", discuss the ideas the game broaches with others and build on them and expand your mind to something almost otherworldly that is yet still a possibility someday for us.\n\nLastly, just get it because you'll enjoy it and you'll be supporting the Devs and also I love you.","March 27, 2014","true","18.8"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

Part survival horror, part exploration, part...mini games? The problem is that it doesn't do any of them very well, and on the larger levels the slow plodding along of your character is just frustratingly slow. The survival horror parts quickly lose their luster when you figure out that sounds are scripted at certain locations and can be repeated over and over, or that you can meander along in one of the few "chase" scenes without actually having any worry of being caught.\n\nThe story is largely told through finding rubber duckies scattered throughout memories. Some of these, the important ones, thankfully, are easy to find with the briefest bit of looking around. Others are incredibly frustrating due to nearly pixel-perfect jumps and long backtracking times. The end of each memory also has a brief animation revealing some storyline, and I honestly have nothing complimentary to say about them.\n\nThe story itself is rather poorly told, with many of the important plot points feeling forced, and much of the rest of it as completely unrealistic. As an example, being inside the "Soul cloud" for more than a certain time causes your physical body to die, and you become trapped there. You find a company memo stating how they've lost several employees to this, and I can't help but wonder how the company hasn't been sued out of existence.\n\nThere are some interesting bits scattered here and there, but unfortunately that's all there is - interesting bits. The gameplay is dull for the most part, the puzzles simple, the mini games frustrating or unfun at best, the horror isn't frightening - basically, they tried for everything and succeeded at nothing.","December 21, 2014","false","3.7"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

I porbably would have liked the story more if I could understand it, the sound was low and distorted (not due to glitches, on purpose) and I couldn't maek out any of the speech in some very important scenes. It's some kind of horror, but not particularly scary horror. Not quite psychological either. I can't pin down what it is but it was engaging enough for me to sit down and play it all the way through. It's a very short game, might take you 2-3 hours to beat. The puzzles are all EXTREMELY simplistic, most of the time you'll just be going through the motions to find out little tidbits of story told through photograps, notes, emails, and satanic glyphs on the wall, all presented "Gone Home" style... but with ducks. The game has a strange fixation with ducks. I don't know what it means, some kind of in-joke with the developers, maybe. The game explains it as some sort of device for people in a simulation to store data in, but why ducks? There are plenty of conspicuous cubes laying around, why not those?\n\nThis game is one hell of a mixed bag. Maybe it wasn't for me, but lots of people seem to really love it and it was alright. It's not super expensive either, so really the only way to find out if it's for you is to give it a shot.","October 12, 2014","true","2.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

It is a great song to end the game with.\nThe gameplay is also quite fun, as you do different puzzles, and while there are some puzzles that can be quite frustrating to figure out, most of the puzzles are quite fun to figure out.\nSeren.exe, the creepy girl-character that follows you, is at first quite creepy and I definitely got a shock when I first enqountered her, and she definitely fits the creepy atmosphere. However, as the game goes on, her presence can be quickly discovered by the players, and when she isn't killing, but just staring at you creepily, her effectiveness becomes a lot less scary, as I definitely made some jokes in my head about her just standing in the corner not doing anything.\nOverall, a worthwhile game that has a interesting premise and some great atmosphere. It is quite short, but if you like this sort of game, you'll probably get your money worth.","October 29, 2014","true","10.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

It's that damn partial controller support that plagues me.  My d-input controllers have permanent button inversion and my xbox controller auto sidesteps making the random platform elements borderline impossible.  If there was an ingame option screen I could probably just switch to keyboard and mouse (I need to invert the mouse) but no, I have to start the whole level over again.  Anyways:\n\nScale: 1=despised 2=negative 3=could go either way 4=positive 5=loved\n\nGame design: 4/5 The game itself is pretty simple.  Run round in the dark and find clues to the story.  It mixes elements of survival horror (I wouldn't call this an exclusively survival horror game though, very little can actually hurt you), puzzles, platforming, hidden object.  It's actually a good mix, and despite my beef with the platforming, the game itself doesn't feel broken.  Perhaps a bit dated.  3D navigation is a bit clunky, and some of the puzzles don't make any sense (but are still easy), but none of it actually gets in the way of gameplay.  Maybe you could call this game "casual horror"?\n\nTone: 3/5   The largest problem with the game is it's selection of advertised screenshots.  It has some cool and haunting imagery, but like the game play, there ir a mix of styles present.  There are weird little cutscenes at the end of each level that look like they were made in Flash.  The impression of the game is a bit different than what is actually there, granted that it is difficult to present a game with this much variety.  It simply might not be the epic horror mystery that you are looking for.  The concept is great, but the story is overly simple and a bit confusing.  I don't know if the game intends to keep you guessing about which girl is which, but I'm still getting them mixed up.  I can nitpick more but ultimately it doesn't interfere with the experience that much.  I really want to enforce that this game is actually quite casual, don't expect anything mindblowing and you should enjoy it.\n\nPersonal skew: 2/5 I'm not mad anymore, and might attempt that last level again.  Hardcore gamers will find this game easy and possibly laughable, I don't think that most will feel it to be a waste of time, but some definitely will.  Casual gamers will get the most out of this, especially if you're interested in horror games but don't want to be overwhelmed.","October 31, 2014","true","7.8"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

I can see that on their new game "Soul Axiom" which sets the surreal environment and awesomeness of the game on a whole new level. Also the graphics match those of an AAA game. But enough with that, this is a review about Master Reboot!\n\nThis game has an immense storyline which you have lots of things to explore if you like giving attention to details.\nYou might be confused or feeling lost at first but giving attention to the cutscenes and clues found, you will feel like you're reading a very well written book. If you're looking for a casual game and not like paying attention this game is probably not for you, you will not understand anything about the story.\nEverything makes sense eventually and oh, its goooood.\n\nThe environment of this game is awesome, most sceneries are surreal and the ambient sounds make the mystery atmosphere even better.\nMost of the puzzles are great, actually I believe it's the way puzzles in games are supposed to be these days. Some of them are too easy, but most of them are clever and you can complete them pretty fast once you get them.\nThis game is about exploring, solving puzzles,finding items and how to use the and avoiding dangers. You won't be finding yourself shooting at stuff\nWell, unless some fake ducks with a fake gun\nAlso, this game has several scenes that might make your heart beat quite faster, so i wouldn't suggest this to the weak hearted.\n\nIf you like indie and/or horror/mystery/atmospheric games , this is one of the best games I could suggest.\nActually it's the best, because the devs are awesome. They always pay attention to the community and care about what we want. Also from personal experience I had a problem with my steam key and they helped me almost instantly after I mailed them, with a very polite and friendly way. Cheers to the devs.\n\nLast but certainly not least,\nThe ending song is awesome! Seriously, if you re a bit emotional it could give you tears.\n\nSo.. synopis:\n\n✔ Mystery/horror atmosphere\n✔ Immense, well written storyline (that however requires for you to explore, you wont get it only from cutscenes)\n✔ Great graphics for an indie game\n✔ Very well optimised\n✔ Awesome devs\n✔  AWESOME ending song!","October 6, 2015","true","10.3"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

The gameplay is mostly simple yet extremely satisfying puzzles with a few other bits and pieces thrown in here and there for variety. The story is great and hidden throughout the levels are more bits of information, this way of feeding you the plot bit by bit and allowing you to piece it all together is very engaging. I have two minor complaints. The first play through only took about 4 hours and it left me wanting more.

The style was fantastic, the story was pretty nifty, the gameplay and puzzles were good but not great. Worth.\n\nTook about 3-4 hours to complete, and I'm a pretty slow gamer. Plan on another playthrough for achievements.\n\nThe world you're thrown into is queer and rather unsettling. You're never really directly told the plot in game, instead you're left to piece it together through notes you find (blue duckies) and scenes during memories (the puzzle/exploration stages to progress the game). I honestly got scared a few times, but I'm an incredibly big wuss so that doesn't say much.\n\nThe puzzles range from really simple, to somewhat abstract. I remember one frustrating part I couldn't pass (plane memory) that I looked up because I really just couldn't figure out what I was doing wrong. There are a couple situations that are more "platform" like but generally you're just walking around figuring stuff out/not peeing your pants avoiding Seren.\n\nI really loved the art style. Chunky, blocky shapes and contrasting colors. Vaguely reminded me of Mirror's Edge. The music/sounds really help sell the mood. Watching the main hub get filled up with stuff from the memories was cool too.\n\nDefinitely worth a try.","December 6, 2014","true","5.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I must be out of my mind.  It keeps moving to the left or forward ALL THE TIME.  I even changed controllers and got the same issue.  That said, I lowered my head and decided I will finish this game without a mouse - or at least 95% without a mouse. Why?  Originally because I tend to game from my mediorce HTPC in my bedroom on my bed.  Then, it became a fully motivated goal to me - I MUST DO THIS.  I CAN BEAT IT WITH WONKY CONTOLS. I CAN!  Keep in mind i am *not* a very good gamer nor am I fast.  Just determined.\n\nI was doing okay until the airplane level.  Oh man.  Needs a KB & mouse, Needs a KB & mouse.   Had to play with both while jumping between controller and keyboard because i wanted to finish with the controller as much as possible.\n\nThen it was not terrible.  I mean, I'd start levels immediately walking into walls with my hands OFF the controller but okay.   I can do this.  Just keep starting and stopping ....over and over. Jumping back all the time.  No sweat.\n\nThen, comes the light maze in the dark. AAWRHRRHGHGHGHRH.  That probably added an extra hour or two to the gameplay.\nJust walking to edges as well as  can, only for the controller to suddenly start sidestepping to the right and fall off.  That happened so much.  Got really good at stopping. and falling. But made it through.\n\nLastly, the end level.  C'mon 3 minutes to finish all that?????  I could get everything just fine - 4 of those puzzles no big deal.\nThe platforming one??? On a controller that moves like a marbles on a plate?  Took me about 4 hrs.  Always, finishing all the easy puzzles and then stuck on platforming till the clock ran out.  When I actually completed that last level - with 30 secs to go mind you -  I don't think I've felt an accomplishment like that in quite a long long time.  It's no picnic on KB & Mouse, but to know that i did on my xbox controller give me so much pleasure.  Like finishing a super hard college course final.\n\nOn to the game .  Really, everybody has said everything on this already.  It's enimatic and throws you in unexplained.  There are parts that kind of stick with you and a few puzzles where I said " Oh! Really? That's it?? Did I solve that by accident?" .  And there are quite a few of " Oh no. no. no. no.  Not like that.  Don't do that.  That's just mean."  Yes, there are some scary bits but it's not really terrifying.  The original ideas and gameplay kept me going quite a bit.  But it was the challenge of the controller scheme that made me finish it really.  I wanted to beat it my way. And I did.  Game was good too.   My next will be point and click, honest.","July 22, 2014","true","19.7"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","4"

The polish is not there, the ideas are sometimes half-baked, but overall this is a fun game, at the right price. I found it to be a lot like something David Lynch might have done back in the eighties, around the time of Dune. The game does not hold your hand and instead let's you solve most things on your own, there are clues from time to time. Sometimes the path is so obvious it feels rushed and other times it is so obscure it becomes frustrating.\n\nThe visual style is something I enjoyed when the textures were not so muddy, it made me wonder why it wasn't polished more. I am not certain how big the team was behind this game, but I have seen a team of four put out something far better looking than this. Now, the lighting is well implemented, but the over all look of the game comes across as rushed. There are levels that seem forced due to how they rendered the environment, it looks like some student project out of Unity from time to time. This really takes away from the real well done segments, that seem to set you up for a great experience, just to let you down again.\n\nThe music is fantastic, being the real strongpoint of the game. I'm surprised it was not used more often, especially during the art cut scenes, that turn out to be sloppy due to a lack of music. Over all the animations are good enough to not make you feel ripped off, but I could not expect you to get fifteen dollars worth of gameplay out of this. For the five I paid, I am  very happy with the game and it would be so much greater if he price was less.\n\nAll in all, this is a game I enjoyed playing for the most part. The story could have been better, but it works well enough to make you think at bit. There really isn't any voice acting, but when there is it works. There were times when I really wanted to like this game more than I do. It never let me down completely, but it also didn't blow me away. If it is less than ten dollars, pick it up. Otherwise wait it out.\n\nThe more I think about it.

If you're a completionist and happen to find all the rubber ducks, you'll understand the context, but outside of that, this game will only confuse more with its rather poor excusues.\n\nBasically (and you don't find this out until the end of the game, but I'm also trying to save you money) you play some chick named Madison who invented the "Soul Cloud" with a dude named David or something, I actually already forgot. Anyway, they invent the soul cloud under this company named Mysteri in the year 2026 where technology is supposedly going to be futuristic just like how it was in George Orwell's 1984. Anway, the whole game takes place in the soul cloud where users can place their memories and re-experience them for a limited amount of time. At least that's what I took away from it. This guy David is murdered by someone named Astrid, I never caught the relationship between Astrid and Madison, but I believe they knew each other. Also, Astrid had died four years prior but was brought back to life; don't understand how that works, but alright I'll let it slide. So Madison is in the soul cloud because of some virus that is shown to have been sent to Madison from an anonymous user, the virus basically effed up the cloud, the virus being named a bunch of random letters and numbers.exe. Madison, being so tech smart inventing some crazy idea, opens the virus which infiltrates the clouds servers, deleting people's data. A bunch of stupid people are mad as shown in "tweet" like this one, "i haet teh sole cloude". Yeah, that's right, people in the future are still terrible at spelling.\n\nSo that's basically the story, the gameplay involves you, Madison, navigating your own memories just to get to the virus. Basically, the giant library room that becomes this platforming nightmare has the virus which is really just a digital and angry Astrid that you've probably seen throughout the game acting like Alma from the FEAR games. The memories range from your childhood to your romantic feelings with David, rather generic to be honest. Also, the game is supposed to be a sort of horror game, but the jump scares were laughable. I feel like there was supposed to be emotion with the memories, but the emotion was detached due to the lack of narrative mentioned earlier. The Stanley Parable had more emotion.\n\nThe graphics were toon shaded without the black edges which were explained in game due to the soul cloud being in the early stages. As George Carlin would say, "Bull-sh!t", the toon shading is a cop out, especially when it doesn't even look good. I mean, at least Gearbox makes Borderlands look awesome. This was rubbish. It doesn't help when the devs make an excuse of in game graphics being toon shaded and then the actual memories are 2D flash animated or puppet pinned from After Effects. You'd think that the memories themselves would be detailed 3D considering that they're taken from the human's mind? Think of the film Final Cut starring the late, great Robin Williams. The memories that he works with are fully realized and completely real, in the flesh. The 2D is such a cop out, what rubbish.\n\nThe music and sounds were the only good thing, as they were both evidently creepier than the game itself. And even then, the sounds had some weird mixing.\n\n4.0/10","September 11, 2014","false","3.9"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

The visual style (to begin with) was very appealling, what with the spooky mist lit forest and the watery pool. But pretty soon the game descends into a hub based puzzler. Solve the puzzle, return to hub, solve next puzzle, wrince and repeat. At least, that's as far as I could stand to go.\n\nThe game's mechanics let it down a little. No crosshair, so no way to guage whether or not you're on target with picking things up, and since some of the puzzles are timed that becomes an issue. Click, miss, die, repeat! Also, the controls felt a little twitchy. There were some graphical glitches too.\n\nThe puzzles were rather obscure, and not very challenging. Just annoying. Rock three black hobby horses in the right order to activate two pink hobby horses. Why? How do the puzzles relate to the memories I am trying to recover? I don't feel connected in the least bit to the life I allegedly once had.\n\nThe welsh flavour to the game would have been nice had it been profesionally presented, but it just came over as a wee bit too much Shadwell and not enough Tom Jones.\n\nA nice effort, but falls well short of the mark.","January 29, 2014","false","2.6"," 17 of 31 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","17","31","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/masterevilace/recommended/251850/","masterevilace","A Fancy Fridge Magnet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/masterevilace/","707 products in account","Highly stylized puzzle / platformer game where you play through memories to uncover the story. The trailer makes the game seem like constant super-intense action, but it's actually really well paced, and feels more like exploration than anything.\n\nThe story really has to be pieced together through scraps of details to get the most out of it, which I'm not really good at while playing... so the details of the story didn't really influence my enjoyment of the game any, but the basics of the story really added to the experience of the memories I think, given how they tended to be unnerving in nature.\n\nThe art style in this game is really beautiful. Simple texture work and geometry, along with lots of bloom effects, shadows, and saturated lighting create really atmospheric dream-like levels. In some places the textures seem low-quality and ugly, but for the most part everything fits together better than most indie games manage to pull off. There are a bunch of cartoony vector art / cut-scenes which feel a bit out of place, but they're not bad. They remind me of Mirror's Edge's cut-scenes, and how they were a vastly different style from the actual game itself. There's also a lot of REALLY well done painted-style art, which was great to find.\n\nThe sound design is extremely well done in this game... lots of stereo sound effects that add to the creepiness of the memories. The music itself is really great, and adds tension in all the appropriate places, and doesn't stick out while playing. It's really easy to slip into the experience they were trying to provide in this game.\n\nThere really isn't a tutorial in this game... pretty much just action icons that appear when you can interact with something. You start off knowing absolutely nothing about your character or where you are.. so you wander around and discover things on your own. Even so, it's pretty straight forward, and you can't really do much other than progress forward, but it still feels more open than it actually is, which is pretty good.\n\nThe majority of the puzzles in this game offer absolutely no explanation, so you have to really be observant, or resort to trial and error methods to solve them. At the beginning of the game discovering the solutions to the obscure puzzles felt super rewarding but later on just felt frustrating because they were so obscure. The puzzles aren't particularly difficult, and you can often find the solution in a couple of minutes. There are many clues to how to solve the puzzles in the design themselves, just through the use of things like color-coding. Some puzzles do have blatant hints, and some puzzles are based purely on memory or being able to repeat a pattern. I only really had an issue with a couple puzzles, and had to resort to trial and error simply because they weren't clear enough... so even though I was still able to solve them, I didn't necessarily know WHY it was the answer.\n\nThe puzzles are really just a way to complete each memory sequence, to reveal the explanation of that memory. Within each memory there are things you can interact with in order to get more snippets of the story. Along the way there are occasional platforming scenarios, and even some time-based action sequences. I didn't really like the platforming, as I would tend to misstep and fall to my death constantly... but the action sequences were much better as they really added tension and creepiness to the game.\n\nThe game took me around 4-5 hours to complete, which includes trying to find as many hidden things as possible, and lots of restarts due to platforming fails. There are a few wonky bits in the game (where you just wonder why the hell it was included), but way more memorable bits to offset them. The game most reminds me of Among Sleep, but similarish games include The Path, Kairo, and Antichamber.\n\nThis might also be the first duck-based video-game I've ever seen...","June 21, 2014","true","4.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's kind of sci-fi and kind of horror with lots of walking around and a little puzzle solving. But the story comes from finding ducks. Yes, little blue squeaky ducks. Ducks give little bits of story details in each level. Nothing is particularly explicit in Master Reboot, except the animated cutscenes at the end of each level, with each level being someone's memory. Who that someone is, who you are, and who's trying to stop you is all part of the story you'll have to piece together from animated cutscenes and ducks.\n\nBut it still mostly works. The pacing is a bit off, but if you play the levels "in order" (there is no numbered order, but levels unlock in groups and you can play them in a sequential order) you'll probably get the story by the time you get to the end. It's short, less than 3 hours beginning to end, but interesting enough. It's clearly a student effort but it's neat and weird.","June 22, 2014","true","2.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cpacifying/recommended/251850/","cpacifying","cpacifying","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cpacifying/","100 products in account","Master Reboot Is not easy to evaluate. It contains both brilliant findings and significant drawbacks.\n\nFirst, drawbacks.\nGameplay is the worst thing in this game. Complete linearity is not an issue, as storytelling manner and diverse surroundings keep brain busy, not letting you get bored. What is a gameplay issue - combined lack of complexity and lack of originality. You start playing a level, get grasp of what needs to be done, and then level ends. In gameplay perspective, Master Reboot is a collection of tutorials for different games: stealthy hide-and-seek, tetris-like car avoidance game, time race, Mario-like platformer and some more. Only gameplay elements that develop are exploration and puzzle-solving. Still, they are quite primitive. To say something pleasant, I will admit that one of the puzzles is truly brilliant and original. One out of circa two dozens. Four of which are actually the same puzzle that needs to be solved four times in a row (did I told you about lack of originality?)\nArt is second drawback. Everything player sees looks like it is made from plasticine. I am no fan of fancy graphics, but rectangular beds with rectangular pillows on them are a little too schematic even for me. Maybe this style is derived from Psychonauts, but somehow there it looked good and here it looks bad. Player gets ambushed by a ghost from a closet three times, and all those three times - same fighting animation of same models in same position (yes, 'position', not 'positions'). Sound sample library is quite small, you can hear recurring sound patterns. It all damages immersion into atmosphere badly, constantly reminding you that you are interacting with a simulation of simulation. Needs to be said, not all art is that bad - papers you find in blue ducks and drawings in Goddess of Death signs are actually awesome.\nProgram names in Soul Cloud have .exe extension. Designers, are you kidding? You telling me that enormous cloud solution capable of holding human personality inside itself will run on Windows? No surprise it turned out so easy to hack!\n\nNow, merits.\nGame contains cool mechanic of hacking wood with an axe. I enjoyed it a lot. Also, axe is ultimate hacking tool in this game. Just great.\nDespite all those bad things I said about art, game atmosphere is clearly an advantage. Struggling with unknown world, recombining story of your life piece by piece and constant threats from Serene create great immersion and motivation to move on. Characters are good, their dramatic experience is interesting and understandable. Only exception is David, which looks like more of a human-like decoration than a living person. Antagonist deserves explicit kind word, as he is not a brutal destroyer, as it often happens, but a crazed creator.\nThe strongest aspect of Master Reboot is storytelling (and, for that, I am ready to forgive all its drawbacks). What starts looking like simple cyberpunk narrative about people losing their personalities in a world of soulless demonic machines, slowly and subtly turns into story about people, whose struggle, hard work and love changed world, and reminds us about simple but important thing - machines can never change who we really are, only we can. It reminds us that tools we create can make our lives easier and happier, but they cannot make us kind, selfless, diligent and rational, as they cannot cure envy, malice or infantility.\nIt reminds us that greatest threat for any human being is another human being, and that no machine should be feared more.\n\nThis is not a game everyone would enjoy. But it surely is a good finding for those who are attuned to cyberpunk, used to complicated storytelling, and like asking questions about nature of human personality.","June 27, 2014","true","8.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Wales Interactive estimates it has about 8 hours of play. I completed it in just 4. There are still achivements to be completed of course, but these are no substitute for actual content.\n\nDespite this, I wholeheartedly recommend this game, just not to everyone. I reccomend it for those who have patience and are unafraid of considering their own mortality.

Then this might just be the game for you.\n\nFirst off this game took me by surprise. Although not as polished as a triple-A title it has a unique charm about it that draws you in and keeps you interested. The whole story behind this game is very intriguing and reminds me of very few other titles. And although the storyline was thin it was highly engrossing and kept me hooked right until the end. I just wanted to know more and find out everything I could about the world around me and the people in it.\n\nThe level designs are tremendous; they have a charm about them that is just so unique and imaginative. Every single one of them offers something different to all the others, I loved just looking at everything around me and taking it all in each time. The characters are pretty interesting and every titbit of information I gleamed helped me feel immersed in these people’s lives and how you ended up lost in this world. The art style is great, very colourful, striking and a word I keep using unique.\n\nThe gameplay is good too, a first person exploration game across a huge variety of stages, each with its own goals and objectives completely different to all those before. The puzzles are not the most difficult but offer enough satisfaction when you manage to figure them out. The enemy in this game takes on the form of a malevolent all powerful AI, as they often do, who will stop at nothing to destroy you. When she chases you it can be a little tense that’s for sure.\n\nThe price tag is little high on this one but if you see it on sale it is well worth a play through. It may take a short time to really get into but once it’s sunk its teeth in there is no letting go.\n\nHave fun ^_^","June 28, 2014","true","8.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You are basically trapped inside someone's memories that have been stored in a computer while you attempt to escape from and destroy a virus.  Gameplay consists of solving puzzles to explore the memories and some occasional simple combat.  Most of the puzzles are straightforward which is a nice change of pace from some other games I've played recently.\n\nWhile the game doesn't start well with a rather poor introduction/tutorial level, it gets a lot more interesting later.  You make your way through memories of someone's life, slowly learning about their life as you progress.  Along the way you will find collectibles that give you more information about this person's life related to the memory they are found in.\n\nGraphically, the game is nothing special.  It uses a low detail art style with a dark horror-like atmosphere to emphasize the fact that you are inside someone's memories inhabited by a virus.  It works well, though the way colors are handled leads to some nasty color banding and really poor contrast in places.\n\nOverall I definitely enjoyed Master Reboot.

Each level is unique and offers a variety of simple or challenging tasks (puzzles, finding items, stealth quests, survival), which makes the game a lot of fun to play.\nI really enjoyed the horror elements. The little scary girl may be a clishé, but it's one I like and I think it's very well executed in this game. The abandoned hospital stage is pretty terrifying and when the game wants to be scary, it certainly manages to.\nThe only thing I found a bit disappointing is how little time they give the story to conclude at the ending. Also, the intro stage didn't seem to be very appealing. But once you're out of the woods (literally), the real entertainment begins.

This game has moments where it shines and moments where you're gonna scratch your head and think why the developers did what they did.\nWhere it shines:\n-The atmosphere of the game. This game is one of the best atmospheres that I've ever experienced. I am big into technology and cyber/sci-fi genre and that is where this game has so many brownee points.\n-The forshadowing and the mystery. The game is good where you start and barely know whats going on and once you start progressing, you start to figure things out and then things start to click together.\n-The art/graphics. The art and graphics of this game are so unique! You wont ever find a game like this that is in the horror/mystery genre that incorporates a cyber and technology feel while trying to spook you out at the same time. The graphics in this game are amazing. There would be times where I would just postpone solving puzzles just to walk around and take screenshots.\n\nWhere it needed some leverage/extra hand:\n-The story is good and all but at the end of it , I found myself asking more questions and using a search engine to fill in the holes\n-The cutscenes are good but it goes back to my first point that they had more questions raised than answered\n-The story sometimes went to dissapointing parts that you hope it would not go to or you're sitting there thinking of a cliche you've already seen.\n\nOther than that. I still recommend this game based upon the gameplay mechanics and definitely the environment/art in this game. Don't focus on the story aspect as much or it'll be mediocre.

That statement is twofold. I'm happy I played the game, but I'm also happy I only paid the sale price for it. Overall, it was a positive experience, but there were some sections that were personally frustrating.\n\nThe negatives: The most frustrating thing for me was the platforming elements. I imagine if you're a gamer who likes platforming games, that they will probably be easy and no cause for concern. I however am not a platform gamer and there were a couple sequences in the last level that I found rather frustrating. Second, the collection elements of the game slow you down as you go through levels and can remove the tension that this type of horror game wants to create and destroy it. A minor complaint I have was the "bell" puzzle in the last level, this a musical puzzle and I'm basically tone deaf. Again, this may not be a problem for all players but it was for me. Finally, some of the animated 2d art was at a lower quality than the rest of the game, it was very notable in several of the close up shots on hands.\n\nThe positives:\nThe storytelling. Oh, the storytelling. The world setting was personally appealing to me, with fun touches of science-fiction. More importantly though, was the core story itself. I won't say a lot, so as to avoid spoilers, but following the twists and turns of these young women's lives was a very entertaining experience and it made for a fun psychological thriller. The method of story presentation added a lot to the game as well. A lot of the story was told through single still images that you found as “memories” located throughout the game. Stopping to search for these did hurt the ambiance, as I previously mentioned, but it did make for a rewarding experience as you worked to uncover the truth of what had happened. In retrospect, it is rather ironic that one of my personal gripes about the game also contributed to one of the parts I enjoyed the most. The level design was done well and did have a good feel to it when you were moving through it at a reasonable pace. The last pro I want to list is the 2d art that found by viewing the tattoo glyphs (and in the final level, on the walls) was creepy, disturbing, beautiful and technically accomplished.\n\ntldr; The game has flaws, but if you like horror and don’t hate platforming elements, its worth playing. The story is a blast to uncover.","December 31, 2014","true","8.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The idea is very original and it works.\n\nThough it is a very short game, the mysterious story unravels itself ever so slightly in sections, yet the plot behind this is still somewhat bleak. This I quite enjoy as it allows the audience to give a personal interpretation of the story.\n\nIt gets straight into the action, unlike many games which have a strenuous introduction, complemented by a ton of cutscenes and such. Action is definitely what the game should be focused on, and right here, Wales Interactive have certainly nailed it.\n\nThe strange and mysterious worlds, dark and strange themes mixed in with a slight hint of shock horror, all in an indie game? Yeah, definitely worth it.\n\n10/10 for me, no doubts about it.\n\nAn hour or so's worth of playtime, a whole lot of memories (pun intended).","September 26, 2014","true","8.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are clues hidden everywhere in the game, and they're mostly mementos, messages, pictures and other what-not - not to mention that the worlds you travel through are based on memories). There is something really engaging about trying to piece together all the clues you have uncovered in a way that makes sense...

The entire game takes place in a virtual world where the soul purpose of this world is to house digital copies of dead loved ones for the living to go visit. The concept is pretty awesome and the game pulls off this idea quite well, despite there being some pretty annoying flaws in the actual gameplay. Even with it's flaws, Master Reboot managed to keep me entertained till the very end, while also bringing out the emotions, which few games are capable of doing. That part alone warrants this game a 7/10. Anywho, here are some pros and cons of Master Reboot\n\nThe Pros:\n- Style - The game has a unique look/style too it that is well done\n- Sound - Makes great use of ambient effects, perfect with headphones\n- a variety of different environments keeps the game fresh\n- The puzzles were good\n- A Good game-length for what kind of game this is\n- A Fantastic Story that can get pretty emotional at times, atleast for me it did.\n- Very atmospheric\n\nThe Cons:\n- Pathetic Jump scares\n- Not scary at all\n- Terrible hit detection\n- recycled monster screams.\n- clunky platforming\n- The Price is a little high, best to get this game when its on sale\n\nIn Conclusion, Master Reboot is a very good game despite its short comings. I can def. see this becoming a cult classic. Its one of the most original games I've ever played.","March 18, 2015","true","4.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

At times it feels unpolished, but for an indie game it’s possible to overlook that simple fact (not to say that just because it’s an indie game that it can get away with it either). If you’re looking for a fairly short and simple puzzle game with a little atmosphere (which was what I expected it to be), and can look past the annoying horror elements, then I’d recommend you get this on the cheap like I did.”\n\n6.5/10 TJBs","January 26, 2015","true","2.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Even though the graphics aren't the latest and greatest, I still enjoyed the visual experience quite a bit. There was a nice variety in the levels. Some levels are about exploring, some are more about puzzle solving, and yet others are more action-oriented. To be honest, I figured out the plot early on. But that didn't matter much, as each level was kind of a mini-game in-itself.\n\nIt's definitely not the scarriest game. But, I see it as more horror-style than survival horror if that makes sense. I think if you like the visual aspects of horror and cyberpunk, this is one worth checking out. I got it on a Steam Cyberpunk game sale, but I think it's worth $15. Ran OK on my 2011 iMac. Some of the cutscenes popped and crackled a bit. The gameplay itself was adequately smooth, but not terrific.\n\nTo sum up, I'm looking forward to Soul Axiom.","July 3, 2015","true","5.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The story is one you have to be thinking about the whole time, as it's given to you in pieces, and the details at first are very confusing because of how general they are, later though, they get more detailed and as you start actively piecing them together, the core of the story starts becoming known.\n\nA fair bit of warning is that the story requires a decent amount of interpretation on your own part. As well as this is a puzzle game, it is very well done, and some of them you really have to think for. This also goes to say that it's got horror in the mix, and I'm glad to say there are some parts where generally I felt pretty scared, and the environment and audio does a decent job of adding to the horror (not to mention the game does some pretty scary things too, however it's something to be experienced, so I'll just leave it at that.)\n\nAt first I thought it was going to be something like Amnesia, where you're gonna have to run and hide from the spooky scary peoples... Glad to tell you that's not the case, maybe there is one instance where it feels like that, but thankfully it's not painful to get past. Don't let that make you think that this game isn't scary though, it was at least to me, generally a decent horror game where I felt anxiety at parts to continue, however the story is what kept me moving, I wanted it to finish, and I feel that this was the best way to tell the story for the style of game that it is.\n\nIt meant sitting down after playing it, and having to think about all the pieces and put them together piece by piece to get to the point where I could comprehend the plot in its entierty, like a book. It was more then likely in my opinion the best way to tell the story, not only that but the mental workout of piecing things together while solving puzzles really gave me this feeling of satisfaction and giddiness. I haven't had to sit down and piece together a story in a long time, as well as I haven't played a good puzzle game that didn't involve trying to break space and time, in a very very long time. So it was a very nice refreshing change from the usuall games I have been playing.\n\nI would most certainly recommend this game if you like thinking, especially when it comes to story, and enjoy puzzles.","December 29, 2013","true","3.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

One or two of the puzzles are, however, a bit too obscure and trial and error but they are far and few between and doesn't detract from the overall experience.\n\nMaster Reboot's artsyle looks utterly gorgoues. It helps build a fantastic sense of atmosphere and suspense and the excellent use of shadow and lighting makes some parts of the game breathtakingly pretty and some parts genuinely tense and creepy during it's horror moments.

I did not like the fact that you can not make saves. The game saves for you and does not really tell you when. Now if I want to try for more acheivments I have to start over. Graphics are basic, but with the brilliant light added it gave life to it. The horror/thriller aspect I think needed to be intensified a bit.

The graphics are horrible except for a few effects.\nThe bulk of game consists of a hub area from where you can access other levels by entering the scattered buildings.\nEach has a theme, for example: Hospital, Graveyard, Fairground, Childhood, Street.\nSome challanges: Shoot targets in a fairground booth, replay a tune on a little musical instrument, assemble a picture, precision jumping, finding objects in the dark with a flashlight.\nIf I had to come up with an explanation how this game came to be, I would say, the developers played around constructing stereotypical mock-maps, such as a playground, a library, a hospital, all very barren and simple and when they had around 10 of these, they tied them together with the concept, that it's all the digitalized memories of a deceased person.\nI didn't enjoy the game after maybe the first hour, but completed it out of compulsion or because I payed for it, I don't know, I wanted to see how it ends. Lowest quality of a game I've ever paid for.\nWant to address the positive stuff too, but I'm really struggling with it. Sometimes I felt that the minds behind this have some interesting thoughts but since I'm not their parent I'll focus on the major impression of the game which is poor design and gameplay not on the lingering suggestion of something good.\nThe only people I can recommend this to, are the welsh, to support their home team if they like.","September 13, 2015","false","6.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

There's several in this game; and while they're not so prevalent that they get annoying; some just seem unnecessary.\n\nLevel design felt average; with nothing standing out that made me excited. Some were cool ideas, while some felt tacked on just to add another puzzle.\n\nThe dev's have gone with a sort of "abstract art" sheme with polygons and 'blocky' models. While this is all good when done right; sometimes it seems they did it simply to "cut corners". Some models look straight out of a game from the mid-90's (i.e. the airplane). Round objects like pillars and orbs have straight edges; a lot of textures are very low quality or non-existent, and lighting felt very basic. It's as if they went for a cell-shaded game but didn't quite commit.\n\nThis doesn't necessarily take away from the game, but it definitely doesn't add to it; and there several times when I was left wondering "why did they do that?"\n\nThe puzzles range from your typical "library maze" and "simon says" to some that are so abstract and "outside of the box" that they become frustrating.  Most of the puzzles are "trial and error"; with nothing really explaining what the goal is.\n\nSome are so "out there", that it takes incredibly long to do something that should be simple. This leaves you wandering around trying to find anything that you might have mised; when usually there nothing else and it's just by chance or luck that you figgure it out.\n\nSome puzzles are designed well, but are frustrating because of poor level design i.e. switches that don't work unless you're in the perfect spot; activating switches that are close to others will activate the undesired one; or something hiding in the shadows. It feels very clunky and unintuitive compared to most puzzle games.\n\nThe story itself is interesting; but it suffers from the long "pauses" of trying to solve these abstract puzzles that don't relate in any way to the story, and you start to loose interest. There's also no voiceovers for the cutscenes showing the "past"; so you sit in complete silence watching the story unfold.\n\nIn a game like this, lighting is key. However, while the "ambient" lighting is fantastic; lighting on objects and models is horrid. There is no dynamic lighting, so you don't get the "shadow play" effect that creeps you out even more.\nStatic shadows are grainy, murky messes. The flashlight (which is only in a few levels) only lights up a (polygon) cone and doesn't cast shadows and is full of glitches. Most un-lit corners are pitch black while there's a light 2 feet away. This actually takes away from the game as it keeps players from exploring, (or even seeing) most of the level.\n\nAll in all, it's an OK game with very few good puzzles, and while the story is presented poorly, it's not a terrible premise. If you get this game I'd recommend getting it during a sale, so if you get frustrated you don't feel so guilty about letting it go.\n\nI can only recommend this game if you get it for cheap, and\or if you REALLY like puzzle games no matter how abstract or obtuse they are.\n\n6\10","January 16","true","5.7"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

You go through several different digitized environments basically collecting clues and solving puzzles that gradually unfold the story, though there is very little in the way of direct conversation. It fits well with the theme and you may feel a bit like a detective as you try to piece together just what is going on. Ultimately, a fair bit is left to your imagination.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gmrleon/recommended/251850/","gmrleon","Gmr Leon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gmrleon/","269 products in account","Check. Everywhere.\n\nThis is a very curious game. Not quite horror, nor what I'd call a thriller. It's perhaps best characterized as a somewhat dark puzzle game, I'd say. It does try to surprise you here and there, but it's often very reliant on you going along the predicted path, which in some areas, they simply couldn't predict. In that regard, if you're looking for something to scare or frighten you, I wouldn't recommend this.\n\nIf you're instead looking for a puzzle game with some visually distinctive areas, however, you can't go too wrong with this. The environments choose style over photorealism, which works to varying degrees (some areas had some visuals that looked slightly off, in an unintended way to me) with it working well, more often than not. I've only played it lightly and already in recalling it, couldn't help wondering whether it had been a dream or an actual memory. As it would turn out, it was a memory of one of the levels in the game, which I think speaks to the striking style of the game.\n\nThe story itself is enough to keep you guessing a little and keep you playing, but as I state at the start, you really are better off looking carefully to understand it, as far as I'm concerned. You might be able to get by with the bare minimum, but I know my initial guesses were quickly thrown off by some additional information I found, which is either a positive or a negative, depending on how much you like searching areas thoroughly.\n\nAltogether, I'd have to say this doesn't strike me as being a forgettable experience, so I'd definitely say go for it if you take the above into account and are looking for unique scifi puzzle adventure games.","March 26, 2015","true","7.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Very ugly. Everything is blocky and soulless, and not in a stylised way. The audio is very... I wouldn't say low quality, but bland and it all sounds like stock sounds/music. I imagine the story is good, but seeing the comments here, it seems like a boring game. The areas all seem very small and use an abuse of lighting that tries to substitute ambiance but all it ends up doing is making the whole thing very, very ugly. In a forest? You can barely see anything. You get this little exposition video in the form of some sort of infomercial for the very uncreatively named company (misspelled word, woooo) and the voiceover is atrocious for one reason: it feels like someone talking to you on Skype, not an official video a company would show the public and new employees.The lack of quality in the visuals and the audio really turned me off, something that doesn't really ever happen to me, which is saying something.\n\nI realise I'm probably being very harsh on this game, seeing as how it's an indie game and I barely played it, but I really, really got turned off by it. You get this axe in the first level and the hit detection for the GIANT logs you have to cut is absolutely terrible; I somehow had trouble cutting them at times. Pushing the seemingly out-of-place minecarts gave me the same problem. Just... something felt very off about the game, and not in the horror way; in the technical way.\n\nMaybe it all gets better, maybe I'm just being a picky prick, maybe my instincts are right, maybe they're not... but either way, no matter if my opinion were positive or not, this game is not worth the full price. It seems to be a 4-5 hour long game and for 17$? Not worth it.

The controls work fine, but sometimes don't feel great (I played with an Xbox 360 controller). For example, there are occasionally items you have to crouch down before you hit the action button to pick them up/activate/whatever. The problem is you have to HOLD the crouch button while you hit the action button, which means your left hand has to reach over and hit one of the facebuttons. It's awkward. There are things in the audio that bug me, like the small torches that light up an area. They sound like a much bigger fire than they actually are, and the sound zone around them is short and drops off quickly. When I absent-mindedly walked by a torch, I was startled because I suddenly heard a big fire and didn't know where it was from (it didn't register in my mind until a few seconds later that the big fire sound was connected to this small fire). There was also a cut scene that played after the school memory where the the audio seemed way too quiet compared to the rest of the game. The art is competent, but the cutscene art style feels strange juxtaposed to the darker mood of the rest of the game. It's not cohesive.\n\nI've played through three "memories" (think "levels") and I want to like the game, but it just needs more polish.

Master Reboot has a cool cyber world aesthetic and some unique puzzles though they can be very unfair at times (I'll explain later), and has an interesting story to it. In Master Reboot there is a world in a computer called the Soul Cloud, A place were people's memories are transferred before (or after I'm not sure) death so they will have a version of themselves left behind. I wont spoil anything because there is a lot to discover through all this, but when I reached the end I was left really confused. The game might pass as a horror game due to having jump scares regularly but it does not properly pace it self for that, In fact the game doesn't even get scary until near the end. I really need to address the puzzle design, at times it's straight forward and reasonable but other times entirely unfair and unclear. I had to use a walkthrough the first time in the school because I was expected to listen to a piano song and then replay it just by memorizing the sound of the notes. I really don't like to look up walkthroughs of games but sometimes I really have no choice, I'm not sure if that's my fault or the designers. I wish I could say that was the only time I had to use it but the games puzzle design constantly shifts from stupidly easy to just plain obnoxious. However despite the issues I have Master Reboot is an enjoyable game with a great atmosphere and fairly well present story.","July 1, 2015","true","3.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The controls work fine, but sometimes don't feel great (I played with an Xbox 360 controller). For example, there are occasionally items you have to crouch down before you hit the action button to pick them up/activate/whatever. The problem is you have to HOLD the crouch button while you hit the action button, which means your left hand has to reach over and hit one of the facebuttons. It's awkward. There are things in the audio that bug me, like the small torches that light up an area. They sound like a much bigger fire than they actually are, and the sound zone around them is short and drops off quickly. When I absent-mindedly walked by a torch, I was startled because I suddenly heard a big fire and didn't know where it was from (it didn't register in my mind until a few seconds later that the big fire sound was connected to this small fire). There was also a cut scene that played after the school memory where the the audio seemed way too quiet compared to the rest of the game. The art is competent, but the cutscene art style feels strange juxtaposed to the darker mood of the rest of the game. It's not cohesive.\n\nI've played through three "memories" (think "levels") and I want to like the game, but it just needs more polish.

It's not the next smash hit, nor is it the most entertaining thing I've ever played or even the best-written script, but it's not really meant to be any of those things; Master Reboot is a trip for the imagination, plain and simple.\n\nIf you prefer subtle, well-faceted stories, action-packed or original gameplay, or are looking for a spine-chilling horror game, then Master Reboot is not the game for you.

It has collectible ducks. It has a goddess of destruction. It has a storyline you gradually piece together. What more could you want?\n\nAll in all it's essentially an exploring and puzzle game, As you solve the various puzzles and explore memories you uncover what's been going on and begin to see how you ended up where you are now. It's not too difficult (although some of the puzzles towards the end I found annoying rather than hard).\n\nThere's also no way to go back and find any collectibles you've missed once you've finished the game, a free play would have been nice (and there was easily enough room in the hub and it would have worked with the story). Over exploring also detracts from the creepiness since a lot of it is cued - walk here - sound effect here - graphic over there, and triggering the same response repeatedly pretty much nukes any sense of threat. It is nicely put together though and well worth a play through. The interactivity with equippable items is also a little clunky but entirely forgivable.\n\nOh and you can play the entire game in Welsh. Full audio, all materials in game, everything. In Welsh.

I could wax eternal in some pretentious rant about parables between the narrative and our growing dependence on social media and "the cloud", but meh... Yes, there is a story, but it's presented in a somewhat heady way - as with Myst, you need to piece the various bits and bobs together on your own; nothing is presented with absolute clarity and a thorough explanation.\n\nIn a nutshell: Everything's colourful. Then everything's weird. Then you go all over looking for little blue rubber ducks. Then there are creepy little girls and teddy bears all around, then things get REALLY weird, weirder still (!), then there's an epic boss fight, and then it ends - and you just sit there wondering what the smurf just happened.

And the game also suffers from an identity crisis, it seems like it's trying to be a horror game, a puzzle platformer, a walking simulator and a point and click all at the same time, and doesn't really succeed to be anything of that. However, if you are a sucker for cyberpunk like me, this game is neat to have in your collection.","September 10, 2014","false","4.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Hard to describe; you really need to experience it for yourself.\n\nGraphics are a tad outdated, though that's only an issue for the casual and twitchy gaming crowds.  Concept is fantastic, and the way the story unfolds was very pleasing.  Not sure why it has such a low Metacritic rating, though I suspect the lack of run-and-gunning would turn off todays admittedly more twitchy gamers.","January 16, 2014","true","5.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I tried to give it the benifit of the doubt and kept going but the visuals continued to distract with their unconfident, amatuerish look. I had hoped that the first cutscene of terrible photoshop drawings would be the last but it appeared that they occur after every level once you get to the hub.\n\nOn top of that, there were many cutscenes to highlight changes in the world that I could have naturally found through normal gameplay without taking the controls out of my hands. Not only did this element make possibly interesting events painfully obvious, but it was also incredibly jarring and completely removed me from the experience.

The atmosphere, art style, and concept are neat. The music also deserves special mention. However, the game falls completely flat in the gameplay category. Basically, you get to walk slowly around (often excessively large) levels, stopped by frequent puzzles which either make little to no sense, or end up being just "collect these to unlock the door"-variety. I really need to point out how much not-fun I was having due to moving too slowly. Also, that trite jump-scare where the little girl jumps out of a locker or closet and grabs you gets more than boring, but actually predictable the third time it happens. Especially since you have to Button-Mash-To-Save-Your-Life®.\n\nIt's plagued by flaws that make it feel like it was made by extremely inexperienced developers. For example: In one level you have a hammer, and see a broken section of wall. You broke similar broken sections with three hammer strikes. So you hit this one three times, and nothing happens. No special sound or particle effect, no change in the wall. Go ahead and hit it three more times, just for luck. Still nothing. You'll be stuck, trapped, respawning over and over (with a cutscene, to boot!) until you discover it inexplicably takes SEVEN hits to break this wall. As well as the next five walls straight behind it in identical-looking rooms. To top it off, after breaking the final wall, I took a look behind me to see if I missed anything. Upon turning around again, for no reason a door had silently closed at the exit, forcing me to redo the section yet again.\n\nAs for those "memorable moments", the only things I can remember about the game are needlessly frustrating sequences like the above. I have to recommend against this game. Better luck next time, Wales Interactive. I hope you learn from your mistakes.","March 24, 2015","false","2.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It's a bit like the original half-life in that sense, that you as the main character start with no idea who you are or what's going on and it's up to you to explore to fill in the blanks.\n\nWith a style resembling something like Tron mixxed with classic 90's low-poly VR worlds, the graphics of Master Reboot do well to immerse you in the game environment. Minimalistic, but consistant.\n\nWithout spoiling anything, the game throws you, the player, into the 'soul cloud' where peoples conciousness can be uploaded. Chased by a rogue AI through the levels, you're tasked with exploring fragments of your past to uncover memories that piece your life back together.\n\nThe game probably doesn't have much replay value beyond completing and finding all secrets, but still i highly recommend picking this up even at it's full $15 price.\n\nIf anything, it's a unique first person advetnure that you might find yourself wanting to show off to other people","February 12, 2014","true","3.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

From the start, really bored with the graphics and the lack of any kind of drive or anything interesting happening to get me to go from space to space. I guess I'm just supposed to go. So I stopped playing. Finally, decided to give it another chance. There is a moment of something interesting when we get the nice little graphic telling us what's going on and then we're in this hub thing, which looks appropriately cyberspace-like.\n\nAnd then you enter these section puzzle areas. Why is this interesting? Why should I care? Please, give me a reason. I make it past one section, only to be stuck in this platform jumping thing with rising water level, sluggish movement, and randomly, we're supposed to find our way to the right jumps to get us high enough? After drowning repeatedly and being reset to the beginning of this level, my patience went to zero and I stopped.\n\nThe graphics have a definite style, but a lot of it looks really amataurish, like it came out of my beginning level design class with more complete functionality, but about the same level of graphical capability. And the story or rather, lack of story... it just made for a really boring game. The concept deserves a better game than this.\n\nNot worth 5 bucks. If it were some free download, it might be interesting enough as a student thesis game or something. Then it would be like, wow, that's a cool final project. Well done.

I've tried altering the settings, and I've managed to play a total of 15 minutes in two sessions. This is my impression on those 15 minutes. The remaining time I have logged is just dead time to get cards.\n\nIt is certainly atmospheric. That is really its strongest point, and if you want nothing but a creepy game look no further. The whole asthetic is certainly cohesive, which makes me wish the art design was too. What I experienced of 'level' design was (mostly) competent though not compelling.\n\nThe story and premise unfolds too gradually; the first two levels have zero context. Even after that I often found myself looking at things and thinking "Why does this matter?" My main gripe however is I found the controls clunky; it's not the best sign when your player gets immediately lost without you putting immpersion-breaking icons over everything.

The colour scheme and simple design is really effective: the world of Master Reboot is colourful but manages feels off-putting and alien on the whole. It's really well done and a shame that the gameplay lets it down.\n\nWhile the levels do mix up the presentation and try to keep things interesting they are hampered by the gameplay boiling down to "hit a button when you see the hand pop up" or "solve this ♥♥♥♥ easy puzzle". Adventure/Platformer with a bunch of crap to collect. There is apparently a story which you piece together through the levels and from finding hidden ducks while you're searching for the other things you're collecting.\n\nIn the end Master Reboot is just really boring. The story is deliberately fragmented (you're exploring memories!) and I imagine there's some kind of ♥♥♥♥ twist at the end that was hastily ejaculated into the script by the writer at 5am in the midst of a Robitussin epiphany. Decent bundle fodder, and probably worth putting an hour into it to see if it's your thing.","August 23, 2014","false","2.5"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

It bills itself as an atmospheric indie horror game and for the most part hits the mark.\n\nThe problem is, the developers seems to have vastly underestimated the importance of graphics and sound. Of course graphics always come second to actual gameplay, but the problem is that horror games in particular rely heavily on visuals and audio to create atmosphere, sensations and so forth whereas Master Reboot doesn't seem to recognize that need.\n\nThe models used for every object and character have clearly visible polygons (though to be honest, this is easily forgivable), the cutscenes look very cheap and the lighting appears to have been used very incorrectly - At one point I was confronted with a jump-scare that would've been far more effective if not for the fact that the hallway it occurred in was colorful and very brightly lit. No sense of forthcoming dread at all.\n\nMaster Reboot isn't bad. It just feels as though very little was invested in it, and as a result I have a lot of trouble investing myself in the game.","September 28, 2014","false","0.9"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

Towards the end and in that stupid hospital level again it does change a little. (I think there's actually some more levels with a changed art style.) The gameplay is also very interesting, each level is extremaly different, For example theres the childhood level where you see a little girls room from the view of a toy as you solve pzzles and try to collect keys, then you move on to the flying (airplane) level. (Theres multiple parts of this level, but I'll just go over the first one) you have to find gold pieces while hiding from seren (the enemy) behind seats.

You are a person who is part of the Soul Cloud, an initiative to preserve memories and souls, essentially, in a digital cloud. Things aren't all that well, though, because there is a mysterious digital girl who is trying to kill you.\n\nHow does it play? It's a first-person exploration-type game, something I think a lot of people are familiar with by now. You wield "weapons" in a few instances, but most of the gameplay is exploring, solving puzzles, and doing the occasional other action like sneaking around or doing a QTE-and this is actually where my criticisms of the game begin.\n\nThere's a few moments that can be frustrating for players: there's a few puzzles that are confusing as hell or require you to be really good at memorizing things. There was one QTE that took me like four tries because the controls weren't perfectly intuitive. Near the end, I found myself looking up a walkthrough.\n\nThis does not make a strong case for the game, so what does it have going for it? Nice atmosphere, interesting level designs, a plot of at least decent quality (with some tear-jerker elements), nice 2D-animated cutscenes here and there, a slight horror element (very slight), and just a general air of creativity. For a game about the singularity, it's a good fit for the concept.\n\nI would recommend this game, but it's not something I'd play through twice. Still, if you find a hankering for digital-soul stuff, do check this out.","February 4, 2015","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/balls_of_ice/recommended/251850/","balls_of_ice","Scopedog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/balls_of_ice/","387 products in account","Master Reboot looks like the coolest game ever made. A dark, moody cyberpunk game with a really cool concept – after death people can be stored in a “soul cloud”, and their relatives and friends can interact with these AI ghosts. You start plugged into the soul cloud, and it’s obvious that something has gone terribly wrong. Parts of the world are missing, or broken, and you’re being stalked by a roving anti-virus program called Serra.exe, who just so happens to materialise as Sadako from Ring during her raver years.\n\nFrom a gameplay angle, Master Reboot is more Gone Home than System Shock 2. If you enjoy these “walking simulators” – storytelling through exploration of environment – you’ll probably find a lot to like about Master Reboot. The puzzles gating off one area to the next could charitably be described as “rudimentary” – most of them are variations of “find yellow, green and red keys and deliver them to the corresponding lock”. While they facilitate environmental exploration, as a gameplay mechanic I found them very tedious. Even the few genuine puzzles tend to be pretty braindead, usually solved in seconds (sometimes by accident).\n\nThe game does briefly flirt with other game styles, including stealth, shooting and platforming, but the game was obviously not designed to accommodate these shifts – the single level utilising stealth is laughably easy, with Serra patrolling up the middle of a plane while you push buttons when her back is turned. Unless you walk into her limited field of view, you’re safe – as long as you do not touch her you can jump around inches from her back. Evasion consists of nothing more than crouching by a seat until she’s passed.\n\nThe last level suddenly becomes a timed precision first person platformer – something which I believe is now considered a war crime in most civilised countries. The controls are clumsy, and the timing is so tight that any kind of mistake will essentially force you to restart. Completing the game at that point was frankly a relief, and almost managed to sour the goodwill the game had built up.\n\nIn spite of these issues the story and atmosphere does just about manage to carry the game – the cold, minimalist cyberpunk environments and creepy sound design are often brilliant with particular mention going to the excellent lighting, though there are a couple of amateurish stages that let the side down. The scares do sort of work, especially early on, but they’re very scripted and it soon becomes clear that there are only a small number of circumstances where Serra can actually harm you. There are also bizarre, cartoonish flash style interludes that are not only poorly drawn and animated, but jar with the aesthetics of the game as a whole. The game would have been stronger as a whole with those story elements woven into the game in a less incongruous manner.\n\nMaster Reboot often feels like a student project, scrappy and unfinished but built with obvious enthusiasm and love for the craft. As a result it is a game that is impossible to hate – but 12 quid is proper game money, and that means it must be held up against the standards of its peers. In that cold, harsh light the game just does not stack up. If you can find it in a sale, I might tentatively recommend it, particularly if you are forgiving of clunky mechanics.","November 11, 2014","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a very simple game with unqiue theme around a vague story with incredibly simple mechanics and puzzles while enshrouded in a plethora of glow and blur effects. I'd say the minimalist visuals attracted me the most about the game and little else.\n\nI beat the game quite quickly - you mostly run around [until your virtualized character runs out of breath *shrug*] clicking all of the blue-glowing rubber ducks. And then when you run out of ducks to click it usually meant there are some other, vibrantly glowing thing you are supposed to click instead. I enjoyed the theme and the simple mechanics, but the whole time I had a poor understanding of who I was playing as and what I was doing - by the time I worked out the "who I was" part, the game was nearly over. Even then I still wasn't sure what I was doing or why I was even here in Tron-land aside from the chronology of seemingly unrelated "memories" I was collecting. I would guess that the final-boss character has something to do with the "Soul Cloud" having errors, but that wasn't ever clarified [that I saw]. The creepy, threat messages left by the "Goddess of Death" were never really explained either.\n\nStarting from the beginning, someone dies and you become Tron. Your purpose is to find the exit door (blue cube thing) to each level that you begin for no reason other than having a door that you can enter. When you have gone through all the doors, you will have accumulated enough "memories" to piece together a vague story about some common tragedies and something-something-something that you won't realize has anything to do with you until someone calls you by name for the first time near the end. And then after that you realize, as an audience, that you really didn't care about the story anyways and continue looking for that damn exit door.\n\nSome better character development for the protagonist would have really helped the game.\n\nActually, the game would have been more interesting from the perspective of Seren [seren.exe], I think.\n\nSpeaking of, I'd say that the only real fright value in this game is that the glowy-eyed Seren might occasionally try and make you jump in your seat a little. It's a game suitable for most ages, I'd think.\n\nOh - And I'll give a Recommend to the game only because between a scale of 1 to 10, the game sits at least somewhere over 5.1 - or something.

The basic premise of the game is that in the future, people can upload their dead relatives' memories to an interactive computer system, "the Cloud" where they can access them through a computer and share treasured moments etc. When things inevitably go wrong the creators of the Cloud send the game's Heroine to investigate.\nMuch about the setting can be learned along the way and if you pick up all the source information scattered around the game the truth about the Cloud and its conception in the "real world" becomes chillingly clear.\nPuzzles are fairly simple for the most part, more than a distraction but by no means the defining feature of the game, as you also have to deal with occasionally quite terrifying manifestations of the Cloud/Memories all the while trying to make sense of what you find along the way.\nVisually Master Reboot has a slightly Manga-esque vibe; the design has an atmospheric, dream-like quality that draws the player in, slowly at first but after about a half-hours worth of play I was totally hooked.  If I were forced to compare this to anything I would say it is like the written fiction of William Gibson and Philip K ♥♥♥♥, but with a distictly Anime, Ghost in the Shell style visual aesthetic.\nOverall Master Reboot is an excellent piece of interactive storytelling.  It is relatively short, so I wouldn't recommend paying full price for the game this long after release; however if it's on offer snap it up, it's well worth your time.","June 21, 2014","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The art style is simple, but effective within the context of the game.  The first person puzzle/survival horror playstyle works well too.  But let's break this down into pros and cons, shall we?\n\nCons:\nNow, I know I referred to Master Reboot as a survival horror game above, but if you go into this game expecting something so scary that it will keep you up at night, you will be dissppointed.  I did not personally find the game to be all that frightening.  Seren is really not all that intimidating.  At first she is a bit unsettling, but that is about it.  If she does manage to kill you, you just respawn and try again.  There is seldom a real penalty for dying, save a loss of time.  After a while, she becomes more of a nuisance than anything else.  If you want horror that will make you cringe, Outlast is the game for you.\nMost of the puzzles are fairly simple.\nAlso, I did encounter occasional real-life glitches, but nothing game-breaking.\nPros:\nThe style is really beautiful and creative, and the music works well with the atmosphere.\nInteresting locations.\nFascinating story.\nHowever, where this game really shines is in how it presents its story.  Unlike most games, there is very little dialogue.  Most of the information you recieve is either through pictures or various notes.  It is then up to the player to peice the story together.  These bits of information are acquired by finding the collectables.  Now, in most games, the collectable-related side-quests annoy me, since finding a bunch of nick-nacks just for the sake of gaining 100% completion feels hollow--like a weak attempt by the developers to increase play time.  However, in this game, each item is a peice of the story.  If you are interested in finding out about what happened, it is in your best interest to find the collectables.\nOverall, this game is a really fun, interesting experience.  I would definitely recommend giving it a try.","September 1, 2014","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Mainly the atmosphere and the story as you can make it out.  The game itself is broken into many set pieces which initalliy played like a variety of large scale minigames.  This I really liked in the beginning until I started to realize that the variety was thin and it was essentialy the same scavenger hunt just in a different location usually with a gimmick to spice it up....find the three things in an oversized child's room.....find the three things on a plane while hiding from a spooky flight attendant of death.....find the three things in a hospital with a flashlight....find the three things using a metal detector..... you get the point.\n\nThat sound design was pretty bad to the point of painful in some instances....kinda laughable in others (shoot some bottles at the carnival and you'll know what I mean.)  The controls however are what ended up killing the entire experience for me.  Movement is clunky which is even more of a negative considering the game relies pretty heavily on first person platforming in several parts.  Now combine this with a rage inducing bug plaguing the game that causes the controls to stick in one direction (usually left for me,) making you to run constantly into walls or off of platforms.  After replaying the finale of the game (a rather long timed platforming bonaza) and failing three times due to the control issues, I flipped off the screen and decided that even though I was seconds from completion, it just wasn't worth the trouble.","February 24, 2015","false","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Strangely addicting.\n\nIt pulls you in, and once you ARE in, it's rather hard to get out. The graphics are simple, they aren't perfect, but not trash neither. You are in a world where death isn't such a huge barrier anymore, but something goes wrong and they have to reboot, causing the strange 'little girl' you will find in the levels. For me, in the plane, if you look at her legs, you can tell she's not human. It should be obvious she's a robotic device. And. . . The graveyard is FREAKY. For me. If you get rather scared easily, there should be a huge BEWARE sign all over this game for certain levels. Luckily, it also provided the players a break. For me, they were the beach and the hub itself. There, safety was obvious. Until the robotic girl just HAD to come along on the boat and ruin the beach. Sorry, ahead of myself, no?\n\nThere are puzzles as well. (I can imagine some of your groans. Hush, now!) They're simple! I finished them easily, they were a little random but still fun. All in all, it's a good game FOR the right gamers. Some just don't think it's good enough, which is fine. It's all opinions nowadays, isn't it?

They're all really illogical and don't serve much of a purpose. Why do I need to move around colored blocks just to get through the park memory? Why do I need to put the planets of the solar system in order and push some piano keys to get through the school memory? After a while, doing these random tasks gets really grating since it gets in the way of exploration. The puzzles are simplistic at best and nonsensical and frustrating at worst. It really feels like the puzzles were added just for the sake of having some puzzles, and they only manage to hinder progress rather than to make the player think.\n\nThe gameplay is clunky thanks to poor controls and execution. For some reason, instead of clicking on objects to interact with them like the settings say I should, I have to interact with objects with the Enter key while navigating with WASD and using the mouse to control POV. This is a very awkward setup, especially for some chase sequences, and could easily be improved if the controls functioned the way the game says they should. I should also be able to play this game with a PS3 controller, but the game either A) crashes the moment I plug in the controller or B) stops acknowledging the controller's input after I move past the menu screen. But even if you get past all that, there's still not much gameplay besides walking and interacting with objects. The street memory is particularly bad since all you do is drive around cars, and that's it. It gets extremely boring extremely fast, especially when the gameplay in that level only consists of pressing "A" and "D" and the only story you get in that level is presented by a radio broadcast by a garbled voice with no subtitles.\n\nThere are some horror elements, but most of the time they fall flat. I honestly found this game more relaxing than scary most of the time, so scarier moments kept feeling out of place. There are some jumpscares (which I already find a cheap source of horror), but they don't damage the player in any way. The rest of the "horror" is pretty much just dark rooms and creepy laughter in the distance, which I honestly didn't find very compelling. There are some pink circle-things scattered around that showed some pretty interesting/potentially terrifying things about gods of creation and destruction when you interacted with them, but they were very few and far between and are pretty much overshadowed by the other aspects of the game.\n\nThe story actually had a good setup and sounded pretty interesting at first and is what drew me into this game. Unfortunately, it's all told through bits and pieces of memories of disjointed events from random characters. I wouldn't mind this since I actually really like stories that you discover and put together yourself. As much as I didn't like the game "Gone Home," it was actually really good at doing this with it's story and characters, which managed to keep the game interesting despite it's weak gameplay and frustrating story elements. Master Reboot tries a similar thing with its story and falls flat. There's no really good way of keeping track of all the random stuff you get and how it's all connected, unless you want to walk around the hub all the time and scroll through each item, and there's no real reason why I should care about any of these people and their lives. From what I've played, they all just seemed to have really bland lives, and after the poor puzzles and gameplay, I'm really not interested in the story anymore. I'd rather just go play a different game.\n\nThe graphics are very stylized, bright, and nicely done, creating a wonderful look and atmosphere to this game, only to be clashed horribly with the washed out colors and mediocre art in the flash-animation memory cutscenes.\n\nI'd have to agree with the other reviewers that have stated that Master Reboot tried to be too many things at once and ended up being only marginal at all of them. The exploration is weak, the horror is weak, the story is poorly told, and the puzzles are terrible. I really wanted to like this game. It had a great atmophsphere, it was great to look at, and it had the potential for an interesting story with some philosophical understones. Unfortunately, in the end Master Reboot is just too flawed for me to fully enjoy or recommend. If you're really interested in finding out what this game's like, you're probably better off just watching a LetsPlay.","June 18, 2015","false","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The basic premise of the game is that in the future, people can upload their dead relatives' memories to an interactive computer system, "the Cloud" where they can access them through a computer and share treasured moments etc. When things inevitably go wrong the creators of the Cloud send the game's Heroine to investigate.\nMuch about the setting can be learned along the way and if you pick up all the source information scattered around the game the truth about the Cloud and its conception in the "real world" becomes chillingly clear.\nPuzzles are fairly simple for the most part, more than a distraction but by no means the defining feature of the game, as you also have to deal with occasionally quite terrifying manifestations of the Cloud/Memories all the while trying to make sense of what you find along the way.\nVisually Master Reboot has a slightly Manga-esque vibe; the design has an atmospheric, dream-like quality that draws the player in, slowly at first but after about a half-hours worth of play I was totally hooked.  If I were forced to compare this to anything I would say it is like the written fiction of William Gibson and Philip K ♥♥♥♥, but with a distictly Anime, Ghost in the Shell style visual aesthetic.\nOverall Master Reboot is an excellent piece of interactive storytelling.  It is relatively short, so I wouldn't recommend paying full price for the game this long after release; however if it's on offer snap it up, it's well worth your time.","June 21, 2014","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GalaxyEyes/recommended/251850/","GalaxyEyes","Galaxy Eyes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GalaxyEyes/","89 products in account","Could've been a good game, but sadly it didn't quite make it.\n\nThe worst part of the game is the puzzles. They're all really illogical and don't serve much of a purpose. Why do I need to move around colored blocks just to get through the park memory? Why do I need to put the planets of the solar system in order and push some piano keys to get through the school memory? After a while, doing these random tasks gets really grating since it gets in the way of exploration. The puzzles are simplistic at best and nonsensical and frustrating at worst. It really feels like the puzzles were added just for the sake of having some puzzles, and they only manage to hinder progress rather than to make the player think.\n\nThe gameplay is clunky thanks to poor controls and execution. For some reason, instead of clicking on objects to interact with them like the settings say I should, I have to interact with objects with the Enter key while navigating with WASD and using the mouse to control POV. This is a very awkward setup, especially for some chase sequences, and could easily be improved if the controls functioned the way the game says they should. I should also be able to play this game with a PS3 controller, but the game either A) crashes the moment I plug in the controller or B) stops acknowledging the controller's input after I move past the menu screen. But even if you get past all that, there's still not much gameplay besides walking and interacting with objects. The street memory is particularly bad since all you do is drive around cars, and that's it. It gets extremely boring extremely fast, especially when the gameplay in that level only consists of pressing "A" and "D" and the only story you get in that level is presented by a radio broadcast by a garbled voice with no subtitles.\n\nThere are some horror elements, but most of the time they fall flat. I honestly found this game more relaxing than scary most of the time, so scarier moments kept feeling out of place. There are some jumpscares (which I already find a cheap source of horror), but they don't damage the player in any way. The rest of the "horror" is pretty much just dark rooms and creepy laughter in the distance, which I honestly didn't find very compelling. There are some pink circle-things scattered around that showed some pretty interesting/potentially terrifying things about gods of creation and destruction when you interacted with them, but they were very few and far between and are pretty much overshadowed by the other aspects of the game.\n\nThe story actually had a good setup and sounded pretty interesting at first and is what drew me into this game. Unfortunately, it's all told through bits and pieces of memories of disjointed events from random characters. I wouldn't mind this since I actually really like stories that you discover and put together yourself. As much as I didn't like the game "Gone Home," it was actually really good at doing this with it's story and characters, which managed to keep the game interesting despite it's weak gameplay and frustrating story elements. Master Reboot tries a similar thing with its story and falls flat. There's no really good way of keeping track of all the random stuff you get and how it's all connected, unless you want to walk around the hub all the time and scroll through each item, and there's no real reason why I should care about any of these people and their lives. From what I've played, they all just seemed to have really bland lives, and after the poor puzzles and gameplay, I'm really not interested in the story anymore. I'd rather just go play a different game.\n\nThe graphics are very stylized, bright, and nicely done, creating a wonderful look and atmosphere to this game, only to be clashed horribly with the washed out colors and mediocre art in the flash-animation memory cutscenes.\n\nI'd have to agree with the other reviewers that have stated that Master Reboot tried to be too many things at once and ended up being only marginal at all of them. The exploration is weak, the horror is weak, the story is poorly told, and the puzzles are terrible. I really wanted to like this game. It had a great atmophsphere, it was great to look at, and it had the potential for an interesting story with some philosophical understones. Unfortunately, in the end Master Reboot is just too flawed for me to fully enjoy or recommend. If you're really interested in finding out what this game's like, you're probably better off just watching a LetsPlay.","June 18, 2015","false","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Strangely addicting.\n\nIt pulls you in, and once you ARE in, it's rather hard to get out. The graphics are simple, they aren't perfect, but not trash neither. You are in a world where death isn't such a huge barrier anymore, but something goes wrong and they have to reboot, causing the strange 'little girl' you will find in the levels. For me, in the plane, if you look at her legs, you can tell she's not human. It should be obvious she's a robotic device. And. . . The graveyard is FREAKY. For me. If you get rather scared easily, there should be a huge BEWARE sign all over this game for certain levels. Luckily, it also provided the players a break. For me, they were the beach and the hub itself. There, safety was obvious. Until the robotic girl just HAD to come along on the boat and ruin the beach. Sorry, ahead of myself, no?\n\nThere are puzzles as well. (I can imagine some of your groans. Hush, now!) They're simple! I finished them easily, they were a little random but still fun.

As someone who has played every F.E.A.R. game, I couldn't help but to see how a couple levels in this game drew a bit of horror influence with the ghost-like girl running across the screen into darkness. There are a few jump scares. So if you have a fragile heart, then don't play this game unless you have someone else play this with you.\n\nThe game puts you in a hub-like area, where there are 3 groups of doors, each containing 3~4 doors that each lead to a unique environment and puzzle to solve. I won't disclose what the puzzles are, but they are quite intuitive but a little too easy. There's a lot of people concerned about the scariness of the game, so I'll say that the airplane and the hospital levels are the only levels you should really be ready for. My personal favorite level was the airplane. Without revealing too much, the level for me was the spookiest yet also the most memorable, the way the level was designed. It gives a claustrophobic feeling with nowhere to escape, stuck inside with no one but an unknown ghostly figure that tries to eliminate you.\n\nThe game will take around 4 hours to complete. I would wait for a sale. $5 makes more sense, but considering how experimental and cleverly-designed this game is, this is an indie game that deserves some recognition.

While the premise of the game is interesting, it lacks to polish, visual consistency, and precise controls to be entirely enjoyable. Environments and character models look very clunky and rough, and while some of this can be attributed to the visual stlye, some of it is simply a product of poor production. Furthermore, the illustrations in-game have little to do visually with the style of the game, and it's odd to see such convincing art on the store page while the art actually used in-game is just so generic.\n\nThough this game does well to build tension, deliver jumpscares, and create a sense of dread, performance issues and bugs, combined with clunky controls, really hinder this game's chance for success.","November 17, 2015","false","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Part of that is down to the level design. The story kind of mandates that the levels be haphazard jumbles (it'll make sense when you play it), but that means that the gameplay tends to devolve into traipsing around samey environments hunting for various keys for various doors, and monotony kind of spoils the otherwise-excellent atmosphere. Many times, the game would attempt a jump-scare, or the soundtrack would freak out in such a way as to indicate that a jump-scare was supposed to be happening somewhere, but they forgot to do the work of making me look in that direction first. That's not to say it didn't make me jump when the various horror elements  did  line up, but the design could stand some tightening up.\nThat's all a shame, because when the game is at its peak, the experience is to die for. Repetetive environments notwithstanding, the visual design is generally gorgeous, presenting a unique and vibrant virtual world that manages to vary respectably while maintaining a coherent art style. From an aesthetic standpoint, it's absolutely fantastic, even if it's really nothing new in terms of horror elements. Little girls with supernatural powers and psychological issues? Seen it. Childrens' toys coming to life? Seen it. Ominous graveyards? Seen it. Deserted fairgrounds? Seen it. Not a deal-breaker, but it just makes the actual points of novelty seem few and far between. I wish it could have been as rich to experience as it is to look at, is my point. There's one plot point (really trying not to spoil here) that crescendos towards the climax in a way that makes it seem like it's going to go somewhere completely insane and mind-blowing...and then it doesn't.\nAll that criticism aside, I still did play through to the end and I would recommend it for its excellent storytelling regardless of any technical issues.There are several really intense emotional moments, and it's refreshing to see a work all about the digital age and transhumanism that actually has a  point  it's trying to make. And if you can look past a couple of imperfections in the design, this one will reel you in like few others can.","February 1","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Strangely addicting.\n\nIt pulls you in, and once you ARE in, it's rather hard to get out. The graphics are simple, they aren't perfect, but not trash neither. You are in a world where death isn't such a huge barrier anymore, but something goes wrong and they have to reboot, causing the strange 'little girl' you will find in the levels. For me, in the plane, if you look at her legs, you can tell she's not human. It should be obvious she's a robotic device. And. . . The graveyard is FREAKY. For me. If you get rather scared easily, there should be a huge BEWARE sign all over this game for certain levels. Luckily, it also provided the players a break. For me, they were the beach and the hub itself. There, safety was obvious. Until the robotic girl just HAD to come along on the boat and ruin the beach. Sorry, ahead of myself, no?\n\nThere are puzzles as well. (I can imagine some of your groans. Hush, now!) They're simple! I finished them easily, they were a little random but still fun. All in all, it's a good game FOR the right gamers. Some just don't think it's good enough, which is fine. It's all opinions nowadays, isn't it? If you're considering this game, watch perhaps the first episode of a Let's Play. That will aid in your decision. I hope this did as well.","June 24, 2015","true","8.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/empr1ze/recommended/251850/","empr1ze","DukeL","http://steamcommunity.com/id/empr1ze/","42 products in account","Surreal and minimalistic adventure puzzle game. As someone who has played every F.E.A.R. game, I couldn't help but to see how a couple levels in this game drew a bit of horror influence with the ghost-like girl running across the screen into darkness. There are a few jump scares. So if you have a fragile heart, then don't play this game unless you have someone else play this with you.\n\nThe game puts you in a hub-like area, where there are 3 groups of doors, each containing 3~4 doors that each lead to a unique environment and puzzle to solve. I won't disclose what the puzzles are, but they are quite intuitive but a little too easy. There's a lot of people concerned about the scariness of the game, so I'll say that the airplane and the hospital levels are the only levels you should really be ready for. My personal favorite level was the airplane. Without revealing too much, the level for me was the spookiest yet also the most memorable, the way the level was designed. It gives a claustrophobic feeling with nowhere to escape, stuck inside with no one but an unknown ghostly figure that tries to eliminate you.\n\nThe game will take around 4 hours to complete. I would wait for a sale. $5 makes more sense, but considering how experimental and cleverly-designed this game is, this is an indie game that deserves some recognition. (note: there are sites that sell Steam keys, and sites that look professional, but most of the times they are a scam. and if they do happen to give you a valid Steam key, then your account will be banned from Steam for breaking the ToS.)\n\nGameplay: 7/10\nStory: 9/10\nSound: 5/10\nQuality: 9/10\nLevel Design: 8/10\nVisuals: 9/10\n\nOverall: 8/10 - Buy on Sale","July 25, 2015","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
