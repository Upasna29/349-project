Luckily for newbies to the genre like me there is a lovely hint system to help progress through the story. That is countered by the fact you have several different difficulty levels and a custom difficulty too!\n\nSo yes, this game is indeed a point and click, hidden object adventure game (as you probably guessed or if you're a veteran in the games you already know) - The video attached contains my first 30 minutes of playing through the game. It is uncut so what you see is what you get, I use my knowledge and explain through the options and then take the main game as it comes.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone who indeed loves the hidden object point and click games but the only problem for me is the NPC's animations of their head when they speak (as you will see in the video above). I would also recommend it to newcomers wanting to get into the genre (like me) as I have a genuine interest in point and clicks, I just need to learn more patience.\n\nI wouldnt recommend it to anyone who is new to the genre and has low patience or are seeking adrenaline blood pumping action because unfortunately you wont get it with this game. I did however get a buzz when I did solve the puzzles correctly (rarely).\n\nIf I need to add anything to this or you have any questions please let me know! :)","November 10, 2015","true","1.5"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","15","21","0","0"

Many innocents people died and it's time for you to understand why he's so interested in an old woman, Miguela. But nothing is easy in that cold town, where the sun never shows itself and where old feuds are strong in the heart of those who fell to hate.\n\nIf you played Where Angels Cry, you take back the role of the monk investigating his own brothers (well, in the church, not his own family) that seemed to have lost themselves to whatever vicious feeling they're currently having. However, now, the story is way more elaborated than the first game and is more polished. However, the ending isn't really satisfying. It cuts abruptly and you can only speculate. Even the bonus chapter isn't explaining it, it's more a prequel and an explanation of how the things came to be.\n\nNow, the game is more oriented towards an hidden object setting, as you have scenes of them, that are easy and interesting. Even if Where Angels Cry is standard in this field (find items, use them and solve puzzles), it's more satisfying than in the previous game. Puzzles are easy and well explained. However, there is a major problem: you're often lost at what to do. Even in Casual, with the map showing the actions you need to do, you're asking yourself what you're missing. I got stuck in Ramon's house because the area that I needed wasn't clear. It's just a little disappointment given the great improvement of the game.\n\nAnd the game improved also in terms of graphics: they're better: the characters seem more alive than in the first game, despite being in a winter decorum, the backgrounds are quite cheerful and colorful, in other words, it seems less outdated. The soundtrack also improved and was way more fitting into the story. However, better graphics don't mean that you can put everything in an hidden object game. I was under the impression sometimes that items were not medieval at all, despite the game being in the 13th century.\n\nWhere Angels Cry: Tears of the Fallen is a very good surprise, especially if you played the first game. Everything improved greatly, even if there are still some little problems. However, I've been more "active" in this opus than the first one. The price is perhaps a little high, even if it's a collector's edition, however, it's still a worthy purchase. If you played Where Angels Cry, I urge you to try Tears of the Fallen, so that you don't stay on your impression of the first game.","April 1","true","3.8"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/413470/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Where Angels Cry is a mysterious adventure where as a secret agent you work through clues to take down the Inquisitor Augustine.  I enjoyed the development of the story and the number of interactions with the village characters.  The hidden object and minigames where well thought out and could be skipped if you wanted to maintain the flow of action.  The hint button came in handy for me as I found myself unsure of which object related to which task and needed guidance on which region I needed to move to next. I found the extra story that you unlock helped you build a picture of the trials the town had gone through and subtle hints on what or who you might actually be dealing with.  the graphicâ€™s are engaging and I particularly enjoyed the change to Sepia colouring for the historical scenes.\n\nA recommendation that I would offer to Cateia Games and Libredia is to utilize everything that the Steam platform has to offer for your games. In this case I would definitely include further achievements, something many of the best hidden objective games do, and to spur on purchases I would include it in the Steam trading card program.\n\nI would recommend Where Angels Cry to fans of the hidden object genre who like to play through a game with slight challenges but not be completely stumped by a mini game or the next path to take.","January 27","true","13.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
