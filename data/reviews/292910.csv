This game brought back the kind of magic and wonder and bemusement I haven't felt in ages, with a more mature dialogue that's more palatable for me as an adult.\n\nSeriously, I usually fill my reviews with jokes and sarcasm, but this I'm serious about.

This game can be very frustrating. A lot of the puzzles follow very illogical reasoning, so often it comes down to trial and error as you try to use everything in your inventory on everything in the world. Even then, this this game can be agonizingly difficult and it would be a challenge to finish this game without searching up guides to get through certain confusing areas.\n\nIn addition, there are quite a lot of glitches in this game, and though they are rarely gamebreaking, they can hamper your enjoyment of your game (for example, I have seen Rufus get duplicated for a while before the duplicate went away, and the sound disappearing).\n\nThat said, however, this game can also be very fun. The humor is great, and the story is interesting, non-mainstream, and engaging. The art style is great and fits with the humor perfectly.\n\nFor $40, this game might be a bit pricy, but I can tell you that this is definitely worth buying and if you are tight on your budget just wait for it to go on sale.","July 20, 2014","true","30.9"," 61 of 70 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","61","70","0","2"

I would have probably taken a tad longer, but I had played the first game in this compendium ("Deponia") stand-alone somewhat earlier (so you can probably add eight or nine hours to my expected play).  As with the stand-alone version, I'm recommending this version (which, along with "Deponia," includes "Chaos on Deponia" and "Goodby Deponia).  The game play across all three games is pretty consistent:  a pretty good point-and-click game with very good art work, tongue-in-cheek humor, and good voice-acting.  The puzzle difficulty does vary across the games just a bit (I'd say the second game is a bit easier than the first, and the third game harder than the first two).  I've got three gripes with the game.  First, the protagonist, Rufus is a jerk.  If there were more character growth in him as the game progressed, I'd have been happier.  But, it's just sort of irritating to have him constantly do really wrong things at every turn for three games (he actually gets worse from game to game).  Second, as I mentioned, the third game is harder than the first two.  Unfortunately, it's hard enough that I had to resort to walk-throughs a lot (a LOT).  I don't mind getting stuck a couple of times in a game, but in the third game I was stuck most of the time.  And finally, I'm not very happy with the penultimate ending:  it's possible I'm interpreting it wrong, but it's pretty mean even with the one alternative interpretation I can come up with.  Even with those complaints, the game is still well-worth the price and time.","April 20, 2015","true","41.8"," 34 of 37 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","34","37","0","5"

Trigon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dijedil/","204 products in account","My recommendation comes with a reservation for those on the fence.\n\nThe artwork, story, music, gameplay, comedy and Deponia mythology are all top shelf. In fact it's so well-done I found myself occasionally feeling like the puzzles were a hindrance to the story. If puzzle solving is your primary interest then don't hesitate to buy these games, you should be very satisfied. If you ever feel like puzzles can be a nuisance then do NOT buy these games. If you're somewhere in the middle then buy the games and follow a guide whenever you feel like the pace has become stagnant.\n\nBesides pace I have two more critiques: it doesn't mention in-game you can double click destination arrows to insta-travel. I played for nearly an hour before discovering this. Achievement hunters take note: for better or worse (it's worse) this package bundles all 105 achieves across the 3 games into one set. So you're committed to ~30 hours of gameplay to get to 100%, and that will be for 1 perfect game not three.\n\nOverall I got more than a bargain for my $8 and would love more Deponia story/mythology, but perhaps in another format.","May 21, 2015","true","26.3"," 35 of 39 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","35","39","0","0"

Which is, of course the best kind, because let’s be real its almost always funny when someone gets hurt. If you haven’t played the trilogy before, then I recommend you buy this package, if you enjoy point-and-click adventure games at all. You will not be disappointed, the story is very heart touching and emotional, with many unexpected plot twist, and surprising comic moments.\nIf you enjoyed playing the trilogy before, and would like to visit Deponia one more time before it may or may not be blown up, I would still say you get it because you should be getting a -90% discount (-30% for each I believe), and there are other content in the game like new puzzles, developer commentary and better game flow, also bonus content like additional soundtrack, art books, paper craft etc. Not only that the developer commentary is quite amusing, and interesting to listen to. You will find out what other idea the dev team had, and how could the game have been different if they have implemented some other ideas.

Guess it's longer than I thought it was!\n\n*cough* Anyway, by now you've probably heard some things about these games, about how the creators are the "German Lucasarts" [which seems a bit unfair given there isn't an American Lucasarts any more] and how the ending actually goes back in time and makes the game suck retroactively.\n\nWell, I for one really enjoyed these games. There was a good balance between outright comedy and drama, the twists and turns of the plot keep you guessing right until the end, and there is actually some good character development. [With the exception of Cletus: I still don't know what that guy's after]. The design and animation is top-notch, and it seems to be impossible to get stuck or killed [with one exception, but you are warned several times!]\n\nIf I'd have just played the first game, I'd be a little more hesitant. I found Rufus to be a bit of a jerk and rather unlikeable, the backgrounds pretty though mostly static, and the puzzles largely illogical. Oh, and the game seemed to suffer from the same problem that Simon the Sorcerer did. It thinks it's funnier than it is.\n\nHowever, these niggles are mostly fixed in the second and third games. Rufus actually undergoes some character development, and whilst he is largely out for himself, he does have a bit more compassion. The scenes are overflowing with little background events, birds [well, platypuses] flying, water ripping, flags blowing in the wind etc. The humour seems a litlte more restrained thanks to the intrusion of some well-placed drama [seriously - these games have some rather dark moments if you're not expecting them], and the puzzles.. well... it could just be that you need to adjust to their way of thinking but they started to make a lot more sense.\n\nThe creators do seem to have made point-and-click adventures their "thing", and rather than Telltale who seem to have rounded all the corners off and made their games simpler for a new generation, Deponia is aimed squarely at people who enjoyed these games when they were in their heyday. That doesn't mean they're old-fashioned though. The control interface is reasonably straight forward, the games are gorgeous (did I mention that?), the voice acting is excellent and the music is..well, it's alright. You can switch it off if it gets on your nerves.\n\nAs for the ending? Well, without meaning to spoil things too much, I can see why it's divisive, but I'm pleased that the developers didn't simply go for a "all the loose ends get tied up, the good guys live happily ever after and the bad guys get what they deserve" ending. Sure it's bittersweet, but why not? This game isn't for young children, you should be able to handle it.\n\nI'm not going to compare the game to Monkey Island. Just because it's a point-and-click game doesn't mean it has to be like a Lucasarts game. It's not as wacky as Cokel's Gobliiins series, nor is it as serious as The Dig. Perhaps it's more like Sam and Max, with the gleefully anti-social protagonist. Regardless, if you like point-and-click games and want something with a good storyline and hours of gameplay, it's difficult to go wrong with this. And it is worth getting "The Complete" because besides giving you a discount, it also links the games together and gives you other bonus items as well. And it runs on Linux.

Deponia stars Rufus, while he may be bumbling like Guybrush Threepwood he most certainly isn't as noble. His mouth lands him in more trouble than his actions and his treatment of many of his acquaintances (and those he would deem friends) is pretty poor and self centred but deep down he has a heart of gold...deep deep down...just look deeper.\n\nThe comedy in Deponia ranges from a little slapstick here to a little silly outrageousness here, puns all around and tons of funny dialogue to keep you smiling as you go with Rufus on his adventure to get to Elysium!\n\nThe characters are very varied and Rufus is a little predictable with how he'll interact with each one but as Deponia goes on so does Rufus, he changes and develops (even if only a bit)\nThe game is fun! The game is puzzling and challenging, or maybe that's just because I'm bad at puzzles. The story is interesting, full of twists and secrets and it even has you sad at times especially towards the end.\n\nThe "Complete Journey" bundles all three Deponias into one but it does have it bugs, when transitioning from game to game it will close the application and sometimes with certain cutscenes ending it'll do it again but upon booting it back up it has saved right where it crashed so it's a minor issue. Other than that I've only had a handful of other bugs which weren't game breaking or impeding my ability to complete puzzles and trigger events but should they continue to patch more bugs I'll update this part.\n\nOverall (or a TL:DR) Deponia took me by surprise, I went in expecting mediocrity and was blown away, with its jaunty music, lovable characters, beautifully drawn scenes and a script that'll leave you wondering where it'll go next. Point and Click veterans will love it to bits and newcomers will be quickly drawn in through the tutorial.\n\nEdit: This review was written in 2014 and it is now the 25th of February and we have just had an announcement for Deponia: Doomsday, Huzzah good things come in....fours?","October 19, 2014","true","20.3"," 22 of 26 people (85%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","85","22","26","4","0"

I get it with a high discount and with 26.5 hours of fun i give this game a 100 % for price/accomplishment. With a 33 % or higher you get really something for your game. You should try to combinate every item with everything (persons/ things) for getting all dialogs and find all easter eggs (achievements).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/themocaw/recommended/292910/","themocaw","Out of Time Units","http://steamcommunity.com/id/themocaw/","314 products in account","It's a point-and click adventure game from Germany, in the grand tradition of Space Quest and Leisure Suit Larry. The interface is crisp, and the puzzles are generally variations of "talk to this guy, use this thing, combine these objects." That having been said, it's got a weird sense of humor that reminds me of the old school Sierra adventures, complete with a dude with a heavy German accent playing a folk song introduction to each chapter.\n\nWARNING: Some of the humor, especially in the middle and third chapter, can get rather. . . "Dead Baby" ish. The only ones that really upset me in the end are a series of horrible things you end up doing to people in the third game in order to pursue a quest that turns out to have been pointless the entire ttime. (And then there were the baby dolphins. :( ) Plus a few moments of grossout humor here and there, mostly based around the fact that the game is set on a garbage planet with all that entails.\n\nThe main character is kind of a jerk who is saved from being an outright antihero simply because there are a few lines that he won't cross. He spends most of his time being a self-centered jerk who mooches off of other people, steals everything that isn't nailed down, and screws people over left and right in pursuit of his own goal and Goal. So in other words, he's an adventure game hero.\n\nGameplay wise, there are a few puzzles which are completely incomprehensible without a walkthrough or guide. Par for the course for an adventure game, of course, but after playing a few Telltale Games adventures, the older model of "point and click trial and error" gameplay feels a bit dated. One Godsend: the more irritating puzzles include a "skip" option that will allow you to pass the puzzle without completing it, if you get frustrated and just want to go on to the next part of the plot.\n\nOne huge pet peeve: "F5 IS QUICK SAVE. F9 IS QUICK LOAD." This is the mantra that most game makers use. This is because it means that there is a minimum chance of accidentally bumping the other button and either saving over your game when you didn't mean to, or quick loading when you didn't want to. Deponia uses "F9 FOR QUICK SAVE, F10 FOR QUICK LOAD." This cost me a bunch of progress at one point when I accidentally bumped the F10 key when I realized I'd gone a while without saving and tried to quick-save.\n\nAll in all, I enjoyed it, I was glad I played it. Supposedly there's a New Game Plus mode, and some collectables you can pick up, but I don't think I have the desire to revisit this game any time soon: nothing against it in general, just that linear adventure games tend not to be as fun the second time around.\n\nPick it up on sale.","December 9, 2014","true","16.3"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

In case it is not particularly obvious by the trailer, most of the gameplay involved is walking amongst various "screens" where you can interact with the items, collect things, combine them, and use them to solve interesting puzzles.  The world is beautifully drawn and the puzzles are challenging to be sure.  Some of the puzzles will cause you to tear your hair out, mainly because you missed the one tiny item on that one screen that you did not realize you were supposed to click, or how a puzzle has to be solved by  changing a menu setting .  But beyond those insanely frustrating moments, when you finally do figure it out, you are rewarded with a wonderful story and a feeling of achievement.\n\nBy the way, I HIGHLY recommend playing with the Developer's Comentary.  Poki is a fantastic lad and will tell you all about the development process, the difficulties, and make you truely appreciate this game.

Visually it looks really nice and the simple interface which exposes only one generic "Look" and one generic "Interact" commands works pretty well.\n\nYou play as Rufus, a guy living on a planet completely submerged in trash (Deponia). Rufus is obsessed with reaching the legendary city of Elysium which smiles at deponians from up high in the sky. He soon gets involved with a girl called Goal and from that the plot will develop into a huge race to save the world.\n\nPositive things about this game:\n- Visually pleasant\n- Dev commentary somewhat interesting\n- Simple usable interface, with nice touches like middle-mouse button to highlight all interactable objects\n- Quite funny (in the beginning)\n- There are a lot of minigames in the game (expecially in the first chapters, there are very few in Goodbye Deponia, the last serie of chapters), most of them are quite fun.\n\nNegative things about this:\n- Okay, what was funny the first 2 times, is not funny the other 27475323234852472372434723520392074238947 times.\n- A lot of puzzles don't make any sense at all. You get them either by coincidence or exclusion. You have to constantly resort to trial and error combining items with interactables.\n- The game does very often a terrible job at hinting at what is the next action to take. They have added a "Chapter Log" in the Complete Journey edition which is supposed to give you hints as to what to do next and on how to accomplish things but it's ludicrously useless. Example of log entry with related hint: "You need to put [nospoiler] to sleep" - hint: "Find something to make [nospoiler] sleep". OH THAT'S REALLY HELPFUL THANKS.\n- A LOT of puzzles make sense only after you have solved them (by chance or by getting fed up and looking at a walkthrough).\n- The game forces you to make decisions which as a player you actively do not want to make in a lot of crucial moments.\n- The ending is a MASSIVE disappointment, after a huge buildup and many hours of gameplay you are rewarded with so little that your entire game experience feels _completely pointless_. If you have played Mass Effect 3, it's the exact same kind of questionable story choice: you have spent hours on this game buuuuut we don't really care we are just forcing you to take our very "art-sy" ending and if you don't like it that's your problem.\n\nIf the ending had not been so INCREDIBLY BAD, I would have recommended this game. Sadly, the wrap-up of the story is so terrible that it _completely_ ruined my enjoyment of the game. It's a fun journey, even if it's a very frustrating one at times, but when you reach the end you are clearly expecting certain things to happen... and they don't, at all. It's so bad that it does not even follow its own logic, it's pretty much as terrible as Mass Effect 3 from this perspective.\n\nShame really, but save your money and spare yourself from a colossal disappointment. You will actively feel robbed of the time you spent playing the game.","January 14, 2015","false","40.7"," 96 of 174 people (55%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","55","96","174","6","2"

The most negative part of the game is that the puzzels are really hard and you might have to use a walk-through from time to time.\n\nI do not in general like Point & Click games very much, but this game is well worth playing.\nIs the game worth the price? I would say definitely!\n\nHuzzah! The chorus guys rule!","August 20, 2015","true","21.2"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jeroentje13/recommended/292910/","Jeroentje13","Jero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jeroentje13/","543 products in account","Deponia: The NOT-SO-COMPLETE-ANYMORE journey contains three of the now four Deponia games. You play as Rufus. A stupid, selfish, arrogant, sexist, possibly racist tinkerer prick who's tired of living on his garbage homeworld called Deponia and would rather spend his life on Elysium, a paradise where the elite resides high above the clouds. Will he reach this destination? There's like three games and all of them are named after the junk planet he's trying to escape from so your guess is as good as mine. Rufus at first I thought was going to be a generic point 'n click main character. The selfish, anti-social a-hole who is hated by everyone and will do anything to accomplish his goals, but still has a heart of gold yadda yadda, but this isn't the case. While he definitely has an arc throughout the entire collection, I feel that Rufus is a more of a unique character than most protagonists. He's essentially the mondern Guybrush Threepwood, but he's actually a bad person who will never think things through and hurts loads of people regardless of whether they deserve it or not. Sure, he sometimes does good things or at least tries, but the only reason he even would go through with it is for selfish reasons and I kind of like that. The game bursts with character. Rufus could nod and it will get a chuckle out of me. If you miss the old funny lucasarts point and clicks then you should definitely get this game.\n\nIf you're familiar with the genre then you know that this can only mean one thing: MOON LOGIC. You know the drill! This means you have to seduce all three personalities of one lady who all want you to do a different thing and one of them wants a romantic dinner, but the only decent restaurant in town serves disgusting platypus so that needs to go off the menu which means you gotta hatch all these eggs so each kind of platypus will protect their babies and they won't be turned into platypus dinner, but to hatch the eggs you need finish all these minigames, but to even get all that information you need to be a member of the official platypus club and get the official platypus guide for dummies which means you need a membership card, but it can only be found in fortune cookies, but we have no money to order any food and OH MY GOD WE STILL HAVE TO DO THE OTHER TWO OW MY HEAD.\n\nIt's pretty bad. The second game is the worst at this as the ridiculousness starts right away while the first and second installment increase the complexity gradually. Heck, it's only one where you can actually have a FULL inventory. That's just cruel, but honestly, if the game keeps throwing my humourous situations like these then I don't really mind and in all fairness, they leave in enough hints to give you an idea what you're supposed to be doing. It can be really fun to try and figure these things out. Even then you usually have a always helpful to-do-list that helps you keep track of your goals whenever you get sidetracked by another crazy situation. Even getting stuck or trying to combine random inventory items or something dumb like that will at least lead to a funny line every once and a while and when you do succeed you'll get rewarded with more plot.\nThough I have to admit, the first game is the weakest in this case. You've got the standard complex puzzles, but not a lot of pay off to make up for it. The second half doesn't have as many characters to talk to as the first which results in less laughs. The first game is just there to mostly sets up the universe and there's very little accomplished with each action especially compared to the later games. Oh and the ending is terrible and I can only describe as mood whiplash, because I don't want to spoil it. So I'm glad that there's a fourth game that adds another layer to it that makes it work.\n\nThe music is good, though the looping is easy to get on your nerves especially in the first game because they remix the same song three times and god forbid you get stuck for more than fifteen minutes trying to figure out how to progress. It's maddening. The graphics are great. Backgrounds look beautiful, but unfortunately objects that you can interact with occasionally blend in with the rest. There is a feature that highlights items of importance, but the game never informs you of this.The character designs are great too. They're very expressive and unique. The animation isn't bad either, but noticeably limited. Sometimes characters won't move their lips when they talk or will look just weird like for example having this comfortable walking animation for a scene that's supposed to be running away from danger.\n\nSo if you're fan of funny Point 'n click games, get this one unless you don't like offensive humour in which case might I recommend Tim Schafers Broken Age a game FOR BABIES. NO. REAL MEN PLAY THIS EIGHTEEN HOUR LONG GERMAN POINT 'N CLICK VIDEO GAMEING SERIES YOU SCHWEINHU-\n\noh also the singing is weird.

Few issues with voice lines when characters go from one sentence to another. Otherwise I've seen one minor glitch that caused the player character to move into the background but I fixed it by talking to a frog, naturally.\n\nThe game has plenty of tough puzzles and good story points and progression, as any game of this genre should have. I like the art style, and the music, although a bit repetitive, is good too. The voice actors were fantastic and fit each character perfectly. Easy to use systems as well that prevent any sort of unneccessary tedium.\n\nI sunk 30 hours into this game as of my writing this while doing only one playthrough so far, which were all very entertaining. I recommend getting this if you are really craving a good point-and-click adventure.\n\nEdit 01/03/2016: Deponia Doomsday has just been released, the fourth installment in the series. This addition was totally unexpected, and as such my major gripe with the game, the ending, is no longer relevant. Therefore, Deponia: The Complete Journey receives a total recommendation from me.","December 10, 2014","true","42.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","6","6","2","0"

But it is excellent for those who are new to the world of Deponia or want to play the whole story without interruptions (if we don’t count the tutorials, since they were left in there for all three parts).\n\nOn the surface, the story is about the struggles of the protagonist, Rufus, and his plans to escape the titular Deponia planet, so he can join the upper society of Elysium. But, looking closer, it is more of a tale of a very egotistical man who uses everyone to his advantage; not because he is evil, but because he honestly thinks he is doing the best for everybody by trying to do the best for himself. The result is not only some slapstick gold, but also excellent dialogues and character synergy between Rufus, his newfound love (Goal from Elysium), and all the others who help them or try to stand in their way.\nThe characters and the dialogue are the strong points of Deponia, even though the plot suffers from a few problems. It tends to get sidetracked all the time, and as the games progress, the number of plot holes and abandoned story threads increase drastically.\n\nAs a point ‘n’ click game, it shows an interesting difficulty curve: it starts off mild, then ramps it up to almost early 90s levels, only to end in some poorly designed or medium level puzzles. This creates a mixed bag for the Complete Edition, but a good bag nonetheless.","June 11, 2015","true","25.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

All the hours I put into it was in the span of 4 days. The puzzles really made me like the game for a while.\nThen I started getting tired of Rufus. He is such a dumb ♥♥♥♥ing idiot, I still hate him.

Just the ending defines whether the whole game was worth it as a whole, and I'm not sure if it was. It's not straight good or bad, it just leaves a stressed out question mark in my head.

Just finished the game. Just wow...\n\nThis game has been tormenting me to finish it from the moment I started playing. I'm not a huge fan of point-and-click adventure games, only because I don't have much experience with them. I've maybe played a few scenes of "The Secret of Monkey Island," and I finished the first installment of The Fall. But that's it. So buying this game on sale was sort of my way of trying something new, so take that into consideration.\n\nWell ok then, on to the review.\n\n\n\nTHE GOOD:\n\nThe Art & Sound\nThe look of the game is phenomenal. It's got a great style and has lots of detail. The music and voice acting are pretty good in my opinion. Most of the music is fairly catchy and atmospheric. The voice talent did a great job, too.\n\nGreat Characters and Setting\nI really enjoyed the setting and the depth of the characters right away. Whoever was in charge of character development and scripting did a truly phenomenal job! It really added to the overall level of immersion... which brings me to another great point.\n\nImmersive and Thought Provoking Story\nFrom the moment I started playing I was immediately sucked into the world of Deponia: I wanted to know who these people were, who Rufus was and why and how he was trying to get out. This was why I bought the game in the first place: to hear a great story. And the game was certainly great and dramatic and philosophical in its places. And it was the game's great writing that kept me coming back to find out what happens... even when its puzzles frustrated me into a blind rage almost every time I played! Speaking of frustrating...\n\n\n\nTHE BAD\n\nUser Interface\nSo, I'm not an expert in Point-and-Click type games, but my experience with the UI was incredibly frustrating. The issue I ran into repeatedly was sometimes you could interact with an item from across the map and Rufus would just walk over to it and use it. Other times the item map would say there's an item I could interact with, but I couldn't actually interact with it until I transitioned (via some other item) into a certain area of the scene. It was a little issue, but it cropped up everywhere. And when you're desperate to use your item inventory on *something* and the game doesn't give you the hint to move over a few inches, it really starts to wear on your nerves.\n\n\nThe Puzzles\nBecause they were such a HUGE annoyance, I break them down into 3 categories:\n\n[::Absurd Puzzles::]\nHOLY CRAP the INSANITY! 5 minutes into he game I groaned as I had to find a way to 'lure' my suddenly animated toothbrush out of a dark hole it was hiding it. WTF am I supposed to do with that? I get that I'm new to Point&Click games, but seriously? What sort of logic am I supposed to use to find the answers to these puzzles when they're this absurd? I guess they were supposed to be funny, but when you've been running in circles for an hour looking for an answer, the laughter dries up fast.\n\n[::Obscure Puzzles::]\nOften times I found I had to use an object for something completely other than it's typically intended function. Again, earlier in the game there was a loose plank of wood I had to remove, and despite the fact that I had several different objects that would be good for prying it loose, I needed one specific item that one would not normally think to use. There were several times where I was stymied because, despite there was some straightforward problem in front of me and I was fully equipped to deal with it (say, opening a car door?) I had to hunt around for a different item or trigger some obscure chain of events in order to beat it. Which leads me to...\n\n[::Pointless Puzzles and Auto-Fail Puzzles::]\nSometimes you'd go through a total nightmare trying to solve a particular puzzle, only once you finally complete it, the puzzle wasn't narratively important to the story. Or that you failed anyway (despite finishing the puzzle in the game) and are forced to deal with the following consequences. It really undercut the feeling of agency in the game, making it seem like you're just going through the motions until you can get the next snippet of plot.\n\nWhich segues perfectly into the next section.\n\n\nTHE UGLY\n\nRufus the Sociopath\nI hated playing as Rufus. Not only do I not like playing as a callous @$$h013, but it actually made the first chapter of the game seem more difficult to complete because no one trusted you. And while I'm sure that was the intent for story purposes and to facilitate creative puzzle solving, it really made it hard to sympathize with the main character. This trend continued for the majority of the game as you single handedly use, abuse and sell out all the other characters around you to get what you want. And just when you think he'll change, he doesn't. But only because the script said so.\n\n\nDialogue\nDialogue in the game is fairly useless. It sometimes informed you about the setting, but most of the time it was a means of explaining (in the vaguest terms) how to solve a puzzle or a sad attempt at humor. And don't be fooled by the different "moral" dialogue options. There were SO MANY times I tried to make a different choice, but be assured; there is only ever one choice.\n\n\nRail-Roading\nThe player is given a lot of “choice” as to how they may proceed, what moral choices they might make or what things they might say. These are all red herrings. There is only ever one way: the Game's Way. This holds true for dialogue, for puzzles and especially for the ending. This was particularly frustrating to me as I have been raised on such RPG games as Fallout, Elderscrolls, Bioshock, Deus Ex... games where choices mean something.\n\nAnd don't get me wrong, I don't mind games that lead you by the nose... but typically those games don't give you options when none exist. So the experience of being given a screenful of dialogue choices (typically at least 6 or 7) where there was only one choice that allowed the game to progress was excruciating. This was also the case for many puzzles. Sometimes a puzzle could have been solved by brute force, or creative use of an inventory item you already had. But unless it was *that kind of puzzle* you were forced to keep doing things until you found the way the game had intended you to beat the puzzle. SO FRUSTRATING.\n\nThe Ending\nI'm not going to say much for respect for spoilers, but it really did leave a sour taste in my mouth. Under other circumstances the ending would have been fine. As I said earlier, there was a lot of great writing that went into the game. A lot of the circumstances had a great moral tension to them. And one of the key driving forces of the game is watching your efforts unfold and hoping that they'll be enough to ensure success.\nBut because of the Rail-Roading that's prevalent throughout the entire game, the ending doesn't feel like the consequence of an action or choice... I'm merely along for the ride, listening to the story someone wrote, despite the fact that I have been fed the illusion that I have a choice. So the ending felt wrong, only because I wasn’t free to choose it. Like everything else, it just happened that way.\n\n\nOverall, it has all the seeming of an epic game with multiple endings, but it isn't. The storyline is as linear as the frustrating gameplay.","January 18, 2015","false","31.9"," 119 of 226 people (53%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","53","119","226","11","0"

(There are tons of them!)\nA useful (very useful!) save system\n\nCons:\nNot a serious issue, but I am someone who gets slightly frustrated easily, so trying to figure out which of 10 items goes where and with what can get slightly nerve wracking. I simply just look at a walkthrough if I hit a wall, which allows me to still follow the story without getting too frustrated, but if you enjoy challenges, then don't, because it is worth slowly figuring out\nThis new 3 in 1 package features the developer commentary, which you can turn off, but it automatically switches on every time the game starts. It is not terribly obstructive in the top left corner, so its still a small complaint.\nNo spoilers, but some people may be terribly hurt by the ending of this if they don't like it. Personally though, I liked the ending, and I find it the most meaningful out of any other ending they could have placed.\n\nOther than the minor cons, this game does promise a nice storyline, a brisk fun walk with the characters and amazing environments. It is a different style of game but is worth going through all 3. :)","January 4, 2015","true","28.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This is the story of Rufus, as he tries to find a better life for himself. He comes up with outrageous plan after outrageous plan, since the "standard" type of plan obviously doesn't work.\n\nIn many ways I feel very sorry for the people around Rufus, as he misses the finer nuances, and tries to resolve the situation a little to literally. To be honest, he has good intentions, but has a decided lack of finesse and concsience (Which is explained in the game, yes, there is something "odd" about Rufus).\n\nI throughly enjoyed the game. The game is fun, funny, deep, and you canstill play it casually (as I did). The developer commentaries are often fantastic, and it gives some more insight into how Daedalic operates, and human nature. I'd reccomend playing with the developer commentaries on. I played the game on Linux, and there was no technical issue that I noticed, so that is good :-D\n\nDeponia: The Complete Journey is funny and ridiculous, with much attention to detail. I fondly rememer the scene where you have to sing the Organnon anthem, and eventually get it right, then you get rewarded with a very well executed choir performance. And the lovely animations!\n\nI highly reccomend you play this game, and don't rush through it, there are many fine details that are delightful in their references, and the minigames are rewarding enough to not skip them.\n\nThanks to Daedalic Entertainment for bringing this gem to Linux, I hope more follow :-P","November 6, 2014","true","27.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

Its puzzles are reminiscent of the old Monkey Island games, and the humour is without a doubt one of the best of the past 10 years. You play the anti-hero Rufus. As the reviews and intro state, Rufus is not a pleasant man. He's annoying, mean, and absolutely self-centered. The game made me wonder what was wrong with the protagonist several times at the start of the game. He sells women into slavery and feeds children to monsters. And, in spite of all this, he grows on you. He's human. He does horrible things but you still want him to succeed in his plans. Rufus is brilliant, and he's utterly fascinating.\n\nGet this game if you want an interesting protagonist. He won't be your immediate hero. He won't be the man you hope to be, or the man you want your daughter to marry. He's definitely not the man you hope to snag in a relationship. But he will be interesting from start to finish.

If you are a fan of the old classic LucasArts point-and-click adventure games (Day of the Tentacle, Sam and Max, the Monkey Island series, etc.) you should enjoy Deponia.  This game is absolutely the spiritual successor to those games.  Even at full price, this is worth it.  When on sale, it's a real steal!\nFor those who may be confused by the titles, there are three Deponia games in the series - this one, "The Complete Journey" is all three of those games combined seamlessly into one package (you don't get three individual games, rather the three games flow into each other one after the other).  So if you get this game, you do not need to get the three individual Deponia games.","January 1, 2015","true","13.8"," 1 person found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","0","1","1","2","0"

You play the bumbling sociopath in his attempt to escape to a new life. Now, some people might find it hard to play a character who makes rather unethical decisions,  but that is the whole point of the game.\nIt lets the sometimes dark humour flow much more easily and makes for a very enjoyable play through.\n\nHowever, even though the story started off well, I don't feel it was amazing. Especially towards the end more plot holes started showing, and the actual end of the game was extremely disappointing.\nThe ending could have been easily solved with a minigame where  you have to find some way of timing everyone to escape from the blades at the same time, and the dev commenter says that they really like minigames. What a missed opportunity that was.\nThe ending also manages to negate any character development anyone could have had, as all the main characters pretty much have their lives screwed over.\n\nThe puzzles in this game are generally pretty good, however in some cases the solutions ended up being extremely obscure and I had to find a walkthrough to prod me in the right direction. This was rather annoying, but for the most part the puzzle, item combination and minigames were designed well.\n\nThe interface that goes along with the game has a good menu system, and a good inventory manager. The on-screen hints that show you where clicks are valid is also very helpful.\n\nThe graphics in this game are extremely good, as is the soundtrack. It all really adds to the atmosphere and helps makes the exploring the game enjoyable.\n\nI did encounter many bugs while playing the game. None of them broke them game completely, but they were annoying. If you get stuck with characters not speaking scripted lines, pressing "Esc" solves this. Also, use the "load" button to load saves, not the "continue" button.\n\n\n[s]Overall, had this game made a few parts less obscure, or at least offered a few more hints at what to do, as well as had a different ending, I would have probably enjoyed it, but it just ended leaving a sour taste. Especially when the main character Rufus's story had built up so close to his final goal.[/s]\n\nOK. It seems as if the story is begin continued. Given a proper continuation, rather than the abrupt end we were left with, I can finally push my rating over to begin a positive one.","January 24, 2015","true","62.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's actually three games together with a few bonus, but it's a cohesive trilogy. What makes the game interesting is it's humor, present through the whole game, and some very interesting characters. The story is good with some twists even if the ending is a bit disappointing. Still, it is well written. The art and animations are great and the voice acting well-done for the most part. The music is also good. The gameplay is what you'd expect from this genre: click everywhere, talk to everyone, collect, combine and use items. There's also some interesting minigames. This edition also includes an interesting Developer's Commentary implemented in-game and a neat questlog. Regarding puzzles, i must say that the game is a bit hard and sometimes the solutions aren't very logical. You'll need to experiment a lot. But it's worth it. If you're a fan of this genre, this is a must buy, except if you own the separate games. If you're new to the genre, maybe this a great way to experiment point-and-click adventures. It may be difficult at times, but that's also a trademark of this genre. Still, buy it on sale anyway.","March 7","true","35.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

But there are way too many disturbing deeds performed by the main character (i.e. by you, as a player). And there are no alternatives – you are forced to do very unpleasant (to say the least) things in order to progress further in game.\n\nI do understand that authors used some kind of dark humor. And while I don’t find every of those dark jokes amusing, I can certainly understand why are those called jokes.\nBut there are things in this game that I don’t find humorous at all. The most ferocious among them are:\nMurder attempt ( locking Gizmo in a burning cabin ),\nKilling ( Grandma Utz’s bird, Clever-Byte, Gondolier, baby dolphins ),\nCondemning to death ( Goon, Rusty, Gritchen, Hansel ),\nSelling into slavery (June) .\n\nAlmost every malevolent action is directed against innocent creatures (they aren’t villains and they haven’t done anything harmful to anybody). You just come in and ruin their lives – no apology, no repentance, no nothing.\nEvery atrocity Rufus commits during the game is reproached only with other people’s “comical” grumbling ( and even justified by Goal in the end ).\nAnd Rufus not only don’t feel any remorse, but also  sarcastically comments his victim’s doom !\n\nThe further into the game, the more loathsome things you have to perform.\nGoon and June  puzzle was particularly disgusting. I wonder if anyone find this puzzle funny at all. It was the last drop that reversed my impression of the game 180 degrees. Before I solved it I wanted to purchase other Daedalic Entertainment games, but after that – no, thanks.\n\nAs far as I can see, the finale is ought to atone Rufus for his sins, but it’s just not enough in terms of moral of the fable – he doesn’t repent of his previous errors, he just let go and goes “hehehe” again.\n\nDon’t let the game’s cartoonish appearance and light-hearted atmosphere deceive you – it is full of dark humor that at times definitely crosses the line of humor, transforming into something sick and repulsive.","January 17, 2015","false","106.8"," 72 of 142 people (51%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","51","72","142","17","23"

The characters are wonderful and charming and the story moves along at a perfect pace. The puzzels are clever and challanging but not overly difficult. However I experienced major glitches during gameplay that enhibited me from continuing. For example, when I wanted the character to enter a doorway or go up stairs it would trigger either a different animation or dialogue from a completely different scene making it impossible to progress without extreme difficulty. Adittionally there were points were the character would be unable to walk in a certain direction or exit an area. I was dissapointed in the fact that these simple coding glitches kept me from playing the rest of the game so I hope the developers can fix this problem quickly.

During the journey you'll become attached to the world of Deponia, to its characters (specially to Rufus, the protagonist) and to its unique humor (enjoyable by people of all ages, trust me). With the plot, the most important part of the trilogy is costituted by the puzzles, which are really challenging, even if not all of them are that intuitive, also most of them require a lot of time and patience to be solved (but once one of them it's concluded you'll feel very satisfied).\nThe artistic sector is also praiseworthy both for its curious and colorful aesthetics and for the soundtrack, full of various catchy themes (which could still become annoying, since they're all looped).\n\nIn simple terms: the trilogy of Deponia it's a magnificent diamond, recommended for every Point-and-Click adventures' lover (especially for those who enjoyed the classics by LucasArts) and also for the newbies of the genre.","February 13","true","23.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","4"

I've just been replaying this game after playing through it a few months ago.  The game is fantastic.  It is the best point-click adventure game I've played since Maniac Mansion back on the NES.  The characters are well developed, the play control is intuitive, the logic flow is tricky, but with just enough hints to get through.  The story is seriously clever. You get really sucked into the plot.  I started off buying just the first game.  At the end, I immediately bought this...I should've just bought this set from the start.\n\nThe minor play control gripe I have is that the tutorial doesn't tell you that you in fact can skip a lot of the slow walking. If you are moving to a screen you've already been to, you can jump to it (sometimes called zip-mode) by just clicking the orange arrow a couple times.  Also, knowing that the space button reveals all the trigger items is a wonderful feature that, again, should've been in the opening tutorial.\n\nThe only serious complaint I have is that the last I checked, you are unable to gift the game.  I tried sending it to a friend only to find that I couldn't...it's weird when you want to hand over money but are unable...\n\nIf you like any of the classic Lucasarts or Doublefine games, seriously, just get this. Don't be scared by the fact that it's done by some random German game company you've never heard of. The english voice actors are all excellent, and the creator-sung song is catchy as Hell (Huzzah, it's catchy as Hell!)","December 2, 2015","true","199.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The world it describes really piques your interest. It has all the ingredients for a great point-and-click game.\n\nSo why shouldn't you buy this game for the full price?\n\nWell, the game is very much story-driven, and the story is where the problem lies. The overall story itself is good, although it suffers from a really badly written ending. That alone does not warrant a negative review, but the devil is in the details. It feels as if a lot of the story details and puzzles were written without any concern for fitting in with the various characters' personalities. Deponia goes from touching kindness in one scene to ruthless human sacrifices in the other, all performed by the protagnist who is almost, but not quite, likable.\n\nThe impression I got from this game was that it was created by a talented team of game developers… and the puerile nephew of their primary financer whom they could not refuse to hire.\n\nGet this game in the bargain bin during the summer or christmas sale though; it certainly has its good points.","January 20, 2015","false","21.6"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","5","14","0","0"

"This guy is trying to escape Deponia" which is told to you if you so much as glance at it. what I loved was the cartoonish style and the witty if occasionally offensive humor. A game made for the crass that doesn't tiptoe around potential issues so much as jump right in like a gleeful child in the mud. it had a kind of charm i hadn't seen in a game yet.\n\nDispite myself thinking I didn't like the character for his actions and personality in the story I was so very surprised to find that at the end I was very dissappointed. A let down so large I sat in my chair shocked verbally repeating to myself "No, that can't be the end. there must be something after the credits right?" So I sat, watched, and listened to the music until the title screen appeared. at which point I immediately opened up the bonus content and searched for something I missed.\n\nBut no, there was no alternate ending. No promise of another game in the future to explain or keep me going. and then I had to ask myself why the ending was such a lurch for me. And I had to admit to myself that yes. the character Rufus had grow on me at some level beyond my imagination.\n\nI cannot say more lest I give away something integral to the plot. So in summarry or TLDR: If you want a game that gives you satisfaction for solving all of it's puzzles and the enjoyment of success. turn back now. because you won't find it here.","July 7, 2015","false","23.2"," 12 of 29 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","12","29","0","0"

For example there is only one black girl from the series and we sell her to play as a monkey. This is absoulutely racism. Also there is a pedophile in the game where the protagonist encourages children to go into pedo's caravan. The racism and pedophile is not something you can joke about and this is stepping out of line. They shouldn't be in the game unless you criticize it somehow but they make a humor out of it. Even dark humor has its limits. I did not even tell you about the sexualism where the protagonist insults women or letting children eaten by a monster.\n\nIf your stomach can handle these things then it is one of the best point & click adventure games. If not then either do not start to play the game or do not play goodbye deponia. The only reason I am not recommending this game is that the racism, pedophile, sexism and dark humor in the game.

Unlike usual game protagonists, he is a complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and his main motive is to gain something only for himself. The art is done very beautifully and clearly a lot of love was put into it, as well as the music. These together make all of the areas very unique and memorable.\n\nAs the story progressed, you learn that Rufus starts to slowly drift towards a more nicer character, even though he still does a few very selfish, mostly just ♥♥♥♥♥♥ deeds every now and then. However, all of this escalates to him having an immense change of character in the end, which didn't fit his character that well in my opinion. Since the game really doesn't offer any options in the story, forcing you to follow a single laid out path, I was hoping that a miracle would happen and reward Rufus for his actions, since luck seems to have been on his side most of the time, when he most needed it. But in the end, nothing happened. This really left me craving for a more satisfying end to his long and eventful journey. It made me feel like the whole game was for nothing, since the culmination never happened. Unfortunately, cause of this I can not fully recommend the game, since I felt like I lost more than I gained through the story.","February 7","false","15.3"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

This game is an insult to my intellect.\nI am great fan of point n click games and games in general, playing since 1995... And i have never been so repulsed by any adventure game so far. BTW: i loved their other title - Whispered World...\n\nThe game is tasteless and annoying, while trying, very hard, to be funny.

This guy, Poki, well...just hearing him talk makes you want to throw things at the monitor. Oh, and he LLLLOVES minigames...After listening to all his commentaries (ALL of them, i didn't skip any) i realised i will never be able to fully enjoy his games from now on, simply because he is type of person i would never ever want to be friends in the real life.\n\nDialogues are the most boring i have ever  heard, pointless and meaningless, and very, very annoying.

The tongue-in-cheek humor at times is quite funny, and Rufus himself is just .. well. so oblivious to his own nature.\n\nThe problem arises when you get to the final leg of the game. - Goodbye Deponia.  It is just awful.  In every way.  For me, it ruined everything that came before it.\n\nRufus has always made inappropriate comments throughout the game and that was ok for the most part because it was part of his personality and there was no real malice behind the comments, just him being selfish and ego-centric as usual.  In Goodbye Deponia, however, his comments begin to stray heavily to a malicious nature which was no longer funny, just insulting and offensive.\n\nIn addition, in Goodbye Deponia, they went too far, straying far beyond humour and deep into the realm of very bad taste.   I literally sat there .. thunderstruck with utter disbelief .. trying to wrap my head around the content that involves June (& Goon).   The only black female character is sold to play the part of a monkey for the organ grinder who looks like an actual monkey.  Just shocking.  Then they have her almost naked and dancing for him.\n\nThe final straw was the horrible, horrible, horrible ending.  I sat there and kept expecting something to happen.. until I saw it say "The End".   Uhhhh. you can't be serious!  Really? that's how it ends?  It was an awful ending.  The ending could have been salvaged by perhaps having multiple endings possible.. but nope.  Just a really crappy ending.  It killed the entire game.\n\nI cannot recommend this game.","November 17, 2015","false","36.0"," 5 of 16 people (31%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","31","5","16","0","0"

You'll probably love it if you have plenty of nostalgia for the glory days, but as a newcomer, I found the game at best mildly interesting and at worst downright annoying.\n\nThe gameplay here is weak due to extremely illogical inventory puzzles that only get worse as you near the end, and thus you essentially have to either spend hours trying every possible combination or read a step-by-step guide. The worst is the second acts of the first two parts, and the last act of the last, as they introduce too many items and too many locations at once, overwhelming you and effectively forcing use of a guide. Minigames, which are rather common, are a welcome change of pace, but are still at times nothing but frustration with little reward.\nThe story is alright, but unfortunately, you play as the worst (most dishonest, sexist, egotistical, immature, narcissistic, and downright unlikable) character in the game. The humor is awful, due in perhaps no small part to a pretty much literal translation from German, as well as extreme repetition of things that were never funny in the first place.\nThe visuals are great, and are by far the best part of the game.\n\nSteer clear unless the genre itself is sufficient for you.","January 12, 2015","false","18.2"," 4 of 14 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","4","14","0","0"

Adventure games to me were always more about visuals, themes, and stories than actual gameplay. This is why I can forgive the downright ludicrous puzzle solutions and poor animations. The complaints that the game is "sexist" or "racist"  I believe are silly as well. They make it sound as if Rufus is aware that he is being an ♥♥♥, which you will quickly learn that he is always blissfuly ignorant of what is truely happening and the consequences of his actions. Back on point, the reason I am not recomending Deponia is that it's ending is a great big stab in the gut to anyone who was invested enough to finish the game by completely negating everything you worked for, solving NONE of the initial goals you set out for, and ruining what emotional value the game could of had by having a side character (that appeared in only 3 scenes if I remember correctly) explain why and what you should be feeling and then being subjected physical comedy.\n\nYes, I'm writing this review in an impassioned state of anger and frustration; I realize that might effect the validity of my review.

The puzzles are good, and sensible rather than obscure. The humour is reasonable and it has an enjoyable storyline.\n\nThere is a slight undercurrent which, when viewed from the right angle and without the context of the final game could be mistaken for riské irony. For example the female love interest and primary plot thread called "Goal". Oh yes ha, I see what you did there. Very good.\n\nThe second game suffers primarily from much poorer puzzles. A spattering of comedy accents which again, from an optimistic point of view, are treading the line but in good humour.\n\nThen we get to part 3, which features a heavily implied paedophile trying to lure children into his caravan, and selling a black woman to be a monkey for an organ grinder. No, really. That one screen (They're both on the same one) puts the entire trilogy in a completely different light and will leave you very uncomfortable for the (far too long) remainder. If you can stomach continuing at all.\n\nDeponia on it's own is decent if you can bury your head in the sand like a Frank Miller fan and pretend it's just good fun. But there's no way I could possibly recommend this after that kind of revelation.","March 23, 2015","false","45.4"," 8 of 23 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","8","23","0","0"

I really only have one thing to be said on this game...it has good production values. Maybe the music if nobody tries to add lyrics. But when it comes to story...oh boy just forget it and look elsewhere. ANYWHERE. This might have been worth it if the story had in any way come to paint the hero as a redeamable character...but any chances of that ends with the first part of the trilogy.\n\nRufus is the main character, and can be safely classified as a sociopathic anti-hero. The least of the things you will get to do as the 'hero' in joining Rufus on his journy would be to break up a black woman from her boyfriend and trick her into indentured servatude, turn baby dolphins into tuna, repeatably mind warp and physically abuse your 'love interest', poison your friends, and my personal favorite being FEEDING CHILDREN TO A SLIME MONSTER (tortilla wraps, gravy, and even puting them in the mouth yourself).\n\nThe 'jokes' are not funny, usually aiming for the lowest denominator. Expect sexism, racism, misogamy, and even gay jokes just to be hip. Expect our 'hero' to remind women to not be in a resistance movement, to consistently make fun of a speech impediment, to basically just throw words at you and jangle the keys. It's really sad that my personal dislike of Rufus and the jokes were so bad that even doing the tired 'crotch meets hard object' joke didn't even make me crack a smile. They even have their own laugh track out of nowhere for one scene...it's about as funny as it sounds.\n\nSo my final advice to you is to avoid this trilogy. I spent roughly 20 hours on it. I want my money, my time, and to wash myself of the whole experience like it never happened. It takes a lot for me to utterly find a character irredeemable and Daedalic has succeded of going even beyond that.

The dialogue is written with the same awkwardness as someone laughing at their own bad joke while they tell it:  it's not funny, and the fact that the person telling it can't stop being impressed with themselves for telling it is only making it less tolerable.\n\nI got a little ways into part two, and I completely lost interest when two characters were able to argue about Goal's personality because she doesn't actually have one. Leaving aside the implications of having the only major female character be a literal burden for the entire first third, and more than one reference of the main character insisting that the unconscious, baby-talking, brain-damaged woman "belongs" to him, the entire game is predicated on the idea that there are two women in the universe: one is the hateful ♥♥♥♥♥ ex-girfriend that needs to be medicated to be manageable, and the  beautiful coma patient whose brain can be manipulated to be whatever the hero wants (and it marks his growth as a hero when he DOESN'T leave her a sweetly mindless maidservant).\n\nIt's been a long time since I played a game that was this outright sexist.\n\nI really wish I could get a refund for this garbage.","March 28, 2015","false","14.1"," 2 of 12 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","2","12","0","0"

Also, for being a game focused around puzzles and minigames, many were unintuitive and difficult to figure out, even with hints or instructions.  Most of the time I had a walkthrough open in order to progress through the story.  Speaking of which, the story starts off somewhat interesting, but rapidly becomes convoluted and unbelievable.  I disliked the ending immensely, as it was a bit of a non-ending and anti-climactic.  Bugs are also an issue, and I found I had to turn off the Steam overlay in order to play.

Deponia's art style, humour and crazy puzzles will take you back.  If you are new to the genre, then I'm not sure what to tell you, this might be like asking you to enjoy Galaga or PacMan without the nostalgia.\nIf you've played it this actually reminds me more of 'Full Throttle' from Lucas arts, it has a similar art style and the odd cutscene in a simlar style. (that game is still worth a play through if you can find it on ebay).\nDespite what others have said, the puzzles are logical and you shouldn't get stuck for 'too' long on any of them. It does require some lateral thinking here and there.  I recommend you have the subtitles on, the somewhat mad creator likes to sing the interlude songs with his comedy accent, he also has a cameo appearance as a rather annoying gondola boatman.\nOverall recommended if you like point and click.

One day, he tries to put into motion another one of his plans to reach Elysium (a spaceship of sorts that is hovering above Deponia and where lives the elite). But (of course) his plan fails again and results in Goal, an Elysian girl, falling down to the surface of Deponia. The rest is about the misadventures of Rufus, Goal, several reccuring characters - how they try to get back to Elysium and what discoveries they make in the process.\n\nI found the jokes in this game to be absolutely hilarious, however that depends on whether you like crass and dark humor or not - there's quite a lot of such humor. And not only the dialogue is funny, the animated sequences contain some funny slapstick situations as well. There are a few (like, a dozen for the whole 30+hrs trilogy) swearwords (which I did not expect), but who cares?\n\nThe voice acting (both English and German) is top-notch. I prefer German voiceover, but the English one is just as good - I switched back and forth b/w them a couple of times.\n\nThe game is very beautiful, that is if you are willing to overlook low-budget animation drawbacks - sometimes you can feel that there is not enough frames drawn for this or that action to look satisfying. The backgrounds are absolutely gorgeous though.\n\nThe puzzles in this game are satisfiyngly difficult, for the most part, which is a good thing. Some of them were, however illogical (like the one with the Yrk and the paper plane, or the one involving the conveyor belt in hell). This is a minor drawback. but still I had to look in the guide a couple of times. For the most part though, the puzzles are creative and you just need to think harder to solve them. A lot of interesting minigames are there as well.\n\nThis edition could use some more polish, the game freezed on me a couple of times, which lead to some loss of progress. However not much progress was lost in either case, the game autosaves at important plot points by itself - just make sure to click 'Continue' and not load your last savegame. The text boxes for the commentary sometimes shifts to the right part of the screen, instead of a text box frame. But those are all minor drawbacks, which I am sure will be fixed with a patch.\n\nThe community seems to be split about the ending, however I find it brilliant and very cleverly written.\n\nOverall, it's a very enjoyable adventure with a great story, great humor, brilliant plot twists and smart puzzles. I recommend it to any point-and-click adventures enthusiast.","January 3, 2015","true","30.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As such, I'll be doing 3 small reviews, based on each game.\n\nDeponia:\nThis is the first game, as you've probaby learned. It's got a bit of a corny feel in the beginning, but I quickly grew to like it, and understood that this game is not meant to be serious. It's got plenty of interesting characters, locations, and some great voice actors. While this game is pretty difficult after the first area, and I'm not ashamed to admit I used a walkthrough in alot of the game, I can see where it would be possible without them. It leaves off to a mediocre ending, but with the money gained from this, the company made the next two games brilliant.\n\nDeponia 2:\nWith better cutscenes, music, writing and etc., It's a great sequel. With brilliant artwork, It kept me entranced, even through the slump that most media goes through in the middle episode. It keeps you excited from the very beginning, and kept me excited until the very end.\n\nDeponia 3:\nIt's better in every way than either of the previous games. It's hard for me to talk about much without revealing the ending, plot twists, or anything really. It's an amazing game. Play all of them.\n\nOverall:\nThese games are beautiful, immense, and deep.

Deponia's art style, humour and crazy puzzles will take you back.  If you are new to the genre, then I'm not sure what to tell you, this might be like asking you to enjoy Galaga or PacMan without the nostalgia.\nIf you've played it this actually reminds me more of 'Full Throttle' from Lucas arts, it has a similar art style and the odd cutscene in a simlar style. (that game is still worth a play through if you can find it on ebay).\nDespite what others have said, the puzzles are logical and you shouldn't get stuck for 'too' long on any of them. It does require some lateral thinking here and there.  I recommend you have the subtitles on, the somewhat mad creator likes to sing the interlude songs with his comedy accent, he also has a cameo appearance as a rather annoying gondola boatman.\nOverall recommended if you like point and click.  Its had 20 hours from me and will likely have 20 more. This is a trilogy of three games and I'm only part way into the second.","January 3, 2015","true","45.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/goggertoy/recommended/292910/","goggertoy","GoggerToy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/goggertoy/","300 products in account","Deponia: The Complete Journey is a trilogy of old-school point-and-click adventure games, all wrapped into a single executable file for your convinience.\n\nThe story revolves around Rufus, a self-proclaimed genius, a tinkerer, who lives on planet Deponia, covered with trash (Deponie is a German word for garbage landfill). One day, he tries to put into motion another one of his plans to reach Elysium (a spaceship of sorts that is hovering above Deponia and where lives the elite). But (of course) his plan fails again and results in Goal, an Elysian girl, falling down to the surface of Deponia. The rest is about the misadventures of Rufus, Goal, several reccuring characters - how they try to get back to Elysium and what discoveries they make in the process.\n\nI found the jokes in this game to be absolutely hilarious, however that depends on whether you like crass and dark humor or not - there's quite a lot of such humor. And not only the dialogue is funny, the animated sequences contain some funny slapstick situations as well. There are a few (like, a dozen for the whole 30+hrs trilogy) swearwords (which I did not expect), but who cares?\n\nThe voice acting (both English and German) is top-notch. I prefer German voiceover, but the English one is just as good - I switched back and forth b/w them a couple of times.\n\nThe game is very beautiful, that is if you are willing to overlook low-budget animation drawbacks - sometimes you can feel that there is not enough frames drawn for this or that action to look satisfying. The backgrounds are absolutely gorgeous though.\n\nThe puzzles in this game are satisfiyngly difficult, for the most part, which is a good thing. Some of them were, however illogical (like the one with the Yrk and the paper plane, or the one involving the conveyor belt in hell). This is a minor drawback. but still I had to look in the guide a couple of times. For the most part though, the puzzles are creative and you just need to think harder to solve them. A lot of interesting minigames are there as well.\n\nThis edition could use some more polish, the game freezed on me a couple of times, which lead to some loss of progress. However not much progress was lost in either case, the game autosaves at important plot points by itself - just make sure to click 'Continue' and not load your last savegame. The text boxes for the commentary sometimes shifts to the right part of the screen, instead of a text box frame. But those are all minor drawbacks, which I am sure will be fixed with a patch.\n\nThe community seems to be split about the ending, however I find it brilliant and very cleverly written.\n\nOverall, it's a very enjoyable adventure with a great story, great humor, brilliant plot twists and smart puzzles. I recommend it to any point-and-click adventures enthusiast.","January 3, 2015","true","30.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As such, I'll be doing 3 small reviews, based on each game.\n\nDeponia:\nThis is the first game, as you've probaby learned. It's got a bit of a corny feel in the beginning, but I quickly grew to like it, and understood that this game is not meant to be serious. It's got plenty of interesting characters, locations, and some great voice actors. While this game is pretty difficult after the first area, and I'm not ashamed to admit I used a walkthrough in alot of the game, I can see where it would be possible without them. It leaves off to a mediocre ending, but with the money gained from this, the company made the next two games brilliant.\n\nDeponia 2:\nWith better cutscenes, music, writing and etc., It's a great sequel. With brilliant artwork, It kept me entranced, even through the slump that most media goes through in the middle episode. It keeps you excited from the very beginning, and kept me excited until the very end.\n\nDeponia 3:\nIt's better in every way than either of the previous games. It's hard for me to talk about much without revealing the ending, plot twists, or anything really. It's an amazing game. Play all of them.\n\nOverall:\nThese games are beautiful, immense, and deep. They are worth the price, and I am probably going to do another playthrough, listening to the developer commentary. Also, those "Huzza!" transitions are pretty amazing.","January 3, 2015","true","19.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even though he has some weaknesses, the person itself is just too perfect to be very likable (in my opinion, that is). The reason I'm stating this, is that Deponia has gathered some critique that its main protagonist is too much an a**hole for players to really get into the story, something that is very important for adventure games. I disagree with that. Good adventure games do not have a perfect protagonist, lest they would be too short. Deponia's story of two people trying to overcome the impossibility of leaving a life full of trash would never be as enjoyable as it is now if most of the obstacles that lie in the way weren't created by the protagonist itself! Of course the player does not like the way Rufus is handling things, but this creates hilarious possibilities for puzzles that otherwise never would have happened. Deponias story is very strong because the player knows why he is in a certain situation. There isn't some kind of Deus Ex Machina that throws us back every time we make some progress in our mission, no, we do it ourselves. This creates, besides a lot of comical events, also a story that you really want to complete, since you know what you are fighting against.\nRufus may not be the most social being on the planet of Deponia, but at least his story is far from boring. Something a perfect protagonist never would have achieved.","April 19, 2015","true","69.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have been eyeing this title for a while, but could never bring myself to pay full price. Sorry, game devs.\n\nI have played through the first two 'chapters' and this is when I am writing this review.\n\nPros:\n- Beautifully drawn environments and characters\n- Double click on exits for fast movement (should be mentioned somewhere)\n- Voice acting is good\n- Story is somewhat entertaining\n- Some LOL moments\n\nCons:\n- Puzzles are not obvious or intuitive. Or, maybe I just don't have the patience for trying every item in my inventory on every other item in my inventory, just to have my cursor disappear and Rufus ramble about how awesome he is. I play with a guide open on my tablet.\n- Mini games are impossible without referencing a guide\n- Rufus is possibly the most most most annoying protagonist in any game I have ever played\n- How many times can you drop a person from 20 feet or more, and have them sleeping peacefully, apparently unharmed? Maybe Goal is a superwoman?\n\nThoughts:\n- Great game if you like figuring things out. If you like exploring the environment, pixel-hunting for items, trying to figure out how to combine them or use them, and stuff like that, well, this game is for you.\n- If you are looking to get through the story just to experience it, and don't care about solving the not-obvious puzzles, open up a guide and follow it.\n\nI am glad I got this game, and I will play through the entire thing eventually.\n","May 13, 2015","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Most of the time I'm OK but Inevitably I will get stuck at some point rubbing random inventory items together and on random things in the hopes of forcing some progress. Eventually breaking down to read a guide because I can't figure out what one combination of 50 things will MAKE GAME GO!\n\nThat said I have really been enjoying this game :D\nStill have about half(?) of act 2 and all of act 3 to go at the time of writing.\n\nThe characters are interesting the world is beautiful (for a junk heap) the voice acting is great. I even enjoy the little Ah-Ha moments when I actually manage to tackle a challenging chain of events/puzzle out without needing to resort to a guide. Bottom line, if you don't enjoy the mechanics of point and clicks then this game isn't going to do anything to change that but it is a really interesting experience none the less. If you do like point and clicks then this is your bread and butter.\n\nPlatypus-bataka!\n\nEdit: Just finished the game and without wanting to spoil anything for anyone who wants to be surprised I found the ending to be less than expected. Actually the last game was sorta hit and miss Tho the ending really felt like the cliffhanger for a 4th game that is never going to come since the Devs have apparently stated that this is the ending they always intended.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/peabodyman/recommended/292910/","peabodyman","Peabodyman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/peabodyman/","259 products in account","I really, really wish I could give a neutral instead of a thumbs up or down.  I just beat the game and well...my opinion on it is decidedly mixed.  Probably not a good thing considering how much of a fan of point and click adventure games I am.  On the whole, I'm giving it a thumbs up, but probably because the game only cost me $5 and I got quite a few hours out of it.  Not sure I'd have felt the same if I had forked over a whole $40.\n\nAs far as the game goes, I've played worse in this genre.  The artwork is delightful, the voice acting is quite good (not earth shattering, but quite good), the universe of the world is facinating and creative, the dialog is genuinely funny at several times, and the plot twists are fun, prepousterous and in the vein of the story telling of Terry Pratchett and Douglass Adams.  At its best it stands next to classics in the genre, particularly the monkey island series.  As far as value goes "The Complete Journey" is long, so depending on your penchant for punishment you might be getting your money's worth here.  I'll say it succeded in captivating me, though frequently not for the best reasons, and with that...\n\n...the game itself can get quite exasperating!  I consider myself a pretty seasoned point and click adventurer.  I'm not past needing to open the occaisonal walk through, but I've made it through my share of titles not having to do so.  I had to consult a walk through no less than 4 times in this title and possibly more (my memory's fuzzy in between the swearing).  Only once did the revealed solution actually impress on me that "I should have thought of that!"\n\nThe game's puzzles all suffer from over construction and frequently hinder game flow.  Just when you think you've made progress on a puzzle you come to realize the designers are just toying with you and you've now got 20 other steps to go through.  All puzzles paths are plagued with red herrings and "Oh, I need to examine that before using it and then it works?" BS.  It comes off as a slap in the face more than being entertaining, and I frequently suffered from puzzle fatigue and started spam clicking in the vain hope of progress.  The game would honestly have been more fun with *less* content, but maybe it wasn't so bad if you played each episode piecemeal as it came out as opposed to the binge play through I did.\n\nMy last complaint (WARNING SPOILERS) is an observation others besides myself have made--there's basically unignorable undertones of sexism, racism and maybe even a little trans-phobia within the plot.  I am seriously no SJW; on the contrary, I can laugh at the occaisonally well thought out racist or sexist joke, but none of these things struck me as particularly well thought or funny.  "Yeah, yeah, lighten up, it's a comedy, whatever."  But seriously I'm male, and I can't ignore that almost all the female characters are voluptous eye candy that suffer at the hands of the protagonist all for comedic relief.\n\nThe game starts in the protagonist's ex-girlfriend's house.  It becomes apparent quickly that Rufus is a leech, without a home of his own, living off her well after their relationship has soured and her life is made mostly miserable by it.\n\nThen there's the major supporting female character, Goal, who ends up in the center of the plot only because Rufus, the protagonist, accidentally knocks her off the vessel she's journeying on, damaging her brain implant.  She then spends the first game mostly unconconcious and dragged about by Rufus like a rag doll (because I guess he's just smitten by her because "She's hot!"). In the second game her personality is split into three alter egos (by yet another thoughtless accident of our main character).  The game play of this episode consists of swapping her digitally stored personalities into and out of her cadaver with a remote control all the while attempting to win the heart of each side of her personality.  In the third game she's all but entirely absent having been killed and re-cloned as a baby (yet *again* the result of an accident by the protagonist).  Her character has zero development.  She's just there as a token damsel.  All her misfortunes are not her fault, yet she nobly stands by Rufus's side until the end because...well why wouldn't somebody love an accident prone ego maniac who hurts all his friends with his misdeeds?\n\nIn the third game there's an interracial couple at the heart of a "gag" puzzle, the solution of which has the white member killed by some alien parasite while the black member is sold to a circus performer to humiliate herself as a scantly clad dancing monkey in the sewers (I swear I'm not making that up nor embellishing).\n\nThere's a brutish trans-women with a 5 o'clock shadow whose voice fluctuates between falsetto and booming base.  And did I mention you have to steal her hormone pills to solve a puzzle in the third game?  There's a Gondola operator who fakes a terrible Italian accent and gets in your way.  There's a fortune teller that looks like a generic buddah statue, complete with thick Asian accent...\n\nEven if the game developers hadn't intended these things to be social statements and "all in good fun, wink wink," it kind of piles up and gave me serious mis-givings.\n\nOn the whole though, for $5?  Eh, it was entertaining.  Your mileage may vary.","September 3, 2015","true","41.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Common sense.... Not so much. A nice and entertaining adventure. Like all adventure games, you have to use your wits (or lack there of) to advance the story.TBH I have only finished the first two parts and I am about to start the third. So FAR, the second one is way better then the first one. One scene I thought was just bad... in the second part.... nope can't spoil it. its just wrong... The fact the makers were able to get some really quirky humor in all the things that the "Hero" does is entertaining. There are a couple of bugs still in the game. but its entirely playable.\n\n1st bug: Grabbing the chili to put in your inventory with an item from your inventory makes Rufus say some words but the sub titles are in German? ( I think)(no real effect on progression)\n\n2nd Bug: Giving Goal Prize Leads to not giving Her the item and her avatar stops moving while the dialogue continues as normal. It looks like Rufus is talking to a Doll. You will still have the Prize in your inventory. ( This one stops progression of the story.) Took awhile before I got around the bug and it worked fine, and I continued on my merry way.\n\nBTW This game/Story is fun, especially when your telling your friends what stupid things you had to do to advance LOL","September 6, 2015","true","38.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I believe I just started the second part of the trilogy.\n\nDeponia is a point-and-click adventure game with futuristic and steampunk elements. The protagonist, Rufus, is a lazy scum bag who is perfectly happy mooching off others. However, due to events he finds himself wrapped in (partially by his own doing), he gets wrapped up in events much larger than himself and becomes the unlikely hero that the story needs.\n\nSeriously, I have almost nothing but good things to say about this game. The aesthetic is charming, cartoony, and with a soundtrack that captures the setting well. All of the characters are engaging and fun, especially Rufus, who does progress with the story. Voice work is good, and the characters have voices that suit them well.\n\nMy one complaint is in the puzzles. Sometimes, the puzzles are too easy, where other times, there is no indicator in-game on how to reach the solution. Most of the time, trial and error worked well to get over hurdles.\n\nOverall, this game is great.","February 21","true","61.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay is fun and the dialogue is more fun!\n\nAlthough there are a few actions that the main character Rufus takes that are questionable, I'd personally say that in context Rufus never does it out of malice. For example the scene with the baby dolphins. He puts up a hoop to train them how to jump through it, but they end up jumping into the kitchen! I wouldn't say Rufus did it on purpose, as in his objective sheet, it never says "kill dolphins". Or when he convinces this black character to work as a monkey. Not is it the only job available to her so that she can afford to go back with her boyfriend, but when Rufus takes the money from her boss instead of giving it to her, it's because he was OWED the money, as well as needing to to SAVE THE WORLD. Reminder that EVERYONE would've died if he didn't get that money.\n\nSo, yeah, some of it is dark humor, not for everybody, but I feel all of it is not due to sheer racism or malice; it's played off to either make Rufus deservedly look like an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ or to make him look as ignorant or stupid as a child.","February 6","true","42.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I just beat the game and well...my opinion on it is decidedly mixed.  Probably not a good thing considering how much of a fan of point and click adventure games I am.  On the whole, I'm giving it a thumbs up, but probably because the game only cost me $5 and I got quite a few hours out of it.  Not sure I'd have felt the same if I had forked over a whole $40.\n\nAs far as the game goes, I've played worse in this genre.  The artwork is delightful, the voice acting is quite good (not earth shattering, but quite good), the universe of the world is facinating and creative, the dialog is genuinely funny at several times, and the plot twists are fun, prepousterous and in the vein of the story telling of Terry Pratchett and Douglass Adams.  At its best it stands next to classics in the genre, particularly the monkey island series.  As far as value goes "The Complete Journey" is long, so depending on your penchant for punishment you might be getting your money's worth here.  I'll say it succeded in captivating me, though frequently not for the best reasons, and with that...\n\n...the game itself can get quite exasperating!  I consider myself a pretty seasoned point and click adventurer.  I'm not past needing to open the occaisonal walk through, but I've made it through my share of titles not having to do so.  I had to consult a walk through no less than 4 times in this title and possibly more (my memory's fuzzy in between the swearing).  Only once did the revealed solution actually impress on me that "I should have thought of that!"\n\nThe game's puzzles all suffer from over construction and frequently hinder game flow.  Just when you think you've made progress on a puzzle you come to realize the designers are just toying with you and you've now got 20 other steps to go through.  All puzzles paths are plagued with red herrings and "Oh, I need to examine that before using it and then it works?" BS.  It comes off as a slap in the face more than being entertaining, and I frequently suffered from puzzle fatigue and started spam clicking in the vain hope of progress.  The game would honestly have been more fun with *less* content, but maybe it wasn't so bad if you played each episode piecemeal as it came out as opposed to the binge play through I did.\n\nMy last complaint (WARNING SPOILERS) is an observation others besides myself have made--there's basically unignorable undertones of sexism, racism and maybe even a little trans-phobia within the plot.  I am seriously no SJW; on the contrary, I can laugh at the occaisonally well thought out racist or sexist joke, but none of these things struck me as particularly well thought or funny.  "Yeah, yeah, lighten up, it's a comedy, whatever."  But seriously I'm male, and I can't ignore that almost all the female characters are voluptous eye candy that suffer at the hands of the protagonist all for comedic relief.\n\nThe game starts in the protagonist's ex-girlfriend's house.  It becomes apparent quickly that Rufus is a leech, without a home of his own, living off her well after their relationship has soured and her life is made mostly miserable by it.\n\nThen there's the major supporting female character, Goal, who ends up in the center of the plot only because Rufus, the protagonist, accidentally knocks her off the vessel she's journeying on, damaging her brain implant.  She then spends the first game mostly unconconcious and dragged about by Rufus like a rag doll (because I guess he's just smitten by her because "She's hot!"). In the second game her personality is split into three alter egos (by yet another thoughtless accident of our main character).  The game play of this episode consists of swapping her digitally stored personalities into and out of her cadaver with a remote control all the while attempting to win the heart of each side of her personality.  In the third game she's all but entirely absent having been killed and re-cloned as a baby (yet *again* the result of an accident by the protagonist).  Her character has zero development.  She's just there as a token damsel.  All her misfortunes are not her fault, yet she nobly stands by Rufus's side until the end because...well why wouldn't somebody love an accident prone ego maniac who hurts all his friends with his misdeeds?\n\nIn the third game there's an interracial couple at the heart of a "gag" puzzle, the solution of which has the white member killed by some alien parasite while the black member is sold to a circus performer to humiliate herself as a scantly clad dancing monkey in the sewers (I swear I'm not making that up nor embellishing).\n\nThere's a brutish trans-women with a 5 o'clock shadow whose voice fluctuates between falsetto and booming base.  And did I mention you have to steal her hormone pills to solve a puzzle in the third game?  There's a Gondola operator who fakes a terrible Italian accent and gets in your way.  There's a fortune teller that looks like a generic buddah statue, complete with thick Asian accent...\n\nEven if the game developers hadn't intended these things to be social statements and "all in good fun, wink wink," it kind of piles up and gave me serious mis-givings.\n\nOn the whole though, for $5?  Eh, it was entertaining.  Your mileage may vary.","September 3, 2015","true","41.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm a big fan of games with storylines and this is one of the better ones out there. I just finished playing through the story and finished all three parts. Now I have to say that the end is not what I expected but it fits the complete journey well. The only downside is the feels after the end.\n\nThe artwork is amazing! Cartoonish and just fun. There is much going on in the scenes but it doesn’t distract you from your story. The story is very well designed. I could relate to some of the characters and parts of the story. Maybe that’s why it’s such a great game for me, but I’m sure that others could have the same experience.\n\nThe music and comedy are a big part of the whole experience. It wouldn’t be the same if it wasn’t there or if it would be different. It suits the story, which is a story about love and life. It’s also fun to see that the music is integrated into the world and that characters interact with it.\n\nThis game is mostly a point-and-click game but has also a lot of puzzles or mini-games in it. Which can sometimes be a nice change-up from the storyline. If you are a puzzle game fan, you will have a blast with Deponia. If you’re not really into puzzle games, just use the skip button or a guide. I had to use a guide for puzzles one or two times myself.\n\nThe game ending is, like I said, not expected. It had a twist which left me with some double feelings. But to know what I mean, you have to play the game from the start and go through the 30+ hours to hopefully get that experience. The end leaves also room for a follow-up, although I doubt that they will make a sequel to the Deponia trilogy.\n\nI’m recommending this game to anyone who loves great storylines in games. No matter what kind of games you normally play. Try this one and play through all three parts. It’s a great game and you’ll love it.\n","November 17, 2015","true","35.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yes, the story isn't anything amazing. However, you /do/ get attached to Rufus and Goal and everyone else. Then you have the ending for the third game and....well, it's horribly disappointing.

The environment and artwork is quirky and the puzzles take a lot of thought but are well planned out and definitely aren't traditional. Deponia and Chaos on Deponia were my favorite to play, as they also seemed to follow a better train of thought as far as puzzles went. Goodbye Deponia, while it had its good moments, had a couple, shall I say, "awkward" puzzles, which seemed to actually take away from the game for me. It was also the hardest to follow, as some of the puzzles were a tad buggy or didn't make sense. If you need help at all in any of the games, Gameboomers has great walkthroughs for all of them. The walkthrough was especially helpful at times in Goodbye Deponia. I would definitely recommend purchasing all three of these games, because not knowing what happens to Rufus, Goal, and Deponia is like watching Firefly and then never watching Serenity.\n\nBecause these games have no ESRB ratings, I (as always) rate it myself, and do my best to remain true to the ESRB guidelines.\n\nDeponia-MATURE: Brief Partial Nudity, Sexual Themes, Suggestive/Sexual Dialogue, Language\nChaos on Deponia-MATURE: Sexual Themes, Suggestive/Sexual Dialogue, Language\nGoodbye Deponia-MATURE: Sexual Themes, Suggestive/Sexual Dialogue, Language","January 8","true","39.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So here's a pros and cons list, to avoid such jibberish:\n\nPros:\nnot completely unique, but fairly engaging story\na lot of difficult puzzles and fun minigames\nat least 25h worth of gameplay + developer's commentery for every screen, if you're interested\nreally good, detailed animation (they don't avoid doing a whole new animation for some little things, just to make them more plausible or funny)\na lot of great comedy at every step in the game\ngreat voice acting\na really unique protagonist\ndoesn't suffer from RPG syndrome that lets you run so free that you decide your protagonists actions\nvery dark sense of humor\nCons:\nit's fairly linear\npuzzles can get really difficult at times, especially in Goodbye Deponia...\n...which is partly because they often have ridiculous solutions, to reflect on protagonist's plan-making skillset\nthe personality of protagonist forces you to do some really, REALLY terrible things and they're the only way to progress\nmost people dislike the ending for various, often opposite reasons (myself not included)\nvery dark sense of humor","March 20","true","32.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you are like me and played the old Lucas arts adventures back in the day and play them through again in ScummVM every once in a while you'll probably like this although the writing isn't as good and the main character doesn't develop as you would expect.\n\nI played the Linux version and it does have a few bugs; Your settings never save properly. Sometimes it'll lose your graphics settings when you start the games, sometimes it's impossible to get rid of the large icon for the developer commentary... There also seem to be a few strings in the subtitles that haven't been translated into English and appear in German.\n\nThe overall ending of the game is apparently very bad (apparently bad enough to ruin the whole story) so I have stopped playing the third chapter before it goes downhill. As mentioned the writing isn't as good as something like the old Lucas arts games but it's good enough that you want to find out what happens and considering it's basically a love story you would have expected there to be an alternative happy ending if the horrible one really had to go in there.","November 20, 2015","true","21.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was very intresting gameplay and I enjoyed the story and game. I would have reccomended it just based of the first game. Heck, my significant other would ask me questions on the game and I would give him answers that made him laugh and want to check my temper, like, "I'm trying to catch a toothbrush that ran away from me, it's hiding in the dark corner." Him. "Okay... are you sick?"  Checks forehead.\n\nLater on, Him "So.. did you catch that toothbrush yet?"\nMe "Yup!" Him, "How?" "Using a mouse trap with some wasabi peas to lure it out!!!"\nHim. @_@ "I think we need to call your mother.. You're really sick"\nWe both laugh because it is hilarious.\n\nThe first game gave me a lot of funny, good laughs. However, when I started playing Chaos on Deponia, I really started to not like it especially at the beginning. It felt as if the game had warped? To a different dimension and the character Rufus was starting to get really ruthless.\n\nI didn't enjoy playing as him anymore. I jumped ahead to read reviews on this game and turns out my suspicions were correct, so I don't think I will be playing the game any longer. It's a bummer because I really had liked this game when I first started it. If they would have kept it at Deponia the first part, even with such an ending it would have been great.

A long, challenging, funny, and story-rich game.","January 15","true","31.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Kids tell you to stop, but you tell them the story to end and later on they can't sleep alone for next half a year. Well, that's how i felt after last chapter of Daeponia.","September 12, 2015","false","14.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What an amazing game. The characters are entertaining, the story is really enjoyable, music is great, and the dialog is perfect in every way.\nThere are just a few things you should know before buying it:\n\n- All three games took me about 20 hours to beat, and I used a guide when I got stuck. (If you need a guide, I would recommend the GameBoomers walkthroughs) It could take up to double that without a guide and if you aren't very good at point and clicks, as the puzzles can be very tricky.\n- I would suggest not using the developer's commentary the first time around, as it doesn't supply any hints and can sometimes give minor spoilers for the scene and / or break the immersion. But, if you have the time, playing the game through a second time and listening to the developer's commentary seems like a pretty good idea. I'm going to be doing it myself when I get the chance.\n- It has a good ending, but it definitely won't leave you satisfied.\n- It should go without saying, but you should buy the complete journey, or all three individual games if they're on sale and you don't care about the extra content. Each game will just leave you craving to play the next.\n- And one last thing - The game never tells you, but you can press the spacebar to show all objects you can interact with in the current scene.\n\nAnd remember: Hussa - The Chorus-Guys Rule!","December 11, 2015","true","20.5"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

I've tried to admire this game beyond it's two main characters, but they're simply too much. They're over the top charactures of gender stereotypes - the girl is a noodle brain who can't do anything on her own and the guy is a self-entitled "underdog". She falls for him simply because he is there and she's too hopeless to not. It's hard to play games that continue to perpetuate these unconstructive gender norms.

The sense of humor is okay, but I did not really enjoy having to make the decisions that the game forces you to make (No, this is not a CYOA game). The main character, Rufus, is pretty dumb and heartless, so in order to solve the puzzles you need to solve them in a way that Rufus would.
