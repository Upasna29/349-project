Disgusting. You proceed from arena to arena and must destroy all the hordes there.The game has just 6 levels.

It's short, stupid, colourful and fun! It definitely feels like a game from the PS1 era from the mechanics, the story, the visual style and just about everything else and I find a certain charm in that and that really brings my inner kid out when I was playing this. You can beat it in under an hour with it's five levels where you go from arena to arena, battle horde after horde of cartoonish enemies until you reach the end of the level and it's silly and fun - I'll give you a quick list of pros and cons just to save you some time:\n\nPros:\n- Short but sweet, doesn't outstay it's welcome\n- Each mission presents something different\n- Colourful, childish and cartoonish, you can run it on a potato\n- Funny but somewhat racist dialogue\n- Very cheap\n- It has an arena mode if you ever want to just smash cartoon baddies\n- Supports controller (With so few buttons being used, you could use a USB SNES pad)\n- Dumb, casual fun\n\nCons:\n- It definitely looks like a PS1 game for those who want fancy graphics\n- Pickups are almost non-existant, only coins in two levels as well as life pickups\n- It's really just an arena brawler\n- Fighting mechanics are dodgy, normal attack is literally useless\n- For some people, it's way too short\n- Might be offended by the voice acting\n\nThat's really all I have to say about the game, I got it in a bundle and I decided to play the game and found myself enjoying the badness and stupidity of the game that I played it to completion in less than an hour and I don't regret my time with it, it's dumb fun and reminds me of my kiddy days playing on the PS1 and for £1.59 (Or your regional equivalent) which I might add is a LOT less than what most people charge for a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game (I'm looking at you Citadels), so I'd say it's worth it if you want to sit down for an hour and play something dumb for a change.

At £1.43 you get more content than it's asking price. The game is short, about 6 missions short and took around 1 hour to complete. However if you are looking for a quick fix for the night then this is bang on das kapital. It's just a classic hack and slash game where you can relieve your frustrations on Pigs, Skeletons, Rhinos etc and finally a Minotaur. After the game is completed there is a cut scene explaining that there will be more episodes so maybe the developers are creating more (hopefully free) updates with aditional levels. One problem is that the game essentially becomes allot easier when you realise that all you need to do is chuck ninja stars to win although this did not stop me from having to replay the final boss a few times.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QTEwuYkQco","January 5, 2015","true","1.1"," 14 of 26 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","14","26","0","0"

When you use your ninja stars, jump attacks, whirlwind or torpedo moves this all uses up Ninja Guy’s blue bar. Even though it regenerates slowly on its own, the idea is that killing enemies boosts your Ninja Focus allowing you to potentially chain an unlimited supply of special moves one after the other. If you simply hack and slash without much thought (without killing enemies), you’ll run out of Ninja Focus and be left with simple melee moves - and that leaves you vulnerable to ambushes. There is definitely an element of tactics required to succeed in this game.\n\nAll things considered, for this price the game is great fun!","January 5, 2015","true","2.1"," 10 of 20 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","10","20","0","0"

Lasts about an hour even after repetitive dying on some levels.\n- Another unnecessary mobile port.\n\nI really, really hated this game when I was playing through the first post-tutorial level. I got frustrated and quit. Picked it back up a few hours later and actually got a few chuckles while I completed the game.
