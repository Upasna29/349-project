Unfortunatley, they made this average third-person squad-based multiplayer.\n\nBeing a team-based, it doesn't do a very good job at it since you don't have a specific role like in Battlefield. However, it wants you to work as a team with a multiplier count that increases if you're with your teamates. This game only has that incentive to work as a team and nothing else.\n\nRegarding the shooting and gameplay, it's very standard, similar to Call of Duty. You progress unlocking weapons, attachments and special abilities. Special abilities include throwing a dog against your enemies, but that's the only fun you're gonna get out of those set of abilities.\n\nSpecial Force: Team X innovates by dropping crazy weapons randomly on the map (like a chainsaw) and those maps are generated by the players. Before beginning a match, the map is seperated in 3 parts of which players vote which part and on which location on the map is placed.\n\nRegarding the graphic quality, it's noting special but gets the job done easily. As to the animations, they're quite basic but also are tolerable.\n\nBottom line, don't get this game, the multiplayer scene is dead and it has not been updated with new content and I wasted 8 euros on it which could've been perfectly used on many other games. I was a bad consumer buying this game but I can compensate it by warning you not to buy it. I do not recommend at all.","September 20, 2013","false","0.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Read on for why.*\nThis game is one of those very depressing scenarios.\nI bought it over two years ago when there were a few servers.  I haven't really played it since, so I started up the game.\nThere are no servers.  Not even a single server or single player.  Either way, let me move on to the actual game:\nSpecial forces: Team X does something special, overall.  It takes an almost unbearably generic, cliche, basic formula for a multiplayer shooter and adds bits and bobs that turn it into something wonderful.\nThe game controls very smoothly, has reasonable controls, no bugs so to speak of, and overall works.\nIt is a generic multiplayer formula with two teams duking it out in deathmath, CTF, or outpost control (this last one may not exist I may be forgetting).  Players must murder each others' teams to win.\nYou create your class in a generic fashion, fixing together static primary and secondary weapons with little to no customization, choosing how you want your character to look.  You also get to choose your preferred grenade type, and preferred special attack (some are unique, such as spontaneously spawning individual attack dogs).\nThis generic formula for the game feels overall amazing.  The game is actually cover-based, which works quite well.  Shooting enemies feels EXTREMELY satisfying.  The guns all have a kick, and the flashy aesthetics are all enjoyable.  The graphics are cell-shaded, which works surprisingly well for this game, and it looks quite nice.\nWhere the game excels in is its one very, VERY unique feature.  No game up to this has ever used it, and to my knowledge, no current MFPS has ever used this idea:\nServer lobby map selection is split into three parts.  There are several different "maps," which each are split into three sections.  When players are voting for the map, there will be a winning map for component 1, component 2, and component 3.  Upon starting the game, the components will all be blended seamlessly into each other for the one map experience.\nHere's an example: Let's say I wanted chunk A) to be the "a" component from 'scrapyard',* chunk B) to be from "offices," and chunk C) to be from 'construction yard.'  (Something really cool is that these are actually different maps; IE "scrapyard" has B and C components as well) Each player then votes for each section.  My preferred chunk C), "construction yard," won the vote, but A and C ended up being completely different map components.  The enemy team might be swarming in from the offices, but I can still snipe them from the crane in construction yard! It's an AWESOME gimmick that I really wish was used more often.\nThe game is awesome in almost every way.  There isn't a lot of content at all, and won't entertain you for THAT long, but is generally an extremely fun, extremely high quality gaming experience.  But what is the giant whale in the bathtub? Why should you not buy it?  Well, you remember when I said that there is not a single player?  Well, of course, you must be able to spawn a solo server with bots, right?\n...WRONG.  The game stupidly does not let you play with bots.  That means that the closest you will EVER get to actually playing, and enjoying this game, is by going into an empty server and playing around with the game mechanics all by yourself.  It's really quite depressing, this game could've been something really special, but the community being dead legitimately kills the game.\nPROS:\n>Game works flawlessly, perfect graphics, controls, no glitches to speak of\n>Extremely fun gunplay\n>Brilliant map customization factor\nCONS:\n>Not much depth, honestly while it could be worth the 10$, you don't necessarily feel like you are getting 10$ worth of content\n>No ability to play with bots at all, despite lack of servers or online players\n\n*I just made up the names of these maps.  I wasn't really paying attention to what they are called.\n\nTL:DR;  Special forces: Team X takes a cliche, uninspired concept and through near-perfect design, fun and satisfying gameplay, and some unique map-based elements, makes it something truly special.  However, the lack of servers as well as bot functionality means that it is literally not possible to play the game.  Unless you consider blankly running around and shooting at a wall without any other players "fun."\n","July 25, 2015","false","2.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Thyme","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197977434623/","612 products in account","This is an excellent game with all the core elements of a good, competitive, 3rd person shooter. You drop behind and hop over terrain easily, shootouts are fast paced and fun, and the voting on map layouts means you get something always familiar but with just enough variation to keep things interesting. That being said, it's nothing special. It won't revolutionize shooters or lend anything to future games. However, it strips away all the unnecessary elements and keeps everything fun and innovative about these kinds of games from the last several years. That makes for a solid game that's fun to play against others, even if it's almost entirely derivative.\n\nThe online community for this has somewhat died out, so I wouldn't recommend it too highly anymore; however, keeping an eye out for similar games from this publisher would not be unwise. A game like this without too high a pricetag that offers solid gameplay will always be worth the investment, in my opinion, even if it's a lot of rehashing. I can't in good conscience recommend the game anymore because the online community has sadly waned away.","September 29, 2014","false","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is nothing particularly wrong with the title itself, even if it is a little generic – you can still have some fun with it once you find a server with some others playing. What hurts it, though, is the unfinished polish, occasional bugs and lack of players, to the point where I believe Zombie Studios needs to rethink the future for Special Forces: Team X, because it will soon go the way of the dodo and be long forgotten within a month or so.","December 26, 2013","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game tries to fall somewhere inbetween the intense unforgiving tactical atmosphere of Ghost Recon Online while having a hard fast pace of Call of Duty and it doesn't really work. The art style is great, but numerous game breaking bugs, along with countless dead servers, lots of lag, unusual hit box miscalculations, and overpowered high tiered weapons make this a game to skip.

(remember that now!)\n\n(no way of playing it right, but maybe one or two dudes setting up servers else no! now check with devs or other medias for update on that and sorry for a quite late review may not remember the shooting/gun play of this game)\n\n\n\nOkey got to say I would recommend it very much good balance of run and gun while cover is much better but what this does good is that it:\nPros:\n-Very fun, were everyone is balanced to some degree and noone is overpowerd (only OP under small sircumstances were they should be OP at like chainsaw be OP close etc but atleast it feels like you have gained a good boost for your team and the others can just find such a good weapon as well since its enough of those crates that holds good weapons)\n- Comfy art design makes it fun and relaxing while pumped when in action (and seeing a person called `My biggest dady" screaming with a chainsaw in my face damnit).\n- Maps and misc that makes teamwork better but also pushed it having teamwork with how most of the map design works and spawning.\n- 1/3 is random + the other 1/3 and the last 1/3 is all randomized for 4 or 5 whole (complete) maps that is cut down into workable state of gameplay and the randomizer.\n\nCons:\n-Bit jerky on servers when moving.\n-Some heavy frame drops with explosives or many bullets.\n- Not allways showing anim because of lagg and becomes very tele fights for now you are an magican!\n- Being registraded shot to death when running around corner lagg if think you was safe for a moment but I guess not...\n\n\nSome "walls" can be shot through making you rage you X on the Y.\nNo Special Force..\nBut an special force as being quite uniqly special not harcore stealth its hardcore in you face...\n\nTakes some skill to get used too the fast and slow paste in battles.\n\nAlso this has a mix of fastpaste Rainbow six cover/combat style with aracady COD run and gun its quite fun for some hours that makes this worth it.","September 27, 2014","true","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has a lot of potential that they just left hanging and it's dissapointing to see a cool game like this just die out.
