You must not only learn handling the cars: boats and planes control extremely differently each, other making the game more deep and enjoyable.\n\nThe tracks are extremely well designed, both visually and technically. There are some noob friendly courses like Carrier Zone and some strongly skill indexing ones like Burning Depths or Adder's Lair. Tracks are also changing lap after lap, which is very refreshing to the standard racing formula.\n\nFor many people this game may be very hard to complete on 100%. The AI isn't messing around - you WILL get hurt. But, you need to know - winning in this game is SO satisfying. You must fight all the time and even is you lose 9 times, then the 10th winning attempt will greatly repay you above your former investment. This is highly skillful game - the difficulty curve ends EXTREMELY high unlike other new racing games.\n\nNO BLUE SHELL. Automatic positive. Weapons are very well balanced for the kart racing. There is still bit of luck, however is less emphasized than in the other games from this genre.\n\nThe main draw of this game is an online mode. When it works fine it is extremely enjoyable. Unfortunely there are many disconnection and lag problems that may make you Rage Quit for a while. That's not good by any means, but there is a high chance that you will get over it. The community is handling some bi-weekly tournaments, so drop on by!\n\nFun and refreshing mechanics that you will love to explore and use for your advantage. I highly recommend this game, especially for non-Sega fans, because this game is far FAR more than a simple fanservice.","November 25, 2013","true","281.6"," 515 of 552 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","515","552","0","7"

When the port ends, you drive off of a cliff only to have your car turn into a jet. After you come down and complete a lap expecting to see the same thing, a giant airship has crashed into the port. Forcing you to drive into a path unknown, the river below where your car morphs into a boat. Mines drop into the water, sending waves that you and your rivals then need to traverse the dynamic water. On your third lap around, the airships get engaged in battle and have completely destroyed the port, causing you to have to fly through burning airships and find your way around the crashing behemoths. As you're dominating the competition on the third lap, you can hear the fans chant your name.\n\nThis is Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed. Every race might be three laps with many paths, but the second and third laps usually deviate in a big way from the first. You won't just be driving cars around the 20+ courses (40+ with mirrored mode), but you'll be piloting ships and jets. The tracks are gorgeous. Themed and inspired from classic SEGA games like Sonic, Super Monkey Ball, Shinobi, Jet Set Radio, Golden Axe, Afterburner, Nights and many more. Even lesser known games like Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg get their own track. A lot of love and detail went into this game and it shows. Bright colors for some tracks, realistic lighting and texture for others. There is something here for everyone.\n\nThe controls are easy yet difficult to master. Left thumbstick to steer, a button to use items, a button to look back, right stick to do tricks in mid air, right trigger to speed up and left trigger to slide / drift. Drifting around corners will not only tighten your turn radius, but if you hold it for long enough, it will boost your speed when you come out. Every character has his or her own stats: Speed, acceleration, handling, boost and all star. These stats balance out drivers. The All-Star determines how frequently you will get it from the items. When you have it, you're temporarily turned into a jet.\n\nSince this is a 'kart' style game, there are items that you'll pick up from floating red orbs. The fire crackers launch forward and bounce off of walls.  There are ice balls that come in threes and will first stun opponents. Hitting them with more ice freezes them longer. A hot rod that will give you a temporary speed boost and you can detonate it, making a ring of fire around you. A drone that will follow the driver you've selected. You can even change the driver by pointing at a new one. A simple speed boost. A spiked blowfish that you can leave on the course. Finally, one of the most creative weapons, a swarm that will charge forward and will put giant wasps on the course. It will cause drivers to weave through them.\n\nEach of these weapons can get fired ahead of you or behind you. Making everything valuable and useful. How do you defend against all these things? Well you can evade them, but there is also a glove that will catch projectiles. Not just that, but then you can throw them back.\n\nWith all these weapons, they don't feel like they'll cause a winner. The game still feels skill based. The last driver won't get an item that will drop them off at first place. There is no item that will seek out and rob whomever is in the lead. It is possible that you can take such a lead that no weapon can overtake you, only your own bad driving will lose you the lead. You can also fall so far behind that nothing will bring you to the others.\n\nAs you play through the game, the characters you play as will get experience. When a character levels up, he or she gets a modification. Simple things like handling or speed. They give you an extra point, but because the game feels balanced, they take away a point from something else. It is a nice system, especially when considering multi-player balance.\n\nThere are boosters marked with purple arrows in the air, water and the track to move you faster. That's not the only way though. When you are in the air, you can do a trick by using the right thumb stick. If you land the trick you get a boost. If you fail, you get slowed down. The game avoids crashes. Even if you fly off the track, the screen just wipes and puts you back in the game. The tricks have another purpose when you're in the air. Left and right do barrel rolls. Up and down do flips. This makes sure that you don't jump off the track.\n\nSega makes use of its rich history and there are plenty of drivers. Characters from Sonic's series, Crazy Taxi, Super Monkey Ball, Football Manager, Nights, Shinobi, Panzer Dragoon, Rome: Total War, Space Channel 5, Team Fortress 2 (three characters as one), an unlockable famous real life racecar driver and so many more. Wreck it Ralph is even here straight from the animated movie! Even if you've never heard of Sega or Sonic, there's always someone here to recognize. It is a huge roster of drivers and thankfully a lot of them are unlockable throughout the game's various modes.\n\nThere are career modes that have your typical Grand Prix with 5 cups that have 4 races each. Each race generally lasts around 5 minutes. Complete all 5 of the Grand Prix and earn mirrored track mode. The main game mode is the World Cup that has you participating in a lot of different events for stars. You will unlock events on a sort of map. When you take part in the event you set easy, medium or hard. Each new victory will give you a star. Easy gets you one star, hard gets you three. These stars are to progress and to unlock new drivers.\n\nBut with the World Cup, you don't just race. There is a whole slew of events. Drifting challenges, time challenges, battle challenges that have you destroying other racers, traffic attacks where you need to dodge other cars, vs races that pit you against another driver, ghost races that have you competing against game developer ghosts, ring races that have you flying through rings and even a perusing a tank boss to destroy it. There is a lot of variety here and I for one appreciate it.\n\nOn top of that, you have local co-op and online co-op that finds you matches based on what mode you want. There are typical races, battle arenas and a few others. The process is pretty streamlined. You vote on a track from three random tracks. Then select your driver, view their license to see how good your competition is. Then you race to see who is the best.\n\nFor every achievement you unlock, you get a sticker. You can place 3 stickers on your license as a flaunt or a personalization that tells other players about you at a glance. There is still in depth information to everyone, which is always nice. When you win, your online rating goes up, when you lose it goes down. It is all a nice system.\n\nWhen you head into a race in Grand Prix and multiplayer, you can play a slot machine for buffs. These buffs are things like ice doesn't slow you as much. You get a glove every lap. Things that mix it up, but really doesn't make anyone overpowered. The slot machine is a diversion during the loading screen. How do you get coins for the machine? On the track there are coins every so often that you can pick up. Not just that, but when a driver is hit with a weapon or falls off the track, they leave a coin. This rewards aggressive players. Plus someone else can always sneak in to take the coin.\n\nThis game has a lot of content that puts it somewhere at the top of the heap when it comes to combat cart racing. While it has weapons, it is skill in the subtleties of the game that will win you races. Every track has its own flair and is a thing of sheer beauty. It is a lot of fun for anyone that needs something different yet similar to Mario Kart. It feels like a genre that was sorely missing from Steam and Sega didn't just fill that void, they hit a home run with it.","November 12, 2014","true","8.3"," 151 of 160 people (94%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","94","151","160","7","12"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dat-silly-goose/recommended/212480/","dat-silly-goose","silly'Goose","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dat-silly-goose/","222 products in account","My most treasured friend, who changed my life, gave me this game during her birthday. Without me having no idea what it was going to be about, I assumed it would have been another clone of Mario Kart, so I just wanted it for the online. But, I was astonished...\nYOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW LONG I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR A KART RACING GAME LIKE THIS.\n\nBefore I explain why this is my favorite game on steam and my Game of The Year for 2013, I'd like to give a bit of history of my experience with Kart Racing games.\n\nI've been a huge kart racing fan since SNES's Super Mario Kart. They're fun to play especially with friends but I felt they lacked something. As technology advance with the introduction of online, modern kart racing games had online sessions where you can play with others. I remember waking up early at 5am to playing Mario Kart Wii to play with a friend via online. It was fun playing with her causally, but when we played 1 v 1. The experience was boring and it felt like just playing a normal racing game since the items weren't made for 1 v 1. This made me realize that the fact is that many contemporary Kart Racing games such as Mario Kart and other MK clones aren't designed to be intense, fast or competitive. If you tried to play competitive 1 v 1, you're going to get a boring experience because modern kart racing games are design to be with 10+ players with explosives items and just pure luck. Basically, anyone can play, blindly, and it manage to win. Some may like it, but I felt it was boring because it lacked challenge.\n\nSonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is the exact opposite because it is a immensely fast, competitive, challenging kart racing game. It is a game you can pick up and expect to get your butt kicked at Normal level. If you think Hard is impossible, this game offers Very Hard mode which will test your skills. It requires mastering maps and developing skills while fantastic music playing. It's like if someone mixed F-Zero with Mario Kart.\n\nUnfortunately, where the game fails is that it does not any introduction or tutorial. I highly recommend checking out guides before playing.\n\nBut when you begin to master the game, you'll realize just how good, if not better, competitive kart racing games than causal fun kart racing games.  What Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed does what many kart racing games fail such is  combine map advantages, fair items, and skills together. Majority of these maps are designed for a player to use the map at their advantage such as drifting and stunts. Stunts are tricks you can perform with your right analog. Performing more than one will reward a player with a high tier boost. Drifting also plays a key role as if a player has better drifting skills than others, they're able to drift smoothly and avoid crashes and hazards. Mixing the two together can give you a insane amount of speed up to a level 6 boost. If you have some skill in stunts and drifting, you'll be able to destroy any novice played easily and make an entire lobby receive a "Did Not Finish"\n\nSonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed's items are some of the most balanced fair items I've seen on a kart racing game. Any of the items are very easy to avoid just by drifting and preforming a stunt. There items that shoot directly, set traps, or just gain boosts. The most interesting is the Bees or Sky tigers. They can either target first place or shoot back, but what it does is spread a ton of bees that blocks or hits 1st player. BUT, if you're really good at the game, you can drift and slide your way out of the hazard or any item.\n\nBeing more specific, the game introduces Boats and planes. Boat, for example, is almost like karts, but you use the water at your advantage. You're able to do stunts when falling off a cliff or bouncing out of the waves to gain an incredible amount of speed. In my opinion, boat and kart are very similar. On the other hand, a player can also use a plane where it opens creatively for the player. There are almost no restrictions and you can fly how you want. All three, the player is able to drift, stunt, and preform a variety of skills to gain speed. What makes the game play different from other kart racing games is that the game rewards you for taking risks, which pushes you to try your best and learn how to go faster. If you try to avoid crashes and hazards uses boosts, you get a risk boost or stunt boosts. This gives a player new idea to get better at the game. What I love the most is that there is no "best" path or road. Majority of the paths in maps are balanced and you could take any path you want and still win. It all depends on your skills.\n\nIn addition to all this crazy talk about drifting, stunts, and skills, Transformed's maps are some of the best kart racing maps. Rather than looping around the same track three times, the maps actually change as you progress. While the graphic or textures on the maps aren't that great compare to today's graphics, the map's environment is where it shines. If you notice that majority of the maps have some kind of action going on. Even maps that have the same track such as Carrier zone something happen such as planes flying back and forth while there explosions happening. AND, a huge missiles flies up to the sky. It just looks amazing. There even maps where the track changes entirely. There a map where you're just racing and if you look in the sky, there actually a battle happening, at the same time. In your second lap, the plane crashes and the players racing are force to use the water to continue the race. Just as you reach your final lap, a dragon destroys the track and you have to take plane. It sounds insane, right? Some of these maps, you actually feel like you're playing the actual SEGA game where it came from especially if you played the game such as Nights Into Dream's Dream Valley map. These are seriously some of the most creative unique maps I've ever played on.\n\nWith great maps comes segantic (fantastic) music! This game offers a variety of abandon songs from Sonic games like You can Do Anything to obscure songs like Carrier Zone to remastered remixes from very old SEGA titles such as Space Harrier. If grew up playing SEGA games, this game will satisfy all your music needs and you'll remember all those valuable moments you had playing your old SEGA games. It does not matter if you played a SEGA game, you'll be nodding your head to the tunes. Some of these songs are addicting such as Race of Ages, Carrier Zone, or Amigo's Spanish song. What I love about these songs is that they improve the game play significantly as they make the game play more suspenseful, intense and climactic. For example, I've played with players who are WAY better than me, but what I was impressed was the fact that I did not care about 1st place. I just wanted to beat the person that was preventing me from getting the closest place. There moments when I was battling against a player trying to keep a place and I eventually beat the person, but laugh when I realized that I was fighting for 4th place. I simply did not care about getting 1st place, it was all about having fun and trying to beat your friends or rivals. I've seriously had some of the best intense moments in this game that no other game can offer. It's like being a driver of the ending of a Fast and Furious movie where it all comes to your skills.\n\nWhat really impressive me is the fact that many players seem to enjoy the game's contribution to old SEGA titles that went and bought old SEGA titles they loved from Transformed. SUMO Digital or SOL did a wonderful job showing their love for their SEGA best classics. You can tell a ton of love, and effort when building this game.\n\nSonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed should be on history for separating kart racing games from Mario Kart Clones and try something entirely different. Now, there causal racing and competitive racing.","July 12, 2014","true","392.7"," 119 of 125 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","119","125","0","31"

Following the template of ´95 games, this game is the proof of gaming culture reborn. With fantastic music, levels with incredible contrast, and gameplay so amazingly well built, you would be missing out one of the greatest and most fun multiplayer port one could think of. For your own sake, and the sake of realising that high quality games still exists, you need this game more than you think.\n\nThis game is seriously good. Ever play Mario Kart, Diddy Kong Racing, or Burnout? Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed basically combines all of the good elements of these games, and does a great job of having characters you actually want to see from both in the Sega universe and not in the Sega universe.\n\nMost of the item weapons are counterable, INCLUDING the 1st place screw you item: THE BEES THE BEEEESS. I think everyone has a deep loathing of Mario Karts Blue Shell aka “bend over and prepare your ♥♥♥♥” or get into 2nd place for 90% of the race dammit. I am giving the Hot Rod item the screw you award though, it can be extremely cheap. The transform theme also bleeds into the tracks. The tracks actually change shape and even switch up when you transform, and it does it in very creative ways. For example, the one track gets blown to bits by an invading force, making you transform to plane for the last lap. This game easily ranks up there as one of the best goofy kart racers of all time!\n\nI mean, really, when this game has Team Fortress 2 characters and Wreck-It Ralph as kart racer options, how can you hate this game? HOW?!","August 30, 2013","true","40.3"," 158 of 186 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","158","186","0","4"

It takes everything good about Mario Kart, gives you more ways to increase your speed based on your skill, and has many different ways to play any character allowing you to play with anyone you like and have your optimal stats.\n\nThe course design, give or take a level or two, is always on the point. There's nothing more satisfying than learning a course and being able to flip and drift constantly. The ways the courses are laid out and change really allows you to visually tell how much better you're getting at playing, and it's always a nice feeling.\n\nThe graphics of the game also manage to shine quite well. With a well optimized engine allowing for nearly anyone to play, it's almost a surprise how good this game manages to look. The small details in everything from the Casino Park level to the Jet Set Radio level pop out quite nicely, and manage to look good even at top speeds.\n\nThe gameplay of the game is fun, simply put. I really can't think of another way to put it. The items are fun to launch at your friends or enemies, and they can all be avoided with other items or skill. If you dislike Mario Kart simply because of the blue shell, this might be your game. All three of the vehicle types are also perfectly balanced, and feel great to play with. It's just fun watching your car swiftly turn into a plane and then continue flying against your opponents.\n\nIf you're looking for a game to sit around and play with a bunch of friends online, I would highly recommend this one.

So many more.. But what makes this better is that you can do all this with your friends together and unlock new maps and characters which keeps you locked in the game trying to beat bosses and progress through the campaign.\n\nThe transformation with the kart, to boat, to air vehicle works great and just makes the game more original.\n\nA game you should definately play split screen with friends and one you can challenge yourself to reach your All Star potential. 9/10","December 12, 2014","true","23.2"," 81 of 84 people (96%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","96","81","84","5","0"

Sonic Racing Transformed's gimmick, the changing tracks & vehicle transformations is well executed, with each of the 3 vehicle types (car, boat, plane) feeling different, although the water driving feels a bit iffy. The tracks themselves are also generally very well made, with all of them very closing resembling the stages from the games they take inspiration from.\nThe game also has a pretty good roster of characters from the sega stable, including   characters from sonic, Jet Set Radio, Skyes of Arcadia, and even PC exclusives like Football Manager and Heavy/Pyro/Spy from TF2, and while not that different from eachother, they still have small differences.\nLastly, perfomance wise, it's one of the better ports I've seen. PC's from 2008 will run this game just fine @ 60FPS or nearly that with most eyecandy on max.","July 14, 2013","true","19.8"," 92 of 112 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","92","112","0","0"

The Steam version of Sonic and All-Stars racing Transformed is the best one by far, just for being able to run at 60 FPS if you computer can support it. Seriously, it just looks so much faster and feels so much better than the console versions.\n\nGameplay modes include the amazing World Tour, where you take on various missions and collect stars to unlock more characters and modifications for their vehicles. Grand Prix, your standard Mario Kart style mode where you compete in a series of races and try to get more points than the other guys. Time Attack, where you attempt to get the fastest lap on a track. The game also has online matchmaking in the form of standard races, Arena where you can compete in the game's 3 arena modes: Battle Race (like a regular race, but you are knocked out after taking 3 hits), Battle Arena (takes place on special combat-based maps and try to shoot the other guys and stuff), and Capture the Chao (find a Chao and deliver it to its destination, while others try to bump into you and steal it), and Lucky Dip, which is a mix of the two modes and also includes Boost Race (tracks have more boost pads, but no items will spawn).\n\nOnline is fairly populated in the Race lobby, but seems to be sort of dead on Arena and Lucky Dip. A word of warning: Make SURE you at least play through World Tour before going online! There are plenty of VERY skilled players online, and you'll want a decent grasp of the tracks and the controls before taking them on. Thankfully, the community is one of the best i've seen in any online game; I've nearly doubled my Steam friend list just from playing this! The top players have written plenty of guides for this game if you're having trouble; be sure to check them out.\n\nUnfortunately, since this game uses the same peer-to-peer networking as the console versions, lag can rear its ugly head. Its two major manifestations take the form of collisions that send your car flying, and several-second pauses that can throw you off guard. It doesn't happen every race, but it can show up, so be prepared.\n\nOverall, just a great game, never thought I'd put so many hours into this, but I just can't stop!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/undox/recommended/212480/","undox","undox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/undox/","4208 products in account","When most people simply glanced at the game, it is easy to look at it as just another mascot kart racing game.  With character racers like Crash Team Racing, LittleBigPlanet Karting, and especially Mario Kart, one would think that that there is nothing more to do.  However, by taking a closer look, it becomes clear that there is more than meets the eye.\n\nWhile the various characters will get your attention, the vehicles that they drive are the important detail.  Depending on the track, the drivers will use either the classic go-kart, a speedboat, or a fighter jet.  Using various vehicles was used in other games like Diddy Kong Racing, but Transformed taking it a step further.  In most cases, the tracks consist of multiple terrains.  Mario Kart has changing terrains, but your kart does not change with it.  If you go into the water, you end up driving in the water, but it is still in kart form.  If you go into the air, a hang glider comes out to extend your jump, but it still counts as more ground racing instead of real aerial races.  In this game, when going from one terrain to another, the vehicles will change accordingly to match it.  That means if your kart goes into the water, the kart will change into a speedboat.  If you hit a big ramp, it will now become a fighter jet.  With your vehicle changing throughout the race, it makes the vehicles more interesting than usual.\n\nThe vehicles are not the only thing that transforms in this game.  As you race progresses, the tracks will change along with it, a feature few racers ever did.  In one prime example, Dragon Canyon, each lap has its own feel.  In lap one, you will start by driving along wooden bridges and rock roads.  Partially into lap two, a giant rock will block the road forcing the racers onto an unstable water route with waves, rocks, and waterfalls.  On the final lap, a dragon will blow up the wooden bridge making everybody to take to the skies dodging pillars and monsters.  With an ever-changing track layout, it makes repeating the same track a lot more exciting than other racing games.\n\nAs with most kart racers, items are a part of the action.  While these weapons make the racing more interesting, they tend to make things unfair.  This is something that this game fixes.  One of these is a weapon that locks onto a racer and seeks it until it makes contact.  In most games, once somebody launches this weapon, all you can do is take the hit.  In here, when the game warns you, it is possible to dodge it with a well-timed boost.  Additionally, another item will allow you go grab them weapon and, if desired, send it back to them.\n\nOne more detail about them items is how they are against the leader.  In these games, there is usually a weapon designed to attack specifically the leader.  What makes them bad is that because they are guaranteed to hit the leader regardless of their distance.  This makes it that the game will penalized the leader simply for being in the lead.  Transformed realized this is unfair and fixes it.  With this game, to attack the leader, the weapon used is a swarm of bees.  While they will hurt the leader if they hit, that is not a guarantee.  They work by acting as a series of pillars.  Through skillful driving, it is possible to drive around them unharmed.  By making it that lead targeting item works on skill instead of blind targeting, this makes that if the leader can avoid them, then that person deserves to be in the lead, the way that it should be.\n\nAnother thing that makes the game stand out are the modes available.  Like any racing them, Grand Prix racing is the main draw of the game.  However, another mode stands out in this game.  In World Tour mode, the game gives various challenges besides simply winning a race.  One on track, dozens of cars will crowd the track making it hard to maneuver.  On another, a tank will try to blast you.  On yet another, the player need to fly through rings that send them both on and off the regular course.  With so much variety, this could have been a game onto itself.  With all the extra challenges, most other racing games pale in comparison.\n\nEven though the newest Mario Kart game is about a year newer, this is what it should have been.  Even for those that play on Nintendo systems, this is the superior kart racer to play.  Since this is a multiplatform game, fans of the genre should not miss on one of the best games released in years.","March 24, 2015","true","27.7"," 40 of 49 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","40","49","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/212480/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","I have never been a fan of any type of racing game, but Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed has kept me playing somehow! Commonly referred to as "Sonic Kart", Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed carries on the mantle of SEGA's racing franchises, coming after titles such as Outrun and Daytona USA. It features a lot of the characters and locales from alot of SEGA's major and not-so-major franchises (I'm looking at you, Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg!).\n\n"What does the Transformed in the title mean?", you might be wondering. To put it simply, each racer's car can transform between a car, boat, and a plane! This makes for some interesting track designs, as portions of each track are land, water, and air-based, and transition between each other very smoothly. It's exciting watching your car morph into a boat or plane without losing any momentum! Sadly, the water segments are the weakest points, as you do not have the traction of the track, and waves don't seem to have any impact on your boat at all. The plane is easily the most fun segment, with the car segments coming second. A major mechanic in the game is "Drifting", in which you brake and turn to the side around curves, which after awhile will earn you a boost when you come out of drifting. Using this to your advantage is key to keeping up with your opponents and winning races!\n\nWith over 20 tracks (40 if you count the mirrored tracks), there is never a dull moment. Tracks also morph and terraform between laps, offering a different experience per lap, and chaning up the land/air/water segments as you go. Tracks range from your typical Sonic locales (Casino Palace, Seaside), to a Panzer Dragoon track, Super Monkey Ball, and Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg. Each track is unique, and they all change as the race progresses.\n\nThere are many, many characters available to unlock, all representing the franchise they come from. Of course, you have your obvious characters...Sonic the Hedgehog, Knuckles the Echidna, Tails, and Metal Sonic. But there are also characters such as Wreck-It-Ralph, Beat from Jet Set Radio, MiMi from Super Monkey Ball, Vyse from Skies of Arcadia, Ulala from Space Channel 5, and many more. Exclusive to the Steam version are also the Tactician from Football Manager, the Deadly Assassin from Total War: Shogun, and Heavy/Spy/Pyro from Team Fortress 2. Each one levels up, gaining more "car mods" with which you can customize the performance of your vehicle. Your car has a few stats on which it is graded, which can be adjusted with your unlocked mods: Speed, Handling, Acceleration, Boost, and All-Star. All-Star is a special ability unique to each character that can be activated by collecting the appropriate power-up. For example, Knuckles' All-Star ability allows him to use the Master Emerald to conjure a Chaos Blast-like explosion.\n\nThere are a number of power-ups that can be used, each obtained from a Random Item pickup. Once picked up, a very fast roulette will determine what power-up you receive. This is completely random, and is also the only way to get the All-Star power-up. Examples of some power-ups are Snow (allows you to throw up to 3 snowballs at opponents), Boost (gives you a free, trigger-at-will boost), Fireworks (similar to Snow, but fires a Firework that bounces between walls), and Blowfish (drops a blowfish on the track which stops any racers who hits it momentarily). If you hit an opponent with a power-up like Snow or Firework, they will drop a Coin. These are collected and used to play a slots game before each race, at the cost of 5 Coins per pull. You can obtain a random power-up at the very start of the race in this manner.\n\nThere are several games modes, including World Tour, Time Trial, Single Race, and Grand Prix. In addition to this, there is a multiplayer that utilizes Steam Matchmaking, so your are never too far from competition!\n\nAs I said at the beginning of this review, I am not a fan of racing games. But Sonic & All Stars Racing Transformed has made me change my mind about racers. They can be pretty awesome when done right, and this game definitely does it right. It's fun, vibrant, and never short on thrills, challenges, or variety. Do check this game out if you haven't already, you'll be glad you did.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=388969120\n\nHighly Recommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","February 7, 2015","true","23.4"," 41 of 51 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","41","51","0","6"

If you don't like long reviews, just skip to the last paragraph, where I summarize everything!\n\nI quite honestly don't remember just how exactly this game ended up in my library, but I recently decided to play it anyway.  Because while I may have many games I still need to play out of my library, I've been desiring a decent racing game for quite some time. Did I expect this game to actually fulfill that desire by being anything close to what could be considered a quality racing game that brought me some great amount of entertainment? Honestly, no, I did not.\n\nBut alas, I was surprised! What I expected to be nothing more than a dumbed down racing experience with unbalanced items and cheesy banter between characters that would make me want to turn this into one of those M-rated shooters I own so that I may claim unsavory vengeance upon them for their horrible forced personalities, turned out to actually be one of the few good racing games I've seen on Steam!\n\nHow is it good? Well, allow me to explain! Wait... Oh, right, that's what reviews are about... Um... Moving on!\n\nFrom the screenshots, and the involvement of Sonic and co, in a bright and cheerful-looking environment, one may be brought to the understandable conclusion that this game would only be enjoyable if you were young, or the stereotypical "hardcore" 50-year old Sonic Fan with no friends, who yells "You're too slow!" at every car he drives by on his way to his minimum wage job at the local McDonald's. You would be wrong.\n\nAmazingly enough, this game is actually enjoyable regardless of age, and you really don't have to be a fan of Sonic at all to enjoy the gameplay. I'd recommend this game regardless of the age of the player, as it's obviously safe for young kids to play, but definitely offers an enjoyable experience for older players as well (For reference, I'm almost 19).\n\nIs it for the "filthy casuals"? No, not at all! While a casual could definitely get into the game on the lower difficulties that take nearly no skill whatsoever, a pro gamer could easily find a good challenge on the hard, and expert difficulties!\n\nMy only complaint would be how few tracks there are. A total of 16 new tracks, with an additional 4 classic tracks, plus mirrored versions of all the tracks, and +1 new track with a mirrored version if you get the DLC. Thankfully, the game offers a variety of modes to make this small number of tracks less bothersome. Nonetheless, it is a small amount, and new DLCs with additional tracks are unlikely.\n\nSpeaking of the DLC, it's not bad, but I certainly wish it offered more than just one single new track. A full circuit of four new tracks would certainly be more appealing. The DLC track isn't really worth it in all honesty, since it's not nearly as interesting as the tracks originally in the game, and there's also a few bugs in it that can be accidentally triggered from time to time (nothing too frequent, so don't worry). Buy it if you really want a new character, and desperately want an extra track. Otherwise, skip it.\n\nSo, in summary, a great game for all ages (children or adults), and offers a challenge for both casuals and hardcore gamers, providing a small number of tracks, but a fair number of characters, and overall one of the few good racing games on Steam right now.","October 17, 2014","true","16.3"," 32 of 40 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","32","40","2","4"

I was fascinated, intrigued of how these top players became so awesome at this kart racer and quickly learnt that SSASRT is a rather technical Kart racing game.\n\nThose new to the SSASRT: you need to learn fundamental basics.\n\nLearn how to drift to level 3\nFind out how to risk boost and danger boost\nLearn the tracks as best as you can\nLearn how to stack your boosts\nLearn every item and use them effectively\nLearn how to avoid drones with a drift\nUnlock practice with all characters find their strengths and weaknesses\nCheck your mini-map on straight ways for approaching racers and on incoming item spam, back spam if needed to counter this and look backward to see the potential racer.\nConstantly if ever in bad situation go all-star strategy.\nAbove all else do not hit walls and practice and maintain high speed and keep consistent races\n\n\nWondering how I got so good at this game: I came up with a plan!\n\nDecided to complete career mode and gain all (232 stars) and complete all Grand Prix and mirror tracks set out to unlock all characters and their respective console mods. I thought this would give me the edge I needed but I was in for a surprise... Gaining all the all-stars in career mod was tougher than expected but at the same time it was the most rewarding. And whatever you gained in career mode without knowing ...you will be applying in online MM.\n\nSumo Digital have gone to a lot of effort at getting the balance between casually playing this Kart Racer and challenging the player to get better while also gaining rewards after completing and getting all 232 stars. And gaining a new character "Ages" was funny enough (this spells Sega backwards).\n\nI was feeling confident with my new attained super kart racing skills after completing the game, getting all 232 stars and completing Grand Prix on expert mode; I was sure I was in with a chance to take on even the top players on MM, come out on top or at least give them a good run for their money. I found myself accelerating up the ranks and obtaining & keeping a constant and respectful 1600 rank in MM. I new it was time to take on higher ranked players and test my skills.. Again I was in for surprise, feeling frustrated with my efforts and felt I had peaked only obtaining 1600 to 1700 ranks while I greatly desired to achieve a 2000 rank.\n\nTo do this I had to better my playing style to compete with higher ranks. I pushed on and came up with another plan, which was only something you could gain through experience and patience and allot of hours playing. I set out to learn all the yellow pick-up locations, what they had to offer and tap into their potential and also learned which mods and characters worked best for each track.\n\nOn some tracks this was a huge game changer: for example there are two yellow pick-ups on Graffiti City: the first pick-up is a triple boost; used at the right time you can gain tremendous speed on straight runs, however this is not always enough to win this track consistently due to the tight nature of the course and the "bees" on the second lap. Now, this is where the second yellow pick-up comes in handy, which is a (blue glove). I like to use this when the "Bees" come my/your way... activate it and sail through them, the bees also act like a wall and are slowing down other racers who might be fast approaching.\n\nThis strategy gave me huge advantage over players, and from time to time I have been accused of cheating on Grafity City. Well, once you get to grips with the course it's possible to pick both yellow pick-ups and use the triple boost and pick-up the blue glove which will both give your even more distance, when timed and use correctly.\n\nSometimes you might find yourself in challenging situations with regular players who see you as their rival, and you might end up getting a few friend requests.:)) This is something not many articles mention or people talk about...\nIt  is the online social communtiy linked with that game which I think people really need to start taking notes of because I think this is also a factor that makes this game a great success...it is the community that goes with it..\n\nSSASRT has an active racing community and friendly too, and sometimes it causes and creates rivalries in MM, especially with the Brazil players and Europeans.\n\nOne veteran SSASRT racer who goes by the alias of "harlot" decided to add me as a friend back in july, he was quick to message me about my skills limitations at that time and style... others have taken note of my potential and this gave me more confidence to keep on going and to continue racing SSASRT. I can't remember exactly what was said back then, but we soon became good rivals to one another, we both had a common goal to improve our racing style and to win as much as we can. But we had different ways of going about it. harlot said to me: If I want to really improve my game I need to "time attack", I took note of what he said and I managed to unlock all the secrets the tracks had to offer, if it wasn't for harlot's insight. It would be almost impossible for me to keep up with the elitist at MM....there is so much to learn to be at the top of your game while playing SSASRT...The game has unlimited potential in that regard!\n\nHARLOT QUOTE: I can, at this moment, be a better matchmaker in a week, than you can be a time attacker in the same amount of time\n\n\nEven though I had the Time Attack experience it did not always solve crucial problems and differences between MM and TA, that is because in MM you can pick up items and if you get hit it it slows you down… because TA promotes the use of "Console Mods", but at times this is not always suitable for MM and so, I decided to approach this differently.\n\nThis is what I come up with to address this issue:\n\nI have a character for every track in the game, I developed a strategy that will give me the overall edge to that particular track and the best balance depending on some factors, that I take into account.\nI am very specific about this, learned over time certain methods and race conditions that need a particular fine tuning, which can greatly improve your chances. This is where the true sophistication that SSASRT brings.\n\nThese are a few examples what character's I use for some of the tracks in SSASRT and the mod's I use and the yellow items I like to pick-up.\n\nRace of Ages - Ryo Hazuki - Console mod - Provides the perfect balance of movement speed - especially in water areas and being small enough to avoid going over the edge of the track.\n\nGame changer: Triple Boost yellow pick-up second lap just passed the finish line.\n\nChilly Castle - AIAI - Sonic - Manager - (Ryo Hazuki/ Console mod) - best over all mod for this track "Acceleration".\n\nGame Changer: You will need to know this course inside and out, learn TA acceleration mod and track knowledge and above all maintaining lead will see you beat this track on MM.\n\nDream valley - Ages / Ryo Hazuki / Gilleus / - Console mod\n\nGame Changer: Learn how to (Risk-boost) on practically anything and stack your boosts as best you can.\n","December 21, 2014","true","139.2"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","21","22","0","0"

All the levels are detailed, well designed and incredibly fun to play. What really makes the levels is that they feel so alive, whether its air ships battling in the skies, pieces of the track blowing up, carriers jets flying over head, or flying through exotic envirnoments it all adds to the atmoshpere.\n\n+ The majority of the levels change inbetween laps keeping things unique and interesting. There are three modes of racing: car, boat and plane.  One lap you may be driving a car and the next lap you may be flying a plane, sometimes you switch between the modes in a single lap.\n\n+Plenty of characters each with their own stats. As you play with a certain racer you unlock mods that change their stats for better performance depending on the level/mode your playing.\n\n+ The game features plenty of different modes across 4 difficulty levels. Each mode is fun to play and very creative. Some modes include racing, boost challenges, sprint, battle areans, traffic attack etc.\n\n\nThe Average\n\n- I found the weapons you use to be somewhat average. I did not find them as unique or interesting as the levels.\n\n- Multiplayer is somewhat still alive but its pretty hard to get a good game going.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis is one of the best arcade racers on Steam, if you can get some friends together you are sure to have a good time.

It plays much like the old games such as Crash Team Racing, Disney's Magical Racing Tour, and Hotwheels.  You have stunts which cause you to have up to a Level 4 Boost if you successfully pull them off, drifting long enough will also give you a boost depending how long you hold it for.\n\nYou can play through World Tour with CPU Players to unlock extra characters.  There's the usual Races, or even Traffic Attack, Battle Races, Knockout Races..\n\nLike Crash Team Racing, it also has Time Attack.  You can race Ghosts for a new Personal Best for that Track, and compete with the whole world with their best times on the Leaderboard.  This is also good to learn the Tracks.\n\nAlso like Crash Team Racing, it actually has Cups as well.  Which consist of a selection of 4 Tracks, and whoever with the most points tallied up after all the races, Wins.  You can also compete with other players in the World of their best times for any given Cup.\n\nBut before playing online, make sure you at least practice a bit Offline first to get your Skills up, because there is a LOT of good, difficult, hard-to-beat people online.  Going online without any practice what-so-ever is only going to make you feel bad.\n\n\nPerformance : Excellent (9/10)\nThis game is pretty well optimized, and apparentely even runs well on HD4000 Series Intel Graphics.  You have to play this at 60 frames per second for the best experience.  Any higher, and the game itself starts skipping frames.  So make sure you've got your FPS capped to 60, max.\n\n\nNetcode : Average (5.5/10)\nAlthough it has a few netcode problems, but I hope they can be fixed.  Those netcode problems alone don't destroy the fun-ness of the game though!\n\nIt's quite hard to predict where the player is going to be in a race unless you get enough experience.  Especially if you're from Australia and the Player is in Egypt.   People may get rammed from you into the sky even if you're no where near them on your screen!\n\nIf your connection is below average, it could cause a Network Error.  Sometimes it even makes other people get a network error as well, or even crash their game.   A shoddy connection may also make you "LAG FREEZE" while racing, meaning you game might freeze for a bit causing you to fail a stunt or ram full-on into a wall, sometimes leading to a Network Error.\n\n\nVisuals : Good (8/10)\nA lot of polish has been done to the Visuals.  The textures are of high-quality, the meshes, the...everything.  The Tracks themselves have a lot of things going on, like animating characters doing stuff on the sides of the track in Samba Studios, pretty lights in Galactic Parade, Jackpot Machines in Roulette Road.  Each character has it's own set of Vehicle Transformations from Car, Boat, and Plane. Each Character also have their own All-Stars animation.\n\n\nVariety : Good (7/10)\nInformation pending.\n\n\nStability : Ok (6/10)\nInformation pending.","March 29, 2013","true","191.9"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","19","23","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LunarLotus/recommended/212480/","LunarLotus","Luna Luck","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LunarLotus/","456 products in account","Why would I not recommend this game?\n\nThe gameplay is vastly different from the previous entry in the series. Transforming and drift boosting will give a great edge in this game once you master the latter. Risk boosting in plane mode can take some time to master since you have to roll out of the way at the last moment for it to count.\n\nThe staff ghosts can be a real pain in some levels (looking at Graveyard Gig and Burning Rangers in particular since both are a little difficult to master drifting in).\n\nCameo appearances from non-SEGA stuff (Danica Patrick, Ralph, and Yogscast if you choose to buy it) are nice to see. Interestingly, people seem to hold a lot of course record top 10 spots with Ralph with characters like Metal Sonic, Sonic, and AGES all coming pretty close to it.\n\nQuite a blast to race through the courses (although I think Mirror Mode could have been replaced with 4-8 new tracks instead, oh well, SUMO's call there) and try to beat your own record every time. I did find Traffic Attack (sans the last one) and Pursuit to be a difficult to master since those felt a tad bit more on the "need to memorize a specific course of pattern" kind of logic to me. Pursuit was way more difficult though since you have a set amount of HP so you can't just recklessly chase down the tank.\n\nThe characters were great although a couple of them looked a bit off (looking at Gum, Beat, and Pudding). Dialogue and racing stuff was pretty nice. It seems Gillius is the hardest one to master as well out of all the characters.\n\nFantastic game, whether it is in a deal on Steam or not, worth icking up and playing.","October 26, 2014","true","59.8"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","1"

It's just to much fun to bring Alex Kidd in the Golden Axe course and the Get Set Radio challenging you for the first place.\n\nThe race controls are pretty good, it's very similar to other games with this kart style, but in here you must learn how to drift to keep it up to the competition and earn some boost to make your way to the first place or to beat the time.\n\nThe game modes are very nice, you can play only some races, go for tournaments or go on career mode to earn starts and then unlock more courses and characters.\n\nThe power ups works the same way we are used to know in this style of game, and they add a good fun element. Some of them you can choose to throw ahead or leave to hit someone behind you.\n\nThe sound design is great. Every music and sound effect make all the experience in the race unique and brings the memories of those games.\n\nThe level design is awesome! It gives you the feel of movement and speed that is the heart of a race game and it is always changing! In some courses you will see all the landscape and the road being attacked and as the race goes you will change to other paths or even change completely your vehicle to a plane or boat to continue the race.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/necropotency/recommended/212480/","necropotency","Ancient","http://steamcommunity.com/id/necropotency/","238 products in account","I've seen this game for some time now and didn't really think much of it.  Finally, at it's super-low sale price I decided to give it a go.  I was a HUGE fan of "Mario Kart" - both for the Super Nintendo and for N64.  So this game had a little bit to live up to...\n\nHOLY ♥♥♥♥ WAS I SURPISED.\n\nThis game doesn't have anything to do with Sonic (aside from including him and the cast as characters...among cooler characters), it's just a balls-to-the-wall  come-get-some cart racer.  I don't think I've ever played a cart racer that felt so damned... HARDCORE.  The characters are all varyed but fairly balanced, the maps get absolutely insane, ranging from peaceful mario-kartish maps to nightmares from hell and beyond worst than anything the Rainbow Road could dream up.  And you get to enjoy all of these things not just from a Driver's Seat, but from a Cockpit and from a Captain's chair as well!\n\nThe game is hard.  Even playing alone in world tour mode on "Easy" presents some challenge.  And it'll take you a good bit of practice to beat those same races on "Normal".  Step into multiplayer?  You better be prepared for a stomping, because those kids don't mess around.\n\nI give this game a solid 8/10.  It would be a 10/10, but the marketing department loses 2 points for not letting me know I should have been playing this sooner.\n\nBUY THIS GAME NOW.  Is it full price?  Then buy it.  Is it on sale?  Then buy a few extra copies for some friends of yours.  You won't regret it.\n\n","December 12, 2013","true","9.7"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198078215383/recommended/212480/","76561198078215383","RustyRick","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198078215383/","29 products in account","So after the pretty decent but somewhat shallow outing of Sonic & SEGA All-Stars Racing, Sumo Digital sure caught me off-guard when they announced a sequel to it. Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed does a good job at improving the flaws and shortcomings the first game had, such as making the courses more varied with at least 1 track based off a different franchise such as Jet Set Radio, Golden Axe, NiGHTS, Shinobi, etc. as opposed to just running with 3 or 4 themes for each course, more interesting track design with tougher placements hazards and they even brought in remixes of various SEGA franchise tunes to accomodate the soundtrack.\n\nSonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed's main gimmick is having the vehicles and gameplay change constantly during the race, transforming your car  when you pass through large blue rings to either a boat or a plane. Some courses have a interesting mechanic in where usually the 2nd or 3rd lap has you driving through a completely different pathway, forcing you to adapt to these situations and work your way around these. Most racing game veterans will recognize this vehicle-changing gimmick from Mario Kart 7, but it reminds me more of the likes of Diddy Kong Racing from back on the N64, except that the courses are designed specifically for each vehicle mode rather than a wide-open track fitting them all. Also very important is that while you're in the air, flipping and rolling your vehicle is encouraged to build up boosts for when you land, but you have to be careful with this as not landing properly will costs you speed and lose all boost buildup, and there's switch-drifting which helps you maintain your drift boost buildup as you switch from steering left to right and vice-versa.\n\nOther new features are the mods that come with each character. Mods are pre-set custom stat adjustments that you can pick from on the character select screen to help you adjust to certain conditions better in the races and in missions in World Tour. (Explained later down below). If you get hit alot or crash into obstacles, acceleration suits your vehicle best and if it has alot of sharp turns, go for handling.\n\nItems are more or less kept the same, but given a new skin, such as the boxing glove to the missile, the barrier shield from Sonic to a glove which in addition to blocking either a stage hazard or a enemy projectile now gives you that item to use in return to get revenge on the attacker, if your item slot isn't filled with another item. Most items are balanced enough, but I will list my issues with them when I get to them.\n\nWorld Tour is also a new addition to this game specifically designed to cater to the more mission-based gameplay in where you need to clear races under certain rules or different gameplay methods, such as flying through rings in plane mode, winning consequtively from a set amount of opponents in the same race in a 1-on-1 format. The difficulty you clear these missions on affect the stars you get, which in turn are required to progress further in the World Tour's map and the real reward from doing them: unlocking new characters and special mods. Most of these missions are designed pretty decently, but your skill will be sorely tested on quite a few on them, especially in the unlockable Expert class difficulty.\n\nAs for my issues with this game:\n\n- A few items are very unbalanced and usually can most likely make or break a race for skilled players. A good example of this is the ice weapon. You gain 3 shots of these by default, and while the game tells you that shooting all 3 shots at 1 opponent will freeze and stun them longer than normal, I notice no such difference, and every seperate shot stuns you as much as getting shot by all 3. The game developers tried to implement a way to make it hard for expert players to win races by a miles' lead compared to the other racers with the Sky Tiger item, a item that spawns giant wasps in front of the 1st place lead, but won't hurt the user if he passes by them while they're still active.\nIt sounds fine on paper, but in terms of programming, it leaves alot to be desired. It works only fine on small passageways on car and boat plathways because it almost garantuees the 1st place lead can barely avoid them, but they can't spawn properly if used near a transform ring, and in the plane they are very easy to avoid due the large area's in the plane sections. It's also possible to shoot a wasp and clear yourself a way through them, which I think shouldn't be possible. It can be a decent counter to expert players, but this isn't comparable to the Blue Shell from Mario Kart by a longshot.\n\n- The method of unlocking characters in this game is very arbitrary compared to the previous game. If you want to play as your favorite character from the get-go and isn't available right at the start, you're going to spend a incredibly long time mastering the game's courses and mechanics just to be able to unlock them. For expert players this isn't a big deal, but casual players who don't have alot of free time on their hands will be annoyed by this, if they want to play as for example NiGHTS or Joe Musashi, it will take quite some time for them to even unlock them, when in the previous game you could just play a few races, earn points to spend in the shop to unlock them, and there you go.\n\n- The physics in a few courses, especially the boat sections in the game are very clunky and will cause the many frustrated losses of players. A good example of this are the boost ramps in the boat sections of Samba Tour and Adder's Lair in where if you approach the ramp from the side and not dead-on straight, your boat will tilt to ridiculous extremes and will lose all momentum and speed trying to readjust itself, or you will be launched way higher in the air than you're supposed to, and lose a good deal of speed as well. And there are also some courses in where some object events that occur in laps will actually hinder the player very drastically if they're not careful and going too fast, such as a robotic fish in the final lap of Ocean View causing the player to bump all over the place if they come in contact with it, spawning when the 1st lead reaches a specific area, and the bridge in Adder's Lair at the end of the 1st lap will not raise fast enough and cause the player to most likely crash into it and lose all speed. These are major issues and I don't understand why the developers couldn't iron out those bugs.\n\n-Unlocking the Expert class difficulty in World Tour is very late near the end of the mode itself, and forces you to replay every single mission you cleared before on the Hard difficulty all over again if you want all the stars in the game, which is a really cheap method of artifically extending the mode's gameplay length.\n\nIssues aside, Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is a solid racing game, and I do recommend it for both racing game enthusiasts and fans of SEGA's franchises in general, but beware of the steep learning curve and having to deal with occasional frustrating glitches or lag in the online gameplay.","July 20, 2014","true","568.1"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","1"

Racing transformed for a modern era, while still having that classic feel making this a must own.\n\nFor those of you feeling like Mario Kart has gotten a bit stale due to lack of innovation, this game may be more your style. This game is just teeming with love, with classic games bursting with modern visuals and sounds. Every part of this game just feels like a love letter to SEGA fans.\n\nGraphics\n\nModernized graphics for classic SEGA games such as Burning Rangers and Panzer Dragoon. The visuals in this game are stunning when you play on the highest settings, and even with a modest computer you'll still get 60+FPS making this game feel amazingly fast and fluid. All the characters are well modeled and textured, and the levels are teeming with beautiful colors and lighting. Each level has been lovingly crafted from older SEGA titles and re-imagined in ways that will bring a tear to long-time fans.\n\nSound\n\nThe music in the game mostly consists of remixed themes from older games in a mostly drum'n bass genre, with the odd dubstep-ish song thrown in here and there. But don't let that fool you, the dubstep is done in moderation and actually sounds good, even to someone who doesn't really like that genre. Each song feels fast-paced and full of action to make the gameplay that much more satisfying.\n\nGameplay\n\nNow on the the most important part, gameplay. As you may have guessed, there are 3 modes of driving, air, water, and land. Land plays exactly as you think it would, very much like Mario kart, but a bit faster and the cars feel heavier. Boating/water travel feels like slippery land travel, and is the hardest to steer on because of it. This is mostly noted in the Burning Rangers level, which is mostly boating with sharp turns in which you tend to go bumping a lot. Air travel is, well, air travel. You can still drift in the air, but you have to worry about your X axis as well, which tends to make it more difficult. You can also do stunts in the air as any vehicle, which will give you a boost if done correctly. Of course if you crash mid-stunt you're gonna go slower.\n\nThe items/weapons in the game are well thought out and even if you get smashed by every single weapon, if you're a good enough player you can still get first place. No blue shells here. Although you may want to watch out for the bees.\n\nValue for the cost\n\nAt $30 you will get way more than your money's worth. Tons of missions and unlockables, GPs to go through, stickers to unlock for doing certain things and of course, multiplayer. The multiplayer is really what will keep bringing you back to this. Online works well for the most part, and racing with up to 10 random people or friends is an absolute delight. Voice chat is included as well, and at the time of writing this there is no way to currently turn that off, but there is a patch on the way which will fix it.\n\nFinal verdict\n\nA game well worth the money that will keep you entertained for many a month. If you've ever been a fan of racing or kart racing in general you'd be doing yourself a great disservice to not give this a try.\n\n9.5/10","February 13, 2013","true","45.2"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","2"

Legitimate driving skills will take you far in this game.\n\nThe tracks are creative and varied, the game controls well, and the visuals are gorgeous.

Since this is a fairly large genre as of late, Sega needed to come up with some sort of gimmick to make the game stand out. This game's gimmick is the ability for your vehicle to transform to handle water and air. I guess it works. It certainly keeps the laps interesting instead of going around in the same circles each time. The one annoyance is that controls of the vehicle change when it transforms. It's an added learning curve, but once you get the hang of it it can be enjoyable.\n\nThe race tracks in Sonic Racing Transformed are inspired by various games from Sega franchises. I rather enjoyed the track design. I found them pleasing to look at and fun to play around in. The music remixes are also fun to listen to. In particular I enjoy the Afterburner stage and music. That one is a blast.\n\nThere's several types of races you can run, but I would have liked a few more race modes. How about some kind of separate mode where you can buy upgrades for your cart with prize money you earn? Or maybe a demolition derby where you try to ram people off a track. How about an aerial dogfight battle arena?\n\nThe weapons are a tad on the weak side. Very few really feel like game-changers, and the homing ability is spotty at best. They just lack the oomph that all Mario Kart weapons possess. I suppose this means that more skill is required in actual driving instead of facerolling with overpowered weapons, but I wouldn't mind a separate mode with said overpowered weapons.\n\nFor the advanced racers, there's additional techniques to learn in the way of boosts, which I haven't nearly mastered yet. Mastery of this is integral to high level play.\n\nI'm baffled that there's no obvious way to change tracks in multiplayer. It's sort of hidden in the corner where you must select Options, and as far as I know, there's no random option. To the best of my knowledge, there's no grand prix  or world tour mode in multiplayer either. So far I haven't experienced much lag, if any, when playing with friends online, so that gets a good mark from me.\n\nI know it's not fair to keep comparing it to Mario Kart, but that's because it's hard not to when the game clearly takes inspiration from it. Sonic Racing Transformed might not be the best of the genre, but for Steam, it may very well be the best Kart game. I rate this game a 8.5/10.  It's a plenty good racer if you and your friends only have Steam and just want to kart race.","September 16, 2015","true","9.1"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

Every map is well designed, every character haves his styled veicle and every music fit his game's map.\nThe poring of this game into the PC is not one of the best, but after some minutes of game, you will learn how to drive those frikin' veicle with no problems at all.\nThe original thing that really impress me is the fact that the maps change every lap, they're not static, but interact with everything that is goin on in the background.\n\nBut there are some problems, and some of those are ridiculous.\nSome model's eyes... they are staring at me..

Gotta go Fast!\n\nOne of my favorite racing games (besides Mario Kart). I am not the best at racing, however, I have thoroughly enjoyed this game and even held a few tournaments for some friends in different groups I am in. It took some time, but I was able to unlock all the racers and tracks to allow for variability. I am still not the best at slides but I have fun competing anyway.\n\nIf you enjoy cartoony / mario kart esque racing games, this is a game for you.\nTo be honest, I have no complaints. Maybe hope for more characters or tracks for this great title, but that was the only thing\n\n10/10 on a Dino Scale.

It has "Overwhelming Positive" rating on Steam for a reason.\n\nMario Kart was always a fun game to play, all other Kart racing games were pale in comparison. In early 2010, Sega released Sonic & All-Stars Racing and it was okay but in no means could hold up to Mario Kart games, it's controls weren't tight, the fun factor just wasn't there.\n\nThen in 2014, Sega released Sonic & All Stars Racing Transformed and it was perfection - Across multiple platforms and a flawless PC port to boot.\n\nMy preference has always been Sega over Nintendo, the last Sonic kart game let me down but this game is super smooth and a very enjoyable experience. What started off as a mere Mario Kart clone (as some games attempt to do), Sonic & Sega All Star Racing Transformed ultimately evolved into it's own thing.\n\nIn this game you will be able to play as your most beloved Sega characters - Heroes ahd Villains alike! This includes Metal Sonic from Sonic CD, Ulala from Space Channel 5, and Ryo from Shenmue. The PC version has an exclusive: You can play as Team Fortress 2 characters. This should not be a surprise to anyone.\n\nThe tracks are the most creative I've ever seen in a kart racing game. Especially the Panzer Dragoon Saga and Nights tracks.... they contrast wach other so well making it hard to get tired of the game anytime soon.\n\nThe controls are balanced and the speed of the game is very satisfying. The A.I is great, the online multiplayer works without any issues.\n\nIf you love kart racing or competitive multiplayer games, be sure to try this one out!\n\nThere is a Single Player Campaign with collectables, which is also how you unlock more characters and locations/tracks. There are cool non-race portions which include "Traffic Attack" or "Drift To Win". These make the game enjoyable as well.\n\nCheers!","March 13","true","8.2"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","1"

By far, Sumo Digital managed to extract the very essence of the classic Sega games scenery and include it on this game, and it's wonderfully done. I mean, just look at this detail of a stage based off Golden Axe[i.imgur.com].\nAnd like that track, we also have ones based on Panzer Dragoon, Samba de Amigo, Shinobi, Jet Set Radio and some other great Sega franchises.\n\nBut that's just me, and if that were the only good thing to mention about the game, then it might suck. But they managed to include driving mechanics so so so good it takes a couple hours to understand them (drifiting-based) but could take months until you manage to master it, and master every track little by little. If you go online, be prepared to be the best you could, or be crushed.\nLet me stress this once again: mechanics are and feel awesome. When you manage to charge up to 3 drift combo levels and you manage to get past that pesky AI, it's great. Also, everything. Getting hit, hitting someone with a weapon, flying, the water drag is incredible. So yeah, that's another really strong point.\nTalking about weapons, there's one amazing mechanic that they did, where they sent this swarm of bees that the first player in the race has to avoid, or it will lose the positing. It's great how they balanced that.\n\nHm, and I think I could write a thesis about the menus of this game too. Whenever you select something, the commentator encourages you to keep selecting things, the SFX, it's just great.\n\nNow, if I have to mention something I really didn't like, it's the inclusion of certain characters without any kind of relation to the Sega universe. Specifically, Danica Patrick and the Yogscast one. They feel so out of place and so unrelatable to Sega that they just break the immersion. I know they either had to maintain the sponsorships, or they did it with for a good cause (charity), but still... it's not for this game. Let me enjoy the classics, not some random dudes/dudettes.\n\nAnd that's it for this game, I could go on but it's long enough as it is.

For some reason the decided to compress it in a completely other way than all the other Sonic games. That may be because it uses VAC and if you modify the music files you could get a VAC ban or something probably.

Not only should it be physically improbable that a russian general can enter a kart race with a tank to race against an anime sky pirate, but the fact that there is a kart racer that could be argued to be as good or possibly better than Mario Kart means that we may have possibly experienced twist in the time lines that has given us a Sonic the Hedgehog kart racer that is not terrible.\n\nI will attempt to do more research into the subject, but in brief, my theory is that All-Stars Racing may possibly be a good video game that you would wish to purchase.

It features race tracks based off of worlds from Sonic games and most of SEGA's forgotten franchises and the racers vehicles transform from cars, to boats, to planes. So it's like Mario Kart 7, Diddy Kong Racing, that random Disney racing game and that Hot Wheels game that share the same idea of transforming race cars. I've never used a controller for the PC Version and I stuck to just using the keyboard, the nice thing about this is that you can adjust the controls for the keyboard to see which keys suit you more comfortably, and not just pressing random buttons all over the keyboard. The car and boat forms are cool, the boat forms are more fun as you can easily perform more tricks to get boosts. The plane form takes some time to getting used to when it comes to drifting while keeping your plane under control. The game features Career mode which is a series of different events, Grand Prix is a race to see who is the best, Time Trial is what you would expect, and Single Race is for racing on only one track, which I advise to try this feature out for practice if you just bought the game. The power ups can be useful at times, from the catchers mitt that catches the enemies weapon and being able to use it to your advantage, to chucking snowballs, ho ho ho. The All Star moves are back but are a bit disappointing. The first game featured the characters having their own specific All Star Moves with their own style and advantages, the sequel just transforms the player into the plane mode and fire's rockets at your opponents. There was also talk about special DLC that would feature more of SEGA's forgotten or internet favorite characters in the game, well it's been over a year and after that Yogscast guy was announced, I gave up on it since obviously SEGA only focuses on Sonic, they don't give a damn about their other franchises or even attempt to feature them in a new game again, and not just constantly porting their already made games onto every console. Besides, a good amount of people who bought this game only bought it just because it has Sonic characters, hence why the name Sonic is in HUGE font while the rest of the title is in smaller font. I rarely play as any of the Sonic characters from the first game (I use Bonanza Bros. all the time) and in this game. They're nothing special compared to all of SEGA's unique and forgotten creations. The 3rd Party batch of characters are very random and are just thrown in there for advertising gimmicks but hey, you can play as Pryo, Heavy and Spy that represent Team Fortress 2 in this game. So yeah, if your one of those few people that like SEGA's forgotten characters like myself, then you will enjoy this game like it's predecessor; you've got NiGHTS, Amigo, a living VMU named AGES, Vyse, Shinobi, and more.............................. but no Vectorman. :'(","December 11, 2013","true","60.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","1"

SEGA have built upon the first game well and are putting up a great challenge to the crown.\n\nSEGA understand that a successful kart racer needs a mix of good tracks, great items, and fun characters.\n\nMost of the tracks in the game are brilliantly designed. A lot of them take into account the ability to transform between the three available states; kart, boat, and plane. This enables the tracks to evolve with each lap, offering racers something new to look out for.\n\nThe items are all pretty instinctive, and there aren't too many of them. Every item has it's own use, and none feel like a waste or a duplicate.\n\nSEGA has drawn upon it's impressive back catalogue giving players a great variety of characters to drive around as. There's also a few cameos in there (like Team Fortress 2).\n\nThe racing in the game feels fluid and responsive. The graphics are acceptable. The music is great, with some remixes of classic SEGA tracks included.\n\nThe ability to transform is done well. It could've been something that was thrown in just as a gimmick, but SEGA have really incorporated it into the game, and it's obvious it was designed around this.\n\nBy far the best addition from the previous game is online multiplayer. The multiplayer system works brilliantly, and that's what will keep me playing this for a long time.\n\nAs always with racers, bring a gamepad!\n\nBottom line: A great kart racer, that's even better with friends.","January 2, 2014","true","21.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/recommended/212480/","rockstarcro","RockstarCRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/","252 products in account","I hated this game when I first played. I didn't like the tracks switching almost every lap. I didn't like the controls. I didn't like any aspect of it. Then my friend forced this game upon me by buying it and I'm glad he did. I really enjoy this game. The gameplay is pretty rock solid. This game is also certified local co-op! It's as easy as pressing start!\n\n"Another Super Mario Kart clone". Perhaps, but this game does it's best to make sure your paying attention at all times. There is always an opportunity to boost or get ahead but proper steps need to be taken in order to make it to first. The biggest difference in this game in regards to other race battle games is that drifting (to acquire boost) is essentially critical. You don't have to hit an arrow to receive a boost. Rather drifting for a certain amount of time will give you a basic turbo. Keep drifting though and notice the color of your thrusters changing colors. Going from red to blue, you'll notice a definite kick to your character upon doing a successful drift. This is a big feature in this game where now it doesn't seem really appealing, but upon playing it the game mechanics will pull you in. On top of that, don't forget you can do tricks with the right stick if you want more boost!\n\nIs there weapons in this game? Of course! Some weapons (and defensive weapons) included are baseball glove (that catches and gives you the weapon fire at you), freeze-balls with the ability to freeze opponents, blowfish that sit like mines, wasp swarms that set up "roadblocks", a rocket that locks on to opponents, a firecracker that fires in a straight line, "going all-star" which is similar to Mario Kart's star except you can shoot specialized rockets that rebound and follow, boost and explosive hot rod engines. The beauty of firing weapons is that you have the OPTION of shooting them backwards or forwards. This is a neat feature as this adds another depth to the game.\n\nThe tracks themselves (to say the least) are unique. I imagine it wasn't easy designing one course that would transform throughout the race. I should mention that the "Transformed" actually means that your mode of transportation transforms. It can either be a car, a (hover)boat or an airplane. So combine that with the tracks and you can get some challenging races but some over the top scenery to dodge. "Drifting" around a dinosaur in an airplane while trying to go through a boost while trying to shoot at an enemy is no easy work. The levels definitely seem like a lot of attention has been given to them.\n\nOn top of all this, they've added different game modes. The main menu offers career mode, match making and custom game. What is really cool is (local) players can play online as well as play in career mode! Having a hard time with a time attack? Wouldn't hurt to have a buddy to help you out. Some of the varying game modes include boost challenges, evasion, time attack, single race and even attack simulations where you have to destroy a tank while dodging his attacks. Characters themselves have the ability to level up (depending on how much you play with them) and your buddies character can level up at the same time. Upon leveling up, you will unlock certain modifiers for your car (such as boost to acceleration, handling etc...).\n\nThe visuals are decent graphics but it seems they attempted to pay attention to every little detail. For example, in the main menu there aren't much options regarding maps (as they haven't been unlocked). Upon unlocking them, you'll see more of these maps on your main screen. The maps as I've said are really interesting and really neat to play through. The characters at times will seem to fall out of their vehicle while doing stunts or boosting.The sounds are actually very good as each individual character has different dialogue for different situations. Little diversity concerning the explosion sounds and it would have been complete. I should add that when the announcer is saying 3-2-1 go that the player should hit "accelerate" (or RT) every time he says a number. This will give you a boost at the start.\n\nOverall, a really good game. It gives Mario Kart a run for it's money  but I wouldn't say it's better or worse. It's tough to compare the two but Sonic Racing is definitely fun.\n\n\n\nRATING : 7.5/10\n\n\nScreenShots :\nThe usual screen you'll be seeing\n\nDrifting and boosting\n\nReally not a fan of player 2 being first\n\n"Flyyyy like an eagle"\n\nNice glimpse into the scenery","March 23","true","9.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

Transformed plays more like a mix of Mario Kart and Diddy Kong Racing, while holding a higher priority for speed, and it's wonderful.\n\nVehicle controls are the right balance of fluid and grip. Stages change over each lap and have an arcade-like feel. Weapons are both powerful and fully balanced (Unlike Mario Kart). You can also remove rubber-banding completely. The game is still quite challenging without it, but it's much more fair for the player.\n\nWith complete local and online multiplayer, you'll be hard-pressed to find a better kart racing game.","November 25, 2013","true","73.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198055823735/recommended/212480/","76561198055823735","Unbekannter","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198055823735/","246 products in account","It is currently the free weekend for this game, and all it took, was a single, short race, in order for me to purchase it! I love this game. I've been hooked on it, all day. My brother and I have had several matches, I've been on single-player a fair bit, and I've played with some random people, online. All in all, my experience, so far, has been a great deal of fun, and wowing at the surprisingly tasty visuals, given the style of graphics.\n\nThe game runs beautifully for myself, with an ASUS 760 OC, and my brother, with an XFX HD-5750. You might well have already gathered, but this game is simply not that graphically taxing. My brother and I both have an FX-4100 - mine is overclocked to 4.2GHz, whereas my brother's CPU is at stock, and for him, the game runs at 60fps, at a 900p resolution, with everything maxed, except he has motion blur disabled. I have even gone a step futher, and forced 8x Supersampling, and 16xQ CSAA - the game still runs butter-smooth. So, to summerize, this game should run beautifully, provided you're not running a computer with a Pentium CPU, 32MB SD-RAM, an ATI Rage 4MB GPU, and Windows 95, like my first Windows computer!\n\nOne of the things I love about any game, are things that I can unlock and earn. Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed has more under the hood, than you might initially think. You'll see on Steam, that there are in-fact - as of this review's post date - 50 Steam achievements to earn. To my knowledge, there are 144 career stars to earn, ranging from various game-modes, with 3 difficulties: easy, medium, and hard. There is a GP mode (Grand Prix) allowing for 10 Grand Prix Wins. Time Attack mode sports 40 tracks on which to race, 20 being entirely different. There are 160 Staff Ghosts to beat, and each one is a different difficulty of time made on each track, from Easy to Expert. The game has 28 vehicles/characters to choose from, each with Mods, totaling 168 unlockable Mods, and if that wasn't enough, they can each be leveled up 6 times, using a simple experience system. While playing the game, you will do some impressive, and not-so-impressive things, earning you stickers - there are 100 stickers to collect, 3 of which can be shown-off on your license.\n\nAs of the post date, there 2 bits of DLC available to you, currently £4.98 in total. I must admit, the DLC doesn't interest me, as I simply don't feel it justified to pay for minor content I feel might as well have just been in the game, at launch. To each their own, as they say.\n\nI do find the graphics to be very pleasant. Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed uses only DirectX 9, so don't expect flashy DirectX 11 features; this is a Sonic racing game, pure and simple.\n\nThe music gives me a sense of nostalgia, with that unmistakable, Sega sound, however, after a while, the constant "Sega sound" blaring in your ears, may start to drive you crazy, so consider turning down that music, or disabling it!\n\nThe controls are tight, simple, and easy enough to learn, provided you don't struggle with the TV remote, or putting on slippers. The wired XBOX 360 controller, works like a dream with this Sonic game, so don't hesitate to plug it and press that Start button. In-fact, it's so nice and comfy with the controller, that I've never tried it with the K&M!\n\nYou might be wondering whether the multiplayer modes are any good - well, from where I'm sitting, they are great, with all the typical game modes found in single-player, and the ability to choose the very same characters/vehicles you've been leveling up and modding, all of which adds to a brilliant experience with your family, mates, or indeed strangers.\n\nAll in all, I've had a lot of fun on this little gem, and I would certainly, strongly recommend it to any Sonic fan, or a fan of relatively old-school, kart-style racing.","December 6, 2013","true","13.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","1"

Nearly unplayable, with ugly graphics, horribly designed stages, uninteresting characters, and just... not very fun to play in the slightest. They tend to be just quick cash ins on the Mario Kart crowd. Sega's latest crossover extraveganza doesn't fail to please. While, at the core, it may look like just your typical Mario Kart clone, it is so much more. Not only do you race by car, but mid-race, you could find your car transforming into a boat or plane.\n\nThere's a single player campaign mode that allows you to play through a ton of challenges. Drifting, tank fights, flying through rings, and standard races. There's plenty to see and do in All-Stars Racing Transformed. There's a huge variety of weapons at your disposal to take out the competition and while not as interesting as those found in the Mario Kart series, they are fun to use and do the job. With 20 tracks (21 if you count the DLC track) and a currently still ever growing roster of characters, the fun is endless.\n\nDid I mention the online is fantastic, as well? Because it is. It's your standard online with 5 different game modes, but there is absolutely no lag, which is always a plus.\n\nSo, if you're a fan of Mario Kart and also love SEGA and their IPs, you'll love this game.","December 6, 2013","true","22.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Below are the key factors behind my mindset.\n\nPROS:\n- Awesome tracks with decent level design, featuring rich environmental details, excellent BGM and diverse gameplay mechanics;\n\n- Rich character roster with some oldschool SEGA characters, along with new ones. Each one of them has 3 different vehicle designs well fit to their personalities, used in land/water/air sections of the tracks. They are not some generic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t;\n\n- Challenging campaign, which sometimes requires complete mastery of the track.\n\n- The PC version is really well implemented, featuring stunning graphics.\n\nCONS:\n- Campaign coop is restricted to local coop. The internet multiplayer works very well, with no lags at all, but doesnt allow campaign mode.\n\n- The game locks you between Easy, Normal and Hard difficulties until you reach the last "world". Meaning that in order to unlock everything in the game, you are then forced to replay the entire campaign in a new master difficulty that is enabled in that world.\n\n8/10","June 24, 2014","true","28.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

During the 2012 holiday sale I bought the Sonic bundle (before this game was added to it) but I figured this would be no great loss, because after all it's just another Mario Kart clone right? Perhaps and also perhaps not. Sonic has a lot more going on than any other kart game I've played, and doesn't have the same obvious rubber banding that is present on the more recent versions of Mario Kart, which leaves you feeling more in control of what is actually happening on screen rather than having Nintendo pushing you along with magic bullets and saying "That's it just a little further, the rest of them aren't that far in front of you" before walloping the person in first place for making the other kids look bad. The Sonic karts handle nicely, the ability to perform stunts has been added to get speed boosts, tracks attempt to cause sensory overload in the most excruciatingly pleasing way possible, and your kart frequently transforms into a boat or plane depending on how the track has been destroyed since your last lap or whatever obstacle is coming up. This is a great game to play with friends, but it's equally as good to play by yourself given all the challenges and unlocks that are available. Unlocks based on game progression are absolutely how this sort of game should be done, so I was somewhat disappointed to find that Sega had released a robotic Sonic DLC - but assuming this is just a skin I suppose you can't blame them for trying to wring every last cent out of us. Mind you, this game was a gift so I'm in no position to have a whinge about that. Had I not been given this game, I wouldn't have realised just how good it is, and how it is well worth buying.","July 30, 2013","true","28.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The problem is if someone is going fast more than you are going fast then you are in fact not going fast so only one person can actually go fast.

Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog in the late 90's made their own spinoff Sonic Racing games, but the first one's were Sonic R, and Sonic Drift, these two games were considered by many to be terrible. then during the time of the PS2, Sega released a new franchise called "Sega Superstars," this game was really mediocre because it was one of the few games on the system to use the Playstation Eye, but it registered poorly, so the game was not good. Sega decided to step back into racing in 2006, with Sonic Riders, released for Gamecube, Xbox, PS2, and PC, this game was much better than Sonic R and Drift, it was different because unlike most racing games, this racing game used hoverboards, and a sequel was released in 2008.\n\n2 years after Sonic Riders Zero Gravity, Sega decided to revive Sega Superstars with a tennis game before 2010, and in 2010, we got Sonic and Sega All Stars Racing. This racing game released for Xbox 360, PS3, Wii, DS, and PC, recevied really positive reviews. So much that it could start comparing to Mario Kart.\n\n2 short years after Sonic and Sega All Stars Racing, we got the game were talking about today... Sonic and All Stars Racing Transformed. Released for Xbox 360, PS3, Wii U, PC, 3DS, PSVita, and mobile devices. So, is this a good racing game? Yes. The graphics on PC are stunning, especially in Max Settings, running 60fps, the colors are bright and colorful, and the small blur affects make the game a bit more intense. The gameplay plays like its original, Steer, Accelerate, Drift to charge up a mini turbo, and do tricks in mid air, which is replaced by flicking the right control stick in a specific direction, (I'm assuming you have a controller) the trick system is a lot simpler and quicker than the original.\n\nThe main gimic of this game is the ability to transform your kart into a boat, or plane, in boat form, you can ride the waves and  perform tricks by jumping off waves, specifically big ones, and even ride on hot lava, literally. In plane form, you can fly around in the air, while doing barrel rolls to dodge mid air obstacles, such as giant dinosaurs, construction areas, magic bookshelves, and flying aircrafts.\n\nThe game has a wide variety of modes, race, grand prix, time attack, world tour, battle mode, and even online, and the game has 20 race tracks and a large selection of Sega characters, and I mean it. You can even level up your favorite character and unlock mods for your character to customize their stats! So you can use your favorite character and still have good stats! Also, there are a handfull of collectable stickers and badges to put on your ID card.\n\nThe soundtrack in this game is really good, with many remixes, but voice clips are resused from past Sega games. But it is still nice to listen to to say the least.\n\nIf I had to give a final verdict on the game, I would say if Sega's goal was to make a racing game that uses features from many other Sega franchises, and bundle it all into one epic racing game, than they accomplished that very well, the gameplay is good, the soundtrack is epic, the online is fun, the selection of characters is great, and the graphics are beautiful to look at on the PC, but not so much on the Console versions of the game. This is a fantastic racing game that will keep you playing for hours, and has really fun online, I can safely say that this is one of the best racing games out there. I score this game with a 9/10. $20 is a good price, but in the steam sales, $5 is ridiculous, you better buy this in the sales! I reccomend this to any racing fan out there!\n","May 11","true","26.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

At least, I know no person who has had no fun with Mario Kart. I had fun, my lil sis had fun, my parents had fun, my grandparents had fun, all my friends had fun. Mario Kart is FUN. And so is... ahem: "Sonic and Sega All Star Racing TRANSFORMED", what's in the name ;)\n\nWhy the comparisson? Well just look at it, it's a race game featuring game characters from other games (sega and valve) you may or may not know and you have powerups and weapons to pick up and use. Is it a bad thing? Not according to me, this is a good game.\n\nIt's gameplay gimmick is the Transformed part. Most courses are part driven in a car, part in a boat and part flown in an aircraft! This changes the dynamics quite a bit as you have to manouvre in 3d when you fly, boats respond differently, etc. It works really well and the tracks are well designed.\n\nIt's just a fun arcade racing game with powerups, boosts, skill and cartoony weapons, nothing more to it. It's fun singleplayer, it's fun but tough online, and even more fun when playing with family and friends in split-screen.\n\nThe characters you can race with may not be known to some players nowadays. I played both Nintendo SNES and Sega Genesis back in the days. I liked mario, off course, but I like Sonic too. I never was part of any camp. Now Sega has come to my beloved PC and I was happy to see that speeding blue hedgehog and his friends again, even though they haven't had a good game since Sonic-CD besides these racing games. The first character I chose was the "green dwarf" I remembered from the game called "Golden Axe", I also know "that taxi driver" from Crazy Taxi and the "monkey" from Monkeyball. But Sega is more of a PC-publisher nowadays and so we get: A Samurai representing Shogun: Total War, a Roman representing Rome: Total War, a Russian general representing Company of Heroes, "the football manager" and 3 of the Team Fortress characters!!! It's an acceptable roster for Steam I would say, it has more potential though. I would love to see an even more PC-specific roster, let Sega think outside their own box even more, they could sell this game even better if they put a Dhovakin as a character in it or Shephard, or Gordon Freeman, or a Kerbal, but it's a fun and diverse roster.\n\nThe game looks beautifull, nice and sharp with vibrant colors. The sound is also what you would expect, it suits the game. And compliments about the music ingame! Funny thing about the menu's though, first of all everytime you boot the game the voice-over pronounces the entire title of the game and he also narrates the choices you make XD\n\nI really recommend this game if you hang out with friends to play videogames. It's more fun when you play together, online multiplayer is fun, the singleplayer is also fun, but on-sofa multiplayer is so much more fun! You do need controllers, something we pc-gamers do not tend to have and if we do, we only tend to have one... these are all obstacles, I know. But if you do physically hang out to play games, this game is highly recommended by me. If you know how to fiddle a little tiny bit and want to spend some time doing it, you can make a working controller out of any android phone. It's a solution, the other solution is to buy more controllers.\n\n\nI would score it 7/10 if you are primarily going to play singleplayer or online, 9/10 if you are going to be playing with family and friends which I highly recommend!","September 24, 2014","true","7.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kouplek/recommended/212480/","kouplek","CoupleK","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kouplek/","246 products in account","Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed excels in almost every aspect of the kart racing genre. The drifting feels natural, the tracks are varied, the weapons are interesting and fair, and the boosting mechanics are great fun to exploit. Where it suffers somewhat is in the character selection - Sonic and company are great, but the rest of the roster is padded with significantly less recognizable entries. Overall a well polished kart racer.\n\nThe games’ mechanics are well thought-out. Everything works well together:\n* Boosts can be gained from drifting, boost pads, and doing tricks while in mid air. You are rewarded for chaining different types of boosts together, which makes you always on the lookout for trick/drift opportunities.\n* Weapons are powerful, but they always leave the targeted player with some recourse to deal with them. All automatically tracking weapons can be boosted away from if timed correctly, and nearly all other weapons can be dodged in some way.\n* Tracks are dynamic and sometimes will change from lap to lap. Tracks generally will have different paths to choose from, each offering either extra boosts, extra trick jumps/drifts, or extra weapon pickups.\n\nKart racing games are often a party game, and this is where Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed might fall short for you. The fact is most people are familiar with Mario Kart. Plumbers, princesses and shells are recognizable to the casual gamer and that familiarity can make a game much easier to get in to. Sonic Racing's monkeys, fireworks and pufferfish aren't as familiar to people, and until a player gets a feel for how the world and the weapons work the well-crafted mechanics will be lost on them.\n\nStill, the bottom line is that it feels good to drive your boat/plane/car around; flipping, drifting, boosting and shooting your way to victory.

Make no mistake, this game is HARD!! You can choose your difficulty for every race, but you need stars to unlock things. I have had no problems unlocking things, but I start out on medium and then try for hard (I think I cleared about 2/3 on hard and left the rest on medium so far). If you're more of an easy-maybe-trying-for-medium kind of player, you may end up stuck or frustrated that you can't unlock additional characters.\n\nIf you do decide to take the plunge, be sure to visit the steam forum page for this game and take a look at the top pinned topic for some awesome tips. You really need to learn how to boost-start and drift to start getting anywhere in the game for instance.\n\nThe weapons are imaginative and they're not TOO disruptive (there are no "I win" weapons), but they're definitely not useless as I saw one reviewer state. The thing is you need to learn to use them, as everything in this game. The game is really designed to be a challenge in every way.\n\nThere are definitely things to complain about, drifting feels a bit counterintuitive and I have to repress some automatic behaviours from more realistic games, flying is hard to get used to as well and although the weapons are not too bad you can still be 1st for 2 rounds only to then be hit by 5 weapons in a row and end dead last (although I guess this is sort of inherent to the kart racer genre), just to name a few... but what it comes down to is that I keep coming back, it's very addictive.\n\nUnfortunately one big drawback is one that Sega can't help much, and that's that the online multiplayer community just isn't very big (at least not anymore now). I've only tried a few times* but once I got to play a couple rounds before a couple players left and there was just me and 2 seasoned pros that I stood absolutely no chance against, the other time there was no ongoing game at all and after waiting around to see if anyone would join me for 10 minutes or so only one person had and they left again. A big plus though is that there is local multiplayer, so if you have the gamepads or someone doesn't mind using the keyboard you can have a sonic racing party in your livingroom. You may have to dial back your own built up skills though if they havent played before or they wont enjoy your company for long ;-) (since the game really does require some practice).\n\n* I feel I should mention, I just tried looking for a matchmaking game again tonight and actually ended up in a nearly full game with people near to my rating, so it might just be a matter of playing at the right times.","July 26, 2014","true","17.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I have always liked racing games in general and the Mario Kart series. I went into this game not expecting much... boy was I wrong.\n\nBeing honest, at first, I couldn't see how this game was good despite hearing that it was. The drifting felt strange as a Mario Kart player. The speed boosts obtained didn't seem very significant. I couldn't beat the 2nd hardest difficulty for my first session or so in the game... and this was early on in the "world tour" mode.\n\nThen, I tried time attack for the first time. I was initially disappointed by how you were only able to do one of the three laps in a normal race; I wanted to run the full 3 laps. However, in the end, I've come to accept it as okay.\n\nAnyway, I saw one of the top ghosts going unbelievably fast (to this very moment, I feel mostly certain about it being a cheat of sorts). So I tried getting better. After easily beating the "medium" ghost, I saw the hard ghost as my goal. After some struggling, I beat that, and... an expert ghost comes out. While not nearly as fast as the top lap times, I could not keep up.\n\nThe game had more things for me to learn than I thought. On top of track layout, there are things like: Switching drift direction mid-chain. Air tricks. Transform boosts. Utilizing the small hops in the terrain/water as a car/boat for an extra trick, while drifting. Risk boosts in a plane. Boost levels beyond the stated 3 from drifting. Using a boost/drift boost to evade the remote control item. Holding drifts or not drifting on certain parts of tracks for more speed than if I let go of a boost. Being able to drift while not holding the accelerator to make tighter turns. Those are the things I learned in my 28 hours according to steam, 20 hours in game time "journey". In that order as well.\n\nAs a fan of racing and going fast, all this was a grand learning experience. The tracks are very good overall; I loved how each lap could (and usually are) a different experience. It's a shame they even brought back 4 old tracks (20 total) from the previous iteration of this game where there's only a car section. Those are by far my least favorite tracks, since they feel so bland and boring.\n\nIt's also a shame there are only 20 tracks too (1 more if you count DLC I believe). (No I don't count mirror versions). The 16 tracks that nearly all change each lap are amazing to go through the first time. Then, after learning all their intricate details, maximizing your speed in each is great fun. They are all beautiful and fairly colorful. I want more; double that. Sumo entertainment (makers of this game) can make great tracks.\n\nThat doesn't even touch on the actual game experience as a whole.\n\nWorld Tour, the "main" mode features a variety of race types to help get you to understand the game's mechanics. From regular races with items, boost-only races, shooting at a tank, and dumbed down time attack ghosts, there's a lot to go through. You don't even unlock the ability to do the hardest difficulty until you complete most of the mode in the first place. This is a mostly good thing to me at least. I definitely would not have had any chance of winning had I not learned from struggling with the 2nd hardest difficulty.\n\nYou unlock nearly all characters from World Tour mode as well. For a grand total of 23 (no DLC), each feels similar enough as a whole, but each one really does have slightly different characteristics... even if 2 characters stats are the same. As you use each character, they can "level up" to obtain mods, which alter their stats a bit. The best ones, especially when you play the game seriously, are locked behind obtaining the max level and/or progressing in World Tour though. You likely won't set great time attack records without them. This is a mostly good thing, but I feel the unlocks for the best mods should not always have been last.\n\nThen there's your standard grand prix mode. Since I completed the vast majority of world tour on the hardest difficulty before touching grand prix, grand prix wasn't so bad. However, the computers definitely cheat. You cannot outrun them no matter how fast you are versus the world. They also will throw items at you at bad times in most cases. A lot of the time, you will have to shoot the cpu ahead of you just before crossing the finish line to obtain first place. Mercifully, the AI does seem to have leeway on which one is "fast" for the race, so you can still take 1st overall if you just race well.\n\nSpeaking of items, they're very standard and a lot less powerful than in other games of this type (...well, Mario Kart series). They work in a close/relatively close race, but if one gets far enough ahead, hardly any items will be able to stop  a player from racing as well as they can. Great in single player (not that you'll ever be able to utilize that since they cheat), but multiplayer kind of suffers from it.\n\nMultiplayer has some players, but not much. It's not the most fleshed out option. It's also an older game now, so that's expected. It's kind of a slow process overall, but the races run more smoothly than expected even if someone else has a seemingly worse connection. Sadly, the largest race I've been in only consisted of about 6 players. I got into a lobby that was full, only to have the game crash before the race started. While it was fun, it doesn't have much longevity. Now that I am proficient at all tracks, skill/track knowledge makes a rather large difference in how well you do online. As mentioned previously, only a couple items, if that, can affect a far-ahead front runner. With a large enough lead, the leader will most likely keep extending it if racers behind don't have the skill to keep/catch up.\n\nThe only truly negative aspect of this game, if that, would be some silly achievements. Having 4 people play locally is out of the question, given the lack of controllers/keyboards/usb ports. Investing more money just for that would be silly. Then there's luck based things, like hitting from a long distance. I wish to 100% achievement the game (as I've 101% completed the game), but they really add nothing to the experience.\n\nOverall, for how cheap I personally got this game, it's a great purchase with enough surface allure and depth to keep you playing, should you choose to get into it. I would definitely have paid a bit more for it (I'm a cheap gamer nowadays). It's a somewhat old game now, but it's definitely worth your time to check out if you're a fan of racing.","December 16, 2014","true","49.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game is a huge love letter to Sega and its various franchises, with characters and stages from games like Jet Set Radio, Space Channel 5, Skies of Arcadia, and many more. Even if you don't have any love for Sega, though, it's still worth picking this game up. The tracks are all huge and well-designed, with each lap changing the course in some way. The transformation gimmick works out really well and makes the tracks that much more interesting. It's also incredibly well balanced. All of the racers feel unique enough for you to find somebody you like, and none of the items are overly dickish. They're all dodgeable, and the game rewards you for dealing with them effectively. The only close equivalent to the blue shell is 100% dodgeable, and in fact is easy to dodge. The game is just overall an incredibly fun and enjoyable experience, and it's super well optimized for PC.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tgump/recommended/212480/","Tgump","+Gump","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tgump/","775 products in account","Fun (but often frustrating) racing game. There's your traditional racing mode (more on that below), and the standard arena modes you'd find in most modern racing games, plus capture the flag.\n\nThe story mode, involving unlocking tracks via gated progression based off of how well you perform in previous races, can be enormously frustrating at times. There are four difficulty settings for each track: Easy, Medium, Hard, and Expert (which only unlocks after you've beaten the tracks on an easier difficulty first) and each present their own spin on AI. Easy is pretty much a cakewalk, and anyone familiar with the controls should be able to fly through each race. The others, though, are a different story.\n\nThe AI cheats in this game. A LOT. They are completely shameless about it. Every race, you start dead last in 10th place far behind everyone else, and half of the AI get boost starts on top of that. If you manage to overcome that massive handicap, you'll also have to deal with conspiring AI (they will always opt to fire their skills at you instead of other AI if possible), immediate & flawless reaction times, and to top it all off, one bot each race will basically be Wonder Woman. They're substantially harder, faster, better, stronger than all the other bots.\n\nBeating this game on Hard boils down to first managing to fly past the other 8 bots without any of them ever getting a good ability hit on you (if you do, you might as well restart the race) and then duking it out with the Alpha bot of the pack and hope that you get All Star before he/she does.\n\nI haven't even tried to get past the first race of the first zone on Expert -- the bots will utilize every map exploit, corner trick, and power-up to completely ♥♥♥♥ you over. I'm sticking to my theory that this is a difficulty reserved for the sole purpose of derisively taunting your racing skills.\n\nOverall impressions: It might be worth a pickup at $20 if you enjoy racing games. At $5, it's probably worth getting just for the menagerie of characters. Just be prepared for your robot overlords.","August 5, 2014","true","24.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SkeletonWarriors/recommended/212480/","SkeletonWarriors","Vunjak","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SkeletonWarriors/","262 products in account","It's probably one of the better arcade racers I've played in recent years. I should get to playing it more but I have to be in the right kind of mood to want this kind of game. The game itself is easy to pick up and play but challenging to master. I'd recommend this over the various Mario Kart racers thanks to the competitive aspect that lies somewhat hidden beneath the surface. Not all of the tracks are perfect but most of them are easy on the eyes and varied in a way that one track can have multiple "environments" thanks to the different vehicle modes of going from car to airplane to boat. This is my favorite game released from SEGA since Sonic Generations.\n\nThe learning curve is very good going from lower difficulties up to harder ones and earning those medals prolongs replay ability if you're into that sort of collecting. 10 player online racing also insures that when you're tired of predictability in the racing AI you'll have slightly more unpredictable opponents to go up against. I can't speak from personal experience on that aspect because I've played the game so little and have no confidence in doing well against live opponents. It's like what my old pal Han said, "Look, good against remotes is one thing. Good against the living? That's something else." However, I hear numerous reports that the online does work well with only minor latency issues and almost no disconnects. I would like to note that it may be harder to find as many opponents to race on the PC version with the exception of occasional sales that pop up like right now for example.\n\nI've heard some say it was ported badly or botched somehow. I never once experienced any issues with this game regarding graphical or control issues though I do use a Sixaxis controller and cannot speak for racing with mouse + keyboard. From my experience you're just asking for trouble when you play racing or fighting games without a gamepad but that's my opinion. It's one of the most stable games I've played in regards to alt+tabbing in and out of with no issues though results may vary depending on your OS.\n\nWARNING: The following huge paragraph is basically me attempting to explain and justify why I prefer video game music that sounds "video game in nature". Feel free to skip to the paragraph below it if you don't want to read a bunch of my most likely incoherent thoughts.\n\nI have to be honest here. I'm not easily impressed by music in most modern games. Usually we end up with some orchestral pieces or stuff that just sounds very unfitting to a video game soundtrack if that make sense. There was a time when you heard video game music and it was instantly recognizable as such mostly because of limitations of the sound chip included in a console/pc engine. For instance, if you never played Mario Galaxy and then listened to most of the OST you would probably assume it was just a piece made by some contemporary orchestra. So I think what SEGA does right in their Sonic games is they include music that sounds very true to what a video game soundtrack used to sound like, except it has been updated with present day technology using instruments and other more advanced techniques and sounds they couldn't have use in the past due to the limitations I mentioned before. I want to re-implore you all that I am in no way suggesting that video game music should never be orchestral or push the limit on what you can use in a video game, I only suggest what I prefer. Maybe I'm biased in that I have nostalgia for those old distinct sounds and I should just get over it and get into the orchestral stuff so I can further my taste. All I know is, some music I hear in video games travels into my auditory system and my brain says to me "Yes I like this please continue." I'm not here to say video game music should be a certain way, I know that any music in a video game is automatically "video game music" and therefore I can't deny any music used in any video game, even something like CRAZY BUS, is not video game music. All I'm saying is that there is a distinct difference in how video game music is being treated across various mediums and I prefer the route that Sega has taken when compared to say Nintendo and the developers who publish games for Xbox and Playstation. Also, I do want to say that orchestral music does have a place in video games. Let's take Shadow of the Colossus for example on the PS2. This game was definitely something  you played rather than watched yet it's movie-like quality lead to the orchestral score being one of the most fitting elements included. You had these tremendous sounds with drums, violins going to town, flutes and other wind organs just accentuating the excitement. Or at quieter less exciting times they were played slowly and solemnly to convey that feeling of loneliness or majesty of these colossi and the forbidden land that cradled them. So again, it has its place but should this music be everywhere? My opinion is that no it should not. The music should compliment what is happening and meld in some way that it fits appropriately to the style and events taking place.\n\nSo now that we got that out of the way I want to say that Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed has one of the better soundtracks I've heard as of late. It reminds me of that electronic sound present in many older games and very much suits the fast pace racing game play. A lot of it is remixes but with enough twists that I feel they are their own creation with sampling rather than just simple tweaks and added effects. So I can safely say the music is more than solid, I really like it. If you like the music in older sonic games I am confident you will like it as well.\n\nLooking back at how much I've written thus far I think it's time to stop because no one will want to finish my "little" reccomendation. I think this game is worth a try for just about anyone with the slightest interest in it. I do have to admit the boundaries aren't perfect where often times I think that I can get away with just barely missing the edge of some obstacle or guard rail, and then suddenly I hit a tiny piece of invisible obstacle that was jutting out  just barely. However, this isn't a racing sim so such things are to be expected but still hurt my enjoyment if only slightly. I'd say it's worth the $5 it's on sale for right now but I paid $15 for it awhile ago and I'm still pleased with what I got for my money.","December 8, 2013","true","27.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/212480/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed (SART) is a sequel to Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing (SSAR), an arcade kart racing game that includes many characters and tracks from Sega titles, this one made by Sumo and released on PC in 2013. So yep, racing around competively, drifting and picking up random weapons to use on opponents.\nIt also got Xbox 360, PS3, WiiU, PSVita and 3DS versions as far as I am aware. And PC version actually got a bunch of exclusive characters (and exclusive DLC), like General Winter. Other versions weren't strangers to cameos from non-Sega franchises either. Though the only ones you miss are Avatar-using racers from Xbox 360 and WiiU. So be happy, you probably got the best version.\nIt also had a "bonus edition" version for consoles which included Metal Sonic, OutRun stage and bonus stickers. It then became the first DLC.\n\nMultiplayer seems to be slightly alive. It's hard to say without server browser, it's only matchmaking. At least at my European evening I got into racing match with 6 more players, so it must be quite good, even though I didn't get into any others. Just once. Maybe just a small bunch of people playing. Maybe none in other modes other than race.\nEh, actually that sounds pretty bad. But hey, some say that Matchmaking is tied to region that you set in your Steam download. Worst idea ever.\nI think that you can play in local multiplayer, where you can actually beat some single-player missions with friend. I heard. Didn't check yet.\n\nOriginal Racing was a simple kart game for it's time, most notably for being on PC and for having Sega fan-service. And fun. It was easy to learn and easy to master.\nTransformed on other hands was THE thing at the time of release. The transforming aspect gave a new twist for the genre and the boost mechanic was much more complex. It was was objectively outdoing Mario Kart at the time of release. Even though I didn't play Kart. Must be Mario Andretti Racing spin-off game. Anyway, it's now hard to learn and harder to master too, delighting more hardcore gaming and fans of Sega racing games.\nAnd well, because of transformation, cars that characters drive were standarized, no more separation into bikes, cars and flying cars.\n\nTransforming now divides racing into three sections: Air, Land and Water. It controls almost same on Land, but now boost mechanics were improved. You now can quickly change directions while drifting and keep building up the boost, even though the current progress to the next boost level will be reset. And this time it will be unwise to try to build boost on a straight road. Not only that, but boosts can be combined with each other. Riding over boosting arrows, using boost powerup and releasing drift boost in same time as they are active will give you a huge boost points. You can also do rolling/flipping while in air to get boost when you land.\nAnd well, that's why you need a gamepad.\n\nSea sections are similar, though they are a bit more slippery. Actually, it has water physics, so if you are good, you may even figure out on which wave/ripple you should roll to get boost.\n\nAir section takes you on the fast plane, which has a bit less responsible controls and will take a while to learn. Rolling here will slow you down, BUT you can get a risk boost this way if you rolled away from collision with some objects, like columns or wall. Though, it doesn't work on every object, so you will have to learn.\n\nWeapons were changed as well to make it feel more fair. They look weird, yet more inspired. If it's something auto-aiming then you can dodge it by boosting in the right moment. It has unique anti-first-place weapon that doesn't feel cheap. It creates a swarm of bees Badnicks in front of a racers for a while between which you have to dodge. But then, good players who are way ahead of main mass will remain unchallenged if they know how to dodge that, while main mass it busy punching each other, so to say.\n\nBut we all know what is the most important question that we must ask. Does this jolly Sega racing all-star game have Segata Sanshiro?\nNo, it doesn't.\nBUT it has Joe Mushashi who is about as cool!\nAND it has Shinobi stage. AND yesssssss, it comes with Shinobi 3 music track, which is the best character out of all that racing karts ever had!\nI am so sorry Segata Sanshiro, but as much as I love Saturn, Idaten is still my favourite waifu.\n\nAnd yes, Sega fan-service is great in this one. Less focused on Sonic franchise, as lovely as that one is, and with more of classic Sega. And cameos. Like characters from RTS games on PC that Sega is currently publishing. Hooray and oora for General Winter and his drifting tank. And even not-related characters made cameo, like Ralph. Or Danica Patrick, which didn't seem out of place because I was thinking that it must be reference to either Monaco GP or Virtua Racing. But nope, NASCAR.\nAnd I mean, you know that this is some seriously awesome AAA Racing game when even Valve would come along and beg for their Team Fortress character to be in Sonic Racing Transformed game instead of another way around, so their Team Fortress 2 game will get some recognition from Sega players. Even though most players feel weird over different voice actors.\n\nAnyway, character selection is great and mighty. They are quite balanced around in stats, not being different otherwise, though community still divides them into different tier. And characters with low-speed will struggle on stages with more straight design. But if you like character but not stats, then you can just keep playing and then unlock mods as you level up, which usually take one point from one stat and give to another one. Also, unique All-Star powers for each character became simpler and more mundane, mostly to balance them out and make them more fair and standartized in multiplayer, I guess.  Since they weren't usable in multiplayer in original. Still, less fun. But hey, look, there is Gillius Thunderhead right behind you!\n\nJust a bit less than half of a characters will be locked away and must be unlocked by playing World Tour, beating stages, which give different amount of stars depending on difficulty, and then getting enough to be able to get new characters. It does give you reason to play the nice single-player campaign of sorts, which keeps giving different missions and tracks. Instead of shopping based on coins you get in each race like in original. It also means that most players will never get to play as Eggman or Gillius Thunderhead, as to get those, you must play at harder difficulty. And AI is already hard challenging nasties. But fun.\n\nStages are awesome and fan-servicy as well. Less Sonic too. More of random awesome. I mean, it has freaking Burning Rangers stage! And After Burner! And... You get it. Not only that, but some tracks also change layouts for each lap, like a ground gets destroyed and from now on you are flying in this part.\n\nBut really, this is some AAA Kart Racing game on Steam, can't go wrong with it. It will keep you busy for a while. And even happy, because Sega magic!","September 20, 2015","true","14.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I should get to playing it more but I have to be in the right kind of mood to want this kind of game. The game itself is easy to pick up and play but challenging to master. I'd recommend this over the various Mario Kart racers thanks to the competitive aspect that lies somewhat hidden beneath the surface. Not all of the tracks are perfect but most of them are easy on the eyes and varied in a way that one track can have multiple "environments" thanks to the different vehicle modes of going from car to airplane to boat. This is my favorite game released from SEGA since Sonic Generations.\n\nThe learning curve is very good going from lower difficulties up to harder ones and earning those medals prolongs replay ability if you're into that sort of collecting. 10 player online racing also insures that when you're tired of predictability in the racing AI you'll have slightly more unpredictable opponents to go up against. I can't speak from personal experience on that aspect because I've played the game so little and have no confidence in doing well against live opponents. It's like what my old pal Han said, "Look, good against remotes is one thing. Good against the living? That's something else." However, I hear numerous reports that the online does work well with only minor latency issues and almost no disconnects. I would like to note that it may be harder to find as many opponents to race on the PC version with the exception of occasional sales that pop up like right now for example.\n\nI've heard some say it was ported badly or botched somehow. I never once experienced any issues with this game regarding graphical or control issues though I do use a Sixaxis controller and cannot speak for racing with mouse + keyboard. From my experience you're just asking for trouble when you play racing or fighting games without a gamepad but that's my opinion. It's one of the most stable games I've played in regards to alt+tabbing in and out of with no issues though results may vary depending on your OS.\n\nWARNING: The following huge paragraph is basically me attempting to explain and justify why I prefer video game music that sounds "video game in nature". Feel free to skip to the paragraph below it if you don't want to read a bunch of my most likely incoherent thoughts.\n\nI have to be honest here. I'm not easily impressed by music in most modern games. Usually we end up with some orchestral pieces or stuff that just sounds very unfitting to a video game soundtrack if that make sense. There was a time when you heard video game music and it was instantly recognizable as such mostly because of limitations of the sound chip included in a console/pc engine. For instance, if you never played Mario Galaxy and then listened to most of the OST you would probably assume it was just a piece made by some contemporary orchestra. So I think what SEGA does right in their Sonic games is they include music that sounds very true to what a video game soundtrack used to sound like, except it has been updated with present day technology using instruments and other more advanced techniques and sounds they couldn't have use in the past due to the limitations I mentioned before. I want to re-implore you all that I am in no way suggesting that video game music should never be orchestral or push the limit on what you can use in a video game, I only suggest what I prefer. Maybe I'm biased in that I have nostalgia for those old distinct sounds and I should just get over it and get into the orchestral stuff so I can further my taste. All I know is, some music I hear in video games travels into my auditory system and my brain says to me "Yes I like this please continue." I'm not here to say video game music should be a certain way, I know that any music in a video game is automatically "video game music" and therefore I can't deny any music used in any video game, even something like CRAZY BUS, is not video game music. All I'm saying is that there is a distinct difference in how video game music is being treated across various mediums and I prefer the route that Sega has taken when compared to say Nintendo and the developers who publish games for Xbox and Playstation. Also, I do want to say that orchestral music does have a place in video games. Let's take Shadow of the Colossus for example on the PS2. This game was definitely something  you played rather than watched yet it's movie-like quality lead to the orchestral score being one of the most fitting elements included. You had these tremendous sounds with drums, violins going to town, flutes and other wind organs just accentuating the excitement. Or at quieter less exciting times they were played slowly and solemnly to convey that feeling of loneliness or majesty of these colossi and the forbidden land that cradled them. So again, it has its place but should this music be everywhere? My opinion is that no it should not. The music should compliment what is happening and meld in some way that it fits appropriately to the style and events taking place.\n\nSo now that we got that out of the way I want to say that Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed has one of the better soundtracks I've heard as of late. It reminds me of that electronic sound present in many older games and very much suits the fast pace racing game play. A lot of it is remixes but with enough twists that I feel they are their own creation with sampling rather than just simple tweaks and added effects. So I can safely say the music is more than solid, I really like it. If you like the music in older sonic games I am confident you will like it as well.\n\nLooking back at how much I've written thus far I think it's time to stop because no one will want to finish my "little" reccomendation. I think this game is worth a try for just about anyone with the slightest interest in it. I do have to admit the boundaries aren't perfect where often times I think that I can get away with just barely missing the edge of some obstacle or guard rail, and then suddenly I hit a tiny piece of invisible obstacle that was jutting out  just barely. However, this isn't a racing sim so such things are to be expected but still hurt my enjoyment if only slightly. I'd say it's worth the $5 it's on sale for right now but I paid $15 for it awhile ago and I'm still pleased with what I got for my money.","December 8, 2013","true","27.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

While many may think "Oh it's just a Mario Kart rip-off", I am here to tell you that this game is so much more behind it's similarity to Mario Kart.\n\nIf you care to look closer to gameplay of this game and Mario Kart, you'd see that this game is a LOT more skill-related than it is 'shoot-your-way-to-1st-place', which (sorry, Nintendo) is what Mario Kart mainly is. In Mario Kart, if you don't get to first place very early on, you are kinda screwed, unless you happen to get a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of Red Shells. Also, the A.I. is kinda mediocre.\n\nIn this game, however, since there are 3 different types of vehicles, there are 3 different playstyles, which also means that there are 3 different opportunites to get an edge over your opponent(s). One can be horrible at driving boats while they excell at piloting airplanes, which can be their ticket to the podium or, alternatively, their ticket to the back of the line. Unfortunately, (sorry, getting off-topic here) you cannot gain a 'rivalry' with another character, which makes them try and ram you off the course or target you if you are nearby. This would make the game pretty awesome and a lot more player-influenced. In addition to this game's unique playstyle, there are also some very unique mission types, such as Pursuit, in which you have a health bar and you must destroy a tank with missiles, which is not something you'd expect from SEGA. Just fullof suprises, now, aren't you?\n\nOverall, I give this game an 8.7/10, because there are some glitches present that can cause you to come in last (such as hitting a ramp in boat mode and falling out of the track. You do respawn, however, so it is not a major thing) and because some missions are outright ridiculous in their difficulty. Other than these flaws, this game is great all around.\n\nI highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys their classic racing games with a little... twist added to them. (Also because no one has this game and I want to race my friends ;~;)","March 11, 2014","true","47.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

But, you'd've been right. Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is pretty much the best kart racer on PC, if not ever. It's very much like Mario Kart with a mix of Diddy Kong Racing in there for good measure, but it seems to be built on a staple of actual skill-based racing. Unlike some of its competing series, it is possibly to win on sheer capability alone, instead of luck (and peer misfortune). Combined with a slick sense of speed and a charmingly diverse roster of Sega "all-stars," it comes out as one of the bigger advances in kart racing since the genre's conception.","September 22, 2014","true","34.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Unfortunately, (sorry, getting off-topic here) you cannot gain a 'rivalry' with another character, which makes them try and ram you off the course or target you if you are nearby. This would make the game pretty awesome and a lot more player-influenced. In addition to this game's unique playstyle, there are also some very unique mission types, such as Pursuit, in which you have a health bar and you must destroy a tank with missiles, which is not something you'd expect from SEGA. Just fullof suprises, now, aren't you?\n\nOverall, I give this game an 8.7/10, because there are some glitches present that can cause you to come in last (such as hitting a ramp in boat mode and falling out of the track. You do respawn, however, so it is not a major thing) and because some missions are outright ridiculous in their difficulty. Other than these flaws, this game is great all around.\n\nI highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys their classic racing games with a little... twist added to them. (Also because no one has this game and I want to race my friends ;~;)","March 11, 2014","true","47.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I was worried that much like mario kart, the challenge of the game would dissapate once you have gotten quite proficient at it, but I was pleasently surprised to find that a fourth difficulty is introduced once you get far enough into the game.\nThe Transforming feature of this game I initially assumed to be a gimmick, but in actuality It forms an integral part of what makes this game great; the speedboat style parts have realistic water physics (not to mention that the water looks great too), the flight sections of tracks are well designed so that you dont get lost and the flight physics do not take days to figure out (in fact I picked them up almost instantly [after a little oh the vertical is reversed moment]) unlike some games such as battlefield.\n\nThe Variety of different game types is pleasant; race, battle race, battle arena, etc. however the time trial style mini games in the world tour such as drift challange and traffic attack (which are good fun) cannot be played on all of the tracks.\nFour of the 21 tracks in the game are direct ports from the previous game, they are fairly good tracks so I can overlook this, one of these is a paid DLC that comes with metal sonic. Honestly I feel this DLC should have been free, but compared to the other DLCs which are literally just extra characters it makes some sense. So completionists beware, if you really want to get every unlock in the game you will need to spend just under $5.00 extra to get those karts.\n\nThe Graphics in this game; while its not a super duper high-end eye-gasm inducing system-melting dx11 masterpiece, the visuals are very pleasing, it is seamless and themed well, at times you may see a couple of low-res textures or low-polycount models in the backround, reminding you that this is a console port but nothing that takes away from the playing experience.\n\nOh, Yeah thats right, this is a console port! and before you turn tail and run sceaming to your copy of Crisis 3 and proceeding to clutch it while shivering in the corner; It is a wonderfully optimised port, solid 60fps and absolutley no stuttering, input lag or any other issues often asscosiated with console ports (cough.. cough... Trials Fusion).\nSEGA have been doing a lot of great ports of late, good job you show 'em how its done!\n\nI did own the previous game; Sonic & Sega All Stars Racing on Wii briefly, it was laggy, difficult to control and not at all fun to play, but I suppose thats just down to motion control and >30fps that you get with a wii, but Mario Kart Wii played much better than that, so Idk. The point i'm trying to make is that before purchasing All-Stars Transformed I was highly skeptical of it being any good, and well I guess I couldn't have been more wrong.\n\n(Nearly done don't worry, It's a miracle you are still reading now to be fair).\n\nIf you enjoy Fast Paced Kart Action or just want something more exciting than you average Mario Kart game, I would definately Recommend you buy this game, It is worth the full price on store but if you dont want to shell out, then wait for it to go on sale, I nabbed it for Half Price.\n\nNow a Couple of Warnings:\n- Use a 360 controller, the game is perfectly playable on the keyboard but if you dont have n-key rollover you are gonna run into a couple of problems and inevitable frustration.\n- The Config menu will not launch from steam (at least for me), you need to go to the game directory and set Launcher.exe to run in compatibility mode for XP sp-3.\n- The Multiplayer Servers are empty, or at least really quiet, the game is fine with out it, but some acheivement and stickers require you to win online races, so again completionists beware.\n\nNow buy it and race me online so I can beat you.\nI'm not joking,\n\nDid you buy it yet?\n\nWhy are you still reading this?

The drifting feels natural, the tracks are varied, the weapons are interesting and fair, and the boosting mechanics are great fun to exploit. Where it suffers somewhat is in the character selection - Sonic and company are great, but the rest of the roster is padded with significantly less recognizable entries. Overall a well polished kart racer.\n\nThe games’ mechanics are well thought-out. Everything works well together:\n* Boosts can be gained from drifting, boost pads, and doing tricks while in mid air. You are rewarded for chaining different types of boosts together, which makes you always on the lookout for trick/drift opportunities.\n* Weapons are powerful, but they always leave the targeted player with some recourse to deal with them. All automatically tracking weapons can be boosted away from if timed correctly, and nearly all other weapons can be dodged in some way.\n* Tracks are dynamic and sometimes will change from lap to lap. Tracks generally will have different paths to choose from, each offering either extra boosts, extra trick jumps/drifts, or extra weapon pickups.\n\nKart racing games are often a party game, and this is where Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed might fall short for you. The fact is most people are familiar with Mario Kart. Plumbers, princesses and shells are recognizable to the casual gamer and that familiarity can make a game much easier to get in to. Sonic Racing's monkeys, fireworks and pufferfish aren't as familiar to people, and until a player gets a feel for how the world and the weapons work the well-crafted mechanics will be lost on them.\n\nStill, the bottom line is that it feels good to drive your boat/plane/car around; flipping, drifting, boosting and shooting your way to victory.

Yes, it's true, this game dose have some similarities, but this game is so much better than Mario Kart imo. This game is easily my favorite kart racer of all time. Why? It has a fantastic cast of Sega characters from all of their best games, including characters from Sonic (obviously), Jet Set Radio, Crazy Taxi, Super Monkey Ball, Nights, and many more. Hell, they even have characters from Total War!  All these fantastic, nostalgic characters are also joind by a few 3rd party characters that are just as cool (Not counting Danica Patrick, because she is the most pointless character in the game), including Wreck-It Ralf and the Pyro, Heavy, and Spy from TF2 (All one character). What makes it even better is the actual gameplay. This game uses a fantastic mixture of kart racing, boat driving, and plane flying which you can transition between without a problem. The gameplay is smooth and controls exactly how you would expect a kart racer to. This games visuals are also stunning. Each track is fantasticly made, with beautiful enviornments. Also, did i mention the music is amazing? Each track has a unique song, which corresponds with whatever game the track is based off of. I've litterally lost races because i just stop to jam out to the edit versions of my favorite songs from Jet Set Radio. This is one of the best games of 2013 and simply one of the best kart racers of all time. JUST BUY IT ALREADY!!

I grew up playing the old Kart games especially on n64 so I was hoping this was a similar experience. Heard bad things about the original but this transformed version feels very complete. A strong Career mode with loads of unlockable characters. tracks and secrets. A very very high skill ceiling; the hard and expert difficulties are incredibly challenging and demand you master all the little tips and tricks you will discover while playing. The online community will eat you alive if you drop into matchmaking on first play. The game gives you incentive to unlock mods for your characters car as the more you use a certain racer the more mods you can use for that character. Racing, Battle mode, 1v1 elimination races, bonus style racing events (booster mode, rings and traffic mode are a nice take on the checkpoint style racing to mix things up)\nIt has ran smooth for me at 60fps on highest settings, some really inventive tracks that nod back to mega drive/saturn/dreamcast days. (The house of the dead was my particular favourite.)\nIt's pretty cheap and got a lot of replayability if you don't chuck the pad out of the window for some dirty scamp pipping you to a podium position with a well placed firework missile.

The tracks transform and give way to water or open skies, and your vehicle will transform between car/boat/plane to adjust to the changes.\n\nI would say the positive points of this game come from the smoothness of the racing experience, and the rewarding feeling that comes from mastering a race course or passing a particular challenge. The campaign mode tests your abilities in race types varying from normal Races to Drift Challenges, Traffic Attacks to Tank Pursuits. Each racer may earn experience/levels, which lets you modify a racer to specialize in Speed, Acceleration, Handling, Boost, or a well-Balanced version of the stats they would normally use.\n\nThe only drawbacks: the difficulty curve rises sharply for each new difficulty level, and the AI-controlled racers don't mess around at all, especially on Hard/Expert difficulty; it may be a rough ride regardless of player experience, but it will still feel rewarding and thrilling to pass the toughest tests.\n\nOverall rating... 10/10, would race again.","March 20, 2014","true","149.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

So yep, racing around competively, drifting and picking up random weapons to use on opponents.\nIt also got Xbox 360, PS3, WiiU, PSVita and 3DS versions as far as I am aware. And PC version actually got a bunch of exclusive characters (and exclusive DLC), like General Winter. Other versions weren't strangers to cameos from non-Sega franchises either. Though the only ones you miss are Avatar-using racers from Xbox 360 and WiiU. So be happy, you probably got the best version.\nIt also had a "bonus edition" version for consoles which included Metal Sonic, OutRun stage and bonus stickers. It then became the first DLC.\n\nMultiplayer seems to be slightly alive. It's hard to say without server browser, it's only matchmaking. At least at my European evening I got into racing match with 6 more players, so it must be quite good, even though I didn't get into any others. Just once. Maybe just a small bunch of people playing. Maybe none in other modes other than race.\nEh, actually that sounds pretty bad. But hey, some say that Matchmaking is tied to region that you set in your Steam download. Worst idea ever.\nI think that you can play in local multiplayer, where you can actually beat some single-player missions with friend. I heard. Didn't check yet.\n\nOriginal Racing was a simple kart game for it's time, most notably for being on PC and for having Sega fan-service. And fun. It was easy to learn and easy to master.\nTransformed on other hands was THE thing at the time of release. The transforming aspect gave a new twist for the genre and the boost mechanic was much more complex. It was was objectively outdoing Mario Kart at the time of release. Even though I didn't play Kart. Must be Mario Andretti Racing spin-off game. Anyway, it's now hard to learn and harder to master too, delighting more hardcore gaming and fans of Sega racing games.\nAnd well, because of transformation, cars that characters drive were standarized, no more separation into bikes, cars and flying cars.\n\nTransforming now divides racing into three sections: Air, Land and Water. It controls almost same on Land, but now boost mechanics were improved. You now can quickly change directions while drifting and keep building up the boost, even though the current progress to the next boost level will be reset. And this time it will be unwise to try to build boost on a straight road. Not only that, but boosts can be combined with each other. Riding over boosting arrows, using boost powerup and releasing drift boost in same time as they are active will give you a huge boost points. You can also do rolling/flipping while in air to get boost when you land.\nAnd well, that's why you need a gamepad.\n\nSea sections are similar, though they are a bit more slippery. Actually, it has water physics, so if you are good, you may even figure out on which wave/ripple you should roll to get boost.\n\nAir section takes you on the fast plane, which has a bit less responsible controls and will take a while to learn. Rolling here will slow you down, BUT you can get a risk boost this way if you rolled away from collision with some objects, like columns or wall. Though, it doesn't work on every object, so you will have to learn.\n\nWeapons were changed as well to make it feel more fair. They look weird, yet more inspired. If it's something auto-aiming then you can dodge it by boosting in the right moment. It has unique anti-first-place weapon that doesn't feel cheap. It creates a swarm of bees Badnicks in front of a racers for a while between which you have to dodge. But then, good players who are way ahead of main mass will remain unchallenged if they know how to dodge that, while main mass it busy punching each other, so to say.\n\nBut we all know what is the most important question that we must ask. Does this jolly Sega racing all-star game have Segata Sanshiro?\nNo, it doesn't.\nBUT it has Joe Mushashi who is about as cool!\nAND it has Shinobi stage. AND yesssssss, it comes with Shinobi 3 music track, which is the best character out of all that racing karts ever had!\nI am so sorry Segata Sanshiro, but as much as I love Saturn, Idaten is still my favourite waifu.\n\nAnd yes, Sega fan-service is great in this one. Less focused on Sonic franchise, as lovely as that one is, and with more of classic Sega. And cameos. Like characters from RTS games on PC that Sega is currently publishing. Hooray and oora for General Winter and his drifting tank. And even not-related characters made cameo, like Ralph. Or Danica Patrick, which didn't seem out of place because I was thinking that it must be reference to either Monaco GP or Virtua Racing. But nope, NASCAR.\nAnd I mean, you know that this is some seriously awesome AAA Racing game when even Valve would come along and beg for their Team Fortress character to be in Sonic Racing Transformed game instead of another way around, so their Team Fortress 2 game will get some recognition from Sega players. Even though most players feel weird over different voice actors.\n\nAnyway, character selection is great and mighty. They are quite balanced around in stats, not being different otherwise, though community still divides them into different tier. And characters with low-speed will struggle on stages with more straight design. But if you like character but not stats, then you can just keep playing and then unlock mods as you level up, which usually take one point from one stat and give to another one. Also, unique All-Star powers for each character became simpler and more mundane, mostly to balance them out and make them more fair and standartized in multiplayer, I guess.  Since they weren't usable in multiplayer in original. Still, less fun. But hey, look, there is Gillius Thunderhead right behind you!\n\nJust a bit less than half of a characters will be locked away and must be unlocked by playing World Tour, beating stages, which give different amount of stars depending on difficulty, and then getting enough to be able to get new characters. It does give you reason to play the nice single-player campaign of sorts, which keeps giving different missions and tracks. Instead of shopping based on coins you get in each race like in original. It also means that most players will never get to play as Eggman or Gillius Thunderhead, as to get those, you must play at harder difficulty. And AI is already hard challenging nasties. But fun.\n\nStages are awesome and fan-servicy as well. Less Sonic too. More of random awesome. I mean, it has freaking Burning Rangers stage! And After Burner! And... You get it. Not only that, but some tracks also change layouts for each lap, like a ground gets destroyed and from now on you are flying in this part.\n\nBut really, this is some AAA Kart Racing game on Steam, can't go wrong with it. It will keep you busy for a while. And even happy, because Sega magic!","September 20, 2015","true","14.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The tracks transform and give way to water or open skies, and your vehicle will transform between car/boat/plane to adjust to the changes.\n\nI would say the positive points of this game come from the smoothness of the racing experience, and the rewarding feeling that comes from mastering a race course or passing a particular challenge. The campaign mode tests your abilities in race types varying from normal Races to Drift Challenges, Traffic Attacks to Tank Pursuits. Each racer may earn experience/levels, which lets you modify a racer to specialize in Speed, Acceleration, Handling, Boost, or a well-Balanced version of the stats they would normally use.\n\nThe only drawbacks: the difficulty curve rises sharply for each new difficulty level, and the AI-controlled racers don't mess around at all, especially on Hard/Expert difficulty; it may be a rough ride regardless of player experience, but it will still feel rewarding and thrilling to pass the toughest tests.\n\nOverall rating... 10/10, would race again.","March 20, 2014","true","149.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

My wife and I race each other each night (she usually kicks my butt) on the PS3 - we love playing battle race mode against each other.\n\nThe Steam PC version has even more racers. Works absolutely perfectly with my XBox 360 controller hooked up.\n\nMultiple race modes, about 20 great tracks [huge variety + additional mirrored tracks can be unlocked too]. Very fast paced, and nice long tracks. Big variety of land/sea/air areas on most of the tracks, and some laps will change path patterns so it keeps you on your toes.\n\nIt may be an older game, but it's still one of my favorites. Love the variety of race characters that span across so many games. I highly recommend Sonic Transformed All Star Racing for anyone looking for some comical fun racing, either single or multiplayer.

With that said welcome to another Friday video game review here on In The Mind Of My Mind with your friendly neighborhood gamer Zalgo_Cometh. I been waiting and wanting to get myself a copy of this game from I heard they were making a part two after all the success the first game received. We reviewed Sonic & Sega All Star Racing two years ago and now its back for round two.Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is a racing video game developed by Sumo Digital and published by Sega. Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is the sequel to Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing, the fourth installment in the Sega Superstars series, and the eighth racing game in the Sonic the Hedgehog series. Do you think the sequel lives up to its predecessor  Let's find out on today's exciting episode of Dragonball Z..........wait wrong show; I mean on today's blog review.\n\n\n\nSonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is a mascot-based racing game in which players race against each other using characters from various Sega franchises, although it features many new mechanics and improvements from the last game. The most obvious is that, at certain points in a race, vehicles can alternate between car, boat and plane modes. The car mode handles similarly to the previous game, in which players can earn boost by drifting around corners or performing tricks whilst in the air. Boat mode features true boating physics, requiring players to consider their vehicle's turbulence. They may also be affected by waves made in the water, some of which can be used to leap into the air and perform stunts. Plane mode, the fastest of the three forms, gives players the freedom to move both vertically and horizontally. Like the other modes, players can 'air-drift' around corners to earn boost and can also perform rolls to quickly adjust their position, earning boost for narrowly dodging obstacles. Players alternate between these modes by driving through blue transformation gates. Certain tracks in the game terraform as players proceed through them, offering different play-styles between each lap.\n\n\n\nWhat’s Good:\nGame-play: I must say Sega really listened to the fans and went all out to improve this series and I certainly see it as a worthy competitor to the Mario Kart franchise. With a wide variety of tweaks and subtle game-play enhancements this game certainly has quite the competitive edge to offer. When playing this game it certainly feels like a true race that is determined mostly by skill and not just sheer luck. From the changing track layout to the varying modes of transportation to the subtle handling differences in the varying modes of transport; Sega has offered up a selection of any and everything imaginable to affect a racing game of this wacky and nostalgic nature. Add into that the wide character roster of old and new faces alike and you simply cannot go wrong.\n\nReplay Value:\nWith such a wide cast of characters to explore how could you not have replay value? Add to that a variety of race modes and tracks for both single player and multi-player enjoyment and you will be begging for a break. Sega went even further and gave us a leveling system for each character and different car mods to unlock and explore for each of your favorite characters. This is what you call some serious replay value.\n\n\nWhat’s Bad:\nStory-line: WHERE IS THE STORY LINE? WHY DO I NOT KNOW HOW THESE CHARACTERS ALL GOT TO THIS DIMENSION? WHAT ARE THEY EVEN RACING FOR? Hell the most important question of them all is why Sonic is even driving a car when he is obviously the fastest participant of this whole racing game? Trolling aside it would have been nice to have a dedicated story-line to help add value to the game and develop more interest in the varying characters.\n\n\nWhat Should Have Been Added:\nPretty much like I said that only main thing I would have wanted to see was a properly fleshed out story to help solidify this game.\n\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nI am definitely glad to see the success this game is receiving and hope that Sega and Sumo Digital continue to make this a worthy addition to the kart racing game genre. especially since its the only kart racing game I know of that has a version for PC which is way easier to get people to play on locally than with a handheld or a console. I hope to see continued variety of character inclusion from the illustrious Sega collection of characters they have at their disposal.\n\n","November 29, 2013","true","36.8"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

There's  a nice assortment of characters (maybe too much from Sonic), a lot of levels which are pretty much all fantastic (with mirror versions), and the controls are tight. While it's a kart racer, skill plays a large factor and items can only do so much when going up against skilled opponents. My main gripe is that there are some issues which can occur with collision on the tracks, specifically with regards to skyboxes, but these hardly detract from the overall experience and occur infrequently. The graphics are nice, the music is great, and the game just plays very well. This is a great game and I recommend this to anyone interested in racing games or with a love for Sega.","December 5, 2013","true","115.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I haven't figured out yet if they're cheating or not but after you've seunk a dozen hours into the game and you start getting a feeling for just how much fast you can be... well.. yeah, let's say that there are some cheaters and you'll notice it soon enougth.\n\nI just wish there was a Panzer Dragoon kart.","December 19, 2013","true","13.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The World Tour mode acts as an introduction to both the game mechanics and further game modes. These include time attack, battle race, traffic attack and boost races with inventive timed challenges.\n\nEach lap features dynamic tracks with land, sea and air obstacles. The players vehicle teraforms accordingly within each zone requiring a unique strategy to control the vehicle. With multiple routes through each course, it pays to experiment and fine tune your approach.\nA key tactic is maintaining a 'boost' via boosting pads and rings, landing a series of tricks or drifting. Its easily achieved with the brake input and long sharp turns can be mastered to achieve a level 3 boost.\n\nAs you progress through the tour you unlock up to 3 medals per event based on your difficulty chose, which are then used to unlock new events and characters. The game also features a traditional Grand Prix, with playlists of all the races found in the world tour.\n\nThe game revives a wealth of characters from throughout Sega's history, re-imagining them in slick, new HD forms. There's also plenty of fan service in the form of the fantastically inventive tracks and items that are all uniquely helpful, whilst never becoming unfair game changers.\n\nThe mechanic of transforming throughout a race works extremely well, forcing the player to adapt their play style completely. Whilst giving accurate feedback and control from the sky and waves, rather than being a mere automated aesthetic change.\n\nAlthough racing is a well polished mechanic and revisited throughout the various modes – it is easily re-playable both on your own and with others.\nFurthermore the invention of boost races and traffic attacks are entertaining but also serve to test and improve your specific abilities in boosting and navigating a course. The game can be both very accessible and challenging, but these are fair frustrations which ultimately make you a better player.\n\nWith over 25 playable characters, there are a range of vehicles with different perks to conquer different challenges. Although there are none to detest some are licensed characters making an unusual appearance.\nEach character can also level up with races earning them modifiers to improve or balance each attribute of their vehicle. Rather than being a player license level it requires each character to be levelled up, ultimately for the same items and begins to feel like an RPG grind.\n\nSega have raided their treasure troves to craft a balance kart racer, that makes innovative strides in the genre. Not only does it look great and play well, but it reinstates some of its greatest veterans in reminiscent worlds.\nSumo Digital have refined the kart racing genre in their offering whilst introducing a more dynamic take of plane and boat racing with sophisticated environmental physics. The game manages to capture what was great and good about Sega whilst becoming an exceptional addition to their roster. Perhaps Sonic is faster behind the wheel.\n\nWatch at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tTUg00HeyY&list=UUxz-iPSjsZAsGhFY7zLfi9g","December 19, 2014","true","19.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Looks and runs perfectly. If you were a Sega kid, you'll love the impressive amount of fan-service here. I had a lot of fun with the prior game in this series as well. The air and sea gameplay here is often more frustrating than fun, but it's tolerable. If you would prefer things to be cart-only, then just stick with the prior game, unless you can nab this for $5 or so.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bVork/recommended/212480/","bVork","bVork","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bVork/","1310 products in account","Easily the best kart racer of this generation, and probably the best one ever released on PC. It's not a dramatic departure from the formula invented by Mario Kart, but Sonic Transformed tweaks and improves upon that formula in a lot of ways that make it even better than Nintendo's more recent offerings. Weapons are a lot more fair and can be dodged with quick and careful driving. The single-player mode offers up a huge amount of missions with a lot of variety. The graphics are gorgeous. The trick system for earning boosts encourages learning the tracks. The three different vehicle modes all handle very differently. There's a lot of depth here if you want to dive into the time trials.\n\nAnd if you're into Sega, this has a ridiculous amount of fanservice. From Segata Sanshiro to Burning Rangers to Panzer Dragoon, this is the ultimate tribute to Sega's history.\n\nAbout the only major flaw is the inability to turn off weapons in online or grand prix play. Some of the single-player missions are weaponless races, and it's a real shame that you can't play like that with friends or in a racing series. But it's telling that I consider that a flaw - that the core racing in a kart racer is so good that I want to enjoy it without the accoutrements normally layered on top of games in the genre.","July 2, 2013","true","34.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Longer game, more races, better maps, more and better game modes. and better characters. You can not alter the vehicles per racer, but that is not needed because the game is so faun already.

The gameplay is smooth and responsive and the races feel action packed. There is a large variety of weapons to thwart your competition and a good variety of brilliantly designed courses. The courses never get boring because a number of them alternate between being ground based, water based and aviation based depending on the lap or course you are on. Different characters start off with and transform into different vehicles suited to the type of race. Each individual character also earns different 'mods' for their vehicles when they level up which alter their stats.\nThe announcer from the previous game is no longer in it and instead it is just spectated when you are "owning the race" or have performed a stunt or attack. The soundtrack is as good and as fitting  as ever with some really well done remixes. You can play with up to four players but playing against the AI also offers up a worthy challenge depending on the chosen difficulty. Playing on a higher difficulty rewards you with more stars which are used to unlock more characters, courses and bonuses.\nThe are only two things that grate on me about this game, one being the inclusion of characters that just don't seem to fit such as 'Danica Patrick' who appeared in the game because she was sponsored by Sega. In my opinion it would have been better to include some more well known characters such as Kazuma from the Yakuza series which was by Sega. On the upside there were a few DLC characters that were added for free.\nThe final annoyance is that I have found the game sometimes crashes to desktop for no apparent reason. This is no reason to not buy the game (because it is a justified purchase that offers a shed load of fun) but it can induce some serious rage when you're in the middle of a race or have just set up a multiplayer session.","December 8, 2013","true","26.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Stick with it though and you will find a beautiful, and enjoyable racing game and the best alternative to Mario Kart that you will find.\n\nThe netcode has some problems which does lower enjoyment somewhat but the online matches are still the most enjoyable part of the game.

One steak quesadilla, four soft shell tacos, three 5-layer burritos, a bag of Doritos and a medium Mountain Dew Baja Blast later, our friend concludes his visit to the establishment and decides to pay another to his dear friend, Mario Kart. Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing Transformed knocks on the door, the sound nearly drowned out by the churning of his own stomach. Mario Kart answers the door. "Hey, Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing Transformed, what's up?", he asks inquisitively, wondering why his friend is visiting at such a peculiar hour unannounced. Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing Transformed replies "Oh, not much, I was just in the area and-OH MY GOD, what is THAT!?". Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing Transformed points in a general direction behind Mario Kart. Mario Kart turns to look at what could cause such a stir, but nothing is there. In this instant, Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing Transformed undoes his own belt, pulls down his pants and aims his ♥♥♥ towards his neighbor. Confused, Mario Kart's head turns back to it's default position to discover his friends exposed, crowning ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ staring directly into his eyes. Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing Transformed proceeds to blow a violent fiesta of watery ♥♥♥♥ chunks all over Mario Kart's stupid, fat ♥♥♥♥ing face, staining it forever brown.\n\nThat's how much better this game is than Mario Kart.","March 24, 2013","true","52.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

This game features gorgeous visuals, music and characters, and fantastic track design and original concepts and stage gimmicks to keep things fresh. If it was worth me buying a second copy, as I already own a near-fully completed copy on my PS3, then that certainly states that I recommend this game to not only Sonic and SEGA fans, but fans of racing games and videogames in general.\n\nIf you want more graphical charm and don't have an amazing PC (like me) you may be better off getting a console version, but seriously, buy this amazing gem of a racer right now!

There is more skill needed rather than luck in this racing game and the S Class AI is quite the challenge even for kart racing veterans.  There are many characters to choose from with their own driving/flying/boat racing abilities.  Many courses change on every lap and the items are well balanced where the best racer usually wins.  Not only that but it looks better and the controls are more responsive than any Mario Kart game I have played.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BrianReddus/recommended/212480/","BrianReddus","BrianReddus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BrianReddus/","353 products in account","This game is good. Suprisingly good. It takes Diddy Kong Racing's multiple vehicle system, combines it with the customability of Mario Kart 7, and throws in all the lovely music and levels you should expect from any Sonic game.\n\nYou should consider making this your go-to party racing game rather than Mario Kart. The weapons are simple, yet well balanced. The rocket, ice, and blowfish all are nice to shoot forwards and backwards, but each have their own little niche to avoiding or dodging. Even this game's version of the "blue shell" is avoidable, assuming you have the skills to weave around it without hitting something else.\n\nThis game also has drifiting and tricks, which when mastered add some speed to your character, but will punish you harshly if you screw it up and get greedy (by either drifting too far or adding in one too many flips) There's no snaking here, but mastering the drifts and the flips really helps.\n\nThe track design is incredible. It lives up to the name, and the track morphs and changes as you go on, making you utilize new stratigies or methods to get to the finish line. Each vehicle style (car, boat, plane) handles exactly the way you'd expect it to, which means any time you mess up, it's always your fault.\n\nThe characters are great too. Some may have more handling, top speed, acceleration, and so on, but you can fine tune these settings with character mods that you unlock simply through playing that specific character enough. Soon you'll unlock mods that will more drastically change the way the character handles. This way if you're playing online, you'll almost always have the car stats you want, even if someone else picks your usual character.\n\nEven the minor things, like the over-excited arcade style announcer, the wide varity of characters, and the track specific music add up to make this a great competator to Mario Kart that beats it hands down in one category: it's on the PC.\n\nTip: Get a gamepad for this game. It's much better with precise acceration and turning, plus the second control stick for flipping makes it much easier than a keyboard.","November 25, 2013","true","28.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, alot of people don't know that Sega had the Idea first. I bought the original game on my DS. Not very good graphics or gameplay. Then I saw this game on sale, and I couldn't stop myself from buying it, as well as a little bit of DLC. This game is amazing. 10/10. The graphics have improved, though that may just be my opinion because of the DS' graphics. The gameplay is better than Mario Kart. In Mario Kart 7, during the flying sections, you don't feel much control. Sonic & All-Stars Racing: Transformed fixes that. At first I didn't realize I had much power over flying, so I ended up in last place. I even had the game turn on Y-axis. Also the game's cast of characters are great. Wreck It Ralph, Yogscast, Pyro, Heavy, and Spy all make appearances. Well, Pyro, Heavy, and Spy make up one team called Team Fortess, so, does that still count? I'm saying yes. Anyways, if this game wasn't on sale I probably wouldn't even try it. But, I ended up loving it. Man, I love this game.\n","May 19, 2014","true","4.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

However if you dig deep enough you'll find a much more complex racing system than in most other racing game.  First of all in addition to the karts you also have access to boats and planes for all characters.  This is where the games design shines as often you'll get multiple options of where to go, one where you take the high road in the skies and the other plodding on the ground or in a boat.  Another nice thing is the items which are only there to spice the game up rather than giving sucky players an unfair advantage.  Even the all star move is balanced in a way that it only really helps if you know how to use it.  The game looks amazing when running at max settings though I've noticed some significant issues with fps even when at minimal settings(Though this may just be my computer.  The game does have it's flaws, characters aren't varried that much especially since all star moves are so much more bland compared to the first game, and the leveling up system is dull and tedious beyond words.  Also I highly reccomend you play this using a controller only as playing with the mouse and keyboard sucks so much its not even worth trying.  But this is the definitive version of All stars transformed as it has additional characters with more promised while the console ports are left in the dust.  And since this game has gone on sale a couple of times since it's release there's little excuse not to pick it up.","December 23, 2013","true","9.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's amazing. And of course, has Sonic and all of your favorite characters!\n\n\nGENERAL:\nSonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed gives you 3 ways to play; alone, with people from all around the world, and at private party. And there's even more ways to play when you play solo. Giving you alot of hours to play for your amusement!\n\n\nCONTENT:\nYou got 30+ characters in this platform. Yes, 30 characters, including the DLC and the unlockable characters from your favorite titles: Sonic, Super Monkey Ball, and so much more! And you can play with them on over 40 tracks. That's alot of combinations there. And it dosen't stop there, you get 5 gamemodes to play with, the combinations are HUGE here.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nThe gameplay is divine. It's like SEGA learned from it's mistakes from SEGA All Stars Racing ancestor and remade it into a more original creation. It's nothing like Mario Kart at all, where you must get OP items to win. If you play alone, you can progress through the game, collect and upgrade your characters! And some singleplayer portions are difficult. It's mechanics are also great. Don't like playing alone? Play online and show the world what you're made of!\n\n\n\nWEAKNESSES AND CONCERNS:\nThere are problems with this game though, no matter how good it is. First being is that to win, you have to rely on one mechanic: Powerful boostings at a rapid rate. You'll never have a decent Time Attack record without a powerful character. I.E. Shadow with Dreamcast mod is one of them. But if you're skilled, you shouldn't have alot of problems with that.\nAnother concern about this is the server. Though the community is friendly, the servers you're gonna play in, will never be. As you're mixed with these new guys, and real MLG players, and some of them may have bad connection, causing an unbearable amount of crashing into walls and such. Even MLG players suffer from that.\nYet another concern is the aftermath, and I mean what happens now when you beat the game, although I like this game, I, at one point, abandoned it because of how usual it is. But I returned to it in a few months after.\nOne of my worries are also being about the tracks, although there's 42 tracks at most, the other 21 is  just mirrored.\nLast one is about one of the mechanics: The Casino. Chances are in a race, you could get a crappy thing, but a really good one is actually rare. I.E. The useless Nitro is often, but the best ones, like Titanium Frame or Stunt Nitro is almost impossible.\n\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS:\nTo be honest, I love the game, it has alot of potential. But I wish that the developers could realise it. But then again, they might be working on something that could beat this. You should get it at full price, but if you take the problems seriously, then maybe at 20-40% off. I give it a 8.9/10","September 7, 2013","true","385.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The fact that it has so many unlockables and characters, and the handling mods make it difficult to pick favorites... it's insane. I've devoted a lot of time just playing it with my brother and unlocking everything, and hard mode on each challenge is rewarding as heck.\n\nBuy it for the marketing characters, stay for the skill.","January 1, 2014","true","20.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Buy this game.\n\nLike kart racers? I'm pretty sure this is kart racer out of kart racer. It's not my genre of choice but once into the drifting, power-up-hogging groove it's good fun, with the usual random ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ry of your competitors being balanced by your own opportunities and being able to mitigate many of the "unlucky" breaks with skill.\n\nIt's a bit of a shame that they went to the effort of licensing, designing, modelling, texturing and voicing the bonus PC characters, to stop short of giving them transform animations and just use obscuring effects instead. The launcher where you set up keyboard controls is buggy and unpleasant. Neither of these things will cross your mind while charging through Adder's Lair to its outstanding soundtrack, or watching Rogue's Landing fall apart around you as an airship battle rages, or trying to corner through Burning Depths as a voice-in-your-ear operator warns you about the flooding track's changing routes.

The branching track design and "stackable" boost system both contribute to making the game easy to pick up while also ensuring that victory in higher-level matches is very much a matter of skill.\n\nThe game comes with a comprehensive host of local and online multiplayer options as well as a fairly substantial singleplayer campaign. Highly recommended.","July 17, 2014","true","32.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has quite a high learning curve and is deceptively difficult so don't go into this thinking this will be an easy game. Don't let that put you off though as it is very rewarding improving your racing skills.\n\nEvery vehicle feels different. I tried getting a couple of my friends who are huge Mario Kart fans to play. They liked the feel of the cars but not of the other vehicles due to unfamiliarity. If you're not willing to give the game a chance due to reasons like that then you won't enjoy it. Stick with it though and you will find a beautiful, and enjoyable racing game and the best alternative to Mario Kart that you will find.\n\nThe netcode has some problems which does lower enjoyment somewhat but the online matches are still the most enjoyable part of the game. Racing against other players is way more fun than racing the computer.\n\nDare I say that if the game was more polished it may have even taken the Mario Kart crown!\n\nHighly recommended!","July 13, 2014","true","161.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ogkillathug/recommended/212480/","ogkillathug","Nerdsync","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ogkillathug/","178 products in account","A wonderful game that pays tribute to everything Sega, Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed is something that will crush the competition for years to come.\n\nThe Good:\n\nLevel Design and Diversity: S&ART's levels come in many different shapes and sizes, and all of them provide a rich, detailed and fun experience for the players. From challenging levels make Rainbow Road look easy to wonderfuly crafted thematic levels such as  Dream Valley, S&ART has a level for every skill level.\nCharacter Diversity: Every vehicle and level in S&ART has it's unique style and feel and style. From General Winter's Tank to Shogun's wooden... Chariot, The level of character diversity in S&ART easily surpasses the majority of arcade racing games on the market.\n\nThe Notable:\n\nThe Boats and Planes: The addition of boats and planes has opened up many unique opportunies for fun and often whacky levels. However, this is no Skydrift or Hydro Thunder. The boats often feel slow and clunky, and the feeling of being in water is only kept there by the predictable wave effects. The planes are meant to be the fastest and most agile of the vehicles, and yet they feel very bloated and dance through the sky instead of cutting through the air. Drifting is also a very gimicked function on these two modes, and serves as a tie-in feature to keep the feel of the game consistent.\nModes that aren't Racing: From 'Capture the Chao' to 'Battle Arena', secondary modes serve as mostly a distraction (albeit an intresting and somewhat fun one) from the core of the game. The fun that one may have is generally very inconsistent as these modes generally rely on utilising one feature of the game over and over again.\n\n\nThe Bad:\nPoorly designed PC Menus: Graphical customisation cannot be done in game, it must be instead configured through an external menu. The placement of the menu items in game are also have a 'console port' feel, with clunky selection menus and awkwardly placed buttons.","March 30, 2014","true","14.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/murakaz/recommended/212480/","murakaz","murakaz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/murakaz/","135 products in account","Has pretty much everything you want out of a kart racer:  balanced power-ups, great level design, large cast of characters, plenty of challenge, smooth online play, local multiplayer, and some fantastic visuals.  If you can look past the fact that you might not recognise some of the racers then you have no reason not to give this game a try.  Seriously, it's easily one of the best kart racing games ever made... it's up there with CTR, Diddy Kong Racing, and whichever Mario Kart you prefer.\n\nI know it can be easy to write this game off.  After all, how many Mario Kart clones did we see after the N64 version blew up?  But instead of merely copying another franchise and putting a Sega skin over everything, you'll quickly notice that the developers genuinely tried to take full advantage of every licence they got.  Putting as much detail as possible into each racer's kart and respective tracks.  The tracks are really well designed; they never get too long or feel too short, they contain plenty of variety thanks to the ability to jump between car/plane/boat, and often change dramatically as the race progresses.  The gameplay itself is a sweet mix of CTR and Diddy Kong Racing, but with their own unique take on the two.\n\nThe game's one weak point (outside of maybe the initial learning curve) is some of the character selection.  While they do try to include plenty of female characters, a few of their choices are kinda lame side characters, but it's a minor complaint and the roster is otherwise very creative and varied.  Plus the PC version has 31 (!) total characters, which is great.\n\nIf this is a style of game you enjoy or have ever enjoyed previously, I highly recommend picking this up.  If you can manage to play it with friends then you are in for some competitive gaming bliss.","January 20, 2014","true","32.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, alot of people don't know that Sega had the Idea first. I bought the original game on my DS. Not very good graphics or gameplay. Then I saw this game on sale, and I couldn't stop myself from buying it, as well as a little bit of DLC. This game is amazing. 10/10. The graphics have improved, though that may just be my opinion because of the DS' graphics. The gameplay is better than Mario Kart. In Mario Kart 7, during the flying sections, you don't feel much control. Sonic & All-Stars Racing: Transformed fixes that. At first I didn't realize I had much power over flying, so I ended up in last place. I even had the game turn on Y-axis. Also the game's cast of characters are great. Wreck It Ralph, Yogscast, Pyro, Heavy, and Spy all make appearances. Well, Pyro, Heavy, and Spy make up one team called Team Fortess, so, does that still count? I'm saying yes. Anyways, if this game wasn't on sale I probably wouldn't even try it. But, I ended up loving it. Man, I love this game.\n","May 19, 2014","true","4.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

The branching track design and "stackable" boost system both contribute to making the game easy to pick up while also ensuring that victory in higher-level matches is very much a matter of skill.\n\nThe game comes with a comprehensive host of local and online multiplayer options as well as a fairly substantial singleplayer campaign.

By looking at some videos of the gameplay and reading some of the positive reviews I decided to give it a shot, and boy did I become a fan real quick! I have always liked kart games like these for their beautiful colors, goofy characters and creative weapons and this game nails those spots right on!\nWith beloved characters from the SEGA universe and some newcomers, this game offers a real nice variation of vehicles along with awesome and unique All-Star moves to go along with which lets you choose your way to devastate the track when you're having a bad day and watch you fly right past the competition in an awesome spectacle, may it be by the usage of rockets, soundwaves or bananas. The creative weapons are both amusing and rediculous and makes the races go completely out of control which is one of the charms of kart games like these. You can also find the usual powerups which lets you boost up to higher speeds or block incoming attacks, but with all the crazy weapons and powerups aside, this game can really offer you a test of racing skill to see if you got what it takes to go even faster by using risky air-stunts and powerful drift-boosts which, altough makes the game a little more difficult, also makes the game more thrilling and exciting and overall more fun. The race tracks are, what you would expect, tracks based on several of the SEGA character's original titles which definitely is a must for party games like these, and putting the "Transformed" in this game's title is the fact that in most of the stages there is a transition to race by both boat and plane during the race which puts more variety and challenge into the game.\nSo if you're a fan of racing games with elements of driving by car, boat and plane as well as neat combos you can pull off, or even if you're just a fan of Sonic and his friends I truly recommend and tell you that this game is for you!","March 3, 2014","true","71.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I give this game a 9 out of 10. In the online ranked mode sometimes (not common but not rare either) you'll find a boost exploiter, or straight up cheater playing in the lobby. You can just avoid matchmaking if they pop up in your lobby though. Sega should ban them permanently from playing.

It's not a dramatic departure from the formula invented by Mario Kart, but Sonic Transformed tweaks and improves upon that formula in a lot of ways that make it even better than Nintendo's more recent offerings. Weapons are a lot more fair and can be dodged with quick and careful driving. The single-player mode offers up a huge amount of missions with a lot of variety. The graphics are gorgeous. The trick system for earning boosts encourages learning the tracks. The three different vehicle modes all handle very differently. There's a lot of depth here if you want to dive into the time trials.\n\nAnd if you're into Sega, this has a ridiculous amount of fanservice. From Segata Sanshiro to Burning Rangers to Panzer Dragoon, this is the ultimate tribute to Sega's history.\n\nAbout the only major flaw is the inability to turn off weapons in online or grand prix play. Some of the single-player missions are weaponless races, and it's a real shame that you can't play like that with friends or in a racing series. But it's telling that I consider that a flaw - that the core racing in a kart racer is so good that I want to enjoy it without the accoutrements normally layered on top of games in the genre.","July 2, 2013","true","34.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It may not have hit that metaphorical bullseye of gaming excellence; however Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed will surprise you. Notably this game has pretty good "game feel".

By looking at some videos of the gameplay and reading some of the positive reviews I decided to give it a shot, and boy did I become a fan real quick! I have always liked kart games like these for their beautiful colors, goofy characters and creative weapons and this game nails those spots right on!\nWith beloved characters from the SEGA universe and some newcomers, this game offers a real nice variation of vehicles along with awesome and unique All-Star moves to go along with which lets you choose your way to devastate the track when you're having a bad day and watch you fly right past the competition in an awesome spectacle, may it be by the usage of rockets, soundwaves or bananas. The creative weapons are both amusing and rediculous and makes the races go completely out of control which is one of the charms of kart games like these. You can also find the usual powerups which lets you boost up to higher speeds or block incoming attacks, but with all the crazy weapons and powerups aside, this game can really offer you a test of racing skill to see if you got what it takes to go even faster by using risky air-stunts and powerful drift-boosts which, altough makes the game a little more difficult, also makes the game more thrilling and exciting and overall more fun. The race tracks are, what you would expect, tracks based on several of the SEGA character's original titles which definitely is a must for party games like these, and putting the "Transformed" in this game's title is the fact that in most of the stages there is a transition to race by both boat and plane during the race which puts more variety and challenge into the game.\nSo if you're a fan of racing games with elements of driving by car, boat and plane as well as neat combos you can pull off, or even if you're just a fan of Sonic and his friends I truly recommend and tell you that this game is for you!","March 3, 2014","true","71.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I give this game a 9 out of 10. In the online ranked mode sometimes (not common but not rare either) you'll find a boost exploiter, or straight up cheater playing in the lobby. You can just avoid matchmaking if they pop up in your lobby though. Sega should ban them permanently from playing.

Everything in this game is an absolute delight from the music and stages to the myraid of characters represented, my personal favorite being Vyse. The game isn't for the faint of heart however as one progresses to higher difficulties, the challenges, all of which intuitively teach you to become a better racer, become harder than you would expect of any kart racer and even many contemporary games in this generally casualized generation. To learn also that this game was a budget shows that SUMO is able to strech every penny they were given, making this an absolutely pleasant experience. The only complaint I can make about this game is the cast which certainly by any range wouldn't be considered a cast of All-stars with YogsCast, Football Manager, and Total War taking priority over Shenmune, or Vectorman. These complaints are rather minimal however with the news of additional DLC possibly coming that might entail such characters being added.","December 6, 2013","true","119.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you can look past the fact that you might not recognise some of the racers then you have no reason not to give this game a try.  Seriously, it's easily one of the best kart racing games ever made... it's up there with CTR, Diddy Kong Racing, and whichever Mario Kart you prefer.\n\nI know it can be easy to write this game off.  After all, how many Mario Kart clones did we see after the N64 version blew up?  But instead of merely copying another franchise and putting a Sega skin over everything, you'll quickly notice that the developers genuinely tried to take full advantage of every licence they got.  Putting as much detail as possible into each racer's kart and respective tracks.  The tracks are really well designed; they never get too long or feel too short, they contain plenty of variety thanks to the ability to jump between car/plane/boat, and often change dramatically as the race progresses.  The gameplay itself is a sweet mix of CTR and Diddy Kong Racing, but with their own unique take on the two.\n\nThe game's one weak point (outside of maybe the initial learning curve) is some of the character selection.  While they do try to include plenty of female characters, a few of their choices are kinda lame side characters, but it's a minor complaint and the roster is otherwise very creative and varied.  Plus the PC version has 31 (!) total characters, which is great.\n\nIf this is a style of game you enjoy or have ever enjoyed previously, I highly recommend picking this up.  If you can manage to play it with friends then you are in for some competitive gaming bliss.","January 20, 2014","true","32.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is amazing, and playing split-screen or online multiplayer with friends is a lot of fun. The character selection, course design and gameplay are some of the best in the genre, and the soundtrack is an absolutely incredible selection of remixed classic tunes, to which you can credit Richard Jacques, also known for his work on Sonic R, Sonic 3D Blast Saturn and Metropolis Street Racer, among many other things.\n\nAnd it's not just a straight console port either! In fact, while this game is great on X360, PS3 and Wii U, the PC version is the definitive version, offering improved textures, resolution and is the only version capable of running in 60fps. The PC exclusive characters leave a lot to be desired though, but their presence doesn't retroactively ruin the game. They're just not a deal-maker over the console editions.\n\nIf you're sick of Mario Kart, then this is the best Mario Kart killer since Crash Team Racing.

However if you dig deep enough you'll find a much more complex racing system than in most other racing game.  First of all in addition to the karts you also have access to boats and planes for all characters.  This is where the games design shines as often you'll get multiple options of where to go, one where you take the high road in the skies and the other plodding on the ground or in a boat.  Another nice thing is the items which are only there to spice the game up rather than giving sucky players an unfair advantage.  Even the all star move is balanced in a way that it only really helps if you know how to use it.  The game looks amazing when running at max settings though I've noticed some significant issues with fps even when at minimal settings(Though this may just be my computer.  The game does have it's flaws, characters aren't varried that much especially since all star moves are so much more bland compared to the first game, and the leveling up system is dull and tedious beyond words.  Also I highly reccomend you play this using a controller only as playing with the mouse and keyboard sucks so much its not even worth trying.  But this is the definitive version of All stars transformed as it has additional characters with more promised while the console ports are left in the dust.  And since this game has gone on sale a couple of times since it's release there's little excuse not to pick it up.","December 23, 2013","true","9.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For once a Sonic game, in 3D no less, that's free of bugs, looks nice, and you actually go fast! Pretty decent kart racer with a lot of weird IPs in it.

Why would you play Grid or Need for Speed? They don't have the MN4GR or the Team Fortress characters. You know what this game also has? WILLEMUS. That's right, WILLEMUS, the Roman general who looks like AlphaOmegaSin (check him out on YouTube, he rocks). Sure, you can play as Sanic and his mutated friends, but why would you do that when you have Willemus? You also have a lot of different tracks to choose from, all from many different and popular SEGA games like Sonic and... Afterburner... Panzer Dragoon... BUT IT HAS WILLEMUS WHAT MORE WOULD YOU WANT?!\n\nI give this game a four Willemuses out of five.","December 8, 2013","true","2.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/triquatra/recommended/212480/","triquatra","Triquatra","http://steamcommunity.com/id/triquatra/","36 products in account","Well, this is just stupidly fun. Annoyingly I originally played this game using a keyboard (UGHHH) as I didn't have a controller at the time. Only AFTER finishing most of the game did I manage to get hold of an XBOX360 controller. Luckily there is still a large amount to complete which I wouldn't have been able to without the controller\n\nGetting a controller is a must. The drifts are loads of fun and very easy to pull off (my 3 year old can do it) which is great when you don't want to put too much thought into your gameplay.\n\nLove the unlockable characters, to see Team Fortress in there was a pleasent surprise. Graphics wise the game oozes neon and bright colours which adds to the childish fun of it all. Transforming instantly into a boat/car/plane is such a great nod to ones childhood, where you would be playing with a toy car which of course could hop off the couch and onto the floor (sea) where it could take off and fly around the room. Too much fun. Highly recommended.","December 21, 2015","true","64.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
