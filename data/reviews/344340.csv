You can play an unlimited number of seasons, choosing to build and rebuild your team through the draft, free agency, and/or trading. It has a strong and challenging Single Player AI, and has full 32-human multi-player capabilities as well. If you've ever wanted to try to run an NFL franchise, you definitely want to give this game a shot. There is an active user community at Front Office Football Central[www.operationsports.com], a fansite frequented by Jim Gindin, the solo developer of Front Office Football and founder of Solecismic Software.\n\nI have owned every version of FOF, dating back to 1998, and in my opinion, this is easily the best version ever, a fitting upgrade to an excellent series.","February 4, 2015","true","962.2"," 98 of 111 people (88%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","88","98","111","11","3"

I have played Madden since the 93 version on my Sega.  It was so great when they finally added franchise mode and then added the draft.  I loved drafting players and playing multiple seasons to see how they progressed.  On into the 2000s we got 3D, motion capture, and all these fancy graphics.  That was great eye candy, but man did it slow down the draft.  I wanted to look at every  player and every stat of every player to make sure that linebacker I was targeting at round 2 pick 7 was going to fit my vision and help the team out.  That took forever.  Sure having their picture there added to immersion, but when you got to fictional players it really didn't matter.  It was just another generic face.\n\nThen I discovered the greatness of Front Office Football.  I could peruse the draft class in minutes.  I could filter by linebacker.  I could see all of his stats in a bar graph that easily let me make a decision if he was a fit or not.  I could create a gameplan to fit my new first round running back.  I could see the results of my planning.  I was in love with this game.   How could it get any better?\n\nWell if it had the fancy 3D game replays that would be great!  EA tried that with a game about a head coach.  I didn't like it at all.  It was still cumbersome to get through the menus and get to what really mattered.  If I wanted to watch every play of the game I could do it with the FOF replay.  Sure it was text, but it was fast and had colorful text that told me what was happening on the field.  The stats gave me the overall view so I could easily see what my competitors in my division were doing.  I could get through a whole season in an afternoon and get a great feeling of acomplishment.  How could it get any better?\n\nI discoverd multiplayer leagues!  Now multiplayer was nothing new.  Madden had it.  You could play against your buddy who you just knew was looking at your side of the screen and figuring out which play you called.  At least until they added the bluff system.  Most football games had some sort of multiplayer.  No this was differnet.  Every team could be represented by a real living person.  It wasn't a bunch of button mashing and test of reflexes.  It was a test of the brain and preparation.  You could build your team through the draft or free agency and then create your perfect offensive and defensive game plans.  Once the commisioner had everyone's  gameplan then it was on!  FOF managed to simulate up to 16 games and send out the results.  Results that could then be replayed in the game viewer play by play.  It took a little bit of imagination to see your players preforming a pancake block or a diving catch, but it was there and it was uncanny acurate compared to the NFL.  Then there came that day that you get to the Super Bowl!  After playing all year against 32 humans!  This team that you built up storms the field and ....  how could it get any better?\n\nIt was just released on Steam.","February 4, 2015","true","14.1"," 87 of 97 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","87","97","3","0"

There are a myriad of reasons, not the least of which is multi player functionality. Testing my team building and game planning wits against 31 other actual human owners in a league has been one of my favorite things to do since the first game in the front office football series allowed it, back in 2004. For over 10 years now, I have been playing armchair GM in several leagues, and the reason is because this game is the best American Football management simulation on the market.\n\nBut, lets say you want to experience the game from a single player standpoint. The big question for games like this is typically "How is the A.I.?" - Well the A.I. in FOF 7 is easily the best it has been in the entire series, which means that you don't see legendary players released into free agency year after year. You don't see teams running offenses that don't fit their personnel. You don't see teams employing a static strategy that fails year after year. You don't see the computer draft players they don't need or sign free agents to ridiculous salaries. This means that 20, 50, or even 100 years into a league (which can go on forever, quite literally) you will still be facing the same challenges from the team building side of things.\n\nThe statistical reproduction is realistic, injuries and penalties are modeled very well, scouting and drafting is very similar to real life in that picks aren't always what they seem. You can win with many different strategies. If you have the personnel for it, you can pass the ball all day long. If you have a strong run blocking offensive line and a stud back, you can run. If you have a killer defense, you can start the equivalent of Trent Dilfer at QB and still win titles. It is entirely up to you how to build and run your franchise. I highly recommend the game, 100% - there is already a built in user base and there are several decade old multi-player leagues still running strong with full or nearly full ownership. With this release on Steam, chances are more leagues will pop up, and more armchair GM's will be taking their seat in the front office, so if you have been looking for a football management simulation for American Football, look no further. This game is worth every penny.","February 4, 2015","true","124.0"," 57 of 62 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","57","62","0","0"

I've got a lot of hours in this game both in single player and in multiplayer leagues hosted offsite. This game will cater to that desire to prove to the armchair GM's of the world that you could do a much better job than they do at running the organization. You'll find the game looks a little hard on the eyes with a lot of menus options to look at and data to process. But once you've gotten over the stark shock of it what you'll find is a rock solid game engine that has been developed over 15 years in the making. The idea is that the problems and issues that a GM would face in the NFL can be replicated here in Front Office Fooball.\n\nYou want to trade up to take that hot QB prospect with the first pick? You want to decide which aging team legend you should let go first to free up cap space? You want to watch your 5th round running back develop into a world beater? You want to throw slants from the 2 yard line with the Super Bowl on the line? You want to fire the guy who DID do that? You want to move to a better city because your fans suck?\n\nThis game gives you control over the entire franchise from the coaching staff, to the stadium, to the players on the field, the draft and right through training camp. The curve is a little high at first, but once you get the feel for the flow of the game there is no better American Football Simulation on the market today. There is already a solid community in place with an incredible amount of gaming knowledge out there to find answers and once you've mastered the single player game you can try your hand by going against a multiude of other players in an all out, throwdown battle for the bragging rights of your league.","February 4, 2015","true","12.1"," 43 of 49 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","43","49","2","0"

A lot of the guys doing reviews on this game have 2k+ hours on record, so my 60+ really aren't impressive in the least bit, but this game deserves as many positive reviews as it can get.\n\nThis game is as deep as you personally want it to be. Want to just do the draft, sign free agents, and simulate a few seasons to see how you did? Go ahead. Want to do that, plus set the actual packages and plays your team runs, along with formation specific substitutions? This game will let you do that.\n\nI've played 25 seasons in this game. The progression and regression of players is extremely realistic, and the effects of how good or bad your coaching staff is is very noticable. I've felt the pain of having the first rounder I was gunning for get taken right in front of me, I've felt the nervousness of trading away a ton of future draft picks to move up early in the first for a guy that I thought could be the face of my franchise, and I've felt the triumph of seeing that guy become the face of the entire league over the past 12 seasons.\n\nAt some point I want to start a new game, create new stories, start over with the players that are in the league today. I'm far enough to the point that every player in today's NFL are a distant memory, and sometimes I long for the familiarity. With that said, I can't just end my game. These "Fake" players are very real to me. I've seen how rookies I've drafted have panned out over time. I keep tabs on them as they go to other teams, and wonder how I let them slip away. I've seen guys I've drafted make it to the hall of fame, and its just incredible.\n\nIf your a fan of the sport, or a fan of management games in general, this is the game for you. Be warned though, this game is very addicting. I haven't even tried an online multiplayer league yet, and I've heard that's the best part of the game. I'm very satisfied with this purchase, and will likely purchase every future installment of this franchise for the rest of my life. I just bought like, 12 games on the steam summer sale, and I honestly have no desire to even touch them because of this game.\n\n10/10","June 20, 2015","true","158.1"," 28 of 28 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","28","28","0","0"

Yoru decisions matter in a lot of ways.  Is it worth picking up that stud free agent if he doesn't get along with the position leader?  Should I spend my money on one big name, or spread it improving my squad with a few players instad?  Should I gamble on that top rated Qb even though he has a high volatility and could be a huge bust?  How likely are the combine scores to matter in figuring out which top player to pick at my 1.11 spot in next year's draft?  Do I have coverage in case my starting RB is ut for injury?  And how how of my salary  cap should be invested in quality backups?  Should i move to a 3-4 defense so I can focus on getting quality LBs?  After a season of play, why did my 64/64 rated DE just get four sacks?  What can I do to inprove his perforamnce next year?  How long should I hold on to my aging QB as he begins to slip from All Pro to Pro Bowl, and looks to be getting worse?  Do I even have enough cap room there?  Should I franchise tag my good TE< even though I'll be forced to pay him a lot more than I otherwise would have to do?  Whcih is better for my coach, playcalling or injury avoidance?  Should I build a new stadium or just re-finance my current one?  If I decide to leave town for a better city, where should I target?  A team in my division just offered me a really good trade, should I take it, even though I'll likely strengthen a fellow divison rival with it?  How high can I increase my ticket prices before people stop coming to my games?\n\nAs you can see, there are a ton of questions, mechanics, skillsets, finances, and more to balance.  That's the good of the game!\n\nBut, the games UI isn't going to win any awards.  The graphics sometimes look like they are a few years out of date.  So frankly, I'd rate it a 10/10 for gameplay, but a 6/10 for presentation.\n\nIt's worth it.

The depth of detail in this game is incredible, and the amount of data mining the community performs in order to understand the ins and outs of player development and play calling is astounding.  If you are interested in this game do yourself a favor and look up a site called Front Office Football Central.  Browsing there will give you a hint as to what you're getting with this game.  It's definitely not a casual sports sim.  For a comparison Madden is to Front Office Football what Call of Duty is to ArmA.  If you're looking for a game that lets you pretend to be your favorite player and rack up 5,000 receiving yards in a season look elsewhere.  If you're looking for a game that forces you to debate signing veterans vs. getting rookies playing time and whether you should build a smashmouth defense oriented team or a spread offense high flying powerhouse, this might be the game for you.  You'll never get to watch your players make acrobatic leaps, but you will get to watch them develop as players and have to deal with how they form friendships and animosity between their teammates and the fans.

For those who have played older versions and are wondering why you should get this one, the biggest improvement is in the financial model. It is much harder to play games with contracts with this version than in older versions. The simulation engine remains very strong, but player contract AI is much stronger than in the past.\n\nFor new players wondering what this is, think realistic fantasy football. If you have ever wanted to be a GM and/or coach of your own team, this is the game to do it. You draft players, sign free agents, extend or renegotiate players, manage your depth charts, set a gameplan, and if desired call your own plays. You can build stadiums, and relocate the team if needed. And you get to do it season after season, building up decades of history in the process. It has a very strong game simulation engine, and a very good professional football financial model. Not everything is there - no compensatory picks, for example, and only one type of free agent, but the feel of being a professional GM is very much there. If you start to get lost, there is an online community called Front Office Football Central that can offer help. Also look through the game's options, you can turn on AI help for various aspects. If you want to GM, you can let your coach manage the depth chart and game plan so you can focus on signing players, or switch roles and try to coach the team the AI GM hands you.\n\nDo note that while playcalling is available, it's not the primary focus of the game. It's set up to sim entire game weeks at once, or you can watch your individual game sim out one play at a time, or sim an entire season in one shot.\n\nThe game's UI is very spreadsheet-oriented. This is both a strength and a weakness. Beginners should check out some of the intro guides and videos posted, as the options can be overwhelming when you start. Just remember that you start at week 1 of the regular season, so focus on managing your depth chart and maybe dabble in some contract extensions, but mostly get used to the game feel during that first season before you hit the offseason.\n\nThe big strength in this is the wealth of data you can mine about your league. There is page after page of statistics and records, and you can view individual player cards to decide if they are playing up to their ratings. There is a scouting system, so young players may or may not turn into the player you think they'll be, or 7th year pros can suddenly blossom into stars. Invest in your staff and it will pay off. All this data can also be exported from the game into CSV files that can be opened in Excel or outside utilities (I've written a few) to complement the game's own interface and browsing.\n\nThe modal nature of the UI can be frustrating at times, but most screens have the information you need. For example, when setting your depth chart, you can view individual player ratings. It would be nice to have the roster screen up beside it, but you learn to live with it (or have your own Excel worksheet you've pulled the roster into for browsing in a separate window).\n\nThere is a strong multiplayer component as well for those looking for a human challenge. There are many leagues out there full of human GMs to trade with and draft against, many of which take advantage of the game data export to provide rich web experiences beyond the game.\n\nIf you are looking for a deep, realistic professional football sim, this is the game to look at.","February 4, 2015","true","245.4"," 27 of 33 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","27","33","0","0"

This game does a very good job at simulating accurate numbers for both the players in real life and the players it creates through the draft. It's fun taking control of a team that's a QB away from playoff contention and trying to find your guy in the draft and turning him into a franchise QB. The best thing about this game, however, is the playability. It's accessible by pretty much anybody's timeframe in one way: you can sim entire seasons in less than a minute, get right back to offseason, and keep building your team. Or, if you prefer, you can sit back and watch detailed text based action unfold, adding a suspense aspect to this game.\n\nEven for its debatably steep price, I would definitely recommend this game to (American) football enthusiasts.

If you're in to that sort of thing and have imagination then you can have a great time with this game. You're the president of a team. You choose where your team is located, the name, the coaches, the players, the training staff, roster moves, draft decisions, trades, gameplan, ticket prices, stadium construction, and essentially anything else that a team president would generally control.\n\nSome of the things that i'm able to control I really don't want to control such as the gameplan for the team. That's something the coach that I hired should control. I don't want to guess how much to charge for tickets so that is also delegated. For me the fun is in putting the team together. Deciding on my coaches, players, free agency, and the draft. The key to success in this game is drafting well and being smart with your contracts. The scouting information you receive is dependent on how well your scouting staff evaluates talent. Then there are curveballs thrown in such as player volatility. Many factors go in to scouting information and the accurracy of that information.\n\nIn some cases your scouts can be dead wrong about a player such as in the real NFL. In some cases players may not be committed and you will see your prized first round pick with tons of potential not really develop. Or in some cases he may even begin to regress. This accurracy of information can be adjusted. By default it's set at 50. I have left it on 50 because it does seem like a good balance. I would imagine that on 0 you just couldn't depend on any information your scouts give you and set on 100 the information would be 100% accurrate.\n\nThis game is a lot like Head Coach 2009. That is a game that I loved because the draft was very exciting. Front Office Football gives a similar excitement. Though the drafts are not accompanied by Schefter talking about the prospects you are not limited to just 15 seasons like in HC09. I think i'm currently in year 2132 of my franchise. I should have been dead long ago. :)\n\nYou have to consider things like leadership, how players mesh together, conflicts between players, and players with a bad attitude. All of these things are done very well in this game. I'm not a young man anymore and played Madden since the first one. Franchise mode was what I used to love to play because it felt like you were in control of your favorite team. Head Coach was similar. However, I think that FOF7 does a much better job of giving you control and a realistic feeling of managing a team.\n\nI'm so thankful that I found this game. I didn't know it existed until it arrived on steam. I was still playing Head Coach 09 even though I had memorized all of the players names and how good they were. Then when I got this game I just fell in love. Not at first but once I got into it a little deeper. FOF7 is a game that has infinite replayability. The drafts are completely random. The names and stats are randomly generated so you'll never run into that problem that I had with Head Coach.\n\nIt's hard to describe a text based game but I can say that this game is a ton of fun. It's challenging, rewarding, and something that you can play without getting bored of it.\n\nThat being said it isn't perfect - but it's close. There are some little ergonomic issues like with mouse wheel scrolling in certain menus and things. Nothing major and it's just more of an annoyance that adds an extra click to your menu diving. That's really the only complaint. I'm not sure how many hours i've played but i have never had a single crash in all my hours. Everything runs perfect.\n\nThis is truly the greatest football management game ever. It's certainly worth it's pricetag if you're someone like me. I will probably play this for the rest of my life and not get tired of it. I love it.","March 25, 2015","true","467.7"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","14","14","0","0"

It's a game designed for the consummate geek: a text-based simulation that gives you the ability to micromanage a football team. There are no graphics to speak up and, beware, the interface and looks are kind of ugly. A true geek, however, doesn't care about any of that, and you'll find that the game engine is very deep and impossible to quite figure out, as the interplay of elements is so mysteriously woven with chance and there are so very many of them in the first place. FOF is an art as much as a science.\n\nAt first the game is fascinating in SP, but eventually you will find your way to MP because it's really the only way to play. The SP game-engine is challenging but only to a certain degree. An MP league, however, gives you a shot at a deeply immersive experience along with regular yet powerful doses of excitement. Imagine simulating an entire season over the course of three months, at a leisurely pace of one stage a day -less during the regular season: maybe just two or three games a week (different leagues follow different rhythms, simming as fast as one season a week, and you can join as many as you can handle). Imagine a live draft -thanks to Wheels' third party browser app- with hard time limits and all the excitement of the blockbuster trades and the pick-by-pick analysis of the local Mayocks in the chat room -a little hangout not unlike watching NFL network. The suspense of training camp as you wait for the verdict on the players you drafted, the development of young players, and the decline of veterans. The chess game of game-planning against human players during the regular season. The drama of the playoffs. The fun team reports written by dedicated owners and posted in the web forums. And all in a friendly atmosphere of camaraderie. There is no bullying in MP leagues, and shy owners can keep a low profile if they wish. A bit of banter, sure, but well within the limits of good taste (I suspect there's a very healthy age distribution among GMs). Besides, there is no such a thing as a player who always wins so the best players know better than to be arrogant.\n\nAs to the details of game play, well, you can sign coaches, franchise players, renegotiate contracts, sign free agents, change positions and weight, training camp emphasis, choose formations, coverages, defensive fronts, blitzes (and who and how many you send), tendencies (run/pass), pass-protection schemes, depth of routes, personnel by formation, make adjustments to tendencies by score and time remaining, define playing time, and so on, and in SP you can also call the plays if you wish. And of course, you can study as many stats as you can handle. However, there are elements to watching the games “live” that you will not find in the scoreboard -the equivalent of watching film- so that's a must for the dedicated GM. Finally, the cap is a serious issue in the latest version, so you will have to be very careful with the team finances. If you like, you can focus only on either roster building or game-planning and let the AI handle the rest.\n\nThere you have it. In conclusion, I'd say this is one of those cult games: either you hate it or you love it forever. And hopefully after reading this review you'll be closer to knowing which.\n","March 18, 2015","true","623.5"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"

The game doesn't allow for too many lopsided trades to load teams up(note you also have a salary cap to deal with), but if you really try hard you can fleece the AI(but what fun is that?).  Aside from being the General Manager, you are able to coach your team, set your depth charts, and run 100's of different plays.  It's not too complex, and it's very enjoyable(remember, this is a text based sports sim, not Madden).\n\nMy biggest gripe is the user interface.  The UI is so outdated(it's something you'd expect out of a game created 20 years ago).  It makes navigating really difficult, and it's unsightly compared to other sports sims.  Back to the navigation, is that it's very clunky, the menus aren't well organized(I attribute this to the clunky feeling of the UI).  If the UI was ever improved, this game would be a hit amongst sim enthusiats.  The UI also makes this game very unfriendly to new players, not just to this game, but those making this their first sim they've tried.  There is no tutorial, there is no glossary for stat abbreviations (or the reason they're tracked).\n\nI'm a little harsh on the negative aspect, but once you get used the UI and if you have prior knowledge of Football, the game is quite a bit of fun.  While it's not a 10/10, I'd give the game a solid 8/10, and I recommend it with a little caution as there is a bit of a learning curve.","February 12, 2015","true","24.2"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","15","18","0","0"

I've been playing different iterations of this game for over a decade now.    Sure, it's not pretty to look at but it's not supposed to be (and frankly, I don't want it to be).  It's supposed to immerse you in the details of your football team.  The ratings/stat output are precise and the contracts and decisions you need to make as GM are realistic.  This is a thinking man's (or woman's) football game. If you love football, you should give this a try.  This is the Football Manager TM (soccer) of American football (before all the dots and 3d).  You will get your money's worth.

It's probably in the hundreds actually.\n\nFOF7 is a fantastic simulator. It's probably the most realistic and immersive game of its kind, far exceeding the realism of Football Manager series (it's soccer, but there are no other football simulators so bear with me here). Everything from setting up your starting line-up to play calling is completely realistic. Player stats are completely within an acceptable range; you don't see QB's who throw for 7000 yards or RBs running for 3000. Even things out of the realm of football (like the population of cities, differing fan preferences, franchise values etc.) are simulated extremely realistically. The game has unending replay value; just pick a different team (or the same team, as stats and future development of players are "random" within a pre-determined range) and call different plays. The players coming out of the draft also add to the playability because the talent pool never seems to drop and you can have a career that spans for more than a century! The best part is that the game doesn't experience any lags, even after 100 seasons.\n\nOf course there are a few negatives: The "graphics" are primitive. Actually, there are no graphics to start with. It's a completely text-based simulator so if you are looking for a 3D interface like in FM, tough luck. Other than that the play calling, while very extensive, lacks a few crucial ones such as trick plays where a WR or RB passes the ball. You can still go for fake punts or kicks, but I found it weird that the developer overlooked trick plays during regular downs.\n\nI highly recommend FOF7 to all American football fans who were dismayed by Madden's franchise mode. What's lacking in graphics is made up by the extreme realism of this game.","April 11, 2015","true","360.9"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

This is the most important aspect of sports sims and this is where the game truely shines.  Everything from the stats, to the match results, to the combine all feel good.  You're given the information you need to make your decision (although it may take some time getting used to where to find that information) without holding your hand.  As with real football you're going to make some good deicison and some bad decisions based on the data you have.\n\nThe UI takes some getting used to.  If you have a serious problem with your game looking like a spreadsheet it probably isn't the game for you, but if you can look past that and take the time to get to know the UI then you'll find that you have access to crazy amounts of information and stats.  You can track your draft history, check out who the biggest bust taken #1 overall in the draft is, look at league awards, the league's fastest man, the league's strongest man, and all sorts of other intersting things.  You can access all of these things very quickly as the most redeeming feature of the UI is that it's incredibly fast and responsive.\n\nIf you're a fan of football and sports sims this is a no-brainer as far as I'm concerned.  Take the time to get to know the UI and work through the initial frustrations and you'll be pleasantly surprised at what's under the hood and watch the hours fly by as you try to sim through "one more season" before going to bed.","February 8, 2015","true","15.1"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","0"

After training camp you find out he cant throw the ball over 20 yards without hitting a defender, change the coach's scheme to play the short game. Dump off passes will go to your RB more often, learning your RB has stone hands become evident. It all snowballs based off your little designs.\n\nYou have the chance to truly find gems in the draft. Snagging a DE and successfully converting him to a 3-4 OLB is a very nice feeling. Injuries are only as accurate as what your staff tells you. If your strength coach is a "special" guy, he may green light a minor injury that costs a player his leg.

Draft mid- late round diamonds in the rough through the draft, drown in sorrow over first and second round busts, trade players + picks, sign top free agent players from other teams while building a championship team under the salary cap! Star player out for the season with a serious injury? Injured reserve here he comes, giving a chance to the backup or rookie sitting on the bench. My only gripes about the game is the lack of graphics and editing rosters/date in game. Football Manager is easy to add player photo's and graphics, and it makes the single player much more complete. Hopefully in the next version, Jim allows for more user friendly customization of the game. If you are a sports sim fan, don't let this great game pass you by!","May 7, 2015","true","201.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The simulation engine is top notch, the stats have great variety, seasonal progression is amazing (Jim has a demo of over 100 simulated seasons), can replay games, great support for multi player leagues, etc.\n\nThe elephant in the room is the presentation.  Simply put, it's not good.  The graphics are pretty terrible, the way modal windows are managed block you from loading more than one at a time (unless that modal can spawn a window), the html output is circa 1999. With all that said, everything is good enough- I can get to information quite easily, but it requires some gymnastics of opening and closing windows (somtimes I need to screenshot windows to compare data which is a shame).\n\nGame modding is possible, but quite tedious.  There's a decent amount of documentation, but quirky things can happen if you screw anything up.  What makes this even more difficult is that the game never warns you if you try to import bad data.  Hacking graphics is possible, but it is a hack (if you want to edit anything more than team logos).\n\nThere are a bunch of additional quirky things that really should be managed better, but the reality is that you can work around these shortcomings and have a very enjoyable experience playing this game.  I'm not going to give the developer a pass on the UI and UX issues because it really should be better, but the simulation engine is world class which keeps me coming back.  The other stuff just annoys me more than anything because I actually play this game a lot.\n\nAnyway, definitely worth the $25, hopefully success on steam will allow the dev to get some help with the UI/UX problems.  This game has a great history and continued interation on the presentation and game mechanics is something I greatly look forward to seeing.","February 7, 2015","true","507.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

The drafting of players is also extremely well done.  The old saying, "Easy to play, hard to master" comes to mind.  You can never be completely great at this game...but you'll get enough tools out the gate to win in single-player mode...and then as you develop your knowledge tool-chest over time, you can start to consistantly win in multiplayer leagues...but it's never easy.  Winning in multiplayer is an accomplishment.  For beginners, you may be put off by the "simplicity" of the game UI design, but for intermediate and advanced players, you'll come to appreciate this very much.

I'll give it a thumbs down, because it's not worth the money I spent on it, and it's a huge pain to be able to play the game the way I want to play it.\n\nPositives:\n- It's a good simulator, if you want to play with current NFL players.\n- The preseason draft option is fun, again, if you play with the current NFL players\n\nNegatives:\n- Trying to play with randomly created players. When creating a draft for these players, there are normally 2-3 good quarterbacks to chose from (rated 75-95), another 3-4 decent ones (rated 55-74), and the rest are completely worthless (Sometimes, the best rated qb is in the low 60s). Unless you get the first few picks in the draft (you can't chose what pick you will get), you won't get a good quarterback, and if you don't have a pick in the top 15, you are screwed, and your team will struggle to win any games because your quarterback is so terrible (we're talking backup NFL material here). The poor quarterback ratings don't seem to affect the computer-owned teams much, but a poor qb certainly affects you plenty.\n- The "Preference Draft" idea sounds like a good one (you can chose to allow the computer to draft for you, based on your weighted preferences on each team unit), but it doesn't work correctly. You'll likely end up with 4 RDEs and 0 LDEs, and if you try to move a RDE to LDE, he becomes worthless (his ratings go down tremendously). Even switching a RDT to LDT, or a RG to LG (both of which should have little to no effect), makes the even the best player on the team a mediocre one. If you could trade to even up your roster, that might help, but teams won't trade after the draft (I don't know how long this lasts...it's at least half a season).\n- Trading is difficult. If you can find a player that another team will actually let go of, they want way too much for him.\n- Searching for kick returners and punt returners in the game is a pain. Basically, you have to open up the profiles of all the running backs, receivers and defensive backs to see if they can fill that role. A search for roles would be extremely helpful in the draft (you can search in this manner after the draft). It would also be helpful for the long-snapping role. I hate wasting a roster spot on a guy who is nothing but a long snapper. Centers should also show long-snapping ability in their profiles...only the rookies do.\nThe "Full X-Factor" option seems to do nothing at all. It certainlky doesn't do what it says it should.\n\nI give this game a 6 out of 10. It is a good game if you want to play with real NFL players, but personally, I have more fun with computer-created players, and this game just destroys that aspect of the game with it's many flaws. It's also a inferior product for the price I paid for it.","April 3, 2015","false","159.8"," 17 of 32 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","17","32","0","3"

Changing to recommending it. I decided to try calling my team's plays each game instead of simulating through them, ie-not participating in the game at all and FOF7 finished in a few seconds for all teams that week. So trying calling the plays makes me enjoy the game a lot more. I become more familiar with my players, their strengths and weakness become more aparent. I also have to strategize which is interesting. Games can be frustrating and rewarding both. The below cons are still a problem, but less so when you're not simulating a year fast. The spread sheets still could be more accessible, moving your mouse over abbreviations so you'd get little tips explaining what the abbreviations mean would be very useful, and locked players not changing when you click recommend positions for all players would be nice.\n\nThe amount of stats are really good to show you how you're team is working out, and to strategize; after each game there's a spreadsheet and then you have one for all your games up until that year. The players attributes work well to explain how they perform in a game so you can strategize about what to plan for your offense and then look at the opposing team to plan for your defense.\n\nCons:\n\n-Navigating is a chore. Its a spreadsheet game. Yet you can't view some spreadsheet windows while others are still open. Want to look at your roster and scroll through recent injuries you've learned about via ingame email? Not happening. Want to compare your roster to what is available in free agency? Can't have them both open at the same time.\n\n-Lots of abbreviations/symbols with no tool tips, you spend a lot of time rereading the manual or watching youtube videos of how to play. Which can be helpful. Crusader Kings II comes to mind, however you're not watching youtube videos of FOF7 for the depth of the game, but just to figure out how to do basic things.\n\n-Everytime a player is injured you have to manually go to the depth chart for the offensive backfield, the offensive line/special teams, or the three defensive sets(goal line, nickle, dime). Or if you let the game automatically set this for you it does it for all players. You can't select players not to be adjusted. So instead you have to go again to eath depth chart mark the ones you do not want to be automatically set by the game, but ONLY when you are click the auto set button for the specific section of the depth chart. No simple depth charts where the next player down moves up.\n\n-Due to the above i'm constantly being told I have too many/too few players active or players missing from the depth chart, so I have to back and figure out what's wrong. over and over and over again.\n\n-Progression of players abilities is not defined. As well some players prgoress higher than any indication, which can be fine, but again no explanation of how this works in game.\n\nThere are more problems. I don't want to type something too long for you to read. I paid the $24.99 and am annoyed and disappointed with this game.","August 24, 2015","true","831.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This experience was always fun, no matter what sport: baseball, football, basketball, hockey, if I could put together a team that would build off the strengths of the various players and experiment to turn that team into a finely-tuned machine, that was my after-school jam.\n\nThis game has been addicting to me.  Unfortunately, I haven't taken many teams past 3 years; my excitement over drafting and re-drafting doesn't allow me to continue through with balancing the team budget, working through the dangerous waters of free agency, or watching the guys I originally drafted leave for greener grasses elsewhere.  But if you're looking for a decent GM-simulator, this is the place to be.\n\nJust don't expect fancy graphics when you simulate the games.  It's not all the way down to a bare-bones text sim, but you're not paying for the graphics if you buy this game.

If you are a fan of american football this is a need in your library. Its pure realism simple as that. After a good bit of time into this game and many seasons I can say i fully recommend this. Whether you want just to sign player and let the ai handle the depth charts for you,Or take every little control over the game from ticket sales,to stadium renovations,to strategy its all in your control. My recommendations for the next version are these (This game has very few faults).\n-College and NFL in 1 D1 colleges,work your way through the gm ladder\n-If no college gm mode,then have college players stats year by year,and awards etc\n-Simplyifyed depth chart option (advanced would be now simplyfied would be something like madden)\n-simplified formation option (same thing as above)\n-Draft class maker,Roster file maker,coach file maker (A simple easy to use tool shipped with the game to make these)\n-Customization! People love there custom leagues and I think this is a need perhaps OOTP style customization?\n-I appreciate and like the simple presentation of the game but it could use some updating\n-Other teams moving cities (is this already in?)","May 30","true","171.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As much as I try to like it (as I love the stats that it generates), here are the problems.\n\nThe interface is from the 90's.  Horrible modal windows that need to be constantly opened and closed to the point of exhaustion.\n\nToo many injuries to the point of being unrealistic.  I've had several seasons completely ruined by having my roster decimated with injuries.  I dread checking the injuries after every game.  I've never seen teams completely wiped out by injuries to that extent in the NFL (to the point where I need to acquire 1 to 2 players each week just to field a freak'n team).  I shouldn't have to tweak the config settings to make injuries realistic.\n\nOne of my best players was "severely depressed" for an entire season and would not play.  I could have cut him if I wanted to pay about a $1 mil. settlement.  I know that kind of stuff happens from time to time for real, but combine that with my six players that are out for 10 weeks with broken arms, feet, clavicles etc. and it gets a little unnerving.\n\nThere is not enough background on players in the draft other than combine scores.  What this means is that the draft is usually a complete crap shoot.  Acquiring new staff members with good scouting ability doesn't seem to change a thing.\n\nI need to draft coaches...give me a break.\n\nI'm required to have a fullback on the roster...give me a break.

This version is really no better than one I played in 2000.  In fact, I think when they actually had the NFL license, the game at least looked better.  The game may have some redeeming qualities, but it's really hampered by the terrible interface which makes trying to do anything a huge pain.

I asked how to edit a few things, like player ratings, rosters, etc. And guess what? The developers deleted my post.\n\nI can put up with sub-par games. BUt what I won't put up with is developers who moderate the Steam discussion boards to the point where they are deleting posts that are conducive to the success of their game.

I'm not even sure what but It lost my attention quickly.\n\nPrice point should have been $2 imo","March 14, 2015","false","10.8"," 3 of 30 people (10%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","10","3","30","0","3"

There's no tutorial, and its a very unfriendly UI. There might be a good game buried beneath it, but I will probably never know. This is coming from somebody who has thousands of hours sunk into grand strategy games which have enormous depth and a sports fan, to whom this game should come somewhat naturally.\n\nSave your money, there are better f2p browser equivilents to this game.\n\nI've bought some pretty big clunkers in the past, but nothing that has dissapointed me quite as much as this title.","February 6, 2015","false","1.2"," 23 of 104 people (22%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","22","23","104","2","7"

The biggest problem is daunting UI in the game. which makes it really hard to find things in the game. but after a while you get used to it.","March 29, 2015","true","10.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

However this simulator is excellent, especially given the fact that it was essentially made by one person. I hope that the GUI can be vastly improved upon in this games next iteration.\n10/10\n\ndo again.","June 2, 2015","true","447.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"
