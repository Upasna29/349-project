"http://steamcommunity.com/id/viatrixa/recommended/410430/","viatrixa","VI -nsanity","http://steamcommunity.com/id/viatrixa/","413 products in account","Not entirely certain what to think here :/ I thought this was going to basically be a horror game played from the viewpoint of a school bully's victim and exploring the pschological suffering and terror that go along with it. Blah blah - fancy words, fancy expectations.\n\nWhat I got was a bizarre mixture of overly loud scream effects, guiding faerie lights, and the Donnie Darko rabbit with a serious case of steroid abuse. I honestly feel that this could have actually been an awesome game with a bit of polishing. But sadly, the only thing this game is, is a hodgepodge attempt at artsyness wrapped in chaotic failure. Cheesey, badly executed and predictable horror effects have been sprinkled to and fro and inbetween the cookie cutter characters: your default ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ bully, your default girl of your dreams, your default creepy creature, your default terrors, your default troubled nerd glasses kid... the list goes on. Oh, and just because: needless lockpick and door opening minigames. IMHO a game can be "wierd and artsy" but if it relies solely on that, the results end up being stale and somewhat cheap, as the story felt extremely flimsy and predictable here.\n\nAnd I feel bad saying all of this, because the idea and the concept of the game are quite neat. One other thing that really really bothered me was the atrocious english translation. One or two little mistakes can easily be ignored, but the game is saturared with bad expressions, faulty grammar, and flimsy translations. English is a difficult language to master - even more so when you're not a native speaker. But there are so, so, SO many people right here on Steam who would have been delighted to proof read it as well as help out with the grammar, spelling and what have you.\n\nBlaaaaaaaargh. Not my cup of tea, for sure. I tried to like it and give it a chance. But I wish the dev good luck in the future!","October 30, 2015","false","0.4"," 134 of 222 people (60%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","60","134","222","10","11"

Until it started making more sense in the end. And I must admit, I'm pretty impressed! An unpredictable game is always a favorite.\n\nI agree the game is broken and needs A LOT of polishing on so many levels, from performance to animation and broken English which made the game pretty dull, but let's not forget this is a work of an independent developer. And for a first project this was quite impressive. So let's not play games for what we expect but for what they have to offer. Because I'm very picky when it comes to graphics and performance yet I was able to enjoy this game which made it very easy for me to ignore its flaws and not many games can do that.\n\nDear Kerim Kumbasar your message touched me and will keep spinning in my head for a while <3","May 25","true","2.3"," 37 of 55 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","37","55","0","0"

After playing it though, I became more interested in trying out the new steam refund policy. This game is absolutely ♥♥♥♥ing nonsense. There are some interesting artistic ideas here but everything about this is just ♥♥♥♥. A 3 year old could've made a better English translation for a game. The gameplay elements are clunky as hell. The story is just the most mindless rubbish on steam. I was worried this game would be hipster jerk off material, wearing its inspirations on its sleeve. I thought it would be incomplete or have bad presentation. It's all that and worse.

The gameplay consists of simply walking around, picking up diary pages and going through cutscenes with a few minigames or puzzles thrown around (lockpicking, making a campfire, opening certain dorrs or, sigh, fishing). Said puzzles and minigames are uninspired at best and can sometimes become annoying due to being set in dimply lit places or requiring you to find small objects in a certain room.\n\nBut the story and pacing are the main culprits here, seldom have I played something so tedious. Dialogues are cliched, slow (no voice acting and there's several seconds between lines) and basically all revolve around the fact that people at school are bad. Even cutscenes suffer from the same problem as they're filled with moments where nothing happens or your attention is drawn for several unnecessary seconds over certain things in the area. Heck even after you finish the game there's a small credits screen and then you're forced to go through several more minutes of cutscenes basically recapping what just happened, why? why would you do that?  The stumbling English just makes things even worse and can sometimes also get in the way of a puzzle (like calling a safety pin "a buckle" or small branches being referred to as "bushes". Even if you discount the aforementioned problems the story is uninteresting at best, leaves no lasting impression and can at times just feel a bit pretentious.\n\nUnless you desperately need to get rid of that insomnia that's been bothering you I can't recommend this one: horror games are a dime a dozen nowadays and Morphine is subpar both in story and gameplay.\n","April 22","false","1.7"," 16 of 24 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","16","24","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/recommended/410430/","Humanure","Belphegore","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/","1597 products in account","Morphine is a (mostly) first person psychedelic horror adventure title that puts you in the shoes of Ted Bundy. No, not THAT Ted Bundy, but it's worth assuming that the protagonist was not given this name perchance. The decision of the name is quite misleading, as Ted Bundy assaulted and murdered women exclusively; the Ted in this game does not. With that said, I feel as though this game is a combination of inspiration taken directly from Donnie Darko, and the Columbine Massacre.\n\nTed is a student in high school, and it quickly becomes clear that he is the victim of what many of us have experienced at one time or another in our lives, bullying. Not only is he bullied by a student named Peter, but Ted's father also deems him to be a failure for not being able to shoot a gun, swim, or fish; you know, the typical "manly" survival aspects of life. The player will relive many of the decisive moments of Ted's life, and will be able to read more into the inner thoughts of the character through journal pages.\n\nMorphine is made in Unity. Now that your skin has finished crawling, I will continue to say that while the game's performance isn't abysmal like many other Unity titles, there are frame drop issues and a lack of any sort of control configure system. However, on a positive note there are no glitches or crashes that deem the game unplayable. It should also be noted here that the original dialogue is in Turkish, and has been poorly translated to English; the amount of grammatical errors to be found are innumerable, and sometimes they lead to confusion of the main plot. However, the way the game performs overall is decent seeing as the entire thing was made by one person.\n\nNow, I've never personally heard of Morphine causing anyone to go insane with rage and kill a bunch of people. I'm not entirely sure why the developer decided to make this the title drug of choice. The plot is weak, and Ted ends almost every single journal entry by saying "I am not a loser!". I understand that this game is based on the emotions that the developer went through during his time in school, and I understand them well; I too was bullied quite a lot. The self-loathing, awkwardness, social distance, and overwhelming depression are emotions all too familiar to me. Although these emotions are mostly conveyed through journal entries, I couldn't help but feel that Ted was an overall weak character. Despite his rage "building" towards the end, he comes off as more of a sad-sack than someone seeking revenge.\n\nAs far as horror titles go, Morphine is just okay. It tries hard in the beginning to scare you, and may even succeed with a few jump scares. However, towards the middle and end of the game, the horror aspect has been left far behind in lieu of the true plot and flashbacks regarding why Ted is reaching his breaking point. The game lasts about 2 hours for one playthrough, and unless you're going back for some achievements I sincerely doubt anyone will go back for a second run. There are far, far better horror titles on Steam; be they indie or otherwise. If you get it in a bundle, cool, otherwise don't waste your time.\n\nRating: 2.0/5.0 - It's not awful, but it's not great.Belphegore's Hell House Reviews (Group)","February 1","false","3.2"," 20 of 35 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","20","35","0","0"

This is digital art and a homage to Donnie Darko (movie). You have to play it till the end to unfold the very emotional and touching story. Yet there are gameplay elements such as: Search for a key to unlock the door, escape the room, jump-scares and you can even shoot. ;-) If thats fine with you, it's a clear recommendation. Thank you Kerim!","October 30, 2015","true","3.8"," 29 of 80 people (36%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","36","29","80","10","0"

It's long approx 1.5 hours, made in Unity engine yet a bit more different with more passion and feelings involved while developing which can be noticed even by casual gamer who played a lot "unity" games.\n\nNot sure are models in game custom made or bought, but atmosphere and concept of the story come before anything else so you dont really pay attention to that.\n\nBasically from story/atmosphere/concept side game is pretty good, really makes you feel different and leave you with hard impression after beating game. Although from technical side there are quite few cons and problems which might get some gamers not to like this title. No voice acting at all, not impressive graphics although I've seen much terrible titles in Unity engine khm khm Rake khm khm. So based on both concept and technical side I would summary this under positive impression.\n\nGame is dark, describing bullied kid and his world through his eyes and unfortunately well-known outcome in most of the situations where same thing happen. There are scary jumps here and there but dont expect regular horror style at all.\n\nAs developer Kerim stated, game is not based on true experiance but its based on true feelings. Were you bullied in school or not I think that you are going to imagine yourself on Peter place while you play this game and its gonna make you think a bit how those kids/persons feel in that kind of situation.\n\nOverall, good job ! Also good pricing and not going crazy since game is longer comparing to some others.\n\nP.S I did recieved couple review copies, but this is completely my thought and impression. I usually record gameplay/short review and I end the game, this time I completed game all the way till end without rushing and I didnt realized that 90 minutes passed. So good job.","October 28, 2015","true","2.6"," 38 of 120 people (32%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","32","38","120","13","0"

The english is not great it but it's not the most important thing. The suspense of the game actually over rides a lot of it's faults making it more enjoyable.\n\nThe only thing I found was that at the end of the game, the names of the lead characters switch over, I think this was a mistake because there isn't any explanation to suggest it was supposed to be that way. I think that's a real shame because otherwise it's a nice game.\n\nIf it gets an update to fix those issues it will be great, but I'd still recommend it either way. Made me jump a few times!","June 6","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
