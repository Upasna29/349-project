The game basically taught me to read as a child.\n\nI've played every iteration of the game to ever release in the US, and this version (the DS version) might by my favorite. The character models do justice to the original sprite designs while also being fresh and charming, though the textures look a bt worse for wear in high resolution. The voice acting is well done and befitting of the revamped script. The handful of new story elements serve the original plot well, and flesh out some things that were only touched upon in the original script.\n\nThe combat is one area where this version (the DS version) of the game shines. While the battles in the original game, and most of the various ports were uninteresting, this one demands a more varied use of tactics and status effects. Gone are the days of being able to mash A to kill bosses. Now you must employ things like Sleep, Slow, and Dark, things that typically haven't ever worked on bosses in the series, to survive.\n\nThis specific version of the game though, being a port of the iOS and Android versions, isn't without new problems. The most glaring issue is the UI. There is no reason the large, ugly UI designed for touch controls should have made the trasition to the PC. There is no reason the UI should take up half of the display during combat, and there is no reason you should have to scroll to see all of your options in battle. Definitely play the game in "Wait Mode," as the need to scroll through your options may get you killed in "Active Mode."\n\nLess of a complaint, and more of a nitpick is that the camera now seems very zoomed in due to the increased resolution, and general size of PC displays. A zoom option would have been nice. Another thing that would have been nice is true analog controls, but I guess this version of the game was never designed with that in mind anyway.\n\nThough I hope (but don't expect) some of my issues will be addressed in a future patch; like the midi soundtrack of FF7's original steam release was, I still recommend this game whole heartedly. In my opinion, Final Fantasy IV is one of the finest JRPGs ever released, and despite the hideous new iOS interface the 3D remake is arguably the definitive version (the PSP version being the other contender).\n\n-P.S. Calling it now, The After Years will appear as DLC in the near future. I do not recommend playing that at all.","September 17, 2014","true","5.3"," 257 of 315 people (82%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","82","257","315","7","25"

It removes one DS feature, a little customizable eidolon named whyt. Whyt sucks anyway.\n\nThe game is good. I will say that. You don't need more then 30 frames to play in this style of game, and the resolution and graphics are pretty decent. The menu's are obviously designed for a phone, but the game plays great with a controller.\n\nThe story is THE BEST of the final fantasies. You will soon forget this is a port or any stupid problems you thought you had. I won't spoil anything but this version adds some unique post game challenges to overcome in the form of some superbosses.\n\nAlso this game is hard as crap. Leveling and grinding isn't as important as smart boss tactics.\n\nThe pricetag is a bit crazy high for a port though. I reccomend grabbing this baby on the upcoming christmas sales, because we know it will be there.","October 25, 2014","true","73.2"," 110 of 125 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","110","125","2","6"

The cast is full of likeable characters, the boss battles (especially on hard mode) are very fun and require far more strategy compared to most FF games, and a full playthrough clocks in at a very reasonable ~25 hours.\n\nIt's worth pointing out, however, that this port is marred by several significant technical issues. This version is a port of the iOS/Android version which itself was a port of the DS version--both of these elements are very, very obvious. The in-battle menus are clearly designed for touchscreens, the character models are extremely low poly with the original DS textures, and battle scenes are locked at 15FPS. If you can manage to overlook these glaring, highly obstructive issues, though, you'll find a wonderful game underneath the surface.\n\nOne aspect that, to me, stands out above the rest is the rebalancing of magic spells. Unlike most FF games, where status ailment spells are close to worthless, there is a use for every single spell in the game. Aside from Cure spells, Slow is perhaps the most important spell in the game! Most bosses will be suspectible to Slow and one or two other status ailments, and each fight becomes a puzzle to determine how to mitigate the boss's most powerful traits and abilities. Once you get to the absolutely punishing (in hard mode, at least) final dungeon, this applies to every random battle as well and forces the player to come up with winning strategies on the spot. Here are some spells that I cast on enemies that were crucial to completing the game: Slow, Stop, Silence, Reflect, Break, Berserk, Bio, Confuse. Seriously, how often do you cast those in FF games?\n\nI only played through on hard mode, and aside from three specific fights it was very well done, striking an excellent balance between challenging and fair. One early fight, Mom Bomb, took me more tries than any other fight in the game, including the final boss; it was an absurd early spike in difficulty that felt completely out of place. Dr Lugae relied partially on chance to beat, due to the confluence of his randomly cast Reversal Field ability and cast timers for your party. Finally, while the rest of the game required no grinding whatsoever, the final boss was actually 100% impossible to beat without gaining about 3-4 extra levels at the end, and even then it was reliant upon perfect execution of a very specific strategy. I know it's the last boss of hard mode, but they took it just a lil bit too far!\n\nThis is just nitpicking, though, as it's worth reiterating that the entirety of the rest of the game was very well-crafted and well-balanced--just don't feel bad or get disheartened if you get stuck on those same fights. Just like most FF games, you'll always be at an appropriate level as long as you just fight whatever battles that pop up as you explore dungeons, no need to go out of your way to grind. If you mess up and die on a fight, you can hit Continue and it'll bring you right back to where you were, so no worries about losing progress. Cutscenes are skippable, summon animations are skippable, and there's a Quicksave option in addition to save points. Sadly, random battles still exist, and that admittedly will be a deal breaker for many.\n\nTechnical issues aside, this is a textbook example of how to remake a game: keep the basic framework (plot, designs, etc), and update the gameplay in a way that provides a new challenge while feeling very familiar. In a word, this is a game that is respectful: of the original developers, of the source material, and of players both new and old. With the caveat that this is a poor port of an excellent game, I highly recommend it (and play it in hard mode!).","August 9, 2015","true","35.4"," 70 of 77 people (91%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","91","70","77","5","1"

Non-battle gameplay is locked at 30 fps. Battle's are locked at 15 fps. This is because the PC version is based on the Android port that is based on the DS port. Kind of like an emulation. The 15 fps isn't too debilitating given this is a turn based game but there is noticable input lag that can be annoying and the animation looks stiff.\n\n2. I tested resolutions from 1920 x 1080 all the way down to 800 x 600 and you really don't notice much of a difference in game. The textures up close (usually during cutscenes) look terrible and neither an increase nor a decrease in resolution seemed to help much at all. 1080p DOES however make the excellent FMV's look even more stunning. Seriously, those are friggin beautiful.\n\n3. The game itself has really hooked me so far. Cecil is way more interesting then any other protaganist I have played as in quite some time. Really makes you wonder how SE could have screwed up so badly with the more recent iterations of Final Fantasy. For some reason, I never got around to playing this even though I've played every other FF that's come stateside and am really glad I picked this one up.\n\nAs I have not played any other version of this game I can't give a good comparison review to other versions. The good is the game itself is great and looks pretty great most of the time. I enjoy the story and despite the 15 fps lock in battle after you get used to it it's not a big deal HOWEVER, If you port a game to PC it's pretty inexcusable to lock framerates so low. As PC gamers, we want to play the game as silky smooth as possible and I can understand why people are upset about this. Hopefully someone can mod this quickly.\n\nAll in all, I'm glad I purchased this game. I can finally play the FF most people praise as the best one ever made. So far, this game really delivers and I'm having a-lot of fun. Take care all I will update my review if I have any further info or thoughts on the game as I continue playing.

It's probably up there in terms of games I've spent the most time with.  Twenty-two years, and I generally find time to play through one of its multitudes of ports and remakes every year or so.  It's a remarkably well designed RPG and for what it lacks in freewheeling customizability it makes up for in perfect pacing and balance,\n\nThis is a port of the Android version.  Actually, from what I've been reading here, it's an EMULATION of the Android version, for a double lazy point multiplier (lazy points can be redeemed for valuable prizes but eh too much work).  The Android version is a port of the Nintendo DS version, which was excellent, though pushing against the limits of that system.  This remake was designed as something of a love letter to long-time FF4 fans, that showed a deep understanding of the original game.  Difficult encounters and bosses were tweaked to be much harder, and their stats and scripts were cleverly turned around to make the old, well-worn tactics ineffective - yet every boss now has a trick to it, and it's immensely satisfying to discover those tricks.\n\nPlus the graphics are really cute (all y'all boneheads who think this game should look like FFXV or whatever are smokin' some loco weed), and the cutscenes are really well done - almost exactly like I envisioned the scenes of the game in my head as a child.\n\nThe Android (and iOS) versions were basically just the DS Version, but in a higher resolution with uglier interface assets and the utterly mediocre system font.  While most of the game runs at a smooth framerate, as it should since it's not exactly pushing the limits of the hardware, the battle scenes are jarringly choppy.  Initially when I played the Android version I was thinking that they must not have optimized the game very well - but no, it's completely intentional, framelocked at roughly 10-15 FPS.  This is probably due to Japanese developers still coding like its their glory days on the PS2, like so many Al Bundys dreaming wistfully about those four touchdowns in a single game in high school.  All the animation is most likely keyed to that irritatingly low framerate, and bumping it up will either make the animation look really bad or play it way too fast.\n\nSo yeah, the PC version is that version.  Unless they (or hopefully some intrepid modder) fixes how choppy the battle scenes are (and how dull the interface/font is), don't bother.  There are way too many other versions of FF4, all of which you can play on your PC somewhat less legally, but it's hard to feel bad when Squeenix can't even put in a cursory effort to give us a good experience.","September 18, 2014","false","62.1"," 309 of 478 people (65%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","65","309","478","10","7"

Final Fantasy IV, perhaps the most cherished game of my childhood, now feels as fresh as anything else in modern gaming. For newcomers to the series, this is an excellent point of entry that showcases traditional Japanese RPG gameplay with one of the best stories ever told in the genre.\n\nFinal Fantasy IV is about a hero saving the world from pure evil. Beyond that reductive outline, the game's plot is actually unusual, even by today's standards. Cecil, the protagonist, begins the game as an intimidating Dark Knight who is sent to murder innocent people and steal their valuable crystal. After the deed is done, he begins to question his loyalty to the king, due to the wickedness of these orders. Your first task as a player is to deliver a package that, unknown to Cecil, is a weapon designed to murder an entire village of summoners. At a pivotal moment in the story, Cecil undergoes a dramatic transformation and plays like a completely different character from that point forward. Throughout the game, characters will enter and leave your party at the story's whim. Some of them will turn against you; others will sacrifice themselves for your cause and never return. Clearly, this is serious material, and it's told through a new translation with a more consistent tone and some additional details that were lost in the SNES version. There is also a small amount of voice acting of admirable quality, though some of the actors don't quite match the gravity of the plot.\n\nGameplay\n==========\nA complex plot demands linearity of game progression, and there is no doubt that Final Fantasy IV is a linear game. It's like a roller coaster...a very slow roller coaster, and you're strapped in for the ride. Your party can include up to five characters at a time, but you have no choice as to the lineup, and every playable character has unique abilities. Although restrictive, this format keeps the gameplay fresh throughout a very long adventure. Your party changes every few hours of game time, so you have to develop new battle strategies on a regular basis. A feature in the Steam and DS versions allow you to collect Augments when some characters leave your party; these items let you teach the departed character's unique abilities to other characters. This feature is made more interesting by the fact that these versions also includes a lot more unique abilities for each character.\n\nSome abilities, like Edward's songs, are much more useful now and continue to grow and flourish via Augments long after the original practitioner has retired from the party. There is even a customizable Auto-Battle feature in which you can assign specific skills or magic spells to be used automatically in battle, for when you are facing easier monsters that don't require your full attention. These and other gameplay tweaks will not only delight long-time fans of the game but also make it more accessible and streamlined for new players.\n\nGraphics\n==========\nThe presentation has been overhauled far more dramatically than the gameplay. An impressive engine by Matrix Software provides some great 3D graphics. The visuals are not only easy on the eyes but also allow some of the more dramatic scenes in the game to be played out with full cinematography. Being so familiar with the original graphics, I enjoyed seeing the new 3D models for all the characters and locations, and most of them look great while staying faithful to the original designs.\n\nSound and Music\n==========\nThe classic soundtrack has been re-recorded with higher quality instruments, but the compositions themselves are untouched, so every song will be immediately recognizable to veteran players. Composed by Nobuo Uematsu, Final Fantasy IV has a ton of great tracks that match up well with what you encounter in game, and definitely get you pumped for boss battles! Just check these out:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MT1X5RZ3HY\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqGXfDpjZA\n\nPerformance\n==========\nPC specs are on my profile. This game ran beautifully. I didn't run into any issues, bugs, glitches, or weird crashes. I played with a controller that worked just fine the entire playthrough. No tweaking had to be made for it to work.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n==========\nFinal Fantasy IV is one of those classic games that nearly everyone should play at some point. It was an unparalleled experience in the early 90s and holds up remarkably well today. If you have never played Final Fantasy IV or haven't touched it since it was called Final Fantasy II for Super Nintendo, this is absolutely worth experiencing all over again. My only problem with this Steam version is that it is not the Final Fantasy IV Complete Collection that was released on PSP, that included FF4, Interlude, and The After Years.\n\nGameplay Demo\n==========\nhttps://youtu.be/k54UluMX-K8\n\nNerd House Verdict:\n==========\nHighly Recommended\n\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","January 9","true","125.5"," 51 of 63 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","51","63","2","6"

Personally, I think FFIV is one of the best FF games ever, definitely in my Top 3. It introduced the first complete and in depth story to the franchise and had one of the best soundtracks in video game history. Here are my pros and cons for the remake:\n\nPros:\n\n+ The GFX are great for a remake, definitely worthy of any FF fan to make them want to play through the game again\n+ In game cut scenes and small facial expressions are an added treat\n+ Voice acting is not bad, I was actually shocked that there was voice acting in this game and it's not terrible\n+ Ability to skip cut scenes, which is great so if you're stuck and keep dying, you don't have to keep watching them\n+ Each weapon in the game has its own unique look, so not all weapons look the same when equipped, same goesf or shields\n+ Summons look AMAZING!\n+ The remastered music is great, it's what kept me playing until I beat the game\n+ When the game is completed, there is a type of "New Game +" feature where you can play the game again with all items/equipment\n\nCons:\n\n- Rare bugs during voice dialogue where one sentence may overlap another\n- There are some parts in the game, that I felt, deserved cut scenes\n- There is an in ability to move the "Switch Rows" selection during combat, too many times I accidentally selected to switch rows when I thought I was selecting Item. I would much rather prefer it being either a different button or just hit right on the battle menu screen to select(which I believe the original SNES version was like that)\n- When defeating certain bosses or if something important happens, you can collect "Augments" which gives you an additional menu selection in battles(for example, you can use bardsong and not be Edward). Only down side is, you have to pick them up(they will sparkle on the screen). I missed too many because I didn't know there was some to pick up or it was placed somewhere that I couldn't even notice it. Would be better if you just got them automatically.\n\nOverall, play this game. Whether you are a die hard fan or just getting into Final Fantasy, this is definitely worth picking up.","December 31, 2014","true","37.1"," 31 of 33 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","31","33","0","0"

A great story, solid voice acting (in the cutscenes where it's included), decent combat (auto-combat is a godsend), but it's got severe technical flaws because it's a port of an Android port of a Nintendo DS remake. The maps and music and battles are done faithfully as far as I can tell, but the graphics suffer; low resolution textures, framerate caps of 30 in everything but the battles, which are a brutal 15 fps, and clunky controls make for a flawed experience. Still, it's one of the most underrated stories in Final Fantasy with some unforgettable moments and while it's slightly cheesy in spots a lot of the characters are endearing and memorable. All that being said I find Square Enix's lack of respect for PC ports a bit disturbing. This is my second Steam Final Fantasy and both have significant flaws. The PC audience deserves a higher quality product. While I plan on getting more, none of them are worth buying at full price, these are wait-for-the-sale games for sure.","February 24, 2015","true","14.0"," 32 of 35 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","32","35","0","2"

Bosses have counters and special abilites, so you can't just use old strategies, or mash while while your white mage heals. It feels rewarding winning after taking things slow in the beginning of the battle to ensure you understand the enemy\n+Addition of Hard Mode gives it replayability and a reason to replay the game for achievements\n+Exploring an entire map in a dungeon/cave rewards you with items\n+Dungeon map exposes treasure chests once you've come close enough to them. It may ruin exploration for most people, but those who have played games 1-4 in order you'll agree how annoying it was hitting a dead end with every other step causing a random encounter\n+Augment, special character abilities, allows you to customize your character even further. Took me awhile to figure out how to add them on, but after I did they were really helpful.\n\nCons\n-No cursor memorization, and with the timed battle system it can be a hassle to find the spell you need if you didn't manage your abilities well enough or set to active\n-Story characters leave too often, but that's just an annoyance to me after all the grinding\n-Because of the timed battle system you can't go back and fix mistakes if you select an incorrect move\n-FPS is locked at 30FPS, in-battle it drops to 15. Isn't that much of an inconveinence, but a small majority would cry "but muh FPS!"\n-You'll need a third-party program to scale the game, since changing the resolution doesn't help much\n-Higher level spells require longer casting times. A nice realistic feature, but can be time consuming having to wait to one-shot enemies when you're grinding or trying to get to an important point quickly\n-For a short amount of the game you have a red mage who is locked at 90 MP because of plot and it can be a hassle managing its MP when getting to several bosses\n-Don't know if it's the game or my 360 controller but the controls will randomly keep pushing themslves after long periods of play. Other people have said this was an issue in the forums, but I think it's a small group of people.\n\nOverall, not too bad. Not sure why people just dislike the game because Squeenix decided to port the game from another port. And sure, making a quick buck on a really old game should upset people, but at least Squeenix knows there's still a market for JRPGs. Story's very old so it's become predictable, but it's a very traditional JRPG so it shouldn't bother most fans. Cecil is also one of my favorite characters in the Fantasy series. The animations are great, and the voice acting is a surprise addition. I really want to play this in Big Picture mode on my big tv, because it looks great, but I don't have any speakers and it'll be a hassle moving my computer. Maybe I should get a Steam Machine...I rate it 6/8. Please no h8. I don't want to deb8 about it either.

Confused? Don't worry about it, lets just focus on this game.\nThis version is a "enhanced" port of the DS port of this game.

The move to the 3D engine is fine but it creates certain problems. When you are wandering around it creates an almost "zoomed in"  feeling when navigating dungeons and towns. This issue may be the result of me playing the original version in my youth and it not feeling quite right. This most likely is not a problem at all if you are a younger gamer. The Other slight issue is the pixelization of the characters during close ups when there is cutscenes happening, the characters become quite ugly looking.\n\nSound/Music\n\nThey pretty much nailed this. Music is a very big deal in all the Final Fantasy's, and the music made a massive jump in quality and scope from part III to IV back in the day. They did a fanatastic job in maintaining the quality of the original score. The sound/music for this port is very good, and if you played the original you'll find yourself humming along as you remember the songs.\n\nStory\n\nThe story is very linear but gives you the illusion of not being linear in certain parts of the game. The overall narrative is very good and it's mostly always clear on what you need to do. The Story itself is actually not that bad and holds up pretty good even by today's standards. The cast of characters are interesting and each have their own motivations and agendas which helps you actually care about the heroes. Also this port they added voice actors for certain parts of the story, when I first heard this I felt that sense of dread " oh man how corny is this going to be?". I'm actually very pleasantly surprised by the quality of the voice acting for the most part, I found Rydia's character to be weaker than the others but it's not that big of a deal.\n\nGameplay\n\nThis game assigns classes for your characters you will not change jobs (well except for ONE character!) and you do not make your own characters. Also characters come and go from your 5 man party as you work through the story. The battles take place in a side view using a "Active Time Battle" system. This basically means that while you are making a decision on what your characters do the monsters will attack you. There is a way to change the speed of the battles and even a choice to put it in a "wait" mode during battle. Meaning the monsters may still act while you decide but they will not get more than one turn while you decide.\nSince i'm on battles I will bring up the fact that for some reason the game defaults to 15 Frames per second  during battles. Its actually quite distracting and jarring especially as you are exploring a cave at 30fps when all of a sudden you find yourself looking at a choppy mess for a battle. The first time it happened I actually thought that something was wrong with my game, I  turned it off and went online to find out what was wrong that's how I found out this was on purpose! I did find a fix that makes the battles run at 25fps which improved it quite a bit. I won't post it here but if you google "Final Fantasy 4 PC fps fix" you will find it. I will be honest I'm not sure if I would have finished this game if I didn't find this fix.\n\nThe other strange thing is the ability to use items (like 'rod') during battles. In the original game you just selected Item and scrolled to the weapon you wanted to use and it would cast a spell. This version you need to select the item under the abilities menu OUTSIDE of battle to put said item in your options list during battles. After about halfway through the game it really doesn't matter as you won't be using weapons as item commands anyway.\n\nThere is an Augment system they added as well where you get to customize the characters with different abilities and traits, i'm kind of mixed on this because I would feel pretty upset if I wasted a good Augment on a character that left your party never to go back in. It didnt effect me because I've played this game so many times over the years that I know the story pretty much by heart and incidently I know who the final 5 characters in your party are so I could place the Augments accordingly. As a new player I would have no idea which characters are in the final part. However, we live in the internet age and it's easy to mitigate this.\n\nOverall I recommend this game it is a good JRPG but there are flaws.\n\n7/10","March 31","true","26.6"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","17","18","0","2"

The story remains unchanged albeit with some previously missing script worked back in, as well as a few new welcome additions to the gameplay mechanics, this makes it feel fresh to those who have played through the original. An example of a new mechanic is the Augment System, this system allows for certain character-only abilities to be transferred to other characters who did not have them in the original and previous re-releases of Final Fantasy IV.\n\nOverall Final Fantasy IV is a masterpiece in it's genre (for me it just falls short of Final Fantasy VI) and well worth the 20+ hours you will more than likely invest into this game. With full HD resolution support and achievements this is most definately the definitive version.\nIf you're a fan of JRPG's or have never played the earlier entries in the Final Fantasy series, now is the time! 10/10","September 18, 2014","true","22.9"," 36 of 53 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","36","53","0","1"

So many technical issues. Little strong points.\n- The common complaint. 15 FPS battles. It looks terrible even though I got used to it pretty quick. Or maybe some of the other negatives made this point seem a lot more irrelevant.\n\nThe game encourages you to play on active mode (Where time keeps going even when you're selecting spells) if you're an advanced player but navigating the menu is terrible because of 2 things.\n- The UI is terrible. When you're in battle and you're selecting commands, spells or anything. You gotta be careful you don't 'Kill an enemy' or 'Summon something' or you'll get sent back to the attack command.\n- Input delay, Selecting spells is a chore. You can't quick select  because you have to go through this 15 FPS half a second input delay nonsense to get to the spell. And when you finally do get it. Be careful someone didn't kill an enemy (see previous point)  or you get to do it all over again.\n\nGameplay wise...\n- Spells take charging and then do as much damage in the same time than 2 physical attacks would. The game seems to encourage mindless ''standard attack'' command spam.   In the SNES version the backrow in FF4 is terrible right? Everything misses and does so little damage. In this game the backrow mages do about 1/3rd of the front row damage. Consistently as misses are pretty uncommon. There is hardly any point to using spells other than during boss battles or strong random enemies.  (Luckily for the game the first 1/3 is heavily mage-oriented.)\n- I ended up playing with the highest speed and wait mode. Yet battles still took forever. It seems like everything that happened just happened so much more slower. This combined with the fact that the best way to get through random encounters is spamming the stock attack command made random encounters feel extra tedious.\nBut does it stimulate your senses?\n- There is little to no animation to getting hit. There's this huge buildup to the sage using the ultimate black magic. So powerful he's expecting it to take his life! Oh man he's about to do it!  And then a handful of boring little lowres fireballs fall down.\n+ They did well recreating the music without the SNES soundfont.\n+ The cutscenes are pretty nice. This is coming from someone that really doesn't like voices in places where it does not belong. Which I thought was the case for FF4, but the game has proven me otherwise.\n+ Seeing the thoughts of the people in your parties when opening menu was the best thing in this entire game.\n+/- The map system is pretty nice. Exploring is rewarded with usually pretty useful but not game-changing items and leaves you satisfied after exploring.  But completing maps takes exploring, which takes steps, which takes risk of having irrelevant random SLOW encounters.","September 22, 2015","false","23.8"," 55 of 87 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","55","87","0","0"

And by harder I mean they spam annoying status effects on you.

No I haven't beaten the PC version. But I have beaten the DS version which is what this is.\n\nFirst off, my bias - Final Fantasy IV has, is, and always will be my all time favorite of the series. The characters are great and develop well over the course of the game - the intrigue feels "Real" and not "Forced" like in other later games in the series (I'm looking at you. VII.) The music is well done and honestly I recognize a lot of the remixes from the "Celtic Moon" album I bought WAAAAAY back in the day. Very cool. There's extra content in this version of the game that certainly makes it worth another playthrough - the graphics are slightly dated looking but if that's your primary complaint I feel like you're barking up the wrong tree - great graphics do not a great game make.\n\nThe game runs flawlessly on my PC, and my gamepad works fine with it. The achievements are fun to see pop up as I never thought in a million years I'd have achievements in my FFIV. I know it's superficial and pointless? But it's pretty fun regardless.\n\nThe translation is great. Miles ahead of the flimsy Ted Woolsey translation of the early 90's. Focusing on more of that "Proper Fantasy English" we've come to love in recent years (Remember the Final Fantasy Tactics remake on PSP, or even XII's stock translation? ♥♥♥♥ made it much more epic.) And of course they keep a bit of fanservice in there for the old fans. (You spoony bard!)\n\nFor me, this release is extra special. As I had to give up my DS and couldn't even play the mobile version due to my eyes worsening and being unable to focus on tiny screens. So if anything, I thank Square-Enix for bringing these updated classics to the big screen so I can finally enjoy them again without causing myself pain.\n\nI recommend this for any fan of retro gaming, Japanese RPGs, Final Fantasy, and just plain great storytelling.\n\n9/10 (I gotta knock off 1 point because I hate Square's always online thing they've been pulling)","November 11, 2014","true","8.2"," 19 of 26 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","19","26","0","0"

It looks, purely from a technological point of view, inferior to even PSX titles (specifically FF7) and the camera during the travel segments is zoomed in so far, moving by minimap is basically essential.\nDramatic frame drops during combat certainly did not help matters, resulting in the sluggish interface handling I've come to know with the GBA port. Not a killer, but I certainly would have appreciated a little more finesse.\n\nIn terms of audio, the game sounds convincingly like FF4. Nobuo Uematsu's masterful soundtrack has been slightly upgraded, but not completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ized (as has sadly been the case with FF8, another favorite of mine).\nOnce again however, technologically, there is a bit of a letdown to be found.\nRather than presenting us with proper volume adjustment, FF4 seems to think 4 levels of audio, for Music, SFX and Voices respectively, are plenty.\nThis becomes especially grating when one considers that older FF titles implemented a substantial amount of grinding.\n\nThe gameplay itself is a slightly overhauled FF4 incarnation, with a lot of fresh air and solid functionality added to classic and beloved abilities.\nMore than anything, the updates this version has made to Edward have elevated him from a distracting nuisance, to a legitimate party member, even if he is never along for extended periods of time.\nThe maps have been revised to accomodate the minimap exploration and are thus much smaller, something I actually hate a lot less than I thought I would.\n\nAt last, the bosses have all learned new tricks and it is now possible to fail them. Initially a good thing, this unfortunately introduces the Shin Megami Tensei issue of having to play the bosses way far too often.\nThe very first elemental fiend for example, is a serious problem when tackled conventionally, but an absolute pushover if spammed with healing magic. Clumsy.\nThis sort of thing continues throughout larger parts of the game, but it never becomes offensive - it merely works its way up to annoying.\n\nAs far as the voice acting is concerned, I can once again not speak objectively on the choice of actors.\nIn my head, over 20-ish years, the characters sounded quite differently. This is not a problem the game can be expected to tackle or even regard, so it would be unfair to fault it for not doing so.\nTechnically, as in whether the actors were good or bad actors, I can not find much fault in FF4. Some lines sound a bit awkward, but it remains within the borders of realism. Some of us simply sound weird, after we've had a cry.\n\nAs a final point, people praise this port for having an increased difficulty.\nSpeaking as someone who could not possibly care less for "Hard Mode" bragging rights, I have played it on normal and it is indeed tricky at times.\nLike most poor quality difficulty mods for games however, the difficulty starts off rock hard and rapidly declines, as the characters build a cushion of Abilities to use in battle.\nIf you are planning to buy this for the increased difficulty, you are essentially buying it for the first two hours plus the occassional "Alright, what do you want me to do?" boss fight.\n\nFinal Fantasy IV (PC) is a solid game, all things considered. It is far from perfect.\nI sincerely recommend looking it up on YouTube before buying it, if you love the classic incarnations. Depending on your individual taste, the new features might make or break it for you.","October 27, 2014","true","10.1"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","0"

There are a few good things, so might as well start with them.\n\nPro: The music is just as great as ever, and transition work from the 2d originals to the 3d environments seems to be pretty decently done. Inclusion of a Hard Mode is quite nice.\n\nCon: Almost everything about the presentation. I don't think that more than a few that worked on this version cared about the original. What it really comes down to is the change of presentation. They removed important scenes and added new ones that don't matter. For example, at the start of the game, Cecil invades Mysidia. In the original, there is dialog with your character being begged to not take the crystal and there is hitting of old men and wizards. This version has a few quickly shown sepia-toned still images of what should have been that scene and then they tried to fix the impressions of what happened with dialog. Aside from things like that, they seem to want to have the dialog be an inpersonation of olde english in a soap opera form. They go out of their way to tell you what the characters are thinking and the cutscenes are really ham-fisted.\n\nI am honestly happy there isn't a FF6 version made like this. I might have to find something to burn if they did the Opera scene. There isn't, is there? I don't want to look.\n\nOverall: If you want to enjoy this game correctly, get the original through some other means. I want to enjoy this game, but even from the perspective of some one that hasn't played the original, aside from a few areas, there isn't nearly as much charm or quality.","January 1, 2015","false","4.9"," 105 of 186 people (56%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","56","105","186","5","6"

The following "review" are just my thoughts and observations.\n\nFirstly this isn't a new edition of the game exclusive to steam. This is a port of the Smart Device version of the game which itself is a port of the Nintendo DS remake. There are differences between  this versionl the Original SNES and the GBA remakes. One notable difference is the Augment system.  The way this system works is to "Augment" the party characters with abilities that can be used activley (i.e. Darkness) or as a passive effect (i.e. Auto-Potion). The way you obtain "most" augments is through party members, should a part memeber have had an augment used on them and leave the party permantley they will give up to three augments based on their abilities depending on how many they recieved.\n\nSecondly I have to point out the graphics. The graphics are by no means bad but it is apparent that it was designed for devices with low graphical and processing power. The Textures on the character models all appear pixely on 1080P resolution. On lower resolutions this may not be as much of an issue but it should be noted none the less\n\nI have nothing else that I can comment on. There is not much i can fault FFIV on and I hope that my review has helped","February 7, 2015","true","0.7"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","3"

I really enjoyed the new translation, as it gave much more depth to the story.  The voice acting in the cut scenes could have been better, but it wasn't too painful to listen to.  The hard difficulty setting can have some pretty unfair fights, which leads to a lot of grinding.  Overall, I was very happy that I played through this updated version of the game.  I would say that if you're a fan of the SNES era of JRPGs, this game is well worth the 15 dollars I paid for it.","October 18, 2014","true","33.0"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

FF4 feels like a classic to me, the overarching storyline is simple but gains more depth as the game progresses, the characters are balanced and the gameplay is satisfying.\n\nFirstly, this is a game with a heart. Each character has their own development related to the overall plot and you really get to know everyone's story. Cecil is great as the protagonist, his calm and yet conflicted character is a rock for the cast, balancing out more fiery characters such as Cid and Edge. The bubbly Rydia, motherly Rosa, romantic Edward and strong willed Yang round up a solid group to follow.\n\nThe gameplay is old school RPG style active time based battle, encounters are dictated randomly on the world maps and each character has their own wait bar before performing an action. There are also plenty of weapons, armour and items to collect throughout the game and I ended up using a walkthrough to find all the best ones since they can be difficult to obtain alone (mainly because many required long unrelated side quests).\n\nThe music is always appopriate and some of the themes such as the Lunar Whale's has a very epic feel to it. Also the opening cutscene is beautiful despite the boxy graphics you experince in game (this is meant to be a remake but I got used to the graphics in the end. It looks so awkward when they zoom in on someone's pixelated face though).\n\nOverall, I enjoyed FF4 a lot and would recommend to anyone looking for a solid RPG to immerse themselves in.","July 8, 2015","true","78.1"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

However, as with what seems like all of the Steam FF games, the SE menus are annoying and the port is quite lazy.\n\nBattles are frame rate capped to 15 fps and normal gameplay to 30 fps. The game also has some features of past games missing.\n\nOverall the 3D models and cinematography are a great fresh coat of paint for this classic installment, but there are much better versions of FFIV out there (most notably the superb PSP version).  The steam port of FFIV is a satisfactory version of a game that all JRPG fans should enjoy at some point. However, there are better versions available  that can be recommended over this one to those who have the options available.","January 23","true","29.7"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","9","12","2","0"

Bosses are challenging but fair (for the majority of the game) and mechanics don't get recycled from boss to boss. Story was solid from start to finish and holds up pretty well for a game of its age.

FF4 is one of my all-time favorite games and it’s really rather sad how badly it’s been butchered in this remake.\n\nThe game has been remade 3D. Not good 3D mind you but rather with terrible, ultra low polygon models using ultra low resolution, pixelated textures. The clean 2D pixel art of the original quite frankly was a whole lot better.\n\nWhile I could get over the 3D by itself, what makes it extra terrible in this game is the camera. While they have nearly exactly recreated all of the maps tile by tile and even added a map system, the camera is zoomed in so far you basically have to have the map up the entire time to see where the hell you’re going at any given time, even in town. The original let you see 6 tiles in front of you and 7 tiles in the other directions. In this one you can see only 2 tiles in front of you and 3 in other directions, leaving so little viewable area you really can never see enough to tell where to go without the map.\n\nFinally there’s the UI. They basically just took the mobile remake’s touch UI and did absolutely no work what so ever to rework it for PC where the vast majority of people are going to be using a gamepad (like they would be using with the original). The original combat command list held up to 5 commands with the Defend and Row commands available by pressing left or right. Here they just left the touch UI, which only holds 3 commands, and the Defend and Row commands have just been added to the bottom, forcing you to constantly scroll through a list that should be able to be seen on the screen all at once. Even the main field menu has to be scrolled to see all of its items as the UI hasn’t been sized down at all from its mobile version.\n\nJust unforgivable, especially from a company such as Square Enix that has the resources to devote to making it right. This game is a total cash grab with no regard to their fan base.\n\n-Playtime-\nAbout like the original, expect a good 25-35 hours on the first play through with completing all optional content.\n\n-Achievements-\nUtterly terrible. While there are achievements for completing the game on Hard Mode (which I didn’t really find to be all that much different than normal) and the two optional super bosses that weren’t in the original game, getting 100% is a total grind. To start you have complete the entire game again in the New Game+ which doesn’t offer anything new. Then comes the utterly terrible part, there are 11 different items that have to be farmed that have an abysmal 1/256 drop rate. I ended up setting up a macro and leaving the game overnight, on multiple nights, to farm most these. These achievements are a completely artificial way of bloating the games already very long playtime. They weren’t fun, they weren’t challenging, they were just irritating.\n\nNot recommend.","April 17","false","122.7"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","2"

Before you moan and groan about how this is another "ported from mobile" edition, there's a few glaring differences esp. when controls are involved. The cutscenes are automated where there's no "press for next dialog", and if you are uninterested, you can SKIP THEM. Also, the cutscenes are voiced, which is a surprise to me, being a player of the original SNES edition (FF2US). If you are getting plastered by hardtype editions, Easytype makes a small comeback -- choose Normal as your difficulty.\n\nEverything is rendered as 3D as most can be, but it is still a decidedly 2D enviroment, excluding some buildings. And odd class-specific abilities (like Edward's Healing) are introduced to you as Augments, where you can use the specific Healing ability to dish potions to the whole group. But there's more Augments to be found.\n\nAnd finally, you can automate the battle. For small skirmishes, you can set commands for your party members that they will use automatically, and then just throw battles on autopilot with the press of a button. However, should your battle become dire, it is easily turned off with the same button, allowing you to regain control of your party members.\n\nI was going to initially say "Oh, a boring phone port", but there's something about FF4's 3D transition and portability that has been done right. You can get party member's thoughts on their current plotline position by opening the menu as that character. What Cecil would think in one spot, would be a different thought to, say, Rosa.\n\nAnd if you've never played the SNES, GBA or PS1 versions before, now would be a great time to find out what makes FF4 so fantastic.\n\nRatings are from 1-10:\nStory: 9. There's no notable flaws that keep you from enjoying the plotline. The voiceovers will throw you off a bit, but still true to the plot, and they only happen during automated cutscenes.\nGameplay: 9. A redeveloped controller system for what would be a mobile port makes command accessability somewhat easy.\nSound: 8. A little grainy with the SFX, but the music more than makes up for it. Fantastic.\nGraphics: 7. Mind you, the textures are again from the mobile port, but that's nothing bad considering the details. It looks great.\n\nScore: 8/10\nDefinitely worth the money?

For those that have played through Final Fantasy IV multiple times in the past, hard mode offers a new and fresh way to enjoy the story, forcing you to think logically and strategically in every single battle.\nFor the new player, the game offers a charming story and superb, if slightly retro soundtrack, and even the occasional voice acting is decent and commendable. And even if you complete the game once, there are reasons to play again and again, such as the addition of hard mode.\nThe only downsides in my opinion are the lack of any updated graphics at all, and the lack of the post-game content that the PSP & GBA versions offered.","January 25, 2015","true","31.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

With a timeless story of betrayal, revenge, and redemption, a large case of unique, well developed characters and a solid, challenging battle, not much else can be said about the game itself. However, the technical aspects of this port might leave a few people wanting a bit more.\n\nI will start by saying that I played this game 100% with the Steam Controller in Big Picture Mode and experienced zero issues. The game saved, auto-saved, and continued without issue. The default settings were perfect, at 1080 on my television and 1680x1050 on my monitor. It just picked my max resolution and fullscreened it automatically.\n\nThe game looks rough, but that's because it is a port of not only a mobile game, but also the DS version of a 25 year old Super Nintendo title, so it's nothing super demanding and can easily be run on even very low end PCs.\n\nOverall, I recommend this game.

I completed on hard mode last night.  Without getting into where this ranks in the FF series (near the top!) - I originally played on the SNES, so this version was very different than the SNES version.\n\n1) Story - Character driven story.  It was nice to see proper translations, which actually made the story stronger than I remember.  But, the 3d animations take away from those 2d sprite emotes that I grew up loving.\n\n2) Battle - Fighting is a key component of jrpgs and the leveling grind was excessive at a few points.  I don't recall this on the SNES version, but this version seems to have a few boss battles where you literally get 1 shot if you haven't reached a certain level threshold.  This is bad design.  I got stuck on the CPU battle in the Giant of Babil due to the 1 shot laser barrage mechanic, where I had to spend a few hours grinding up my levels by the save point/moogle sales npc.\n\n3) Abilities - The SNES version did not have certain abilities, such as Rosa's Pray.  This is a great addition!  It adds some class distinction and play options that can be fun and awesome!\n\n4) Augments - Another addition that I knew nothing about.  After reading the forums and figuring out some augment combos, the hard mode of this game became instantly easy.  Learn about augments prior to starting the game!\n\nOverall - 9/10.  I want to give this a perfect score because of nostalgia and great story/fun gameplay, but the truth is that the ds/phone version of this game are not vast improvements over the 2d version.  The game itself is amazing, but there was no reason to release the 3d animations over the original 2d.\n\nRegardless, this game is worth buying and playing.  Even if you wait for a sale, take the time to play through one of the best jrpgs ever made.","October 10, 2014","true","34.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Even the graphic remained the same: low-poly models, small-res pixelated textures with no filtering (on the last point: why, Square Enix? Why You didn't added at least a bilinear filtering?). So, don't expect an HD-remake, with tessellated models, tons of normal/parallax mapping and HDR.\n\nThe story remained the same, plus or minus.

I believe FF6 is the total package but 4 tells a great story and has amazing characters, music and art design.\n\nMy only gripe about this game is that it's basically a tutorial up until the 90% mark... The game is on auto-mode because of the perfect pacing. You never really have to grind out more than 5 levels to conquer new areas... so long as you know the bosses weakness and have a strategy, you'll win every fight with ease.\n\nThe game doesn't really begin to give you a whole lot of freedom and customization until the final dungeon and almost makes you feel a bit ill prepared. There are a few side quests to knock off before the finale and they give you some of the best gears in the game but most of which are all found in the final dungeon so it doesn't make it easy on you going in.\n\nOther than that, fantastic addition to the series even though it's a bit over done...\n\nThings about this version in particular:\n\nI dislike this 3D look and prefer the newer PSP 2D edition but I do like how they kept it simple and didn't really add on too many extra things.\n\nThe Augment system is welcome, I enjoyed having a bit of customization this time around but having to start from scratch on a NEW GAME+ really hurts the replayability because the pacing should be much quicker your second time around but it stays neutral.\n\nIt only allows you to keep the BEST of the BEST items... like Adamant Armor or Onion Gear... that's it...\n\nSo all ultimate weapons and your character levels are reset at the start of NEW GAME+ which hurts the game as a whole... The entire point of NEW GAME+ is to whip through the game quicker and double up on gears so you can have everyone with best in slot stuff... but if fails on that front.\n\nStill worth a purchase though if you haven't gotten a chance to play this version. The FMV's are also very nice to look at... it's nice to get a glimpse of what these characters would look like if Square had a bigger budget. It brings them to life and makes them feel even more real than they already do... lot's of personality here.","October 8, 2014","true","30.9"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","6","9","2","0"

Until Final Fantasy IV, I hadn't finished any of the previous iterations.  I suggest that if you haven't played a Final Fantasy game in the past but you'd like to look back on the history of the series, this may be the best game for you to start playing.  The previous games, even their modern ports, did not age well.\n\nI thought the story was interesting, and over the course of the game I felt a connection with the characters.  I put in a little over 20 hours and managed to complete everything I wanted out of it.\n\nThere were issues with this port.  There are times during combat that the game will visibly slow down.  Some of the tile work doesn't line up correctly when navigating through areas.  I noticed in some of the dialog bubbles there would be weird pixels at the end of each line of text.\n\nMy only complaint is that the random battles toward the end of the game through very large dungeons started to wear me down.  Instead of being filled with interesting content, the game dragged on with a very large dungeon.  However, the game ending was definitely worth it to see and I finished the game feeling it was a high note.","January 23","true","27.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

So far, all the hidden paths and shortcuts to get some good gear early are still in the game from what I remember in the original.  The FPS in the battles is lower than the rest of the gameplay, but not enough of a downer to not play the game.\n\nI am playing on the new Hard difficulty, which is in fact harder; you need to actually use specific strategies to defeat bosses instead of just grinding/power leveling your party.  It is nice option that I recommend if you are not new to the game.  A new feature is the Augment items that you can give to party members, allowing them to issue new types of abilities in battle.  These can be very powerful and quite helpful when playing on the Hard difficulty.\n\nSeeing the world in 3D, hearing the characters speak in cut-scenes, and seeing your weapon and gear changes in battle is pretty cool.  Thoroughly enjoying this game once again!  $16 is a small price to pay compared to the $90+ I remember the SNES game being back in the day.","September 28, 2014","true","41.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Sadly i am only allowed to give it a yes or no recommendation. when really i want to give it a meh. Anyway i am going to be objective as possible. Personally for final fantasy 4 i will say the GBA version is the best. it wasnt 3d, there was no voice acting and everything that was supposed to be in the original was restored. The GBA version is the game at its most natural state. Then came the DS and PSP remake. When that came out i was very excited, and could get over the FF7 like graphics. the Cutscene opener looked great and then i played it. the story played out as it always had but the RNG was broken beyond playable. maybe it was my cart, but basically leveling up was meaningless and the characters typically didnt get any stronger for me. i never touched ff4 again until i heard they were porting it to ios and pc. I thought that was cute, but it turns out really it was just a port to ios. they removed a few ds specific features and slapped it together as quickly as possible. pc / steam version was even sloppier. now i am not a professional developer but i know porting things is not THAT complicated. 90 % of the work has been done aleady for you and sadly it shows here. The menu is identical to the IOS and android versions, and its slightly broken. If you pick up a peice of equipment that is usable in battle you must configure a command prior to the fight to even be able to use it. given that some characters come with a ton of commands it will be difficult to pick and choose if that oppurtunity comes up. The other thing they got rid of is the RNG development. this can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on who you ask. In the past the RNG hated me and broke my game and experience so in a way i was happy to see it go. But in its place is a VERY static character development. as far as i can tell it looks as if the character stats are meaningless. Combat formulas seem to rely solely on the level number the character is on. I know this because if you poke around the guides you will see one written by me detailing memory editing and plugging numbers in stats doesnt seem to affect anything, though editing the character level had a profound effect.\nlastly is the 3d levels. for the most part the entire game has been remapped into 3d. but the lack of camera controls makes it somewhat difficult to navigate. the good news is the maps are pretty much identical to their 2d counterparts.\n\ni feel weird for saying this but i think i liked the 2d sprites and graphics better, but thats just me. Here eveything has has been converted to 3d enemies bosses maps, the works. to their credits its the most effort square enix has put to porting a game ever, and the 3d conversion is a leap in a positive direction, but then you see the effort they put into releaseing ff13 to pc and you see corporate politics murder something great. its a shame really.\n\nAnyway tl;dr: Its ff4 for the most part fully rendered in circa 1997 3d. cookie cutter character development is pretty much the only reasonable flaw i can find.","December 29, 2014","true","32.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Final Fantasy 4 is undeniably one of the games that paved the way for modern gaming. Not only did it brought refinements to an already excellent gameplay formula, but it was also one of the first games that showed that video games are capable of telling good stories.\n\nThe game puts you in the role of Cecil Harvey, a dark knight working for the kingdom of Baron, who is questioning the nature of its kingdom's actions. Cecil begins to question his own humanity and sets out in a journey of redemption. Though I won't spoil much about the story, suffice to say that's it's full of great moments with a great cast of characters and memorable moments. Many games would later on use Final Fantasy 4 as a blueprint for story telling, especially in JRPGS.\n\nThe game plays out as a classic turn based rpg, though it does have its quirks. Unlike the first entries, Final Fantasy 4 has an active battle system where you have to wait for a bar to fill in order to attack. This leads to a more fluid experience, as both players and enemies attack in a faster form and enemies don't wait for you to pick your attacks. However one of the things that makes it more interesting, is that the game is constantly challenging your expectations. For example you might start out with a party of a swordsman and two mages and suddenly you shift to a party that it's more melee focused. This is great, because it forces you to use all party members and to constantly adapt. Right when you are getting used to a team, the team gets a radical shift and you have to adapt once more.\n\nNow if you seen the screenshots, you'll notice that this isn't the SNES version. In truth, this version is an improved version of the DS remake. Having played that version, I can say that this is by far the superior one. The attention to detail can be perceived better in a big screen than in the DS' limited screen and resolution. The improved graphics also come with a remastered soundtrack. I honestly though I wasn't going to like it (FF7's remastered OST wasn't that great) but I was actually pleasantlty surprised, it holds up pretty well. One of my favorite themes is the Airship one, I could listen to that all day. Also, cutscenes have been added along with voice acting for key events. These make the memorable moments stand out even better. There is a particular cutscene related to Cecil nd a mountain that is simply awesome.  That said, the only slightly negative thing I noticed, is that sometimes battles are a tad low. Seem to be in 15-20 fps, but it not a big deal, given that this isn't a fast paced game.\n\nFor those of you that already played the game, aside from the graphical/music/cutscene overhaul, there are a few gameplay additions. There is a particular sidequest involving a hummingway that is quite humorous.\n\nAll in all, Final Fantasy 4 has always been my favorite FF game and this remake does it justice. RPG fans should not miss out on what is easily one of the cornerstones of gaming. If you are looking for a good, fun and long game, look no further than FF4. You won't be disappointed.\n\nNow let's just hope we get to see Final Fantasy 6 grace Steam someday. With IV, VI, VII and VIII here, JRPG fans will have a lot to look forward to.","September 30, 2014","true","18.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

FFIV is nonetheless a fantastic part of the series, this particular version being the iOS (strangely enough) version, which has been ported for Steam. FFIV in particular was remade in 2007 for the Nintendo DS, and the iOS port is just that, with a few tweaks and removals of DS features/additions of extra features in their place.\n\nOnto the actual game, it's the same thing I could say about any Final Fantasy game. The story is rad (I'd go into it but I don't want to spoil it here), the soundtrack is great, the visuals are alright for an iOS port, if we're talking about DS remake times then they're excellent. The Steam version also has a plethora of achievements for all of you hunters out there (like me) to grab up, following suite with the other Final Fantasy additions to Steam.\n\nIf you're a big FF fan, or just a fellow looking for a decent RPG for a relatively cheap price, then by all means, I'd say go for it.","October 2, 2014","true","138.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Downsides due to it being a port of the Android/iOS version, the UI is firmly centered around touch controls and as such the UI is large to accomodate fingers, and would be massively improved by being scaled down a bit for PC.\n\nThe story itself is fairly basic, but with a lot of humour, and surprisingly for some, a lot of emotion. Final Fantasy titles are known for changing with each game, FFIV follows some of the other early "classic" era titles with the story revolving around Crystals, and a quest to retrieve the Crystals to save the world, in this version characters have been slightly more flushed out in back story, and voice acting adds even more to the experience, overall though pretty basic, it's a classic story told and somewhat updated, well.\n\nGraphics:\nAs this was remade for Nintendo DS, older fans who played the original in it's 2D sprite glory might be put off by the DS style chibi-esque graphics, I find they actually add charm, now they don't contain the sharp details a 2D boss sprite can achieve, and at 1080p, it's a bit distracting at first, but that soon passes and you'll either love or hate the updated visual style, it certainly doesn't look bad and this being a pro or con is totally down to you.\n\nPros:\n- Excellent music, a staple of Final Fantasy games.\n- Length (and depth) - On average it's not going to come close in playtime to the newer Final Fantasy's many know well, such as 7 or 8, but it's not a short game, and for it's original gameplay and story having to accomodate cartridges, it holds up well in content.\n- likeable and varied cast in personality and combat (No job system ala FF3)\n- Voice Acted cutscenes - Whilst they aren't voiced by "A List" voice actors and are short and well paced throughout the story, they are well done and really help immerse you in a world full of text.\n\nCons:\n- UI - Designed for touch, using it via controller works perfectly, it's just a bit unsightly in my opinion and would work much better being smaller.\n- FPS - For me personally, I don't find it an issue, but many do find 15fps in battles distracting.\n\nAll in all, FFIV is a classic JRPG that should be in the collection in any JRPG or Final Fantasy fans collection, does it have problems? Yes, but the pros outweigh the cons, and for the price it is, it earns its value.","October 11, 2014","true","33.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I loved it more when I discovered the J2e translation of the "real" game, not the "Easytype" version that we got in NA. The PSX port was awful due to load times. This is basically the DS version ported to PC, and it more or less faithfully updates the game, but I do have a few issues with this version.\n\nThe Good\n+ It's FFIV.\n+ It's got improved graphics\n+ It's got some quality of life improvements\n+ Achievements\n+ It's on Steam, and has cards\n\nThe stuff I didn't like\n- They altered the equippable items of some characters for no good reason. Why shouldn't the Paladin be able to use staves and bows (useful in lodestone cavern)? Why can't CId use bows (useful after the party has Kain, Cecil, and Yang all competing with him for one of the 3 front row slots)?\n\n- They fixed three of my favourite exploits in the original game:\n\n(1) Originally, when you got returning party members, they would come back at the average party level, now it seems like they come back at the level they were at before, or some arbitrary number.\n\n(2) Related to the above, the original had a spot to the far north of Mysidia where you could go and grind much harder enemies (from the Troia encounter tables) for easy XP. Dark Knight in the back row, swing away, and your sword's instant kill ability would take care of the rest.\n\n(3) The steal-equip trick no longer works. In the original, you could use this to equip any character (besides the one doing the stealing) with whatever you just stole. The most basic and obvious reason to do this is to give your magic users Mythril Shields, but it could also be used to give them weapons that will serve until near end-game; I used to give my summoner a Flame Spear, and my white mage a Gaia Hammer. You could also use this to give someone a charm harp, or other lesser weapons, just for giggles.\n\nThose annoyances are not enough to make me not recommend the game, but it did significantly impact my enjoyment.","December 30, 2014","true","88.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

I dislike however how they ported over the DS version instead of the perfect PSP version since the 3D looks bad in 1920x1080.  The port has many graphical errors and texture defects in any resolution. The FPS is capped very low during the battle scenes so it looks sluggish and unnatural.

Its fine orchestral melodies give a fantastic atmosphere in-game. The combat system is pretty basic and lovely, I am still not a fan of it since I prefer more of a Turn-Based Mechanic like Civilization and so on. Still its good but I stress everytime when I am doing a move and if I click on the wrong menu I am losing precious seconds giving the enemy AI an opportunity to defeat my party. The Story is great, you play as a Dark Knight called Cecil (Or in my game ♥♥♥) who follows the orders of supreme tyrant king. He and his Red Wings go to the City of Mysidia and attack on its peaceful people for its crystal. I won't go on any longer with the story, but becomes interesting the more you know. The Characters in game are all facinating and quite lively, the cut-scenes in the game include voice-overs which I found great. Finally, Final Fantasy IV succeeds on being a True JRPG, the only thing I had problem with  was what to do next? In this game, I am told what to do and when accomplish I just don't know what to do or go where. A bit more guidance in-game would have done the trick. Also this game has very good "Engrish," you will notice some when you read the text carefully.\n\nOverall this game I found it a  good rendition on my Steam Library and cannot wait for more of the Final Fantasy Games to get on steam. The is excellent fulfulling what a JRPG should do with excellent music, interesting story and well-thought characters. In addition, has some faults with guidance in-game and contains some well written "Engrish."","September 19, 2014","true","31.3"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

I would easily pay $60 for a fully updated version of this game.\n\nHaving said that, this game has it all for me, including the amazing soundtrack.

The second Final Fantasy game I have played, Final Fantasy for the NES preceding it is probalby my favorite Final Fantasy game out of the whole bunch, and I've played all of them except XII. The characters all have unique abilities (though augments were added in this version to share abilities between characters) that make having them at specific parts of the game useful. The storyline is rich and engaging, and you generally start to develop an emotional attachment to some of them (depending on your playstyle and level up depth you get into games I suppose). A good time sink, and luckly this version includes both Easy Type (Final Fantasy II US Release) and the original Hard Mode from the Japanese release of Final Fantasy IV on the Super Famicom. So if you are looking for a challenge, you'll get it as the game get's very difficult, very quick if you don't grind to learn spells for specific bosses.\n\nAs a forewarning, this is not the Final Fantasy that most everyone and myself fell in love with when it release back in November of 1991. The game contains the core coding for all of the characters, leveling, and monsters along with all of the proper translations the 1991 US release lacked. As much as I don't care for the graphic upgrade they gave it (should have gone with the SNES / Super Famicom graphics) the graphics do NOT make the game. The storyline and the combat system make the game, and those remain flawless. I highly recommend to anyone new to the series, and to those wanting to get a whiff of nostolgia to join Cecil Harvey once again on his adventure of Love, Betrayal, and Atonement.","January 1","true","117.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The last time I played this game was when it first came out on the Super Nintendo.  Sadly, this version tries to look better than the original, yet I find myself at many times wishing I was playing the original version.\n\nThe most obvious change is that the characters are all modeled in 3D space.  This allows them to do even fancier things such as add flair to cutscenes.  The original format does not have cutscenes; it came before a time it was popular in the gaming world.  The graphics would probably be bearable if the character models didn't look like a first year game development student could pull out (and I'd almost bet tthe student could pull out better models).  Judging from the style, I'd say they ported the models from the Nintendo DS version of the game.  The quality looks just as bad.\n\nThe biggest flaw in the graphics, though, is not the models but the way it is presented.  The camera is, of course, coming down on your character at an angle - standard for 3rd person 3D games, but the camera is damn near on top of your character all of the time.  Fortunately, you can press one of the shoulder buttons to pull up a map overlay.  Unfortunately, you will not get to enjoy much of the DS-quality graphics since that damn map will be up all of the time because you really cannot see what is going on when you need to go down on any map.   Most of the dungeons I've ran through, I navigated almost entirely off the map since it's easier than just popping it up and down as needed.   That isn't even fool-proof though since the icon for your character doesn't exactly fit around the terrain as easily as the map indicates (several times, I'd get caught up trying to round a corner).\n\nThe music is probably the strongest point.  At least they didn't try to butch it all too much; most of the music is how I remember it.  It was one of the things I liked about FFIV the first time I played it.  Some of the spell sound effects are different, but it wasn't enough to sound like it didn't belong.\n\nOther notes: some of the fights are different than how I remember it.  For example, I don't recall seeing the "reverse" attack that the doctor in the Tower of Babel casts on the group.  Took me a couple rounds to figure out what was going on.  Random encounters are way too frequent in some areas.  I think it was like that originally, though; I wish they would have tweaked it since they were already tweaking other things.\n\nOverall, I'd say if you have this game for any other platform, pass on this one.  It might even be better to download ZSNES or other SNES/Super Famicom emulator and play the original.   If you really want it on your PC, get it on a Steam sale.","July 23, 2015","false","8.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Imagine the leap from the simplicty of NES FF1 to having a full-blown story and pleasant music of SNES FF4. It's not the most amazing story or anything, but it had a lot of charm that still holds up even today.\n\nThe game is, more or less, the same as the original SNES FF4, but given a 3d overhaul, with added scripts, revised inventory, and bug fixes. They considerably buffed up the laughably easy bosses and introduced some new mechanics such as the augment system, which enables you to acquire abilities of other characters when they leave your party.\n\nI must note the user interface. It's... very off-putting. What happened to the simple text on blue menus with portraits? Instead we get a surprisingly unappealing menu interface that makes poor use of space. I get that this is essentially a port from a mobile platform (which is yet a port from the DS) in order to make it easier to touch, but how hard can it be to resize boxes and text?\n\nI also really miss the SNES music which still sounds epic. This version has some good music, but not all of it is up to snuff *cough Toroia*. Also, even on low volume the music is still oddly loud, at least on my system. The graphics are serviceable. The 3D models work well enough, but those low-res textures are strikingly noticeable on any computer monitor. Meanwhile, most of the 2D stuff such as portraits and menus end up looking worse.\n\nThe translation's good. It's got a slight "thou art" bent to it, but at least they kept the spoony bard line in. I miss the Golbez hand scene, where his severed arm crawls on its own and grabs the plot coupon. Instead he just grabs it and goes. The acted parts are fun to watch, but very infrequent.\n\nTo the best of my knowledge, nowhere in-game does it mention how to move spells around. This is something I consider important! (tip: hold down the action button and then move the spell around). Speaking of spells, they got rebalanced. Now the high-end spells have drastically increased cast times (no more Flare spam!). So I find myself using those far less often than I used to.\n\nI have no complaints about the frame rate like others do, but what I do take issue with is how the game as a whole is slowed down. Battle transitions take time, battle animations take time, battle results take time, running from battle takes time, everything takes time. In all 2D versions, you could enter and end battles quite quickly. Here, the random encounters take up to 3x the time, and this gets tiring very quickly, especially when you're trying to grind for something like, say, pink tails. Furthermore, unskippable scenes slow the game down. God, the dancing girls take forever end. It discourages me from talking to NPCs because I just don't want to waste those precious minutes that add up quickly.\n\nOne curious problem I have is that the field of view is much lower than SNES. You're sort of zoomed in fairly close and thus see less on the screen at any given time. To offset this, you now have a minimap, which is useful. However it does not show doorways, for whatever reason. I still would have liked the ability to zoom out on the main screen though. I aso notice that hidden passages are much harder to spot now. Had I not known about them from the SNES days, I would have easily overlooked them.\n\nOverall I liked it. It's FF4! And I'll probably keep buying their remakes for as long as they keep making them.

I started with the "easy" Final Fantasy 2 North American release and played that at least ten times through.  I played this on PSP, Playstation 3, Gameboy Advance, and now on Steam.  Here are the pros and cons in my book for this game that still has me playing after 20 years of its inital release.\n\nGood:\n\nBeautiful music, decent voice acting, turn based goodness.  I will say first and foremost, I LOVE turn base RPG's.  The story is simple by today's standards (you can tell what is going on unlike some of the later Final Fantasy games, talking to you 13 and all of your weirdness).  The combat is turn based, strategic, and fast paced (even with the atrocious frame rate at times I still didn't mind grinding).\n\nBad:\n\nOk, I said "decent" voice acting.  It is ok I guess.  It is weird hearing names of the people that I thought were always pronounced differently.  Yang is pronounce Yong and I thought Cecil was pronounced SeeSeal not Sessal.  Oh well, after twenty years I know.  The game is pretty dang hard.  Some of the tricks that worked 20 years ago do not fly right now.  Notably the putting the wall spell on yourself to reflect Bahamuts special attack.  It does not work so Bahamut is not a pushover any more.  There are other things that used to never happen like tons of counter attacking and so forth but I am glad to see it get to be more challenging.\n\nOverall:  I know that since Square and Enix merged they have been money hungry.  However, the $16 price is worth the experience to be sure.  Final Fantasy purist may cry fowl that the game has been modernized and new players to the genre that started on 7 or later may not appreciate the gem that is FFIV.  However, I fully support this game and would love to see FFVI get the same loving treatment.  I will gladly shell out $16 for it.","December 9, 2015","true","29.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I've beaten it over 10 times and spend hundreds of hours playing the original. I know this game inside and out.\n\nThis release is absolute garbage and I can't in good faith recommend it to anyone over the original.\n\nThe horrific graphic style aside, it also runs horribly slow and it's extremely clunky to play. It's absolutely painful if you've played the original.\n\nHowever, being a fan of the game, I could overlook this.\n\nIf it wasn't for the camera.\n\nThe camera is zoomed in so far it looks like you're staring directly at the top of the head of your character for most of the game. You can't see anything around you. Some of the maps are enormous and you feel like a rat in a maze...because you can't see anything. You can't take in the sights of maps or the overworld...or anything. Maybe this was an appropriate camera for a handheld, but on a big screen it looks ridiculous. I can't enjoy playing the game like this at all.\n\nVerdict? There's simply no reason to play this when you can play the original. It's a fantastic core game ruined by enorous oversights.","September 12, 2015","false","11.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

The last time I played this game was when it first came out on the Super Nintendo.  Sadly, this version tries to look better than the original, yet I find myself at many times wishing I was playing the original version.\n\nThe most obvious change is that the characters are all modeled in 3D space.  This allows them to do even fancier things such as add flair to cutscenes.  The original format does not have cutscenes; it came before a time it was popular in the gaming world.  The graphics would probably be bearable if the character models didn't look like a first year game development student could pull out (and I'd almost bet tthe student could pull out better models).  Judging from the style, I'd say they ported the models from the Nintendo DS version of the game.  The quality looks just as bad.\n\nThe biggest flaw in the graphics, though, is not the models but the way it is presented.  The camera is, of course, coming down on your character at an angle - standard for 3rd person 3D games, but the camera is damn near on top of your character all of the time.  Fortunately, you can press one of the shoulder buttons to pull up a map overlay.  Unfortunately, you will not get to enjoy much of the DS-quality graphics since that damn map will be up all of the time because you really cannot see what is going on when you need to go down on any map.   Most of the dungeons I've ran through, I navigated almost entirely off the map since it's easier than just popping it up and down as needed.   That isn't even fool-proof though since the icon for your character doesn't exactly fit around the terrain as easily as the map indicates (several times, I'd get caught up trying to round a corner).\n\nThe music is probably the strongest point.  At least they didn't try to butch it all too much; most of the music is how I remember it.  It was one of the things I liked about FFIV the first time I played it.  Some of the spell sound effects are different, but it wasn't enough to sound like it didn't belong.\n\nOther notes: some of the fights are different than how I remember it.  For example, I don't recall seeing the "reverse" attack that the doctor in the Tower of Babel casts on the group.  Took me a couple rounds to figure out what was going on.  Random encounters are way too frequent in some areas.  I think it was like that originally, though; I wish they would have tweaked it since they were already tweaking other things.\n\nOverall, I'd say if you have this game for any other platform, pass on this one.  It might even be better to download ZSNES or other SNES/Super Famicom emulator and play the original.   If you really want it on your PC, get it on a Steam sale.","July 23, 2015","false","8.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I've enjoyed Zelda, Phantasy Star, Secret of Mana, Illusion of Time, Questron, Eternal Dagger, Shard of Spring, Phantasie III (last 4 on PC) so I'm not anti-RPG at all.  And I know I'll get flamed for not liking this, but it's really not for want of trying!  I desperately wanted to enjoy FFIV on PC, and am glad it (and all the others) are getting ported but I just didn't 'get' it... it seems so primitive nowadays with all the wandering and random encounters and cutesy characters.  I realise that's part of the charm in a way but for me I guess I've just lost that innocence growing up & become instead a cynical old ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ LOL.\n\nI know I'm expecting too much from an ancient game and actually don't want to dissuade people from playing it, I'm just suggesting they should maybe lower their expectations and get it when on sale or in a bundle.  I'm still gonna try FFVII as it's consistently been hailed as the classic of the pre-X era.\n\nAs I said, I'm not decrying the fans, Square or RPG nostalgists, it's purely a personal opinion.  I doubt I could play the 'Gold Box' SSI games or Dungeon Master either now- but I'd still be chuffed if they were brought back to remind us oldies of happier times and to show the young 'uns where it all started (and possibly to be thankful for the progress that's been made since)...","May 9, 2015","false","24.4"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

As such, this game has always felt disappointing to me by comparison, and very much overrated. It's a smaller game from a smaller team very early in its debuted console's lifetime, and this fact is more than apparent. Plot points happen purely because they're plot points, and not because of anything actually compelling. Character design is there, and sometimes a bit of personality comes through, but it's largely flat and even absurd.\n\nIn the sprite-based versions of the game, I would even say that the gameplay is lacking, but the DS version that this (and Android and iOS) version is based off of improves it a bit. Bosses aren't quite as mindless a walk in the park anymore, which does wonders to keep things interesting. No more limited inventory space to curse at.

It's hard to believe that this version of FF IV is actually a remake, because the game has aged terribly.\n\nPro:\n\n+ The battle system itself is great. Lots of spells and skills that make combat more tactical.\n\n+ The music varies from memorable to pretty annoying, but overall it's decent.\n\n+ The graphics are fine, considering it's actually a Nintendo DS game.\n\n+ It has some really cool and challenging boss fights. These are the only part of the game that's really entertaining, sadly.\n\n\nCon:\n\n- Basically every battle that isn't a boss fight is just one thing: annoying as hell. As you progress through the game, random battles become worse and worse, as the enemies just throw their skills left and right. Counter attacks, insta-kill abilities and party-wide debuffs and elemental spells like there were no tomorrow. Worst encounter design I've EVER seen in a J-RPG, and I've seen a lot.\n\n- The story is dull and without any twists or turns, except one before the final dungeon of the game. Same goes for the characters, they just come and go to your party all the time, as if the developers actually wanted the player to not care the slightest about them.\n\n- There is absolutely no overview of the events that happened or are going to happen next, you only get hints from NPCs where to go. Fine for the story, at least if you don't plan to make a longer break during your playthrough. But without a walkthrough I probably would've missed like 70% of the optional stuff, since what you have to do often doesn't even make sense, because the game explains nothing.\n\n- Dungeon design is very repetetive, no puzzles or anything. But random encounters, OH, so many random encounters. Fun.\n\n- And, last but not least, cutscenes aren't skippable.\n\n\n.. Well, I haven't played the original FF IV, but I know that the DS (aka Steam) version is supposed to be much harder (and more unfair). And to be honest, I can't think of any good reason to play this over the original, since gameplay-wise it doesn't feel like a modernized game in the slightest anyway.

The plot of FFIV consists of an epic adventure that starts off promising enough however it falls victim to killing off characters and then taking it back REPEATEDLY. Death is a thing that means nothing in this game more often than not  yet you are still expected to cry about it over and over.\n\nTHIS PORT: This game as I understand it is a port of the DS port. This port being originally for mobile phones however that doesn't mean it's inherently bad, in fact the graphics are quite nice and the menus reasonable. However to 100% this game requires you to do newgame plus 3 times, that's right 3 TIMES!!! With an already weak plot having to play this game 3 times for true completion is at best a chore and at worst a form of video game torture.\n\nGOOD POINTS: The voice acting in this game is quite good, in fact despite having a few awkward moments the English voice cast does a pretty good job, on top of that the gameplay is okay although controlling five characters on an ATB system admittedly is a bit tedious especially with all the random battles. Very few battles are quick even at high levels.\n\nCONCLUSION: If you want to do a quick run of a Final Fantasy game and don't expect a masterpiece then this may be for you, However if it's an epic masterpiece you're looking for then perhaps this game is not the way to go.\n\nMY FINAL OPINION: I played Final Fantasy IV with the intent of 100%ing it and in the process it has become my least favorite game of all time. I am a huge fan of Final Fantasy games and have played them since I was a child but this is so far the only one I have not liked.","January 13, 2015","false","91.5"," 6 of 18 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","6","18","0","0"

This happened multiply times, once during a cutscene after a big boss fight, and now again, right at the end of another big boss fight. I was looking forward to sitting down and getting a good 30, 40 hours out of the game, but the consistent freezing up during pivotal moments has me putting this one back on the steam self till it gets patched.

The various deaths/sacrifices should've evoked some sort of emotion. They didn't.\n+There are some funny moments.\n\nGameplay\n\n- Ability system is extremely rudimentary. The only characters who ever gain new skills are the mages, via level up. Everybody else has exactly one or two special skills, which don't change.\n- Same goes for equipment. New items are few and far in between, and there are for instance no accessories to protect against the various negative status effects.\n- There are basically three types of places in this game: towns, castles and caves. The level design is boring and repetitive.\n\nVarious\n\n- The game lacks atmosphere. The tiny villages and the few npcs don't create the impression of a living world. The sceneries look like stage decoration. I'm usually not so much interested in graphics, but in this case I could imagine the original sprite graphics to work better.\n- Some of the voices don't fit the characters at all. Cecil sounds like a boy, and Kain is the polar opposite with his gruff manliness. Something inbetween would have been more appropriate for both of them.\n- One of the biggest disappointments is the soundtrack. Of all the other FFs I have played (6-9) all had a decent, at times brilliant music. Here, there are only a handful of different pieces, which are rather uninspired and monotonous as hell. By now I play with the music turned off.\n\nSummary\nOverall I'd say this game just hasn't aged well. Pretty much everything has been done better by later games, and also later FFs. I haven't played 5, but I can recommend 6 and 7, with 7 being one of my favourite games ever. I didn't enjoy 8+9 quite as much, but both are still better than this one.

The game runs (finally) and I'm even able to improve its appearance by forcing AA and Anisotropic Filtering through a hardware profile for the game.  That's good news but I still haven't yet determined what setting I changed that got things running in the first place.  If I ever figure out what it was I'll post it here.  Despite my personal technical difficulties this appears to be a functional port.\n\nAs to the review itself...\n\nThis game is a classic JRPG with a colorful cast of characters bound up in an epic quest to save the world.  The old-school turn based battle system has all the depth, complexity, and clunkiness of RPGs of the era.  There's as much to love as there is to be frustrated by since the game hasn't seen as much of a mechanics upgrade as it has a visual upgrade.  Some old design principles are timeless, but others were abandoned years ago for a reason.  Final Fantasy IV makes no recompense for this, so you'll either be charmed by nostalgia or you'll pass on it entirely\n\nI never played the Android or Nintendo DS versions of this game, but I did play the original SNES version.  The addition of occasional voices and cut scenes plus 3D models really adds character to the game's old, blocky sprites.  If you liked Final Fantasy IV on SNES then I think you'll find this version to be a nice upgrade to the experience.\n\nMy understanding is that there are more inexpensive ways to get this version of Final Fantasy IV on Android and DS (which is where this version was ported from), so I recommend wiating for the Steam version for when you can get it on sale.  Your platform of preference should be the deciding factor for determining where you get this game from as I understand the modern ones are all virtually identical.\n\nI recommend Final Fantasy IV as a classic JRPG with new drywall and a fresh coat of paint that's as fun as I remember it being all those years ago.\n\n1 January 2015\nI would love to give a positive recommendation, but I'm unable to get the game to launch.  It crashes immediately upon clicking "Play" in the launcher.  I've owned this copy about 24 hours as of this posting and I haven't once gotten to even play it :(\n\nI'm still looking for a solution for this and will update my review when I find one.","December 31, 2014","true","34.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"

One major change is that a large number of the enemies now have counter attacks which can be really annoying.\n\nI love the game, I love the story (I really REALLY loved VII, it was the first game that I would say I really loved infact, and I can see where it has borrowed from this title, fairly extensively).  It, to me, is everything I expect from a JRPG.\n\nThere are pitfall's of course;\n\nThe steam achievements are very grindy (you need items that have a .4% chance to drop, and yes, that is a point four, not a piece of crud on your screen, but an actual decimal point) and it is possible to mess them up such that you need to start the game again to get them.  On the bright side, the community page has a lot of helpful guides.\n\nThe interface is a pretty obvious port and feel clunky, however they kept a quick save feature, which, as someone who played on an old PS1 back in the day, is a very nice feature.\n\nThe inventory system is terrible to use in combat and not much fun out.\n\nThe opening video is beautiful, they made some exquisite models, but you never see them again.\n\nThe music is beautiful.\n\nIf you like classic JRPG's I would say that this is a staple, a must play.","January 24, 2015","true","153.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you own a DS, get the DS version. If you own a SNES, get the SNES version. The problem with this, the Steam edition, is that it feels less like a real port and more like a bad emulation of the DS game. There are numerous littly tiny bugs, most often sound-related but also occasionally visual. Luckily it does support a game pad, and you can customise all the controls, so that's a point in its favour, but the overall experience of the game is weakened by the poor technological execution.\n\nEven so, if this edition of the game is your only option, then I recommend it. The graphics are decent, if a little dated even for its time, and the art style (for characters, anyway) does not lend itself perfectly to the aesthetic of the story. The controls are sluggish (making both battles and menu navigation tedious), the random encounter rate is atrocious, and the game is more difficult than it needs to be, but all of those faults fade into the background when you get truly engaged in the story, characters, and wonderful music; and, really, those are what make a Final Fantasy game great. Those are the reasons you play. And those are the reasons you should play this one.","January 25, 2015","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The augment system is still very cool and gives a lot of customization opportunities to each person’s play and the grinds are truly Final Fantasy standard (i.e. 0.4 drops = hours of grinding). This game also has a great deal of replayability, in fact you should play it at least twice since the New Game Plus offers access to superbosses and more augment opportunities.

Technically, this game is a near-direct port of the Nintendo DS version (the only difference is the image resolution). The biggest killer, I suppose, is the framerate lock: battles are locked at fifteen frames-per-second; overworld and town movement is locked at thirty. But, setting these detriments aside, the core game of Final Fantasy IV is still here and it is absolutely amazing. You, the player, gets to experience Cecil's journey of redemption in its entirety in a manner that's new, yet familiar. If you have played the game before, this game is still worth purchasing for replaying an awesome JRPG (sort of; $16 for a semi-half-♥♥♥♥♥ port is a bit much).

It's playable, if the battles run a bit slower.  There's a few things though different from the DS version:\n\n1.  Rydia's bonus summon is absent.  Not a big loss.\n\n2.  You can only get ONE Limit Break Augment.  Be careful if you're trying to min/max your characters on a third playthrough.\n\n3.  Mini games have been taken out.  Not a terrible loss, but it was still kind of a fun feature of the game.\n\n4.  Battles are really slow, because the fps caps at about 15.  Obviously this game wasn't really suited for PCs (Basically a lazy port).  I feel like the battles run better on my DS game sometimes.\n\nHonestly, I'd recommend the DS version still, and if you're a 2D purist, go for the GBA version (I don't care for the RPGMaker tone that the PSP version has, but different strokes, different folks there).  If you can't get your hands on either copy, you're stuck with this.  Despite it's flaws, it's still really good, and I actually love the 3D version a lot.  And this is coming from a person that still has the original copy of 'Final Fantasy 2' from the old SNES days.  I just hope Square stops giving very lazy ports of games to Steam for a quick cash grab.  If you own the DS version of this game, stick with your DS version.\n\nNow I'm just waiting for the cash grab that is TAF...\n\nEdit:  Just to say too, after playing a little bit of my DS copy compared to this one, normal mode?  WAY easier than the DS version.  In the Steam version, Edward died a total of 0 times, and Rydia didn't die at all.  While in my DS version (Which was on a new game+, so I had bonus augments to boot!), Edward died about 6 times and Rydia died about 3 times, and that was only to Mount Hobs!  So they toned down the damage in this version and 'hard mode' is the original difficulty of the DS version, I'm assuming.  Either way, if you found the DS version difficult, the normal version will be enough for you.","March 20, 2015","true","83.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It, to me, is everything I expect from a JRPG.\n\nThere are pitfall's of course;\n\nThe steam achievements are very grindy (you need items that have a .4% chance to drop, and yes, that is a point four, not a piece of crud on your screen, but an actual decimal point) and it is possible to mess them up such that you need to start the game again to get them.  On the bright side, the community page has a lot of helpful guides.\n\nThe interface is a pretty obvious port and feel clunky, however they kept a quick save feature, which, as someone who played on an old PS1 back in the day, is a very nice feature.\n\nThe inventory system is terrible to use in combat and not much fun out.\n\nThe opening video is beautiful, they made some exquisite models, but you never see them again.\n\nThe music is beautiful.\n\nIf you like classic JRPG's I would say that this is a staple, a must play.","January 24, 2015","true","153.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That being said, it is not as good as you would hope. In the normal difficulty, some enemies are harder than bosses. Most bosses being incredibly easy. Endgame, you will be extremely overpowered, to the point that you basically can't die. There is a new game+ option, I've yet to completely replay the game on Hard and the new game+, but it feels like it will be a chore. Mind you, FFIV is probably my favorite game of all time, this is a solid port of a mediocre remake. If you want to play the best versions of FFIV, I recommend FFIV The Complete Collection on PSP, or FFIV Advance on GBA, which include endgame dungeons and the ability to use almost all the characters endgame. All in all, this is an ok port.\n\n6.5/10","March 4, 2015","true","36.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sometimes it's hell when you want to target someone who you usually wouldn't target (ie: beserk on an enemie). This was also not an issue in the DS version\n\nThis last issue may just be an issue with my controller, I haven't seen anyone else report it. But I don't have this problem with any other games\nSometimes when pressing a direction or button my game would continue to act like I was pressing it when I let go. The issue would not fix it's self until I pressed it again\nFor example. I might be pressing up and when I let go my character/cursor would keep going up until I pressed up again. Really annoying.\n\nOut of all the issues I had, the controls was the only one that made me reconsider whether I should have bought this game.

It features the updated graphics, voice acted cutscenes and increased difficulty from the Nintendo DS rerelease.\n\nThat said, this is a very bad port. Even accounting for the restrictions of the DS release (low poly models, pixellated textures, 24fps cap during battles) it has a horrible UI taken from the iOS port (making this a port of a port of a rerelease :/) which means that it cannot display the whole battle menu without moving down (any reasonable PC display should be able to show the whole thing, hell, the console versions could) yet there is no mouse support which you'd think they could have done given the iOS port as a base. Also, gamepad support is fairly terrible, no Xinput or just DirectInput, though my 360 pad works it has deadzone problems (detects axis motion where there is none) which is a pain in the ♥♥♥♥.\n\nSo while I recommend this game as it's a piece of history, beware of port issues - consider buying a different port. The Chronicles version in particular can be played right off the disc on PC if you use an emulator though it has 16 bit graphics and a poorer translation.","March 22","true","35.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A true Square-Enix remake, with 3D graphics, CG scenes and cutscenes for the DS.\n\nWhy does it get so many negative reviews, though?\n\n2 reasons. The first one involves this being ported from the DS to Android systems and then from Android to PC. Which means this game was designed for the 2 screens interface of the DS, meaning things are either "rigged" or tottally lost, like the map system, the party screen on the menu and stuff like this, or the Whyt feature that was removed. This IS bothersome, but does not make the game unplayable. In fact, it is doable and you can play without too much convenience loss.\n\nThe second reason is because there was a PSP version with "more content" and old-school graphics that could've been ported to PC instead of the DS remake. Well, although this is a consistent complain, I think it's unfair. The PSP version offers no innovation at all compared to the GBA port or even the SNES original version. Interlude is mostly fanfic level stuff. So is the After Years, although being good, you can still get it on steam. The DS version is the only one that offers a real innovation, both graphics and gameplay-like.\n\nSo if you like Final Fantasy games, get this one, it's on my top-3 FF games. It's not a perfect port, but it's still fun and, in my opinion, was a better choice over the PSP version for Steam. Of course, the most hardcore fans will still struggle over an option superboss that was left aside, but... really? Is this what "fun" means? Minor optional stuff not ported over? I don't think so.","April 4","true","79.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It feels like Square-Enix got lazy with this and took the easy route to grab a few extra bucks. Call me a fool for buying it, but I like the game and I honestly feel like I was betrayed.\n\nI've been a huge fan of Final Fantasy IV since its first release as Final Fantasy II on the SNES; played pretty much every port that's been made, including the WonderSwan port. Then, I found out Square annouced a DS remake, which got me excited, but disapointed when I found out how the graphics looked. I understand the DS couldn't render 3D graphics better than that, but they still seemed a bit too limited. Also, the DS version was at least twice as hard as the Final Fantasy IV we never got on the SNES. You have no idea how many times I had to restart the battle with the Giant's CPU because of that stupid Laser Barrage attack. I also wasn't able to beat Zeromous until I was at least at average level 70, and it still was still stupid difficult.\n\nWhere am I going with this? Well, this is a port of a port; DS to Android/iOS. The DS port is the inferior version of the game. Why use that? The PSP remake is leaps and bounds better, displaying better visuals, classic grid-like movement in the overworld and such, and also included the extra dungeons and party swaps from the GBA version. Why did Square-Enix take the lazy route and run a stupid Android emulator with the Android port of the DS port? I just don't understand and it makes me both angry and, as I said many times while typing this, disapointed.","March 28","false","28.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JustinDP/recommended/312750/","JustinDP","JustinDP","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JustinDP/","383 products in account","Final Fantasy 4 is very easily my favorite Final Fantasy game, and one of my favorite RPGs in general. It was the first RPG I can actually remember going through as a kid, although I know I played the original Dragon Warrior/Quest years prior to playing it. As such, this is a game I will very happily replay every time I have an excuse to such as a re-release, or souped up version. So how does this one match up?\n\nThis version is a ported version of the iPhone port, which in itself is a port of the version designed for the Nintendo DS. It retains most of the functionality of the DS version with a couple of tweaks both good, and not good. The good is that the text is a bit much easier to read than the stylized text they originally used in the GBA, and DS versions of the game. However, that may have more to do with the tiny size of the screen you had to use at the time to play it. The graphics are 3D rather than sprites, and while they look alright - the depth of field and the closer view at the characters makes things look a little wonky at times. Nothing that makes the game unplayable, but still hard to not notice.\n\nThe Big Chocobo minigames from the DS version have been removed. Rather than earning the augment for doing these games, you instead have to go hunting for a group of summoned monsters that have left the Feymarch. Thankfully, this isn't all that difficult. You get hints as to where they may be, and you can go get them at your leisure. Overall I'd consider this a positive change as the minigames I barely even remember, meaning they would have simply been busy work I didn't care about.\n\nAn odd change involves using an equipped item in battle. Originally you were able to go into your items menu and simply push up to access your item. Now this only gives you a prompt to change which item you have equipped. Instead you have to manually go into your abilities and change your Attack command to a Rod or whatever. This is mostly annoying simply because you'll be doing it for the mages, such as young Rydia, who basically needs it to do any degree of damage without killing her mana pool immediately. It'd have been a little less bad if there was some sort of thing in the game hinting towards doing it this way, but alas.\n\nThe biggest negative to the game is actually not specific to this version, as it originated in the DS version. There are a series of rare items. This isn't the negative. The negative is that they are so rare that you have a better shot of winning the lottery than you do at getting them to drop. If it were one, or two items this wouldn't be nearly as bad as it is. However, you have Rainbow Pudding which is required to progress the Namingway quest chain at around the midway point of the game. You have the four hidden summons for Rydia. Then you have Pink, Black, Red, Blue, Yellow, and Green tails to get the Adamant Armor, and Onion Equipment sets. That makes ELEVEN seperate items with the extremely crazy 0.04% drop. This is very tedious at best, and not at all fun. Thankfully, for the most part these things are optional. However, you'll absolutely want an Adamant Armor for the two hidden bosses. Hell, you'll want a couple of them more than likely. The Onion Equipment is alright for leveling, but I wouldn't consider it really worth the effort required. The summons aren't very strong at all and you'll only use them just to see what they do (although Cockatrice is good for stuff weak to stone). If you neglect the pudding, you'll miss out on at least three seperate augments in the chain following it.\n\nAnother minor negative is that this version doesn't feature the bonus dungeon, and the ability to swap around your final party that you have in the GBA and PSP versions. This is the clearest example this is just a straight port of the DS/iOS version. I can't really count it as a true negative since it wasn't in the DS version either, but still a shame.\n\nStill, in spite of those negatives the game is still a good experience all around. Those who found the DS version too difficult will like that there is a slightly easier difficulty option as well. I recommend the game, but be aware of what this version actually is in advance.","September 8, 2015","true","34.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I wasn't sure at first if I wanted to play through it again but I'm very glad I changed my mind. This version surpasses the Gameboy Advance version to me. I've only beaten it on Normal and only unlocked 72% of the achievements but here's a list of my pros and cons.\n\nPros\n-Wide variety of characters with their own abilities (although the mages kind of overlap minus the summoner Rydia). You'll get to play as Yang the Monk who whoops ♥♥♥ and Edward the Bard who sucks ♥♥♥. You'll also get to use a Dark Knight, Dragoon, Paladin, Sage and others.\n-Great story, the DS version adds cutscense that add to some missing parts of the story from the previous versions of the game. Plus, the voice acting is great, (pretty sure Kain is voiced by the same actor that did Gaara from Naruto).\n-Lots of things to do, I beat the game in about 22 hours but there's also a hard mode and more things to do in the game, such as hidden ultimate weapons, secret bosses and an annoying rabit thing that I missed the achievement for doing all his damn things.\n-Summoning. I love summoning in a Final Fantasy game. This version they're called Eidolons and they're pretty sweet. You got your usual, Ifrit, Shiva, Ramuh, Chocobo that come with your summoner when she joins and some sweet hidden ones like Leviathan or Bahamut. The hidden ones are fun to find and are well worth the search and grinding neccesary to acquire them.\n-Combat, you can either have Wait or Active combat. Both are like what they sound like, Wait you get a chance to figure out what to do when it's your turn and Active keeps the battle going. I preferred active as it made things go by quicker and made the battles a bit harder.\n\nCons\n-Back to the variety of characters, you won't get to choose who you use. It's set who you will use when and where and that's why this is a like and dislike. It means I won't have to worry about leveling up all of my characters to stay close to the same level but what if I wanted to see if Edward stops sucking? Or bring someone else to the final boss other then the ones I'm supposed to use? It's not a huge gripe since I liked the five characters I had to take to the end but it still is a gripe.\n-Now I've only played it on Normal so far but I found the game to be a bit on the easy side. When you bring up the menu to start the game, there is an option to Continue. I thought this was for a quicksave but actually, it brings you back to where you were when you died. I got to one treasure chest guarded by a tough monster and instead of taking it back to when I last saved, it continued me right next to the treasure chest to try again. This isn't a huge con but it doesn't make me feel worried about going into a fight with low hp, cause I know I'll be able to continue right where I just was and try again.\n-Can't skip cutscense. I pushed every button I could and I had to watch them no matter what.\n\nOverall\n-I had alot of fun playing this game. I liked the characters, the story kept me interested and the game was challenging to the point where grinding was needed in order to keep going.

A true Square-Enix remake, with 3D graphics, CG scenes and cutscenes for the DS.\n\nWhy does it get so many negative reviews, though?\n\n2 reasons. The first one involves this being ported from the DS to Android systems and then from Android to PC. Which means this game was designed for the 2 screens interface of the DS, meaning things are either "rigged" or tottally lost, like the map system, the party screen on the menu and stuff like this, or the Whyt feature that was removed. This IS bothersome, but does not make the game unplayable. In fact, it is doable and you can play without too much convenience loss.\n\nThe second reason is because there was a PSP version with "more content" and old-school graphics that could've been ported to PC instead of the DS remake. Well, although this is a consistent complain, I think it's unfair. The PSP version offers no innovation at all compared to the GBA port or even the SNES original version. Interlude is mostly fanfic level stuff. So is the After Years, although being good, you can still get it on steam. The DS version is the only one that offers a real innovation, both graphics and gameplay-like.\n\nSo if you like Final Fantasy games, get this one, it's on my top-3 FF games. It's not a perfect port, but it's still fun and, in my opinion, was a better choice over the PSP version for Steam. Of course, the most hardcore fans will still struggle over an option superboss that was left aside, but... really? Is this what "fun" means? Minor optional stuff not ported over? I don't think so.","April 4","true","79.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also Child Rydia has a permanent smile on her face which is lazy, offputting, and completely against the tone.\n\n"Hey, were you the guys that just killed my mom? :D" <---- like that.\n\nGet ready for a crappy little poof for your ultimate spells. Firaga looks like someone just sneezed into a bit of chili powder. Summons arent great either. I don't mind the way the Eidolons themselves are drawn but you don't even see their attacks land, just the numbers after they cast.\n\nVery disappointing if you are someone who is into crisp spell graphics.\n\nThat being said I still almost played through the whole game out of love for the title, but in the end couldn't get motivated to unlock a crappy bahamut animation and finish. Mad props to the developer for not putting on the kid gloves for hard mode, you will definitely notice that they aren't pulling punches(harder than most new JRPG 'Hard Modes,' example being Aldorlea games.)  Be warned, unless you're cool with about 8 hours of grinding to get through story mode, you should probably stick to normal.\n\nThe Map is surprisingly navigable for being changed into 3D, also a nice touch.\n\nUnfortunately overall I'm going to have to thumbs down this game, unless a "extra hard type" FF4 interests you enough to ignore the detrimental bits.\n\nAlso, ignore the fact that I have 380 hours on record, just left the ♥♥♥♥ open for over a week :P","April 5","false","380.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This version loses some of the quirkiness but makes up for it by being the definitive translation of the game. It really pulls together a lot of the story that was lost in the translation of the original. Even including scenes that were completely missing or so poorly translated that they turned a monologue into a single sentence.\n\nI really like all the extra features, some were cut from the original (summons) and some were additions from the DS version (augments). They make an old game that was at times a slog into a smooth experience. There are a lot of reviews bashing the graphics but of all Final Fantasy remakes I've played I think it was done best here. The characters are cuter but just as expressive and they never stray too far from the original design, the world design looks fantastic in my opinion. The menus are clearly designed for smart phone and took some time to get used to, that was my biggest issue.\n\nSo many people praise the PSP version but in my opinion it was the absolute worst, the translation of it is highly inaccurate and includes lots of modern references and cringe worthy memes. The extras there don't make up for how awful the rest is. This is the version to get.\n\nFF4 is my favorite of all the old school FF's and I really enjoyed playing it again, this version adds plenty of new that kept me hooked and plenty of old that kept me nostalgic.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ipsen444/recommended/312750/","Ipsen444","Ipsen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ipsen444/","20 products in account","For many FFIV was a lost gem due to the original release being 25 years ago - the good news is that it's been remade so many times that can just about get it on any platform. The Steam version is same as the Android/IOS version, but I certainly feel it fits better on a computer than a phone or tablet, but that's just my opinion. Realistically it is just a modified version of the DS release, but I wouldn't say that it was overly superior - just different, sometimes even cumbersome. The DS had two screens which made for a nice experience when completing the maps as you has a map in front of you the entire time, but it wasn't blocking your view of game itself. You could avoid this by casting the spell "Sight" for a few MP to get a mini map. The issue with this was that 1. It costs MP which most wont be willing to spare for such a thing when you can just press the M key to get a full screen and more detailed map. 2. You would need to recast it. as well as other spells such as Float when you reach a new floor in a dungeon. Although these things aren't major, it did feel like the earlier versions were superior in this aspect.\n\nThe story is fantastic, but certainly short for a Final Fantasy game. Most need 40 or so hours to complete the story and maybe a few side quests, but this can all be done in 12 hours or so. This will appeal to some, but not others. The gameplay is dragged out by aquiring rare items to exchange for rare weapons and armour. Although it is at times tedious, the ends do justify the means. I loved this game, but I don't think it's the best Final Fantasy for a newcomer to the franchise to try first. It was a nice addition to have a "Hard Mode", but it certainly felt more tedious than difficult, mainly due to the constant status counters which would affect your party by silencing them, poison them, or put them to sleep. I wouldn't say it was more difficult, but it was more frustrating and even led to a few game overs at unexpected times.\n\nProto-Babil and Geryon were nice additions when the 3D versions were first released, but it would have been nice to have something a little more exclusive to this version. Even now, they are still pains to beat if you aren't completely booted and suited before battle.\n\nThe game is great as I have said, but it certainly has a lot of shortcomings too. This game isn't as appealing today as it would have been 25 years ago, but the updated 3D versions do try their best to fill the void a little. Personally I think this was a decent enough purchase at 50% off, plus I got FFIV:AY in a bundle, but I am not sure this game justifies £10 - especially when it's hardly made progress on the DS version which you can pick up for a song. I do recommend this game for all RPG and JRPG fans, but if you expect anything close to perfection then I wouldnt buy this version, however if this were on sale? It's more than worth a purchase to a diehard fan, or even someone who wants to just try something different.","January 18","true","80.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You have to use spells you rarely had to use, like slow, haste and reflect even for some normal encounters. Other than that, FF4 is the first game in the series to have a very good narrative, with memorable characters and events, as opposed to the previous "Light warriors vs. evil emperor" stories. The music is also very good as usual, particularly the battle themes. The only downside are the pixelated 3d models, as this game was originally for the DS.

Not the best re-make ever, but much better than most.\n\nPros:\nNew literal translation from Japanese.\nOriginal SNES area maps, complete with secrets.\nClassic JRPG game with new indie-style art.\nHard mode is actually challenging.\nWorks with a steam-configured generic controller.Cons:\nUneven art direction during the first 15 minutes.\nA few engine glitches during scene changes.\nVery amateur-looking battle menus.\nMist Dragon looks very uninspiring.\nTranslation: while I don't speak Japanese, comments from a professional translator lead me to believe that this is quite a literal translation of the original Japanese script. It's not the same as the US SNES release, and I haven't seen any frat-boy jokes yet. All good so far. Note that the English SNES release did change the story in some small ways, whereas this tends to keep Japanese cultural references.\n\nThe maps appear to be 3D tile renderings of the original SNES tile maps, complete with secret areas. This is good news because those old-school game designers sure knew how to make compelling explorable areas.\n\nThe art style is uneven to begin with, featuring a modern FMV, the in-game graphics, and two different styles of concept art. This doesn't make a great first impression, but once you get into the game things settle down. Be prepared for some cognitive dissonance when you first meet Rydia. The new 3D pixel art has its own charm. You'll get used to it, I promise. Some of the re-modelled bosses look pretty ordinary though.\n\nGameplay: this is very close to the original SNES game, with a few new features. The battle menus are frustratingly unresponsive, and look terrible. They look copied and pasted from a mobile release. Whoever made them has no appreciation for font sizing and use of space. You'll spend a lot of time waiting, and then frantically fighting the menu interface to enter commands.\n\nTL;DR: if you're sick of re-makes that suck out all the original gameplay and charm, try this version.

I wasn't sure at first if I wanted to play through it again but I'm very glad I changed my mind. This version surpasses the Gameboy Advance version to me. I've only beaten it on Normal and only unlocked 72% of the achievements but here's a list of my pros and cons.\n\nPros\n-Wide variety of characters with their own abilities (although the mages kind of overlap minus the summoner Rydia). You'll get to play as Yang the Monk who whoops ♥♥♥ and Edward the Bard who sucks ♥♥♥. You'll also get to use a Dark Knight, Dragoon, Paladin, Sage and others.\n-Great story, the DS version adds cutscense that add to some missing parts of the story from the previous versions of the game. Plus, the voice acting is great, (pretty sure Kain is voiced by the same actor that did Gaara from Naruto).\n-Lots of things to do, I beat the game in about 22 hours but there's also a hard mode and more things to do in the game, such as hidden ultimate weapons, secret bosses and an annoying rabit thing that I missed the achievement for doing all his damn things.\n-Summoning. I love summoning in a Final Fantasy game. This version they're called Eidolons and they're pretty sweet. You got your usual, Ifrit, Shiva, Ramuh, Chocobo that come with your summoner when she joins and some sweet hidden ones like Leviathan or Bahamut. The hidden ones are fun to find and are well worth the search and grinding neccesary to acquire them.\n-Combat, you can either have Wait or Active combat. Both are like what they sound like, Wait you get a chance to figure out what to do when it's your turn and Active keeps the battle going. I preferred active as it made things go by quicker and made the battles a bit harder.\n\nCons\n-Back to the variety of characters, you won't get to choose who you use. It's set who you will use when and where and that's why this is a like and dislike. It means I won't have to worry about leveling up all of my characters to stay close to the same level but what if I wanted to see if Edward stops sucking? Or bring someone else to the final boss other then the ones I'm supposed to use? It's not a huge gripe since I liked the five characters I had to take to the end but it still is a gripe.\n-Now I've only played it on Normal so far but I found the game to be a bit on the easy side. When you bring up the menu to start the game, there is an option to Continue. I thought this was for a quicksave but actually, it brings you back to where you were when you died. I got to one treasure chest guarded by a tough monster and instead of taking it back to when I last saved, it continued me right next to the treasure chest to try again. This isn't a huge con but it doesn't make me feel worried about going into a fight with low hp, cause I know I'll be able to continue right where I just was and try again.\n-Can't skip cutscense. I pushed every button I could and I had to watch them no matter what.\n\nOverall\n-I had alot of fun playing this game. I liked the characters, the story kept me interested and the game was challenging to the point where grinding was needed in order to keep going. I might take a break before trying hard mode but for now, I enjoyed my time with Final Fantasy IV. My rating for this game is a 9/10.","June 2, 2015","true","26.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I still recommend the game for FFIV newcomers, and for those who don't have PSPs or GBAs (or their emulators) but us returning players will find several issues.\n\nAs other reviewers have said, this is a port of the Android version of the game, which is itself a port of the DS Version.  Why they didn't simply port the 25th Anniversary Edition on the PSP, which was a) better-looking, b) higher-performance, c) more stable, and d) had more stuff, I have no idea.\n\nThis leads to many small issues that can, at times, seriously impact play.  For instance, whenever I'm at a shop and back out, sometimes the screen will go completely black, except for a small corner in the bottom right.  I fix it by opening the game menu, but it's still a very common and annoying problem.  The same thing occurs when I use any kind of item that features an animation in the World Map (such as Tents or cottages, or Emergency Exits), except this one does it all the time instead of only part of the time.  It's especially egregious with Sirens, because it will automatically pop back up only when it's one of your party members' turns to attack.  If you get Back Attacked or Surprise, you're outta luck unless you survive.  And for those of us who are trying to farm Pink Tails from Flan Princesses, we're boned if our entire party gets berserked (which should never happen if we're smart).\n\nThere is also another glaring bug.  Sometimes, while using a controller, my directional input will "hold," as if on the DS I were holding said directional input down.  It does this for several seconds, always varying in length, and sends the party either running in a direction I don't want them to go, or it scrolls through menu options over and over, sometimes in battle, making it hard to fight back.  The only fix I've found is to open the start menu (not the characters menu, but the Pause menu), hit the button opposite the one that is being held, and then hit the one that's being held.  This should unstick it (it has for me, at least).\n\nThe game itself also runs capped at 30FPS, which while understandable for an Android port of a DS game, I feel it is completely unacceptable for a game this small on PC.  Surely you could have taken the extra time to ensure smooth movement.  It's even worse in battles, where it's capped at 15FPS, which definitely is jarring on at least my eyes.\n\nThis being said, the game overall is alright.  The story is engaging, the DS's music is top-notch (what else would you expect of Uematsu?), and the game is challenging.  It's more difficult than other versions of IV, as the DS version is widely-considered to be the hardest of the lot, but that makes for great value for us returning players.  The ATB in this iteration aged like milk where the rest of the game aged like wine, but there's only so much you can do about that when you consider ATB was an experiment in this game.  The characterization is strong as well.  Now, the character polygons could use some better polishing (again, understandable given it's a port of a port).\n\nHOWEVER...\n\nAs I play through the game, I find a number of things that really are starting to detract from it.  Especially given that this is a game on the PC.  A port, yes, but still a PC game.  The big one is that, as far as I can tell, there is no bonus dungeon.  The GBA and PSP versions has the Lunar Ruins, and the mobile versions had the EX Dungeon.  As the iOS app does not have said dungeons, they were not included on PC.  Unacceptable.  PC has room for more memory and power than the iOS version, and as such, all bonuses that appear on other systems should be included here.  All we get is a New Game+ that basically lets us keep playing the story over and over.  I believe I can't even change my party members for the final battle either, which is also disappointing, as that is a feature easily implemented (as is the above).\n\ntl;dr:  If you're a new player of FFIV or you don't have a PSP and/or can't download a Gameboy Advance Emulator and ROM, I recommend it, as it is essentially the old game with a polished look and a bit harder, but it comes with its fair share of distractions.  If you're a returning player, save your money and get the PSP or GBA versions instead (assuming you have a PSP or can download a GBA emulator and FFIV Advance ROM).  They come with everything this game comes with, save for achievements and augments, the first of which you can live without, and the second of which only slightly impacted gameplay for me.\n\nThis being said, my earlier score was 7.5/10 as I just entered, before I found all of the missing stuff and distractions.  Now, after experiencing it all and with the experience of other versions of the game, I cannot rate it that high, and lower it to 6.5/10.","July 3, 2015","true","22.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you are looking for a good jrpg game you've found it, this one takes it back from the roots.\nI played it on DS but that version was ported to IOS, so this one gets the DS/IOS version which means this is exactly líka IOS (few things different)\nThere's so many great aspects to this game so i will list those that come to mind:\n\nPros:\n-Absolutely fantastic gameplay, the most enjoyable aspect of the game.\n-Has auto-attack mode which helps with grinding and making more quick to lv up.\n-Great graphics considering its a game from SNES and then NDS\n-Fascinating storyline with a lot of depth.\n-Has this real rpg feel, most rpg games are not close to the atmosphere a real rpg like this carries\n-Really cool characters, really deep background behind considering the former FF games did not really have that going.\n-Really well made cinematics/cut-scenes\n-Very long gameplay value, has new game +  as well where the most important stuff is carried over\n-Big world to explore and like the classic FF's its the opposite to linear. You can go explore everywhere.\n-Augments are a great add to the game and tinkering with characters abilities is so much fun.\n-If the game crashes or you die for some reason you will spawn at the location you where pretty much and the continue button at the main menu is a great add. Not much need for quick save (Not sure i would rely on this though).\n\nCons:\n-No Whyt summon from DS (not neccessarily a Con, just was something i enjoyed)\n-Augments are hard to find and there are many many missables in this game, really easy to make a mistake.\nEspecially because you only get 3 playthroughs and your failure to make the right decisions will continue to ruin the other 2-3 saves should you decide to master the game. So very well made perfect guide is much needed.\n-Crashes sometimes unexpectantly in random areas (More frequently than other steam games in my opinion).\n-The worst con of all is probably the low drop rate of special items like tails,pudding and rare summons.\nIts extremely low, especially for a single player game. It makes the most hc online drop rates look pathetic.\nYou can spend hundreds of hours farming for those items. It takes such a long time you tend to lose interest completely in mastering the game by getting those rare items. Its ALOT of effort.\n-Its from Squeenix :P (Good ol' Squaresoft fan here).","June 20, 2015","true","64.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Compared to the first 3 games this one stands out in multiple ways.  Mostly with its story and character design.  In the fist 10 minutes of the game the story takes center stage.  Usually when you play a FF game the best thing about the game is everything but the story (usually).  Most stories in FF are strange, overly drawn-out, and just downright confusing.  BUT with this game the sense of love and betrayal is almost imidiate.  The story follows Cecil a Dark Knight who discovers that there is more to life than death and taxes.\n\nThe dynamic between the two main characters (Cecil, and Kain) is great.  They both represent two ends of a spectrum, and they use this many times throughout the story.  This is made ever greater by and amazing support cast.  You even get to meet an ancient mage who lives on the moon, you also get to FLY to the moon which was mind blowing.  Too me this game set a presidence that all FF games followed afterwards.  The world came to life and the characters felt like they were real.  The greatest thing about playing this again years after its original release is that its fully realized in 3D.  Usually that big of a change can be a bad thing but they did it right.\n\nBut there always has to be bad with the good.  Where the story and setting were great the usual character progression system like jobs and roles, equipment, side quests, and collecting were a bit weak in this game.  An example is Cecil who starts the game off as a Dark Knight.  Eventually he becomes somthing elts (SPOILER WARNING) a Paladin.  This was hard to grasp as he became somewhat weaker.  Other characters were stuck being whatever job the game designated them to be.  FF3 was all about having the correct classes to get through a given area of the game and that was fun.  But the extreme change in game mechanics was a bit hard to bear.\n\nDespite me not liking the optional content it wasnt enough bad to hinder the game whatsover.  I can easily say this is one of my favorit FF games, if not one of my favoirt JRPGs of all time.  I got about 50 hours of gameplay out of it (IM a bit crazy with leveling) so I expect an average gamer to get about 30.  In the end I think this game is great and anyone that loves oldschool rpgs should give it a try.","May 27","true","48.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
