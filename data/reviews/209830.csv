"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AestheticGamer/recommended/209830/","AestheticGamer","AestheticGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AestheticGamer/","3606 products in account","Lone Survivor is a 2D psychological survival-horror game that pulls a lot from David Lynch and the Silent Hill series. I originally played it back when it came out from the developer's website, and have played through it a few times since also on Steam and on the PS3.\n\nYou play as a nameless character who is stationed in an apartment in a ruined city. Each day is a struggle, with limited supplies and draining willpower. Our character decides that he doesn't want to die alone, and sets off to find someone else to give meaning to his minimal existence. As he ventures out, he does meet other characters, but they all seem rather odd. Are they real, or a figment of his imagination? Is everything as it seems, or just an illusion?\n\nThe game has atmosphere in spades. While the graphics are low-res and pixely, the game has a fundamental understanding of the effect minimalism can have on games; like the original Silent Hill or Resident Evil, your mind fills in the blanks of details. Everything is just detailed enough to make out what everything is, but minimalistic enough that your imagination fills in the blanks. The game also utilizes some nice lighting and fog effects to help add to the atmosphere.\n\nThe audio is fantastic, with moody and stylistic music, wonderful sound design, and while unsettling, adds so much to the experience.\n\nThe game doesn't have jump-scares, but rather mood to unsettle and oppress you. Some will find this decision to make the game ultimately not very scary, but it remains tense and unnerving through tough obstacles and strange moments.\n\nThe game is a bit cryptic, which might turn some off from the title. Something that most may not see coming is that our character has human needs for things like sleep, food, and rest of mind. If you don't take good care of your character, it effects him. And to take good care of him means to search around for things that may help, such as gas for his stove to cook things or a game system and batteries to use to play it with. You collect food and supplies from the environment, and from utilizing these elements you can help tend to your characters needs. Or you can not, and just do the minimum effort to get by.\n\nBut choice in gameplay matters here. The game has about six different endings (one of them is a slight alteration of another ending though), with four available on the fist playthrough. Which ending you head towards is not determined by simple A or B choices, but by how you play the game. And most everything effects it. How often do you eat? How often do you sleep? Do you use the transfer mirrors to return home? Do you indulge in side-quest? Do fun but meaningless things to help your sanity? Do you help or hurt this guy? Do you kill or avoid enemies? All these choices add to an unseen score (that they finally show you after the credits) which determine which ending path you're going on. Well, that is except one ending, where you need to do a secret side-quest to obtain it.\n\nThere are a few points the game drags on a bit, particularly of note in the basement segment where your map is near useless and maneuvering can become rather confusing. After completing the game for the first time, you'll probably have more questions than answers. To really get the full experience of Lone Survivor means to play the game more than once, in fact certain areas, side-quests, and endings aren't even available until the second playthrough. This kind of commitment will turn some off from the game. And for some the survival element will feel superficial, as the game essentially will give you anything you need if you don't mind gaining 'ending points' to go on a certain bad ending path.\n\nBut it's also probably one of the truest Silent Hill games to release since Silent Hill stopped really being SH, and is one of the best 2D horror games to exist. To really dig into the game requires hard work to keep your sanity up and your spirits high, and rewards those that dig into the game's systems and figure it all out.\n\nLone Survivor is atmospheric, and in my opinion, one of the best 2D horror games in terms of atmosphere, and one of my personal favorites. It has sim-like mechanics not all will care to manage, but those that delve into it will be rewarded with interesting story twists, revelations, and new areas. It needs to be replayed to be fully experienced, but likely will attract a niche audience with its surrealism and mysterious storyline. For those less interested in the strange, there is a pretty solid old-school styled survival-horror game here. It may not have all the bells and whistles, but it's an ominous adventure while it lasts.","May 4, 2014","true","4.3"," 128 of 141 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","128","141","0","0"

The pacing can suffer a little from time to time as you wander around looking for what to do next. But aside from that, I enjoyed gradually making my way through the 7 hour campaign. The enemies are not found in abundance or varied but all placed with thought behind the room design.

[…] As far as I know, I’m the only one left. The Lone Survivor.'You\n__________________________________________\n\nIntroduction\n'Lone Survivor: The Director’s Cut' is one of these little games that shows how good indie titles can be.\nThis little pixelated horror adventure suceeds where many huge (Horror-)AAA-titles fail nowadays: Creating a deep and atmospheric experience full of creepy and mysterious situations without relying too much on (cheap) tricks like e.g. jumps scares behind every corner.\n\nAfter the outbreak of an unknown disease the nameless protagonist – only called 'You' – tries to survive in this harsh and cruel world. He lives withdrawn in a lost apartment building, unsure if he is still sane or if everything he sees is only a hallucination. Due to the questionable mental stability and the omnipresent problem of starvation he doesn't know how long he may be able to stay alive. First of alll 'You' doesn’t want to die alone – therefore he starts exploring the apartments and looking for other survivors of the catastrophe.\n\nWhile exploring the remnants of the 'good old times', 'You' will be confrontend with deep fears and mysterious situations, monsters and hallucinations, unsure what is real and what is just a trick of his own mind. Armed with a flaslight, batteries and a gun with very limited ammunition he makes his way into the unknown depths of the apartments, facing mysterious horrors while trying to keep the rest of his sanity and finding enough food to eat and time to sleep. The only 'true‘ friends he has in this apocalyptic world are a plant and a plush doll – but is it really a sign of sanity to talk to them? Who knows…\n\nThe story is short but well done and the dialogues make you actually care about the characters, their well-being and their behavior, questioning the situations that 'You' has to face in and what’s really happening in front of him as everything may change in the blink of an eye. And in the end every step and decision you‘ve taken may affect him.\nUntil 'You' will see the end of his journey it will take approximately four up to maybe five hours (I finished the game already two times outside of Steam, therefore my short gaming time is no sign of lacking experience). Fortunately the replay value is quite high due to many different endings based on your choices during 'You‘s' journey and a NG+ Mode with some additional content.\n__________________________________________\n\nGraphics and Audio\nTo cut it short: It’s a pixelated game based on Flash Engine so you shouldn’t expect too\nmuch – but for this it does quite a good job. The games‘ soundtrack is fantastic and fits most of the times absolutely perfect. It’s creepy and catchy at the same time, giving you the chills in the right moments.\nThe pixelated graphics are well done and you can see that the different appartmens, rooms and scenes were crafted carefully and with a love for details. The game feels like a great trip in good old 2D-Horror Games and has a deeper atmosphere than many huge titles nowadays.\n__________________________________________\n\nCons\nUnfortunately 'Lone Survivor' somehow feels bulky and using the inventory or selecting items can be quite annoying from time to time (just as using your gun in my opinion). The controls aren’t very comfortable despite some hotkeys, remapping them isn‘t possible and due to the restrictions of flash games there is no easy solution for controller support aside from third party software – a fact where the game would benefit from heavily. That’s kind of sad as the PS3-version has both controller support and achievements (that are somehow missing in the PC version).\n__________________________________________\n\nConclusion\nThis game may give you the chills while taking you on a little journey about sanity, surviving and the horrors that are hiding either in the shadows or in your own mind. Sure, it has some flaws and edges but the overall experience is intense and it suceeds in creating a deep and nice atmosphere when 'You' tries to hide from the strange creatures or faces them – realizing that he’s actually out of ammunition. Moreover it has a brilliant soundtrack. Seriously.\n\nI’d rate it 9 out of 10 points and definitely recommend the game - it's worth the money, even without a sale.\n\nThis endorsement approved by The Reviewers' Union, providing better standards for reviews and reviewers.","March 16","true","2.8"," 50 of 55 people (91%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","91","50","55","4","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Luna_Nyx/recommended/209830/","Luna_Nyx","♥ Gia ♥","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Luna_Nyx/","398 products in account","Ah, Lone Survivor, a 2-D retro survival horror game that makes most of nowadays "horror" games feel ashamed. It's not the spookiest, but it's definitely tense as all hell.\n\nFirst off, I'm gonna say, the difficulty of this game is truly remarkable, even on normal mode. Normal mode on other modern survival horror games basically holds your hand for the whole playthrough, with a puzzle now and then to hinder your progress, or they are rather linear. This game is hard. First, you get tired AND hungry at times. Second, food items might be common, but mostly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ones. You can scavenge for food, cook it, collect water dripping from the ceiling with a bucket, stuff like that.\n\nThird, and my favorite, what made games like the first Resident Evil true masterpieces:\n\nNot enough ammo for every single enemy that you come across. So, you gotta play smart, hide from the monsters, distract them, use items, basically, you gotta think before you waste even a single bullet, because if you do, you are going to regret it later on.\n\nI can describe this game for common folks with a single sentence. "It's like Silent Hill but 2D". That's what most of the ones that have played this game use to describe it. The story has something to do with the outbreak of a disease that turns people into some kind of faceless zombies that wander around all the time. You are locked inside of your apartment, and that's pretty much how you survived, but now you gotta find a way out of that dreaded building, having to face tons of enemies with just a few bullets, so to speak. The game's got multiple endings, so there is that, too.\n\nThis game might be short-ish compared to other stuff I've played before, but it's definitely worth it. It's nothing short of frustrating at times. The game starts nice and slow, but once you reach the basement, you can actually feel the difficulty spike going up your ♥♥♥. Hard. No lube. It was kind of linear before that, with a map telling you were to go, but once you reach the basement, say bye bye to that, and be prepared for backtracking, corridors full of enemies, running out of ♥♥♥♥ing batteries or ammo, getting lost, or falling into death traps.\n\nThe music is pretty good, nothing that extreme, just ambiental tracks that really help the game. The controls are unremarkable, standard 2D controls, move left and right, aim, shoot, interact, that's about it.There is a pause button, but the inventory isn't a safe place to hide.\n\nThe graphics are akin of SNES games and stuff like that. The visuals are nice, even if it gets really dark at times.\n\nAll in all, I would recommend this game to any fan of survival horror games out there. It can be unforgiving for the casual everyman, so be prepared if you are one of those.","July 26, 2015","true","21.9"," 46 of 51 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","46","51","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/invecta/recommended/209830/","invecta","OZWA","http://steamcommunity.com/id/invecta/","100 products in account","Lone Survivor is a difficult game to reccommend.  I've been hearing good things about it from friends and various sources since its release, and I tried to play it when the Director's Cut edition first came out -- but it did little to hold my attention and subsequently collected pixelated dust for months and months. A few days ago, I forced myself to play it again at the behest of a friend who was convinced I was robbing myself of an amazing experience.  While I wouldn't call the experience 'amazing', I don't consider it a terrible one.  Lone Survivor is a game that has its moments of brilliance, but all too often this brilliance is marred by mechanics, lazy dialogue, and design theory.\n\nThe Good\nWe'll begin with what Lone Survivor has in its favor. Lone Survivor features a cohesive aesthetic, a persistent, chilling atmosphere, an engaging, apposite soundtrack and good pacing/length.\n\nThe Aesthetic:\nThe aesthetic design in this game is tight, cohesive, and remains this way throughout the entire playthrough.  Environments are detailed and fit nicely next to character models.  Characters are semi-detailed sprites, and all are animated well.  The Man Who Wears a Box was especially well rendered.  Enemies and corrupted environments are visceral and exploding with gore. There's nothing that stood out as exceptional to me in Lone Survivor's aesthetic, except for one: The text is presented in absurdly low-quality.  Reading it was a bit of a struggle at first, and even when I was used to it it was still ugly and strained my eyes.  I understand the intention behind the font, but readability need not be sacrificed in a retro font.\n\nSound Design\nLone Survivor's sound design is possibly its best feature.  Sound effects are harsh, untempered, and low quality, which help augment the visceral nature of the environment around the player.  Monster screeches sound more like white noise and synthetically generated wave forms rather than actual grunts and gutteral groans, and I believe this helps add to Lone Survivor's unique atmosphere.\n\nLone Survivor also has an apposite soundtrack that enhances the gameplay and conflates with the environment and atmosphere.  I find that many sountracks either don't do enough to augment the atmosphere of a game, or they are too zealous and begin to drown out other elements.  This one fits nicely somewhere in the middle.\n\nPacing // Game Length:\nThe game's pacing is quite good as well -- things develop at a satisfying rate, and the game doesn't hang on one section too long nor fill itself with useless padding; while at the same time still offering those who wish for an extended stay side-quests and multiple endings.\n\nThe Bad\nLone Survivor seems to work hard to make itself a very neutral experience -- for every good design decision or execution, there seems to be a poor one following closely in its wake.  Lone Suvivor suffers from sluggish mechanics, a rather banal pool of enemies, a narrative that is just a little too self-conscious of its esoteric nature, uninspired dialogue, and an underdeveloped character cast.\n\nMechanics:\nPerhaps the most crucial flaw in Lone Survivor lies within its game mechanics.  Controls are clunky and there seems to be a slight input delay for most actions -- for instance, many times I would take an extra, undeserved hit from an enemy when using the flare hotkey due to the delay.  Combat is simple, basic, and unengaging.  Players are given the option to avoid combat using the stealth 'system' (if you can call it a system -- hit X to hide in pre-designated spaces, then hit X to unhide), but this is equally dull and boring.  There's an elaborate cooking system, but I also found this to be unengaging.  Food heals the protagonist as well as boosts his mental health, one of the metrics used to determine which ending you get.  Nothing's broken, but it's not ideal either.  Everything works and functions at an acceptable level, but nothing is compelling.  Because the game's mechanics were so prosaic, I felt absolutely no want nor desire to play the game based on them alone.  That meant that the narrative and characters had to do some heavy lifting -- which they didn't quite do, as we'll discuss in a moment.  To summarize:  Aside from the frustrating input delay and clunky controls, the mechanics work in this game.  They're just too basic or too dull to make for a fun or engaging experience.  I think many might argue that these clunky controls build tension in the game , as many other survival horror games have similar setups.  Yet that's an argument without weight, and one that excuses lazy or lackluster development strategies.  Tension could (or should) still be maintained regardless of the control setup.  Limiting a player's options is an acceptable strategy to build tension, but the options that remain available should be fluid, entertaining, and satisfying.\n\nNarrative, Dialogue, and the Cast:\nLone Survivor thrusts you into its narrative in media res, but then does very little to supply the player with the backstory.  There are a few mentions by characters that hint at the past, but specifics are almost non-existent.  In fact, vague ambiguity is the main problem with the narrative: It's presented to the player as a large mystery to be solved, yet frustratingly little is resolved in the end.  It's a narrative that seems rife with potential and one that, unfortunately, instead only delivers minimal emotional impact.  Characters aren't given enough time nor dialogue to develop into something the player will actually care about.  And about the dialogue -- it's very hit or miss.  Sometimes it's fitting and poignant and interesting.  Other times it's tacky, too colloquial, or entirely too self-aware of its attempts to unsettle the player.  Many of the character developments and dialogue just feel like cheap, thoughtless shots that are meant to add tension.  For some, this might work.  For me, this only served to pull me further out of the world.\n\nLack of Motivation:\nTying all of these other issues together severly limited my motivation to finish the game.  There are mysteries (in theory) to discover, but there's so little information given to the player that I had little interest in solving them.  There are characters with which to interact, but I had no reason to care about them and felt no connection.  I felt rather insulted by the cheap shots in the dialogue with regards to generating 'tension' or 'suspense'.  I felt bored with the fact that there were only a couple of enemies that appeared throughout the entire game, and that all of them featured very predictable AI patterns.  There were only a couple of bosses, and both of those fights were inane and unimaginative.  In short, I had to force myself to finish the game. There are multiple endings, but I felt no want or desire to put the effort in to see the others (I did research them, however).\n\nThe Gestalt\nThose who enjoyed the game and reccommended it to me argued against my complaints and averred that it was the gestalt of Lone Survivor and its experience that caused it to transcend its flaws.  From my perspective, this isn't a valid argument.  Something must carry the weight in order to deliver an excellent experience, and I don't see any element doing this in Lone Survivor. Lone Survivor isn't a terrible game, it's just a boring, unresolved one.\n\nSo there it is. If you feel that Lone Survivor is still something that interests you after reading my complaints, pick it up and form your own opinions about it.  However, if you want a truly compelling survival horror game that delivers both stellar gameplay and a fascinating, coherent narrative -- look elsewhere.","January 8, 2014","false","5.1"," 157 of 238 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","157","238","0","7"

There is no power and supplies are limited. Every day you leave the safety of your humble bedroom in search of food and a solution to the mysterious, surrealistic hallucinations that are happening to you.\n\nWhat lurks beyond your apartment 206 walls are faceless mutants that only have a sense of smell to find you. This sense of smell leads them to find rotting chunks of meat that you can find in refrigerators and leave to bait them. Once you've dropped some meat, you can hide in specific areas and watch as they travel past you.\n\nYou do find a gun, but ammunition is scarce and these wandering mutants take a few bullets to put down. Firing is slow, reloading is slow, but that comes with the genre. How can you be terrified of a mutant walking toward you when you can instantly kill it? Well how can you be terrified when you have a gun to take them down?\n\nLone Survivor has all of the makings of a survival horror game or at least a point and click adventure without clicking anything. The game is keyboard only which under normal circumstances, I have no problem with, but I do prefer a controller. The real problem is there are plenty of keys to use and sometimes finding the correct key in the glow of your monitor can be a daunting task. There are keys for reloading, shoot and interact share a key, left, right, flashlight, map, leave meat, show the inventory and two other things. Eight keys in all and even more for gamma correction and so on.\n\nThe game excels in an atmosphere and creepy vibe. Flesh covered walls you need to cut through. Coming across a party going on in a room while there are threatening mutants outside. Having to find a girl's stuffed animal. Saying hi to a plant as you pass by. Finding a girl locked away behind bars. You are a lone survivor though. How can you be lone and yet have all of these people inhabiting your wrecked apartment building? You're the only one tat seems to know there's any danger going on. Every so often you experience a dream or hallucination in the form of a cut scene that plays out and only adds to the odd experience. One cut scene has you and someone else in chairs discussing pills. It adds to the surrealism that the game brings.\n\nThe radio in your bedroom and your plush cat toy are your only source of friendship. The radio gives hints as to what you should be doing and you will find cards that tell you what stations to tune into. Its a good way to bring you back to a game if you go long periods without playing. After all the best way to play is in the dark after midnight and who can stay up that late?\n\nI know that your character sure gets tired easy. He gets exhausted as much as he gets hungry and when he gets tired, you need to return to your room every ten or so minutes. Its only a constant recommendation. Something might happen if you take too long, but its never anything that you need to do right then and there.\n\nTo make travel easier, you can look into a mirror and teleport your way through back to your apartment. It adds to the surreal nature of the game, and it becomes mandatory because you need to fight the whims of your character. He gets tired and hungry as we all would in a world of sheer darkness and famine, but he refuses to do things like traverse a hole he had gone through before. Its a good way to force you to use the mirrors as a sort of tutorial. Doors are locked and your character mentions coming back there later.\n\nYou get a map of the apartment level with all of its rooms. Everything is marked, locked doors, blockages, open doors and so on. It feels small enough to learn your way around over several trips, but you can still get lost. Places to go are marked with giant question marks, but the problem is, these never go away, even long after you've explored everything in the room.\n\nThere are plenty of items such as can openers, gas tanks for stoves and hams that need to be cooked that manage to still be fine in a refrigerator with no power. You can see an item's description in the menu. Some things are obvious, but its the food that you need to see if its spoiled before you consume it. There's also an option to talk with objects, such as your sleepy cat doll. Whatever keeps the crazy isolation away I suppose.\n\nWhile I do feel the menu is a bit cumbersome to use, it keeps you in the action because its just a minimal series of items at the top of the screen. I'd rather stay in a game like this than hop to a menu. When you see an item that can be interacted with, you still need to delve into the menu and use the item when it could have been streamlined so you just use it at the proper place. I can chalk it up to survival horror game design forcing you to figure out that you need to use a can opener on cans.\n\nYou can find red, green and blue pills scattered around here or there. The choice to take them is yours, but I learned from arcade games in the 90s that winners don't use drugs. They accumulate to a sort of score at the end determined by what food, pills and choices that you made such as pushing drugs on someone.\n\nAs a character, you're alone and sanity has gone with everyone else. You're wearing a medical mask that might keep out whatever mutating apocalyptic virus there is, but it also makes him look like he has a giant smile in this shambled building shooting "mutants" while downing pills.\n\nLone Survivor feels like a good, simple game, but once all the mutants are dead the challenge goes with them. New areas have new mutants, but roaming through an empty wasteland for the fourth time can get dull. With an area so small, its never frustrating and the game lays out your objectives in a good manor to keep you going. Other times you'll need to check cabinets that you've already checked previous to being stumped in order to find a hole to crawl through.\n\nIts easy to recommend for its atmosphere, surrealism and simplicity. Its a good environment that takes you to a different place where there are no clear answers only your interpretations.","October 6, 2015","true","1.4"," 28 of 29 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","28","29","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrJinxed/recommended/209830/","MrJinxed","Jinxtah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrJinxed/","511 products in account","I really knew next to nothing about the game when I started. I had only read a few lines of positive feedback on it, and seen about 5 minutes of gameplay on youtube, after which it had captured my interest enough for me to take a chance on it, and I'm thoroughly glad I did. It turned out to be one of the best indie titles I've played. The reason for this is perhaps because I went in blind with no real prior knowledge or spoilers about the game. There's something to be said for experiencing a game in this manner. I thoroughly recommend it.\n\nAs for the story.. Well it's rather hard to talk too much about the story in detail. Partly because it's fairly weird (no, really), and partly because there isn't much of a story at all. It's one of those kind of games where the whole world has gone mad, you are seemingly one of the very few survivors of what must have been an event that ended civilization.\n\nYou wake up in your apartment, which acts as your safe zone, where you can sleep (save), and prepare food and drink, and other things. Once you venture outside, you quickly find out that in order to survive, you have to deal with the monsters that now roam the halls and inhabit the other apartments.\nOne way to deal with them is to shoot them with your trusty pistol, though you can't just go all gung ho, because if you run out of ammo, you're in for a rough time since there are no other weapons in the game. However, there are various ways of getting more ammo along the way, so it's not the end of the world. I ran out of ammo once, and it took me quite a while to get more, but in the meantime I took the more stealthy approach, which is absolutely viable, and perhaps even preferable for large parts of the game.\n\nThe controls are a bit clunky if things have to go fast in terms of inventory management while monsters are about. The reason for this is that there is no way of stopping time. It'll just keep ticking away regardless of what you're doing, which means monsters aren't going to stand around and wait for you to open your inventory, find the right item, and use it. They will just make short work if you while you are otherwise occupied with your inventory.\nThis is a good thing though, as having time stop just because you want to open up your inventory and find items in the middle of combat really breaks the immersion, so be prepared to run away to a "safe" area before taking care of your health or mental state.\n\nSpeaking of inventory management, you will often find that you get hungry or tired as you explore the game, and since you can die of both starvation and exhaustion in this game, you'll always have to be aware of how much food and drink  you have on you, and how much time it'll take you to get back to your apartment in order to sleep in case you don't have caffeine on you. You can even die if you run out of batteries for your flashlight, so you have to watch out how much you have it turned on.\n\nSpeaking of food. You might not always have the right equipment in your kitchen to cook what you find along the way either, so you'll also need to find the proper cookware if you want to prepare the various foods in the game. Apparently, you were a big fan of ordering in before the world turned bad, because you don't seem to own much of anything in that department.\n\nThe game took me a little under 5 hours to complete, and I really enjoyed every moment of it. I imagine this is much like what the original Silent Hill would have been like if they had gone with a 2-d side scroller instead of 3d.\n\nIt's well worth your time and money, so I say go for it if you're a fan of the genre. You won't regret it.","November 12, 2014","true","4.8"," 33 of 38 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","33","38","0","2"

It has the same thing that SH2 has, and that is a great atmosphere. The game doesn't scares you, it makes you feel unnerved and unsafe, just like SH2. AND also the game is about how far can the human psyche go until it consumes the individual, also like SH2 without the journey to meet your dead wife. So overall, long live to this game, Silent Hill, horror, and my mother.\n\nPS: There is something that may ♥♥♥♥ some people off (not me). The game has a food and sleep system, that makes you scavenge through the places for finding food if your character ask for it, or that makes you go back to your bed if you are tired. This end up adding backtrack if you want to be fine, but I was so absorbed by the game that I just didn't gave a toss about that. I'll copypaste the last sentence of the previous paragraph.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wayner/recommended/209830/","wayner","Big Gulp","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wayner/","182 products in account","This is still one of my favorite games ever. Is it sometimes reminiscent of Silent Hill? Absolutely. Does it feel like a clone? Not in the slightest. Does asking rhetorical questions make me feel like a phony? You betcha.\n\nThose looking to get the game for action-packed fights, or even more than one weapon, are going to be disappointed. The game is more about exploration and, in later playthroughs, taking care of yourself.\n\nThe game sort of draws you in initially by seeming like your typical survival horror game, only pixelated and with really cool atmosphere. While it still does have really cool atmosphere, it becomes obvious very quickly that the story of this game is about more than just a zombie outbreak or whatever. In lots of ways, you could argue that all of that side of the game is just metaphorical anyway. While I wouldn't be able to confidently explain all aspects of the story, I can see some pretty touching themes about coping with loss, as well as free will vs. fate: Do you have the courage to keep moving on after loss, or will you just stagnate? Will you take your future into your own hands, or will you give in to what you believe is your "true" nature?\n\nThe choices you make affect the ending of the game, and if you're anything like most people who have spent their lives being conditioned by videogames, you will get a pretty bad ending on your first try, which is in part due to the fact that killing enemies counts against your mental score. The idea of NOT killing living things in a survival horror game is going to feel very foreign, and sometimes, you're going to need to really work your brain to figure ways around conflict. It's really neat trying to find the "good" way to handle enemies rather than taking a gun to them, which the game clearly implicates as being the easy way out. It wants you to show some of the most powerful traits that human beings possess: resilience and compassion.\n\nIn more direct terms of things, the game's just fun to look at, play, and listen to. Most of the time any item you pick up is going to be something unique. There are so many food items, and it's fun to try them out and see how the main character likes them. There's even some stuff with cooking later on, or other things you can do with the food. Sprites are all really well done. Music (or atmospheric sound) is always spot on. The game also keeps tossing in new twists or things to do and it never really gets old, despite never giving you more than one kind of gun (WHOA!).\n\nI guess that's about it. Some say the main character is kind of whiny, but I don't think those people really fully appreciate the kind of situation this guy is in, or for how long he's been in it. It's a cool game with a cool story and if you've gone through some kind of painful loss, there are definitely things that you could relate to in it. The creator, Jasper Byrne, is also a super cool guy who has even responded to emails I've sent him. Mr. Byrne, if for some reason you read this, hello, and I have bought three versions of this game. I'd love to see more like it.","January 16, 2015","true","0.1"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","14","16","0","0"

If you're a fan, of 2D Side-Scrollers, and Survival Horror this game is for you. Having an amazing retro style to it, like if you imagine if Silent Hill 2 was in 2D but have a soundtrack as amazing as the proper game. The music in this game is fantastic, from the ambient tracks through out the game, distorted zombie sounds when you encounter enemies, and to full tracks with vocals in some of the cut-scenes, it adds significantly to the atmosphere.  The game play is very easy to get a hang of except for maybe occasional difficulty to navigate the map especially when you're trying to run away from a creature you can't fight in a hard to navigate area. The atmosphere is outstanding, with added survival needs like food and sleep, it add a lot to the experience. Puzzles are pretty straight-forward and linear but may in some parts make you scour the whole area looking for one small item to progress. The characters mental state mechanism will make you think how you tackle the situations, as every action you take will have consequences, and in the end it may be better to take the non-violent approach, no matter how unlikely that sounds. Add to it the fact that there is no one way of playing through this game, and the more times you replay this game, more new things you will find, it just adds to the replayability of this game to compensate for the game being  only 4-5 hours long. So if you're looking for a atmospheric thrill, with interesting characters, fantastic soundtrack, multiple endings, and a cat  I would absolutely recommend this game as it is a fantastic addition to the ever growing Indie video game library.","January 27, 2014","true","18.1"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

Now, it's safe to say that Jasper Byrne's Lone Survivor: The Director's Cut had proved me wrong, dead wrong. Originally a 2012 title and later updated to the Director's Cut version free of charge in 2013, Lone Survivor tells a story about a nameless man trying to survive in a world ravaged by a disease that turns almost, if not, all of it's inhabitants into mindless zombie-like monsters. Supplies dried, he's forced to leave his apartment behind after so long to forage provision and find other survivors while constantly trying to keep his sanity in check.\n\nThis game is a purely a throwback to the survival horror goodness that games nowadays lack. The writing and visuals works excellent in portraying the madness of how the new world has become and the lines between reality and insanity becomes blurred with each passing day. The game plays in a 2D manner and you can navigate the masked man right and left, also facing the front and the back. Every level will have a map which you have to find and it's vital to keep your bearings intact because not only does the area looks vaguely similar at times but there's a chance that the room will appear differently when you came back. While exploring, you have to keep your hunger and tiredness in check, which are noted by dialogue cues. Items can be combine and cook to provide more significant bonuses when consumed. Lone Survivor also relies heavily on the pocket flashlight (Silent Hill, anyone?) which uses battery when lit. You can't examine things if there's no light so there's a need in moderation. Same goes with the handgun you'll find early on in the game. As you can already guess, ammo are scarce so more often then not, sneaking your way through would be the best course of action.\n\nThe pixelated graphics works surprisingly well for the game! That, added with the amazing sounds and creepy lighting, will keep you on your toes whenever you enter a new area. Even though the monsters appear blocky at time, I can guarantee you that pants will be ♥♥♥♥ (or at least a little scream) when the thing suddenly lunges or jump up to the ceiling! The game also dealt with psychological horror aspects so do expect some disturbing scenes while playing.\n\nDespite the praises, Lone Survivor is no where a perfect title. The problem particularly arises from the controls in my view which I'll list them in a bit down below.\n\n\nPROS\nThis game is just plain CREEPY & DISTURBING! The setting, writing and the lighting sets up the mood quite nicely and oh boy, you're in for a scare! Be sure to turn the volume up as well!\nIn general, the sound in the game is just fantastic and are bound to make your hair stands on a few occasions That damn screeching sound when the thing detects you...\nThe soundtrack, if I might add, is just phenomenal. I highly recommend you picking up the DLC if you have the extra cash.\nThe game runs exceptionally well, even in my dated PC, at a constant 60 FPS with no hiccups whatsoever.\nResource management is pretty well done, although there are some that argue the hunger and tiredness increases to fast. I personally have no trouble with this since it encourages exploration and at the same time, that means facing unnecessary dangers.\nMultiple endings depending on your choices and state of mind at the end.\n\nCONS\nLack of any controller support. This is, by far, the biggest flaw that Lone Survivor has for me. I prefer an option to play my 2D side-scroller games with a controller, please. The keyboard control honestly felt a little off and I often misclick the buttons leading to my untimely, i.e. cheap, death. Oh, to make it worse, there's no way to reconfigure the controls and you can't exactly view the controls except when clicking the little note beside your bed. It's a shame since the game has already been updated to a Director's Cut version.\nThere's no option to play the game in Windows mode, or at least not that I know of. I don't have any trouble with this since I play the game in full screen anyways but I'm sure there are others that appreciate the option to play in windowed mode.\nThe game lacks all of the basic Steam functionality, even Cloud saving which is obviously stated on the store page! The overlay and screenshot works fine though.\nRelatively small pool of monsters to face.\nI find it weird that you can't change the direction of where your character is facing in shooting mode. If, for example, you have to deal with 2 monsters on each side, you have to manually exit shooting mode, turn the other side, and enters it again.\nOverall, I think Lone Survivor: The Director's Cut has been a fantastic experience! Despite the flaws in the game's controls, it managed to make me yell out quite a few times during key moments in the game and for that, I give it a horrifying 4 / 5! Highly recommended for any horror games fan!\nPersonally, I think the price tag of $15 is a bit too steep for a 4 years old game but the game itself is pure gold and any survival horror enthusiasts shouldn't missed out on this. If you ever managed to find it on sale, then by all means, go for it. Money well spent, I say.\n\n\nFor similar Steamified Reviews and Giveaways, please visit http://www.steamified.com/.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lintire/recommended/209830/","Lintire","Lintire","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lintire/","194 products in account",""The games of yesterday, today!"\n\nIndie games have something of a problem when it comes to wearing their inspirations on their sleeves. Time and again you'll hear touted roots in Legend of Zelda, Earthbound, 90s platformers - and in this case, Silent Hill. Lone Survivor hasn't so much said it's been inspired by Silent Hill as much as it has carved off James Sunderland's face and is proudly displaying it for the world to see.\n\nEspecially fitting considering how paper thin and two-dimensional this game is compared to the real deal.\n\nEvery part of this game is bad so we're going to break it down in steps.\n\nIt's ugly. While predating the worldwide novelty of low resolution pixel art coming to a screeching halt, Lone Survivor manages to be ugly on its own merit. Filters, overlays and soft shading don't disguise the absolute amateur attempts at anything resembling human characters, to the point where it's legitimately hard to make out overall shapes, nevermind details.\n\n"What the hell is that?" is usually a response you want to body horror, not to regular bodies.\n\nThis isn't aided by self defeating gameplay. You actually have 4 ways to deal with enemies:\n\nYou can set down an item that stuns them for a time\nYou can lure them past a hiding spot, or use an elongated hiding spot to shuffle past them\nYou can shoot them for damage\nYou can clear space by shooting their feet and forcing them back\nProblem is that the entire game is divided and dictated by a moral choice system that means you will only ever use two of these at a time. And with only two main enemy types in the game, this means that even with a 2-3 hour playtime, you're going to get bored. 2 hours and it manages to be a repetitive mess.\n\nSomehow even the sound direction manages to unimpress - the constant static that the zombies emit has beaten records in how quickly it gets annoying, and your classic Silent Hill "panic tunes" constantly trigger when there's nothing happening.\n\nWalking down an empty hallway? Time for some heartbeats and tempo. In a crowded room, 3 Thin Men and a Fatso right up your rear? No room for tunes, baby, not over all this ear-bending, monotonous screeching static.\n\nThat's one Silent Hill classic element tossed to the winds. What about the other, what about the narrative? Good question. What about it?\n\nEvery single character, plot line, ending, and interaction is obfuscated and muddled to the point of absurdity. Everything is a metaphor, or not really there, or is speaking in riddles with no answers that nothing prompted, and it all ends in a lovely "Was it ever really real?".\n\nIt's pretentious trash. Everything is so completely convinced that it's all so deep and meaningful and smart, with every plot thread busy jamming its thumb up its colon.\n\nWith the amount of theory-baiting this game does, the developer could have just thrown up a blank canvas with "May as make up your own story, frankly we're not interested" with a bullet point list of prompts to get you started. Who is "her"? Why does the man wear a box? How many of these lines are just references to other, better games? You decide.\n\n"You know my name, so why don't you say it?"\n\nAll five endings over 9 hours. Three distinct ones, one incredibly minute variation, one joke ending. That represents 3.5 playthroughs, all done to explore if there really is any merit behind this game.\n\nLone Survivor is for one niche - Silent Hill fans who are desperate for more similar content and don't mind a massive quality drop in everything. Made by a fan who couldn't see the forest for the trees, it's low grade imitation beef.\n\nThe soundtrack is nice. You can buy that on bandcamp. Anything else, you're looking in the wrong place. I don't recommend this game to anyone.","June 3","false","9.3"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"

And while the idea of a lone guy in an apocalyptic world with zombie-like-monsters is seen too many times already, I would like to point out that that is not the highlight of the game. The highlight of the game is the sanity of our character, and thereby your sanity. The things that is going down in this game is illogical (even by psychological game standards), and it hints at the story outside of our characters head. You will find yourself questioning most of what happens in this game like:\nIs there really an apocalypse?\nIs the characters you stumble across people from our protagonist's life or just reflections of his own mind?\nAnd what is up with that ending? (No matter what ending you get, this one counts).\n\nTo top that off I think that the art style is wonderful, the controls is nice and the soundtrack is plain up amazing.\nI will say that your hunger and sleep meter could have been presented better than just the game spamming you with messages, but all in all I love this game. It is definitely one of my favorite survival horror games, if not my favorite.","August 27, 2015","true","12.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

While the 2D gameplay feels a bit strange at first, after a while it all feels like it fits. The game itself is relatively short, it can easily be completed within 3-6 hours even if you go into it without any idea what you're doing. Though it's a very interesting game in itself, it has a few drawbacks. At regular intervals your character will constantly need food and rest, trying to attend to these needs can get frustrating at times. While the story and cutscenes are all interesting they are painfully cryptic, constantly leaving you guessing at what is happening. There are multiple endings, but two of them are nearly idendical, and getting the best ending is most likely impossible without some kind of walkthrough, as the hints to what you need to do in order to obtain those endings are extremly subtle. All in all, I think the experience is worth the price tag.\n\nPros:\n+The 8-bit graphics are very well-made\n+Gameplay is unique\n+Multiple paths and endings\n+The enviroment and Story are eerie, disturbing, and interesting\n+Great Soundtrack\n\nCons:\n-If you're looking for a super-intense horror experience, you may want to look elsewhere\n-Your character can be too needy\n-Story is cryptic\n-Getting better endings may require a walkthrough","November 29, 2014","true","0.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The graphics style pulls off deliberately lacking visuals, which, in a horror game, is a good thing when visual details are shrouded in mystery, and not hi-rez and in your face.  Unfortunately, now we come to the gameplay ... all 4 hours of it.  Due to the 2D perspective, the map is difficult to follow and encounters with the 3 total monster types often leave you with no choice but to shoot them, as avoiding them is only possible in a few context sensitive areas.  Survival through food and rest feels off because there is no meter to tell how badly you need either, except for the main character complaining without warning.  Finally, the story becomes complete nonsense the further you progress, leaving tons of questions un-answered to where horror game veterans may sense a common ending cliche approaching.  A triumph in atmosphere, but lacking elsewhere.  Tread lightly!","July 3, 2012","true","1.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","5","6","2","0"

To be honest though, I'm just plain neutral about this one. I think it's far from a bad game, but it is far from a great one as well.\n\nI enjoyed the art style and music, the atmosphere is superb. Gameplay is decent as well, and though it could be a bit difficult to find my way around, i managed to beat it.\n\nMy main issue with the game is the story/lore behind this game.\n\nYou ever play Silent Hill 2? Remember how a lot of the enemies, and even Silent Hill itself, was all based around what was going on in the main characters life? (Such as that one enemy that spits at you, was thought to represent your wifes 'harsh words', and it's death animation was supposed to represent someone thrashing on a hospital bed?) That game was a puzzle, and if you managed to put all the pieces together, you got a ♥♥♥♥ed up (but amazing) picture.\n\nThis game feels like a puzzle you bought at a flea market. It's missing a lot of pieces, and the one's that are there don't fit together well.\n\nFor example, "The Man That Wears A Box." Who is he? What is he? Is he meant to represent something? You don't know. Nor does the game tell you. Same with The Director. What's his story? Why does he give you free items? Or whomever writes up about your actions about the game afterwards. Was the story a dream? Are you in a Hospital? Are you dead?\n\nYou. Don't. Know. Nor will you ever.\n\nHonestly, i wish i could be neutral when i rate this. I'd say for 5 bucks, you can waste a few hours shooting weird creatures and popping pills. Also again, music and atmosphere are executed well. But just because of the vauge, almost non-existent story, I'm going to say save your money for something else.\n\n(Note, i only played through once, as i was so bored with the game i didn't wanna play it again. So if multiple playthroughs/different endings reveal more about the story, then i apoligize for being so critical. But even if that is the case, i still wouldn't wanna beat this twice.)","March 31","false","3.6"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","2"

Or a horror fan? Or maybe, you just love post-apocalypse setting? Than you will love that game.\nIt's very clear, that the game was highly inspired by the Silent Hill series. Setting, monsters, atmosphere, - all that has definitely come from there, You might say, that it was a bad decision, just to take the idea from one game and to apply it in another, but it was not the case, really. Because this time it was not about to take and to apply, it was about adding something very new in genre.\n\nGraphics\nThere is nothing special about the graphics here. A very popular way of decorating - 2D-pixel one was used here. If you are not a huge indie-game fan, that might be a little problem at first, but then you will get used to it and realise that this was the best type of graphic that could be used in the game - because there are a few details in the game that your imagination creates, your own vision of the protagonist, the people he contacts with, the monsters - just as book does.\n\nSound and music\nEven here it is easy to identify that the game was inspired by Silent Hill. Some in-game sounds are very similar to the ones you have heard in the SIlent Hill series. However, sounds here are great and it is impossible to say that they are bad or too cheap.\nThe music here is a pure masterpiece. Inspired by Akira Yamaoki's guitars and synths, that multi-genre soundtrack will stuck on your MP3-player for the next 2 months. From melancholic guitar to a disturbing noise - you can find here everything you loved in Akira Yamaoka's soundtrack.\n\nGameplay\n"Lone Survivor" is a 2D-survival horror. You have to move from left side of screen to the right one and back. There will be monsters so you have to face and shoot them or just go behind them. You can pass the game without even shooting to monsters. However, gameplay is not something revolutionary here, but, in this case, it is an advantage, because it helps you to concentrate on setting and on storyline.\n\nSetting and storyline\nAs I have said it above, the setting is truly inspired by Silent Hill, and here it seems as a briliant idea. All the details from there are realised well. In fact, they were set in the game as the creator of it had worked on a original Silent Hill game. There is nothing that might be unnecessary, every detail, every word, every event - all these are truly on its places.\nThe storyline is good too. All the human characters are very interesting and it is exciting to see how they react on the protagonist and how protagonist reacts on them. There are 3 endings depend on the way you play, so it is more interesting to complete the game again in order to see the rest endings after you finished "Lone Survivor" once.\n\nConclusionThe game creates a very special effect on you. After the game, you would feel yourself as you've just finished one of the Silent Hill games. Was it a hero's dream? Or was it for real there? The answer is up to you, because there are a lot of facts for and against it.\nAll in all, the game is worth its money. If you are still thinking whether you should buy it, I would say: buy it. "Lone Survivor" is not a very long game, so you do not have to play in it for days, but the time you spend here will be unforgetable.","February 9, 2014","true","7.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

It's a game that's fun to play, fun to talk about, fun to figure out.\n\nYou won't always know what's going on, even after the credits roll, but you get the idea that the creator and characters do.

I'm one of the people who agree with this, and had a great time playing. Lone Survivor puts you in the shoes of an unnamed character, usually referred to as "You" and is claiming to be the last human on Earth. You are on the brink of losing your sanity because of you being alone, and you're tested to see if you can truly keep your sanity or not. The plot can be a little cliché, but the sanity part keeps it from being overused.\n\nAlthough I do tend to prefer games that are more gameplay based, this one is an exception, along with a few others. Being from the horror genre, there isn't really much for the gameplay. If you expect a game where you have an arsenal of deadly weapons and you run around thinking you're Rambo, then trust me, you do NOT want to buy this game. DO NOT. However, when you are given the chance to go into combat against one of these enemies, the battle is usually very heated and fast paced, and the battle will end before you even know it.\n\nThe graphics are probably the reason this game is popular. It provides a whole new view on the horror genre, using pixelated graphics to make you whine and scream for your mother in a corner with your stuffed animal. Okay, let's not push it THAT FAR. We'll get to the 'how scary is this' stuff later. I don't really have much to say, since pixelated graphics are more difficult for me to describe, other than it was done very well.\n\nThe soundtrack is excellent, and while I, again, have not much to say, it was very well done and highly praise it. Not unforgettable, but it's something you'd probably enjoy listening to while you play.\n\nNow, for the part we've all been waiting for: How scary really is this game? Honestly, it's not really that creepy as it seems. When one of the enemies discovers you, then it can be a jump scare because of the sudden loud screeching you hear and the sudden change in the environment around you, but truthfully, even when playing this early in the morning, when it's still dark, and everyone is sleeping, with the sound up loud, this game isn't THAT scary.\n\nOverall, Lone Survivor was quite an experience, and it has many endings to choose from, which I had forgotten to mention earlier. It provides another take on the horror genre, and does it successfully. All though the plot was a bit overused with being the "last man on Earth and blah blah blah" kind of thing, this was still a game that is very interesting.\n\nGraphics- 7.5/10\nGameplay- 5/10\nStory- 6/10\nAudio- 9.5/10\nReplayability- 5/10\n\n.:7.0/10:.\n+New take on the horror genre\n+Nice soundtrack\n+Heated gunplay (when it comes)\n-Overused plot\n-Isn't really that creepy","April 28, 2014","true","2.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CSJones/recommended/209830/","CSJones","CS Jones","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CSJones/","9 products in account","Great concept, bad execution.\n\nIt uses the same morality system that would later be put to better use in Undertale - the more enemies you spare, the better your ending - but here, they're just mindless zombies instead of developed characters, so there's no reason to give a ♥♥♥♥ about them.\n\nThe other factors that contribute to your ending are almost random and have to be discovered through trial-and-error.  Unless you use a strategy guide, it takes multiple playthroughs to figure it out.  And - my opinion, at least - the game just isn't fun enough to make it worthwhile.\n\nThat's because there it has plenty of other great ideas that just don't work that well in practice.  For example...\n\nYou have some flares to blind the zombies with, and a gun you're not supposed to use, but you will.  Each flare lasts all of ten seconds and the gun's aiming mechanism is bizarre: you have to be within melee range to get headshots.  You can sneak past one of the two types of zombie, but that just becomes a long, slow exercise in tedium after a while.\n\nYou get maps, but since it's a side-scroller, figuring out which direction corresponds to which is a pain.\n\nYou have to eat and sleep, also good ideas, but the game is so short, you'd only need a tin of beans and a power nap in real-time.  So the dev makes up for it by your player character complain about being hungry and tired every five minutes, knocking off karma points every time.\n\nThis would be fine if it spelled out that the in-game times and distances were greater than what it shows you...  But they're not.  You live in a normal-sized building, in a city with normal-sized blocks, that take a normal amount of time to walk across.  Apparently, you just can't function on any less than 23 hours sleep a day and constant meals.\n\nAlso, about sleeping: the game docks you points for sleeping too much, too little, irregularly, and when you're hungry.  But you HAVE to sleep in order to save.  Want to pop back home for a quick save after cheating death or unlocking the next area?  Too bad, you're losing points.\n\n-SPOILERS-\n\nWorst of all, there's no reason to care about getting a good ending in the first place.  The story's so vague it might as well not exist, and what little you get of it is pretty cliched: you have amnesia, a psychotic disorder, and a dead wife (the Horror Game Protagonist Starter Kit), you keep hallucinating people who toss you hints at a distant plot, and it's likely the apocalypse is just a delusion.  But an observant player can figure that out early in the game, so no matter which ending you get, it won't clarify things any further.\n\n(As a side note, the final boss is also the most anticlimactic I've seen in a long time.  Its roar is scarier than the fight.)\n\nBut the game DOES deserve credit for its atmosphere and the lack of cheap jumpscares.  The soundtrack is also as good as everyone says, so I'll give it that.  Although I'm not recommending it, I wouldn't advise anyone against buying it, either, if you're into retro horror games.","December 2, 2015","false","15.0"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","8","14","0","0"

It is a side-scrolling survival psychedelic horror game.\n\nThe mechanics of the game encourages the player to maintain their protagonist's health by sleeping and eating.\n\nEach time the character sleeps, which saves the game, the day also progresses. This made me consider the actions I took throughout the day was limited, even though it did not explicitly define a day night cycle.\nThere character's awareness/fatigue seems to affect your character's performance against combat situations.\nAnd food is associated with the character's HP and also seems to determine whether if it heals or not during sleep.\n\nEven though serving a core gameplay purpose, these seemingly mundane actions plays a larger role in my experience in the game. It made me wonder if my actions defined the protagonist's character.\n\nThe protagonist is given a handgun to defend himself. The shooting is rather basic, there's only three preset angles I can shoot at, up, straight, or down. This forces the me to rely on options rather than just my shooting skills. Such as, to line up a head shot I'll need to move the character closer to the enemy, thus risking the chances of being harmed. Otherwise, I can shoot straight which allows me to keep my distance. Additionally, you can only aim the handgun in one direction while firing. To switch directions, the gun needs to holstered before the character can be turned around.\n\nThere is also the option to just avoid all conflict and use stealth to sneak past enemies. I found this, however, frustrating. As the options given for stealth is limited to only one path. Additionally, I would have to put up a blind faith that the path is viable. The game gives no indication that I could have failed the stealth before even completing it. I found myself spending time waiting for an opportunity to sneak past an enemy to only find myself minutes later that the path back out is blocked, as the enemy would not move from its position no matter how long I wait, causing me to resort to guns blazing.\n\nThe puzzles in Lone Survivor served as a way to guide the player throughout the game. It is presented one at a time, rather than a typical adventure game puzzle where you combine items and use your wits to accomplish multiple puzzles at once. Another critique, the puzzle items seems to apply to only one puzzle, and is not automatically discarded afterwards, leaving me wondering if it could be used elsewhere.\n\nOverall, even with a slow start, what kept me in the game was its subtle tension well as the mystery behind the protagonist.\nEventually, leading up to a conclusion which makes me crave a re-play for the secret and alternative endings.","February 19, 2014","true","8.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Lone Survivor bills itself as a post-apocalyptic survival horror game in which the player controls an unnamed protagonist who spends his days exploring the dark hallways of his apartment complex in search of companionship amidst a “zombie” apocalypse. What distinguishes Lone Survivor from other survival horror games is twofold: everything is rendered in 2D, an aesthetic choice not typically associated with the horror genre, and it was all made by one man, Jasper Byrne. So is immersion still possible in such unconventional circumstances? Read on to find out!\n\nThe moment you launch Lone Survivor, you can easily see the amount of care Byrne has put into his game. Each pixel is carefully placed and every nuance, from the character animations to the background scenery, is extremely detailed. While some may argue that the pixelated composition of the game’s monsters and objects makes visual cues all the more confusing, I personally found the art style helpful in simultaneously maintaining an aura of mystery and urging the player’s own imagination to take hold. Equally as impressive is the game’s soundtrack which features not only your eerie but generic horror music, but also soothing guitar riffs which supplement the more lighthearted segments of the game.\n\nIn addition to its survival horror roots, Lone Survivor also prides itself in being a psychological thriller—and with good reason. The plot is all sorts of crazy, and to even mention any particular event in detail would be a potential spoiler. Unfortunately, this also makes the ending a bit easier to guess as all the nonsensical happenings can only suggest so much. Maybe there is a twist waiting at the end of the journey. Maybe there isn’t. Maybe the twist is that there is no twist! Lone Survivor’s narrative, or at least its method of storytelling, isn’t its strongest quality. However, that is not to say that its world lacks depth. Byrne did a fantastic job with the writing. None of the dialogue I came by struck me as cringe-inducing.

Lone Survivor bills itself as a post-apocalyptic survival horror game in which the player controls an unnamed protagonist who spends his days exploring the dark hallways of his apartment complex in search of companionship amidst a “zombie” apocalypse. What distinguishes Lone Survivor from other survival horror games is twofold: everything is rendered in 2D, an aesthetic choice not typically associated with the horror genre, and it was all made by one man, Jasper Byrne. So is immersion still possible in such unconventional circumstances? Read on to find out!\n\nThe moment you launch Lone Survivor, you can easily see the amount of care Byrne has put into his game. Each pixel is carefully placed and every nuance, from the character animations to the background scenery, is extremely detailed. While some may argue that the pixelated composition of the game’s monsters and objects makes visual cues all the more confusing, I personally found the art style helpful in simultaneously maintaining an aura of mystery and urging the player’s own imagination to take hold. Equally as impressive is the game’s soundtrack which features not only your eerie but generic horror music, but also soothing guitar riffs which supplement the more lighthearted segments of the game.\n\nIn addition to its survival horror roots, Lone Survivor also prides itself in being a psychological thriller—and with good reason. The plot is all sorts of crazy, and to even mention any particular event in detail would be a potential spoiler. Unfortunately, this also makes the ending a bit easier to guess as all the nonsensical happenings can only suggest so much. Maybe there is a twist waiting at the end of the journey. Maybe there isn’t. Maybe the twist is that there is no twist! Lone Survivor’s narrative, or at least its method of storytelling, isn’t its strongest quality. However, that is not to say that its world lacks depth. Byrne did a fantastic job with the writing. None of the dialogue I came by struck me as cringe-inducing. Quite the opposite: every word uttered by the protagonist effectively fleshes out his character and conveys his feelings of hopelessness.\n\nBut what really matters, beneath the aesthetics and story, is the gameplay and it is with this that I have my biggest gripe. I wouldn’t go as far as claiming that the mechanics behind Lone Survivor are bad, but I found them rather frustrating.

The Resident Evils (pre 4) and Silent Hills were never my thing. However, for whatever reason, I loaded this up and was surprised at how much I enjoyed it. It's pretty simple and accessible for the genre. You've still got to eat and sleep, but thankfully, an unlimited inventory and fast travel points back to your bed make this much less annoying.\n\nIt's got that "retro" pixelated look that 98% of indie games have, but here you can actually SEE the blocks that make up the character and items. Despite this, it's still got a strong horror atmosphere and it was unsettling exploring some of the areas. Like a lot of indie games, it's got a decent soundtrack with a few songs I could probably listen to outside of the game.\n\nThe most interesting aspect is the "mental health" system. It seems that almost every action you take affects it somehow and therefore, what ending you get.  I went in without knowing that all my actions were being recorded and got a less than desireable ending. However, a second playthrough wouldn't take nearly as long as the first and will add a new challenge in keeping the character in good mental health.\n\nIf you got it in the humble indie bundle, try it out. If not, grab it at 75% off next time.","January 16, 2013","true","5.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","3"

Every other horror game seems to focus on similar "monsters", similar situations, and really  they're almost carbon copies of each other. And while Lone Survivor is not something I've never seen before (I found the storyline pretty straight forward even with the deeper issues that were supposed to be in play) I believe it's a fresh enough take to elevate it above most of the other games.\n\nOne of the main reasons I really liked it is that you actually have to focus on taking care of your character. You need to feed him or he won't feel well (and boy will he let you know that) and you need to sleep (especially since that's how you save the game). To get a relatively good ending, by all accounts he has to have relatively good mental health. You're given more than one way to do things and jumping in with guns blazing is generally not the right way. Running away, hiding, distracting, and even scaring are all options and sometimes they're clearly the better ones.\n\nOf course because it's not really a game focused on fighting monsters, the gun controls are a little awkward and I can't say I'm fond of them. Your character moves really slowly when the gun is drawn and can only move backwards and forward facing the same direction so if something comes up behind you, you're screwed. And admittedly sometimes, you do just want to kill the monsters because constantly having to sneak past them gets annoying. So while I get the point of hiding and sneaking rather than shooting, it can get a little trying.\n\nThat being said it's clear that the developer wanted this to be an experience that you remembered based on its merits alone not for being needlessly frustrating. You never really have to spend a lot of time needlessly backtracking. As you progress through the building and city you unlock shortcuts that make it easy to resume in the same general area you need to be in once you've slept. If you run out of ammo or food or batteries and can't manage to find any while you're exploring, you are able to get it in a couple different ways (even if it's not always recommended). And because of these little details, you're able to focus on actually playing the game itself.","July 9, 2014","true","4.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Nails the original Silent Hill atmosphere, and though it's rarely full-on "scary," it's always interesting to explore the locations and try to piece together the obscure plot. The dialogue is full of humor and pathos... When the protagonist talks to a stray cat, or comments that a steamed ham is "the best thing that's happened to me in a long, long time," you feel both amused and depressed. The combat and stealth are bare-bones, but workable, and I was never bored.\n\nA single playthrough is only about 3 hours, but there are multiple endings which reveal - partially - more of the true nature of the story. In total, I played about 10 hours. I didn't understand some of the hidden mechanics of the game, even after beating it, and had to use a walkthrough to figure it out. There's lots of little hints as to your progress, but they're not very noticeable if you're not looking. I'd have preferred if the ending report were more clear on what you did right and wrong.\n\nOverall, highly recommended.","August 2, 2014","true","11.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Jasper Byrne (the creator) is a huge Silent Hill fan and you can feel the love for that atmosphere in this game without it feeling like a 2D Silent Hill. It has its own identity and ideas.\n\nLone Survivor is a short game with a really cold atmosphere. That detached loneliness that reverberated from Silent Hill is very palpable.\n\nRather than boo scares, what LS gives is a dreaded loneliness. That feeling of being in a world that is inhuman and hurt. It is an atmosphere I haven't seen in a Survival Horror game in a long time, and one that is impeccably crafted. This is an emotional game while avoid the melodrama present in so many other mediums.\n\nCombat is extremely basic, in true Survival Horror fashion. You will often find yourself trying to figure out how to get through an area without fighting. Gameplay is challenging without being frustrating. The atmosphere is preserved and this is not the kind of game where you will need to retry a section 50 times. There are always multiple ways to solve a challenge, giving you an important element of control.\n\nThis is not a long game, it has multiple endings and clocks at about 4.5 hours. But it is done incredibly well. If you enjoy Survival Horror this is a must-buy. It is a heartfelt, amazing achievement at breathing life back into a dying genre.","June 22, 2014","true","0.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's set in a zombie apocalypse of sorts and the story starts with the unnamed protagonist venturing out of his apartment for the first time since the infection started. Gameplay is fairly typical for the genre with a heavy emphasis on resource management and exploration. Unfortunately, I never really found the game that scary as health and ammo pickups were relatively common and I usually found it easier to just shoot mutants rather than trying to sneak by them.\n\nI also found the survival aspects somewhat underdeveloped. While having to worry about eating and sleeping in a horror game is interesting, it just became tedious because the character can barely leave his room without getting tired and hungry and you can't really craft much to help with it. I was never able to reach a place of sustainability in the game where survival became easier, which just felt unsatisfying.\n\nHowever, I did enjoy the level design, exploring, interacting with other survivors, and the general atmosphere of the game. Overall, I would recommend Lone Survivor to survival horror fans (especially those who like psychological horror games) but not to those seeking a game with good survival or action gameplay.","March 31","true","5.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ichikumer/recommended/209830/","ichikumer","ichik","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ichikumer/","1268 products in account","You wake up in the small side apartment on the second floor. The radio talks nonsense, there’s no food and all your neighbors are now scary pixelated monsters. It’s hard to tell if they have become zombies or some other ♥♥♥♥ has happened to them. The game isn’t heavy with going on the specifics of what is actually happening. This is an abstract story of a nameless protagonist, swallowing pills that change his dreams and exploring the building and its nearest surroundings.\n\nGoing outside is dangerous and challenging. Monsters can kill you easily; avoiding them is the preferred course of action. Ammunition is scarce. Rooms and corridors are dark. Batteries for the flashlight don’t last long. On top of that the character has to eat and sleep. And take those pills before having psychedelic dreams in which he talks with a man wearing a box for the hat.\n\nA deconstructed version of classic survival horrors, Lone Survivor keeps only the most core features of them. 3D world is among them. This is a rare for 2D metroidvanias, most of them use a door for nothing more than a couple of completely separate rooms. Lone Survivor makes use of its scene. Corridors go around the floor, intersect with each other and make a dense maze that you have to study. Two sections of hiding in the shadows, turn to the left, then to the right, enter the gaping fleshy hole in the wall, find the new key, some canned fruit salad or even another survivor. So, no, you’re not really lone. But at least you’re survivor. You’ve got that gas can for the stove. There were a few very scary zombies in that dark corner where you’ve found this can, but you’ve managed to pass them unnoticed. Tonight you’ll eat some cooked ham. Who knows if you’ll be that lucky tomorrow?\n\nPacking a lot of action on such relatively small map makes the game tense. The best compliment for a survival horror. The requirement of enough variety and challenge forces most metroidvanias with the flat world map to resort to some kind of red herring like gigantic elevators in Metroid. It’s a neat way of separating the parts of the world and still preserving the integrity of it. Extravagant ride on the carriage with undead horses in Bloodborne is essentially the same thing. Of course it’s more noticeable this way. You can now separate the “main” part of the world from this one. What you didn’t notice yet though is that “main” parts consists of such “separate” ones. Their connections are more believable. They could be one level from a technical standpoint, they could be separate ones — it doesn’t matter. You can still percept them as a whole. Lone Survivor is very careful with its level design. Architecture may make no sense when put in the actual 3D perspective, but the protagonist seems to be delusional anyway.\n\nA small geographical anomaly is easy to overlook when you try to precisely target a zombie slowly coming at you. Perhaps, even easier than the supposedly unexpected subplot-which-was-the-actual-plot-you-fool. The game rather mimics the melancholic tone of Twin Peaks than its mystery; to the point that it manages to end anticlimactically. Those green, red and blue ending sequences are still better than their counterparts in Mass Effect 3, but they too are nowhere near the legitimately scary journey through post-apocalyptic nightmare that has preceded them.","September 23, 2015","true","5.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","2"

Still, Lone Survivor has something about it that just doesn't fit. The ideia behind the game seems very nice, and it has some nice art also. The environment is great. Just, there are somethings that doesn't make sense. Two types of nonsense things.\n\n** ALERT: This part may contain information you might consider spoiler **\nThe first type is the completely nonsense, like not being able to see the map again after the first time. You get the message "I don't need maps, I know my way around". Except that I didn't know may around. If I got the map into my inventory, why can't I look at it? Or, I got into a gun store, with many better guns that my pistol. Still I couldn't game any. "Too noisy", "Too big", etc. Don't limit me this way. Let me choose between the silence or the noisy. If you don't want me to use it, don't make me want it. Don't put them there.\n\nThe second type is the maybe nonsense. I say this because the story of the game don't become clear at the end, and so some nonsense things can be acceptable if you look at the game from another point of view. Still, the game has more than one ending, so, again, the endings might explain one thing or another. This don't bother me too much, even though I think that some parts could be better used (story and game), so to give the player a deeper felling and more him more connected to the game.\n** Not spoiler anymore **\n\nI know the game is indie and developed by a very small group of people (in my understanding, almost only Jasper Byrne), and by that I agree that this game is a great thing. They did a very excelent job. A negative review just because I felt it lacks some basic things.\n\n7/10","June 4, 2014","false","2.4"," 21 of 41 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","21","41","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/recommended/209830/","maudish","Audish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/","908 products in account","Silent Hill has surely cast one of the longest shadows over the horror genre. Few major studios have attempted to capture its success with psychological horror (and not even Konami themselves can regain what they had), but indie developers are always ready to attempt their own thought-provoking thriller. Lone Survivor sticks about as close as you can to the Silent Hill legacy without calling down a lawsuit on itself, but the retro presentation and more immersive mechanics help make it a worthy game on its own.\n\nYou are cast as the last survivor of a mystery plague holed up in a decaying apartment complex. Uninterested in dying alone, you set out from your safe space to find someone, anyone, to share your company. Unfortunately, the whole place is overrun with gangly, fleshy abominations that would just love to eat your masked face. Owing to the retro 2D style this plays out more as an adventure game than even the restrained action of Silent Hill. Combat is something to be avoided if at all possible, taking alternate routes or skulking around with your flashlight off, or creating distractions with rotting meat. However, you can't get through the game without some fighting. Your weapon of choice is a handgun which you can fire straight, upwards, or downwards, and the enemies take some interesting locational damage. It's a good combat system supported by an intelligent balance of combat and sneaking.\n\nHaving your face eaten isn't your only concern, however. Your character gets hungry and tired as well, and you have to scavenge for supplies to keep yourself going. You'll find bags of chips and tins of beans along with more suspect foods, and as the game progresses you can combine foods for different effects and even do some rather involved cooking. Sleeping is necessary (and is also how you save your game), but coffee and pills can keep you running and have some additional interesting effects on gameplay. It's an interesting consideration to add because items are finite but you grow hungry and tired over real time, so you have to constantly be moving the story forward. After some early uncertainty I've come to really appreciate this mechanic, because it pushes you to forge ahead into the darker, more threatening areas in search of food. It adds a genuine sense of urgency that helps justify the terrible risks your character takes.\n\nAll of this is held together by a fantastically dark atmosphere, but one not without its holes. Most areas are VERY dark without your flashlight, but light attracts the creatures. The whole complex is rotting away, and there are far more sinister things taking the place apart as well. The sound direction is excellent, with uncomfortable cues for the monsters and some excellent atmospheric pieces while exploring. The writing is good, though I feel the atmosphere does take a bit of a hit when your character is speaking with certain... things. I think I know where the story is going with these elements I won't expand upon, but for now they feel a bit out of place. Additionally the low-res look doesn't always work in its favor, sometimes making things look a little too cartoonish or obscuring something that would otherwise appear horrifying.\n\nThese are just small nitpicks, though. Lone Survivor takes its inspiration from Silent Hill and runs with it, creating its own atmospheric experience that terrifies and intrigues. I knew I had played something solid when I finished an hour session around midnight, my wife asked me to check on the laundry in the basement, and the hairs on the back of my neck stood up. Yeah, I think I'll check it in the morning, thanks.","September 16, 2015","true","1.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"You," as the game refers to the player character, wake up in your apartment and seek a way out into the surrounding city streets. The problem is the apartment building You are in is in shambles, leaving doors locked, hallways in ruins, and more than a few monsters running around.\n\nRight from the get go, this feels like an early Silent Hill game. Despite the very simple pixel based graphics and the side scrolling perspective, the game manages to hav a good atmosphere of tension and dread. It uses its limited perspective to its advantage, leading to a lot of atmospheric touches.\n\nIt's a good thing that it has atmosphere, too, because the story is a bit all over the place. You run across a few different characters throughout your journey, and they usually serve as some sort of source of goods and supplies, while also asking You cryptic questions that don't make a whole lot of sense. Unfortunately, this is one of those games that, I have a feeling, needs to be played through numerous times in order to fully grasp what's going on, because the ending I got was anticlimactic at best and confusing at worst. I'm not someone who needs everything spelled out for me, but the vague nature of the game is a tad frustrating.\n\nStill, this is a worthwhile survival horror game. As mentioned above, it's very creepy and manages to feel old school thanks to its hunger and ammo systems. You must constantly explore to find more supplies and ammo, meaning conservation and planning are a must. Give this game a shot if you like games such as Silent Hill or are itching for something highly atmospheric.","March 3","true","3.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

The design, atmosphere, and music are well rendered tributes to the Silent Hill games it was clearly modelled on. This is a long review, and what I've said many have already mentioned, but I felt this game was just too close to the mark of being brilliant that it needed to be given justice.\n\nThat said there are weak points, some minor and some not so, and these for me made the game a real chore to play and enough reason to not finish it. Yes, reviewing a game you haven't even finished is laughable, but for me it serves as a statement about it's appeal and playability.\n\nFor one thing, the lack of being able to access the title screen to quickly reload a game when you screw up (and you will), means having to either find monsters to finish you off (if they're still alive) or exit the game completely and restart it. And that takes just long enough to be a real pain, not least because the sequences you can't skip (like the Game Over sequence and the first loading screen) go on for longer than is necessary or desirable. This becomes a major problem by the way when facing the first "boss", which was the point in the game where I waved the white flag and stopped playing due to much bigger problems.\n\nThe fact the character can't last ten minutes without needing a nap means either backtracking to your apartment (albeit facilitated with "mirrors" - itself a nice nod to Silent Hill), or drinking coffee (although you still need to go back to your apartment to brew it), or taking "booster" pills which you run out of way too quickly. It should be mentioned that sleeping in your apartment is how you save the game. I am not kidding when it is literally about ten minutes before you need to "nap" for 24 hours and lose another day in the game. What would take any normal person a couple of hours to complete took far too long for it to be enjoyable. Instead of fighting monsters, I spent most of my time sleeping and eating, backtracking to my apartment again and again. I'm grateful they didn't program in the need for the character to go potty and floss.\n\nThen there's the healing process. As with most other games, you do so by eating and drinking. Problem is, the character gets hungry, regardless of your health level. And if you don't have food, you die. Same goes for water. And sleep. And yes, foraging for food takes just as much time and effort as satisfying the need for the character to sleep. Which means going back to the apartment. Over. And Over.\n\nMy final criticism is the plot. Not the main story, i.e. trying to escape a city suffering the ravages of an infectious outbreak, but the special characters injected into the game to add mystery to the hero's back-story. It's difficult to say what exactly feels wrong about them. But I guess it's the fact they speak so vaguely that very little is revealed about who you are, and who they are, until later in the game. Long enough to lose interest with all the sleeping, cooking and foraging you'll be doing while apparently playing a survival-horror game where a quick getaway from an apocalyptic scenario is key. What they do say is cliched and generic to the point of being another reason to quit the game and apply for a refund.\n\nI really wanted to like this game. What is has accomplished is impressive, and it is by no means a bad game in terms of potential. But the gameplay issues I had with it marred what I hoped would be a memorable experience. As a casual, no-frills (and not very competent) player, it's more effort than it's worth for me to persevere with it.","March 26","false","5.1"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","44","4","9","2","0"

This isn't such a big deal, it just feels a little clunky at times.\n\nThe second complaint, on the other hand, is a deal breaker for me.  This game is just not very scary.  It's really not.  Even playing it at night, with headphones on and the lights off failed to scare me.  Don't get me wrong, it's got it's moments, but they are few and far-between.  I never thought that playing a game about a man losing his grip on reality in the zombie apocalypse would bore me.\n\nMaybe it gets better later on, but after giving it 2.5 hours to get good, I think it's reasonable to lose faith.\n\nIt could still be your thing though, it's got a lot of promise.

And wow - Lone Survivor is a wonderful game by the obviously talented Jasper Byrne. With it's surreal Twin Peaks meets Silent Hill feeling it manages to weave together elements from many genres. The gameplay of the survival horror genre, the look of old school adventure games, the intelligence and introspection of other new indie games, and some pretty funny and seriously dark humor, Lone Survivor is best describes as a survival horror game though, and while it doesn't scare you it may very well haunt you in different ways. It's a moving game with more than a small touch of emotion and the bizarre, and it's a game I should have played a long time ago. It's also a game anyone can pick up. It doesn't really require any skills or knowledge of a specific genre to appreciate.\n\nIf you're wondering if you should pick it up? The answer is simple: "Yes! Yes, you should pick it up! NOW!" While a playthough won't take more than between 3-6 hours (depending on playstyle and the amount of exploring you do), the game (especially the director's cut) should be played at least 2-3 times. There are five different endings and, while it may not look like it, the game is extremely detailed. Every action has consequences, but they are far from apparent. Lone Survivor is not just an interesting and beautiful game, it's a damn good one with great gameplay. This is a game that quickly rose to my top-20 list of best games of all time. A definite must have.","November 7, 2014","true","8.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

With that said, there shouldn't be any hesitation about entering the dark corridors.\nAnd yet, it's still one of the most terrifying things I've ever played.\nYou'll always know where the hazards are. You'll always know how badly things will go if you make a mistake. You'll always have more than enough time to let the dread settle in as you step out into the next area only to find that things have gone much darker, and the infected are practically everywhere.\nThis isn't a game that is meant to make you rush things. You'll revisit areas over a course of several in-game days, having to ration your food and knowing when to sleep, and figuring out how to slow your descent into madness.\nIf you're rushing things, it probably means that you're panicking. But you might be doing a lot of that.\n\nIf you're not into horror because you're sick of the same formula being followed every time, then consider giving Lone Survivor a try.","November 8, 2014","true","10.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This game took me to the point of questioning my own sanity, not knowing if what I just saw was in my head or in my characters head... Seriously a great perspective on a whole monster like apocalypse, instead of going for the "Lets shoot everything until the world is saved!" approach this game takes ot from another angle, the one of a "Lone Survivor". Having to sit sweating trying to sneak past a monster or feeling proud of myself for using various bait traps to lure them elsewhere, this game just has everything a horror game needs. To top everything off the graphics and sound work together so well to give this game that edge that is needed.","November 13, 2014","true","1.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RadKit/recommended/209830/","RadKit","RadKit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RadKit/","491 products in account","Lone Survivor is a survival horror game that really makes you feel both the survival and the horror and thirdly the horror of survival.\n\nRight off the bat LS has a demo out there, so you should give that a couple minutes to see if you can handle the retro graphics.\n\nNot for you? Move on.\n\nPixel lover? Let's dig in.\n\nLS takes quite a few cues from other survival games, like an auto updating mapping system and flashlight that needs new batteries constantly, but really the game remains largely unique. You play as a young man set in a town filled with zombies caused by disease. The game starts very quickly with little explanation and leaves the player to fill in what is going on, who you are, and how to really survive.\n\nIt becomes very clear very quickly that your character might not exactly be in his right mind, a large part of the story and vibe of the game is a psychological one, but this review is not going to expand on this because its best left for the game itself.\n\nThe biggest chunk of surviving the game is managing your food and sleep levels, which might not sound fun, but its so key to the game in multiple ways that its inescapable. The character will let you know maybe a little too often how you are feeling, tired or hungry.\n\nYou will need to find and cook, or combine food in different ways to keep yourself going. It takes some trial and error... is this bottle of milk still good? Whats more filling these crackers or a squid on a stick?\n\nThe more important question comes in while exploring and being harassed by critters that want to spit infected blood on you, or strangle the life from your body.\n\nShould I push on, do I have enough food, am I well rested? Should I return now or risk it and explore a little more.\n\nThus the game follows a good pattern of exploration, and retreat, each day you'll either need to hoof it or use teleporting mirrors to return back to your apartment to rest and save before heading back into the mirror and continuing.\n\nAs you explore you'll find lots and lots of things a flashlight, a weapon, a cat, coffee, a ham, a source of water, fuel for your stove. Also you'll unlock several shortcuts and even pseudo vendors to allow you to get a helpful boost if you need more ammo or pills or rotten meat.\n\nIn several areas you'll need to use the flashlight to be able to interact with something in the darkness but the light will increase your visibility to the games creepy monsters, also the flashlight has limited energy and you have limited batteries.\n\nMany monsters are near spots that allow you to sneak around them, but your character isn't a complete wimp and its not too hard to kill them off, if carefully watching your supplies and planning your attacks.\n\nThe controls work well, and are responsive but might take a bit of getting used to as you can only attack to one side at a time, and walk much slower while trying to do so, needing to lower your weapon before turning and re-raising it. Other than that the game is very minimalistic, a few hotkeys, movement keys, interact key, inventory key.\n\nA real treat in LS is the sound that immerses you and gives you clues about your character's state of mind and health. Monster noises are creepy and while there is no real voice work, this is a retro-style game after all.\n\nAll in all Lone Survivor is a wonderful exercise in a lot of things, retro graphics, minimalistic controls, sound, creepiness, and of course survival mechanics. At 9.99 it's a steal for hours of enjoyment over many other games of lesser quality at many times the price... it might even keep you up at night.","April 27, 2012","true","10.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The environment and story is interesting, the art is good, and the atmosphere and sound excellent.\n\nIt's very much in the vein of Silent Hill, but there's a heavier emphasis on resource management. Supplies are scarce throughout the game and missing some early items can severely cripple a player in the long run (namely, the can-opener that you can find very early). Fortunately, the game is forgiving enough that total failure is not likely.\n\nI didn't finish the game, but enjoyed the experience up to where I "gave up". I didn't quit out of lack of interest, but because I hit a point where my poor planning and over-use of lethal force put me in a bad place. I would like to start from scratch and finish the game at some point.\n\nOverall: Good game, 8/10\n\n","April 10","true","5.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You play the role of You who lost in the abandoned apartment block must make his way out. It won't be easy though. You don't have much food, medicine, ammo and you have to pass countless corridors full of danger.\n\nFinishing the game left me with mixed feelings. The whole experience was sometimes very enjoyable and often annoying.\n\nThe game has a great soundtrack. It doesn't consist of many tracks but they all contribute to a nice lonely, unsettling atmosphere. It's also got an openly interpretated plot. The story may seem confusing. No, actually it is very confusing.\nYou don't know who you (he?) really are. Was it all just a dream or?\n\nHowever it's obviously not perfect. One of the most annoying things I encountered were controls. Can you imagine not being able to turn around while pointing your gun at enemies?\nYes. It does happen.\n\nThe game is pretty hard itself and its mechanics make it even harder. You get hungry a few minutes after having a tin of pickles and sleepy 10 minutes after waking up. When you die, that happens quite a lot, you need to wait for the game over sequence and then re-load the game from the main menu. When you screw up, you can either\nfind someone/something to kill you or quit the game and load it from the main menu.\n\nMaps... The game is a 2D side-scroller so the in-game maps will probably make you confused. I couldn't get used to the map system till the very end.\n\nAlthough playing it is not always a pleasant experience, the game is worth a try.\n\nYou can do it.","April 18","true","8.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

A chilling and down right creepy horror game with an interesting story to the likes of the actual Silent Hill games...I got an "Eh" title that tries to do that with muddy graphics and some form of a narrative, but fails to captivate me enough to actually care.\n\nLone Survivor is the 2D, pixelated SIlent Hill, that just isn't. Sure, the monsters creep you out at first, mostly due to the noise they produce then the stickman figure they happen to look like. But they just tend to be more of an annoying blockade in the hallway than something you should fear.\n\nThis game also brings up some annoying mechanics like an invisible sleeping and eating meter. Cause God knows we need that much "realism" to a game so that people get so "immersed" in it! It's not at all an annoying and unnecesary mechanic, especially when the character ♥♥♥♥♥es and moans about it every 5 minutes.\n\nThis game also brings back the clunky aiming mechanics of the old Resident Evil. It kinda works for it since it's used in a 2D setting. Though you'll mostly want to avoid confrontation since the enemies  tend to be really bullet absorbent. Which is a plus considering it's a survival horror game.\n\nAs for the story...I'll be honest, I lost interest in this game after getting to the basement. And I really just did not care what was going on in the appartment. Who that lady in the cage was. If the monsters were actually people and the protagonist was just delusional this whole time. I just didn't give a damn.\n\nWhy didn't I give a damn. The narrative felt a bit lifeless. I didn't feel like I should actually care what was going on in this world. The fact that most of dialouge amounts to the damn hunger/sleeping meter prompts whenever the protag feels hungry and/or tired may have added to that.\n\nPros:\n-It's, kind of an interesting take on a Horror game. (Though I wasn't impressed.)\n-Some of the puzzles were actually kinda clever, like luring a monster to another room by placing meat near it.\n-You can kinda mix and match items to make new ones, sorta. (From what I experienced, it was mostly to cook food.)\n\nCons:\n-Hunger and Sleep meter...oh joy.\n-Muddy pixel graphics (The filter made it seem nice, but it really just adds to it.)\n-I didn't care for the story or mystery of the game.\n(Which is a big con considering that's an important motivator to play these types of games.)\n\nIn short:\nIf you're interested in a 2D, sidescrolling horror game. Try something else.\n\nYou don't wanna take my word on it and wanna jump into the game anyway? It's your money. Do with it what wish.\nI recommend you to get it on sale.","June 9, 2015","false","3.4"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","9","20","0","0"

I wish there were some sort of neutral rating on Steam. This game is worth starting but not really worth finishing.\n\n2. The standout quality of this is sound design, which is simply as good as it gets. The sound effects almost feel like a natural extension of the music, which is excellent in its own right.\n\n3. The art style, I am not in love with. It is just sort of a pixely blur. It works well enough but something about it just looks like you have resolution on your monitor set incorrectly.\n\n4. The atmosphere--see number 3--is enticing at first. Very immersive. This isn't really scary exactly but there is a menacing quality that is very foreboding and appealing all at once.\n\n5. Gameplay is a survival horror game boiled down to 2D. While the giants of this genre are rotting away into AAA action games, it is nice to see an indie dev do something that stayed true to what people love about survival horror while adding their own twist.\n\n6. 2D survivor horror works fine. The third D is overrated in gaming.\n\n7.  Number 5  is why I really, really wanted to like this game and why it's been on my to-play list for years. Unfortunately, this works only as a proof of concept. See number 6.\n\n8. Once you absorb the atmosphere, the gameplay starts to wear thin. There is nothing wrong w/ it inherently but the whole thing seems to lack polish. You are backtracking all over the place. You have to rest and go through the same little clip scenes over and over. There is a mild puzzle solving element but it's just like, "You need to cook? Find a pot, I guess."\n\n9. Yes, backtracking and an overall slower pace are hallmarks of survivor horror and I just praised this game for being a true survivor horror game. What can I say? This game is both good and bad. It's a paradox.\n\n10. *the sound of minds blowing*\n\n11. There are multiple endings. Multiple endings are overrated in gaming.\n\n12. Like, seriously, are you so full of yourself that you think your game is worth playing like five times over and over? Sorry, I got things to do.\n\n13. In all honestly, I didn't finish this thing even once. I was just bored to death after picking it up the second day for another hour. Tried again on a third day and still bored, I set down my trusty Steam controller, and thought, yep that's all I'm ever playing of this game for the rest of my life and I feel good about it. I will totally buy a sequel or preferably a new IP in a similar style if the developer makes one.

After finally playing through it, I was disappointed on most of those accounts.\n\nWhat it does right: For what could be a gameboy  game, it certainly has a decent atmosphere and mechanics that I couldn't complain about, even with the menu system. It was interesting enough that I wanted to see what happened next and I actually finished it, but not enough to want to play through it again or try to find out the smaller details of the plot.\n\nWhat it does wrong: For a game that had been paraded to me for how scary it was, it really wasn't. The few first experiences with the thin men were creepy, especially if I ran out of ammo, but the fact that you have a limitless supply of ammo and batteries if you take pills takes any stress out of the game. There's no suspense if I can just walk up, shoot the things in the head a few times and be done with it. Coupled with the fact that I could go home and save somewhere within every level at any time, things just weren't tense or suspenseful enough to make me feell actually afraid or in the moment. It became more strategical as the game went on, instead of me being actually afraid. I suppose it would be hard to really set up a realistic experience with the size of the game, but I'm sure it could've been done better.\n\nLike I said, having an unlimited supply to pills, and therefore and unlimited supply of ammo and batteries takes a lot of what could be a good survival element out of the game.  When I initially found out you could do this, I stopped trying to avoid the monsters entirely. Why take the time to avoid the problem every time you go through that area if you can permanantly remove it? It might've been different if my ammo supply was actually limited. Any fear of these monsters was entirely gone when I figured out it was that easy to take them down.\n\nAnother thing was the protagonists messages. They seem entirely useless after a while. While initially he complains about hunger or sleep, when he starts saying he might collapse and other things, I would try to eat or sleep to no avail. It seems that message system wasn't entirely necessary, and I just ignored it entirely when I would eat and sleep at regular intervals. Maybe it had something to do with his gradual downward descent, but it certainly wasn't helpful from a gameplay standpoint.\n\nLastly, I hesitate to call it something that was done wrong, but the story. [ALSO SPOILERS] I see it was trying to be this deep journey about a guy imagining his own depressing world after his girlfriend was killed in a car crash or something, but it never took the time to make me interested in the main character or his situation enough to really care for him. This may be to try to immerse the player deeper into the role, but that never works when you're trying to tell a compelling story at the same time. It may just be me, but the story was never involving enough to make me like the game any more than I already did.\n\nIt was also really short, but I guess that isn't a bad thing. I could've beat it in two or three hours if I didn't mess around so much.\n\nGuess it was an alright experience, but I doubt I'll ever come back to it. Dunno if I would've actually paid fifteen dollars for it if I'd known what it was really going to be.","November 15, 2014","false","4.1"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","6","15","0","0"

The game didnt lag, but this would make it difficult to record and all the text looked blurry because it was all stretched. If i had to rate it, i'd give it a 4/10; Not totally awful, but really has a lot to be desired.","June 23, 2014","false","0.7"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

Early on, it's neat, since it has good atmosphere and an intriguing story, but the interface is so obtuse that it becomes a chore to play. Combat is a bore, which normally wouldn't be a problem in a survival horror game. But this game tosses samey enemies at you like there's no tomorrow, forcing you to either kill them (clunky, and also locks you out of the best ending) or use one of many consumable items, forcing you to navigate a menu in the middle of being chased.\n\nHorror games should make you fear for your life. Not make you curse for dying repeatedly against boring enemies who are only halfway scary because of the banal scare chord that continually blares while they see you. After a while, the only dread I felt was the dread of trudging back through those same '2spooky4u' hallways.","June 4, 2015","false","5.3"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","29","2","7","0","1"

The game is more "survival" than "horror" as I wound up trying to keep myself alive rather than soaking in the atmosphere and as a result, made me just stop playing the game.\n\nAtmosphere: 4/10\nWhile the atmosphere does give off an eerie feeling at times and give off the feeling that everything is dead, I wasn't really scared or even creeped and I didn't feel very threatened.  You can tell when standard monsters are around only because they create what sounds like radio static, you can easily outrun them, and they won't follow you to another screen.\n\nStory: 2/10\nThe story was not very interesting and sometimes hard to follow.  The basic plot is that you are believed to be the last man alive but leaves his appartment to try and find if there are any other survivors.  It's a good setup, but the pacing is so slow that it doesn't seem in any rush to progress past the "escape the apartment" portion which takes a long time to actually do and has the character go through multiple halucinations and black-outs instead of moving forward.  Taking bule or green pills before sleeping will put you in a dream state where two different characters bring up psychological topics to ask you.  As much as I like this idea though, it distracts from the main story and just took me out of the game.\n\nGraphics: 6/10\nI have to be honest and i don't mean to offend anyone, but the characters in this game look pretty ugly.  I am not expecting them to look like something out of a AAA title so I do cut it some slack, but they still look unappealing.  The monsters look basic and the "walkers" as I will call them do not look very threatening.  The graphics' saving grace is the backgrounds as they do look dead and abandoned giving the game a sense of dread.\n\nGameplay: 3/10\nSurviving is a challenge itself as you WILL be dying more times than you can count.  When encountering monsters, you are mostly given items such as rotten meat or flares that will only distract enemies and the only thing you have to kill them with and defend yourself is a shoddy pistol with VERY scarce ammo.  More often than not, you will wind up running out of ammo as monsters take quite a few hits to kill and the later monsters take even more hits to kill, so you will be constantly backtracking looking for blue pills or ammo you hope you had missed; and you'll be lucky if you can find them.  This could have easily been fixed if a better gun was available or at the very least a melee weapon, but the protagonist says he would rather keep his weak pistol.  If you want the player to stick with one gun, don't throw in something that will make us want something different.\n\nThere is a hunger mechanic that seems to just be there and didn't really affect my survival.  The game just seemed to nag me when I got hungry or got sleepy to make me eat some food I had found or go back to my room and sleep to the point where it felt more like a chore.\n\nReplay Value: 2/10\nI honestly, can't see myself replaying this game anytime soon.  There is not a lot of things I understood even looking back at them and it will just be the same repetitive gameplay that gets boring after a while.\n\nFinal Verdict: This game has potential and so do the developers.  I honestly want to see them go far an make some very enjoyable games.  This particular game, however, was a bit of a disappointment; if you are looking for a game that will scare you and keep you invested, you might want to look elsewhere.\n\nFinal Score: 17/50\n\n3.4/10 - Cannot Recommend","January 4, 2015","false","3.2"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

I spent the entire game on the edge of my seat, and jumped when I heard so much as a mouse scurry.\n\nI felt really happy with the experience, and I (unwisely) thought I'd try playing another horror game. I noticed Lone Survivor, so I loaded it up.\n\nAfter having to sit through some boring and uninformative text boxes, I found myself in a colorfully lit hallway face to face with a noodly guy doing some whacky noodle walk. He just seemed to be walking around and he didn't seem too threatening, so I decided to stroll on past him. He wiggled at me a few times until my character fell over and I lost. I put it down for later.\n\nAfter cleansing my palate of the bitter aftertaste my first try at Lone Survivor left me, I ventured another nibble. This time, I tried to give it an earnest go, pledging a prudent prescription of play before passing a proper opinion.\n\nSo I read the inordinate quantity of introductory text boxes, cautiously avoided the fleshy Air Dancers wandering the halls, following the instructions. Once again the halls were lit like a strip club and the sound design echoed the subtlety and fidelity of a Bar Mitzvah on a budget. I grit my teeth on my very expensive new crown and carried through.\n\nI reached a part of the game where you meet people, but everyone was acting veeeerrry straaaange! It was soooo spoooooky! Anyway it turned out everyone was actually DEAD THE WHOLE TIME (SPOILERS OH NO) and I quit the game because that plot twist stopped being novel to popular media after the first season of The Twilight Zone in 1959. I gave it a grand total of 23 minutes, and now it's uninstalled for good.","January 21, 2014","false","0.4"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

You'll spend a lot of time backtracking through the same samey areas over and over. Your character is in constant need of rest or food, which is more annoying than compelling. The food crafting system is bizarrely over-complex, and entails a lot of time spent struggling with the terrible interface. Speaking of...\n\nControls are baffling laid-out.

It opts for a very tense and oppressive atmosphere rather than jump scares and over the top horror cliches.\n\nIt can be argued that horror is one of the most difficult genres to break into.  Fear is a subjective response and what frightens one person may not frighten another.  While there wasn't anything that made me reach for a new pair of pants, I was certainly on the edge of my seat the entire time.\n\nIn my opinion, the best horror games are those that make you incredibly tense and afraid of the unkown.  They make your body cry out for you to quit, they make you hesitant to press on, while at the same time making you crave more.  This game did it for me, and I hope it will for you as well.\n\nIn conclusion, Lone Survivor is a great horror game.  It's certainly not without it's flaws (which I haven't covered here, because they truly are minor), but will certainly not disappoint.","December 21, 2014","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm not even going to make a joke or some stupid statement about it. This is honestly one of the greatest games I've ever played. The whole experience of attempting to stay alive in an apocalyptic world while trying to maintain your mental sanity is incredible and it becomes difficult to decide between learning about your past by dulling your mind or staying sane and focusing on the future and your own survival. The soundtrack is also amazing and there's always those unexpected moments of humor that really get me. Again, Lone Survivor. Awesome game.\nAnd, no, none of that was sarcasm.","June 19, 2012","true","12.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It never happened.\n\nAnd maybe Jasper really did just never think to include it, but the more likely case is the lack of intuitive controls, the confusing keyboard layout is all part of the psychological trap the game puts you in. In nightmares, people are meant to feel powerless, disabled. This would explain the odd controls on a metafictional level.\n\nThe soundtrack is really really good. I remember him doing the soundtrack for Hitman: Contracts and that was very tense and chilling as well, but this brings out his talents even better so to speak. From the screeching static enemies to the trapped-in-a-hell-dimension ambiance, this game isn't shy about roughing up your ears.

It is not what you see, but what you can hear, hiding in the shadows, that drives your fear.\n\nThough the game is short (4-6hrs), and can be comepleted quickly, its best to take your time.

It's somber environment increased by the soundtrack and the gutteral sounds of fleshy monsters brings everything together - from the dark apartment hallways to the dusty streets. Weapons are scarce, food and water must be gathered often and carefully, and the enemies can be avoided through discarding rotten meat or sneaking by.\nIt's one of the best survival horror games I've played, but it's a shame that it's a tad short compared to the length of other horror games.

It's a pixelated sidescrolling survival-horror that takes inspiration from many great places - most notably Silent Hill. You begin the game trapped on the second floor of an apartment building and must set to work finding a way out (for a start), while making sure to collect supplies, avoid (or kill) a good many monsters, look for other survivors, ocassionally obsess over cats, eat regularly, get a good night's sleep here and there, and most of all: stay sane. Which is easier said than done. It doesn't seem like you can ever truly screw up the game for good. Running out of bullets or dying is usually treated with a fever dream and some mercy supplies, but it puts a massive strain on your sanity.

But the characters themselves. A cross between all in the main character's head and generally nice or partially helpful characters litter the game which liven up the dank depressing mood.\n\nIn fact, since I played the game on a pacifist run I found that underneath the depressing "dog-eat-dog" atmosphere, there's some genuine hope and optimism. It gives you such a warm fuzzy feeling to pick up a can of beans and know that it will be a delicious treat tomorrow along with your morning coffee. The main character's reaction is not only the icing, but the cake itself. Treating mental disorders has never felt so nice.\n\nThat said, the difficulty flucuates from easy to hard and back to easy around the midpoint and the game requires a lot of guessing to figure out (drinking milk to get the milk bottles for bottles of water).","June 16, 2012","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It also doesn't seem to take itself very seriously, which really helps explain away the horror label, considering it is about as scary as a luke-warm glass of water.\n\nSeriously though, soundtrack is full of great things.","July 8, 2014","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The characters are interesting and creepy, the environment is creepy, everything is creepy, had me frightened the whole way through, though it does also have an odd sense of humor throughout which was enjoyable.  The soundtrack is amazing and wish it didn't cost just about as much as the game itself.  If silent hill games (esp the old ones, like silent hill 2) are your forte, check this one out, unless you hate that 8bit/16bit look.  I never thought a game with graphics like this would scare me, I was wrong.  The save system can be a bit frustrating at times, as can the shooting and hiding mechanics, but mostly they're pretty simple, they just can wig out at times.  Also, as many say, it's hard to not see a huge smile on the protagonist's face once you see it that way, it's really a surgical/medical mask, but it sure does look like a huge goofy smile.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shonaningyo/recommended/209830/","shonaningyo","ShonaNingyo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shonaningyo/","215 products in account","I love retro-style horror games. Games like Silent Hill and Resident Evil and of course the beautiful scarefest that is Amnesia depend on extraordinary graphics in order to get the scares across. In Lone Survivor the creators relied on classic pixelization, and it somehow works. The music is paranoia-inducing and the alarming change in environment when a monster sees you is reminiscent of the Silent Hill 'monster warning system" of radio static, and of Amnesia's blaring horn/string frenzy of "Oh ♥♥♥♥! Oh ♥♥♥♥! Oh ♥♥♥♥! They see me!!". And much like Silent Hill there are quite a few monsters to navigate around and it is not expected that you outright battle them head-on, as well as many doors and openings that are not always open and, as far as you know, may never be.\n\nYour character claims to be the only survivor in the apartment complex that he is currently a tenant of, residing in his own cozy little room of 206. Of course, you need to go out and fetch supplies and try to find survivors. Along the way you are shaken up by bizarre visions that may be a result of something alien and supernatural--I mean seriously, that's all that could explain the existence of those THINGS--or possibly your character's insanity slowly grabbing at his mind. Despite being dumb as a rock when it comes to logical "one thing leads to another" set ups that this game surely is, I managed to find my way around the place and just as I was thinking "Okay it's time to stop for today" I found something else to explore and just kept going. This is a great mashup of pixel, adventure, psychological, thriller, and horror.\n\n","May 3, 2014","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Hardly reinvents the wheel, because it's a carbon copy of Team Silent's efforts down to the confirm prompt sound. As far as 2D-demake/homages go, it's the only one of its kind and offers some new things to the formula. With an emphasis on the actual survival part of horror, you'll be foraging for foodstuffs and making recipes to keep your health and sanity up. Then there's the way your actions (aggression vs stealth, consuming different meds, etc) affect the possible endings. As you would expect, these systems are a bit obscure, but the game drops hints throughout if you pay close attention. There are no puzzles to speak of, but there can be some frustrating trial and error sections to the game. Jasper Byrne is no Yamaoka, but the game feels built around the soundtrack - it's quite good.\n\nA note about the control scheme: it can't be rebound, so, oops.\n\nEverything else is solid if unremarkable; this is real survival horror in bite-sized pill form.","March 29, 2014","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

The fact remains you have that fear of death and that bewilderment of what might happen next that is essential to this type of game.

Lone Survivor is an indie survival horror game and if you've ever played a Silent Hill game before, this game will feel very familiar. The developer, Jasper Byrne, is a self-proclaimed Silent Hill fan and the influences are very apparent throughout the game. Everything including the gameplay, the narrative themes, and even the audio cues are very Silent Hill-esque. And Byrne, who also composed the game's soundtrack, does a great job channeling Silent Hill's Akira Yamaoka with his musical style. But even if you've never played a Silent Hill game, you may still want to give Lone Survivor a look.\n\nLone Survivor is short, and I think that's to its credit. It's about 5 hours long, and I think that's a perfect length for a game like this. Turning off all of the lights in your house and subjecting yourself to the twisted imagery and pulse pounding terrors of a good horror game now and again is fun, but it's also kind of nerve wracking and draining. Not something to do every single night. I've played a lot of games that do a good thing effectively, but wear out their welcome by doing it over and over again for too long. I felt Lone Survivor had a very appropriate length, and I'd like to see more shorter experience games like this. I think it can work if the games are appropriately priced, but that's a whole different discussion.\n\nYou play as a nameless survivor of some disease outbreak that has seemingly turned all of the world's population into mindless zombie-like monsters. The main character has holed up in his apartment to survive the disease outbreak, but is now running out of food and is curious if there are any other survivors other than himself. So you'll start to venture outside your apartment and see the horrors of the monster infested world, but you'll still return to the apartment often to rest and save. You can combat the monsters with your handgun if you have enough ammo, or you can lay piles of meat around to attract the monsters to a certain location to try and sneak past. Like any good horror game, ammo management is key. You'll want to sneak past enemies when possible rather than shooting them to conserve your ammo. You'll also want to keep an eye on how many batteries you have left. Without batteries, your flashlight won't operate and you won't be able to see many important clues and objects in your environment.\n\nWhile Lone Survivor probably isn't quite as complete of a game as some of the games it's influenced by, this game is still my favorite type of horror game. There are very few, if any, jump scares. Less means that the few jump scares that are in the game are more powerful and memorable. Rather than relying on jump scares, games like Silent Hill and Lone Survivor create the feeling of horror by constructing a creepy atmosphere through good music, sound and art design. Games like these understand that the most horrific things your imagination can cook up are more intense than anything the game can actually show you. So they simply focus on creating good atmosphere and let your imagination do the rest. I especially love the strange hallucinations and bizarre scenery present in Lone Survivor. Good stuff. I think the minimalist pixelated art style works to the game's favor here too. When you see a monster, you just kind of get a general impression of what it looks like, and again, your imagination fills in the details. Lone Survivor perfectly follows the prototype for my favorite kind of horror game.\n\nI didn't find the story quite as satisfying or the game design as nuanced as Silent Hill 2, but Lone Survivor is still worth a look if you like these kinds of games. Its length is appropriate, and it does a great job creating a dark and creepy atmosphere. I wish it had the narrative depth of SH2, but does do a great job replicating nearly everything else from that game.\n\nFor more game reviews, check out http://whatisjamesplaying.blogspot.com/","April 25, 2014","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But once you figure out how the system works, then it's quite easy to finish to the point that it turns into a routine. The game is all about survival. Your food is limited. Your weapon is limited. Your time and energy is limited. You have to think economically and plan ahead. And you have to take Lone Survivor's mental health into account too. You can choose whether you will sneak your way around or blast your way through with your gun, or whether you will trade your health for more energy to run. But whatever you choose, you will face the consequence.\n\nThe storyline is quite linear and short; you can finish this game in about 3-4 hours. But there's multiple endings which allow you to explore the story deeper. And personally I consider the beauty of this game is at its story: it doesn't actually tell you, even at the ending scene, what had happened and leaves the conclusion open to your speculation. This unfinished story gives incentive to play the game again and see it from the new perspective. Some dialogues and visual cues will make more sense after you finish your first run and form a theory in your head.\n\nAnother beauty of Lone survivor is the sound and music. This game should be play with headphone. The sound alone can make you feel creepy. The game will ask you to immerse yourself in by turning off the light and putting on your headphone. Just do it.\n\nIn short, I highly recommend Lone Survivor for those who is looking for a good survival horror, and those who loves to solve the puzzle behind the story.","January 3, 2014","true","31.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Byrne decided to add some rpg elements to a classic side scrolling adventure game, like the necessity to properly rest and eat/drink while exploring the spectral and dangerous city. Ammunitions and supplies are scarse, enemies are tough and numerous, but exploring rewards the player with useful items. Several characters can be met during the travel, they have sidequests for the player and they also help to put together the pieces of the puzzle of a very interesting story behind "You", the main character of the game.

It opts for a very tense and oppressive atmosphere rather than jump scares and over the top horror cliches.\n\nIt can be argued that horror is one of the most difficult genres to break into.  Fear is a subjective response and what frightens one person may not frighten another.  While there wasn't anything that made me reach for a new pair of pants, I was certainly on the edge of my seat the entire time.\n\nIn my opinion, the best horror games are those that make you incredibly tense and afraid of the unkown.  They make your body cry out for you to quit, they make you hesitant to press on, while at the same time making you crave more.  This game did it for me, and I hope it will for you as well.\n\nIn conclusion, Lone Survivor is a great horror game.  It's certainly not without it's flaws (which I haven't covered here, because they truly are minor), but will certainly not disappoint.","December 21, 2014","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For a game based off of a movie though, it kinda branches off from the story of the film. And by kinda, I mean a lot. Instead of Taliban and Al-Qaeda combatants, the developers made the decision to change them into zombies and other 'horrory' stuff. Instead of Afghanistan, it takes place in an American apartment building and city. Creative changes sure, but at least they laft the main character as kinda 'Mark Wahlburgish' and its kinda good in its own right. 9/10, wouldve preferred they stayed truer to the story but good none the less.","February 18, 2014","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some fairly interesting gameplay, especially for a 2D game. Simple, yet good stealth/combat mechanics. It's more about learning to use your brain, and fast. Some good story as well. More than nothing though, this game has atmosphere.  It's dark, your flashlight won't shine two feet ahead of you, your ammunition is limited, you need food(and the means to make it. You can't exactly munch a can of beans, can you?). The building is confusing, it's long corridors seem all alike and you never know which step will put you face to face with... something. The main character is the perfect expression of this game: he gets tired; he feels claustrophobic; he freaks out when things happen beyond his comprehension. Is he really alone? Is he even sane? As you give in to the story and setting, this game keeps you on edge without any cheap scares. It's psychological trauma at its best.

I wanted to like the game, but it was difficult to navigate a 2D game with a 3D map (maybe that's just me). I know the creator wanted to pay homage to Silent Hill, but he really didn't need to use the same map to do it. There are good 2D maps out there. Take Mercenary Kings, for example. You can see where you are on the map and it's easy to direct yourself based on lines connecting rooms.\n\nI will give the game props for its creepy atmosphere and art, but the main character looked like he had a ♥♥♥♥-eating grin and it was really distracting when I was exploring the environment.

The several mysterious personalities of Lone Survivor represent the different pieces of your character's psyche, and as the journey goes on you begin to make decisions with a certain sense of mortal and personal albatross. At no point does the game feel like a toy to be played with or a skill to be mastered. There is only survival by any means, and as a player you feel every hit taken, every shot fired, every gruesome corpse as a grave reminder of your own mortality.\n\nThis is a truly rare game. It has chilling aesthetics, tense gameplay, and an immersive plot with several endings. Lone Survivor is not a scary game with cheesy jump-scares. It's a true horror survival game with an immersive environment. You won't be able to play this game in one sitting or even a couple days; the human body isn't meant to handle the stress this game imparts for more than a few hours at a time.","October 27, 2015","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At the beginning when you get the map of your apartment building it immediately stirred up thoughts of Silent Hill. I sort of had to laugh. But in all honesty, similar elements aside, Lone Survivor KICKS THE ♥♥♥♥ OUT OF SILENT HILL. It is a vastly different experience altogether; fully intimate and engaging. I was totally immersed and intrigued. It was very refreshing, like how games used to be before they just started pumping them out.\n\nThe story is dark, mysterious, deep and disturbed. The only puzzle I've seen so far is trying to piece together the fragments of downard spiralling insanity as the adventure unwinds in shifting clarity.\n\nI am definitely going to keep my eye on works from Jasper Byrne  from now on.\n\nJUST GO GET IT.

While a lot of love for disempowerment-centric games like Silent Hill is clearly evident, Lone Survivor feels like an homage moreso than merely jacking any mechanics in particular. A mysterious story, creatures menacing enough that there don't need to be many of them to be afraid of them, and a lack of clarity as to what's real and what isn't come together for one heck of an experience.\n\nLone Survivor places you in the role of a nameless young man who happens to be one of, if not the only, survivor of a biological cataclysm that's wiped out most of the human race. Mutant monsters wander the streets, and the conveniences of what was once everyday life are rapidly becoming a distant memory. Starting from your apartment, you begin venturing further and further into the immediate world, trying to find things to keep you alive and, eventually, free you from the prison of your ruined neighborhood, possibly toward something better.\n\nA lot of the game hinges on weighing consequences and resource management. As is typical for a nigh-apocalypse, edible food and firearm ammunition are rather scarce, so being stringent when using either is key. Sleep is also a valuable resource, as it helps you keep your sanity, but getting the rest you need must be weighed against spending time making other progress. Everything's a delicate balance in Lone Survivor, and every choice you make has a chance of influencing which of five possible endings you get at the end.\n\nWhile cloaked in vagueries, the world of Lone Survivor has its own encapsulated consistency, with lonely streets and looted storefronts that sometimes feel like characters in their own right. A few other surviving humans litter the landscape as well, though they're few and far between. It's also unclear at times which of them exist solely in your dreams or imagination, and how human at least one of them still happens to be.\n\nThere's also a kitty, which is always a plus.\n\nMost of this review is based on my experience with the original version, as I've not had time to experience the additions made to the Director's Cut. However, given how much I'm gushing about the "vanilla" version, I can only imagine the additional content makes it even better.","January 9","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/notsue/recommended/209830/","notsue","I'm Not Sue","http://steamcommunity.com/id/notsue/","465 products in account","This game is pretty good... but it could have been better, and because of that its actually more of a disappointment in a way.\n\nGoal is to explore the apartment complex you are in and progress towards an ending.  Horror setting is heavily inspired by Silent Hill, but honestly it went too far.   The item use / find sound being basically the same as those in the SH series is a reference.  Monsters making static distorion when they get near you is borrowing / inspiration.  Directly ripping sections from those games and using them both without storyline purpose and without original spin (locking room, object in mouth-like hole, etc) is just too blatant.\n\nOn top of that, every character you meed is of the 'mysterious' archetype, save one.  When everyone has confusing dialogue, nothing makes sense.  A lot of the dialogue for the main character is definately breaking believability too.  More on that below.\n\nAlso, enemies should not become invulnerable when stunned by a flare.  That is just dumb as bricks game design.\n\nBecause of the nonsensical dialogue, it made me feel like my player-driven actions that I took in the game meant nothing. I shot monsters that tried to kill me, ate when complaining of hunger, slept when tired, and acted like the survivalist the game portrayed my setting as necessitating. So then why does my ending involve my character exploring a mental ward, finding a clipboard with his and room number, then entering his room, suddenly deciding he's nihilistic (after 4 game hours of survivalist behavior), taking a pill he finds there, and then lying down on the bed and having a dream of his girlfriend saying 'Hey, you found me even though you're mental and everything's ♥♥♥♥ed up. That's cool right?' The character agrees, then the credits roll.\n\nExcuse me what? Where was the survivalist drive? He even just swore revenge for a buddy he made being killed a second ago. If anything he'd react to this exactly like he did to being locked in a random room before (aforementioned direct ripoff) and exactly like a survivalist would -- "Crap I got locked in! I gotta find a way out!" There's a theory the character is insane... but then that arbitrarily obsoletes the whole story I just played through. He gave up? Not believable. Was there something I missed in the bunch of mysterious dialogue from every character I meet? Yeah, probably. Games with open storylines are best when they're actually well crafted -- A mailbox with a slot that you decide what letter to put in, not a jumped arrangement of nailed boards that you could... yeah I could jam the letter in that crooked triangle space at the top but it might fall out of all the holes in the sides and bottom.\n\nThere are two other endings, but given that the one I got is likely to be the default most-common one. The others are obtained for more pacifist behaviors and another for self-destructive ones (not eating, sleeping, killing everything etc). Thus if anything, this 'default' ending shouldn't be so nonsensical and break from the theme the game has presenting the whole time.","June 12, 2012","false","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nekobun/recommended/209830/","nekobun","nekobun","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nekobun/","1568 products in account","Despite its retro-feeling visual style and two-dimensional gameplay, Lone Survivor blows most modern horror way out of the water. While a lot of love for disempowerment-centric games like Silent Hill is clearly evident, Lone Survivor feels like an homage moreso than merely jacking any mechanics in particular. A mysterious story, creatures menacing enough that there don't need to be many of them to be afraid of them, and a lack of clarity as to what's real and what isn't come together for one heck of an experience.\n\nLone Survivor places you in the role of a nameless young man who happens to be one of, if not the only, survivor of a biological cataclysm that's wiped out most of the human race. Mutant monsters wander the streets, and the conveniences of what was once everyday life are rapidly becoming a distant memory. Starting from your apartment, you begin venturing further and further into the immediate world, trying to find things to keep you alive and, eventually, free you from the prison of your ruined neighborhood, possibly toward something better.\n\nA lot of the game hinges on weighing consequences and resource management. As is typical for a nigh-apocalypse, edible food and firearm ammunition are rather scarce, so being stringent when using either is key. Sleep is also a valuable resource, as it helps you keep your sanity, but getting the rest you need must be weighed against spending time making other progress. Everything's a delicate balance in Lone Survivor, and every choice you make has a chance of influencing which of five possible endings you get at the end.\n\nWhile cloaked in vagueries, the world of Lone Survivor has its own encapsulated consistency, with lonely streets and looted storefronts that sometimes feel like characters in their own right. A few other surviving humans litter the landscape as well, though they're few and far between. It's also unclear at times which of them exist solely in your dreams or imagination, and how human at least one of them still happens to be.\n\nThere's also a kitty, which is always a plus.\n\nMost of this review is based on my experience with the original version, as I've not had time to experience the additions made to the Director's Cut. However, given how much I'm gushing about the "vanilla" version, I can only imagine the additional content makes it even better.","January 9","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It will creep you out to the very end, and then will offer an insight into the nature of your soul to boot. Well, you'll see what I mean if you play it. In addition the beautiful pixel art and detailed environment will keep you intreigued (assuming you don't get freaked out half-way through and quit for a year like I did) all the way through.\n\nPlus you can adopt a cat, make a cheeseburger, shoot a writhing thing (or don't), and slip into drug-induced comas every night. So those are all plusses, especially the cat.","December 14, 2015","true","19.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Draws strong influence from Silent Hill series (no secret that the game's creator, Jasper Byrne, is a fan).  It feels like a 16-bit version of Silent Hill with a dash of Eternal Darkness thrown in.  You are a survivor of an outbreak that has devastated your city.  You awake in your apartment alone, supplies nearly exhausted and find yourself forced to confront the horrors outside to both gather life-sustaining supplies and perhaps find a way to escape the decaying city.  Along the way you will encounter mysterious figures and come to question which, if any, of these encounters even happened.  Unlike many run n' gun action survival horror games. Combat is not something encouraged and you must also take care of your basic biological needs such as eating and sleeping lest your mental health deteriorate and cause you to descend into madness.  It's a bit short but it's execution and artistic style are superb.","June 5, 2012","true","8.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
