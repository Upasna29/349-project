To build up my tower with all this different parts is fun and to see how it works against gravity and natural forces is also great. The defend could be challenging sometimes but after a while there is always a way :)\nOf course I am not yet through every level but so far I would clearly recommend it.","February 23","true","5.8"," 22 of 28 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","22","28","2","0"

At some points it realy got tricky.\nA nice feature is the guns mechanic and enemies attacking your turret ( highly praised my turrets! )\nTill now I had fun with this game and can recommend it to everyone else.","February 27","true","0.8"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twisted6/recommended/354280/","Twisted6","Twisted [UK]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twisted6/","227 products in account","I bought this game under the misleading title of "tower defence". It's a 2D tower building block game with clunky controls and a horrible UI. And there are only 32 levels which would take maybe 2 hours to complete. This just reaks of amateur. For the price I'd usually say you can't go wrong, but in this case, save your money.","February 26","false","0.6"," 7 of 27 people (26%) found this review helpful","26","7","27","0","4"
