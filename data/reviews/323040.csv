There's nothing more to the story than that. Where the game thrives is with it's music and game-play. In this title you use both sticks of a controller to handle one of two lasers, and you have to manually go through nodes / pieces of memory molecules to collect them.\n\nIt's like Rez and guitar hero had a baby and instead of wanting to shoot things, it just wanted to make music. I was able to play this and numerous people walked by and stopped to just see what was going on, my son even stopped playing with his cars to stare in awe at all the shiny things going on on the screen and numerous times I found myself bobbing along with the music moving up and down and shifting in my seat to match the lasers.\n\nAs I mentioned, it is short, I would say hour and a half taking my time to get through all of the levels. That's not to say that there isn't replayablity in the title. Really there are a lot of reasons to play again such as challenges like getting all the memory molecules, beating a friend's score and honestly if you've got 10 minutes to kill you can boot up the game, and run through a level, because you can. I myself already played some of the levels over again.  I'm not sure what the plan is for the game, if there will be DLC or add-ons, but I really hope so. In that hour and a half I was sucked into a world and thrown into a journey of a life that wasn't my own, but I was more than interested in.\n\nThe game has moments where it is challenging, but it is never impossible, and I for one love a challenge. On top of all that I can't really think of anything bad to say about the game. It's just right.\n\nIf someone were to ask me if I would recommend this title, yes. In a heartbeat. It's unique enough to grab me, beautiful enough to hold me and great enough that I'll remember each moment.\n\nTitle fully reviewed on PS4, Though I also played some on Steam, there is apparently integration with camera to play ( I assume much like Child of Eden game), however I was not able to get that part working.","September 22, 2015","true","0.2"," 33 of 40 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","33","40","0","2"

It should be a quarter of the price it is demanding. There is no reason for having a score in this, it doesn't give you anything extra when you do nail a perfect level. As soon as you start getting a feel for its mechanics..it ends, that's it, no more content, just re-do the levels if you wish.\nI'll be asking for a refund, there are plenty of other games for the same price that are just as great but with quadruple the content.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/UltimaLyca/recommended/323040/","UltimaLyca","Rye Roen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/UltimaLyca/","190 products in account","I made a video review for this game.\n\nLink: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelRLqMjkhc\n\nTranscription:\n\nAmbidextrous? Choice Provisions new game LaserLife, is for you. It’s a rhythm based twin-stick game, I know it’s been done before but this is my first experience with it, and I have to say, I was charmed by this game.\n\nIt took me about 10 seconds of gameplay for my brain to kind of click and get into multi-task mode. Maybe I’m particularly quick I don’t know, but I feel like I was almost immediately in the zone with this game. The movement is snappy which is a must for a game like this, and another must is that it feels satisfying and natural to play which it does. The way I’m describing makes it sound relaxing, but don’t let me fool you because the game is pretty fast paced right from the start, and it only gets more intense. Most people will be comfortable with the first few levels, but it really doesn’t take long to ramp up the difficulty.\n\nThough i will say that if you are looking for, begin quote “challenge” end quote, this might not be the place to look for it or it might not be the kind of challenge you're looking for. That really isn’t to say that the levels are too easy, but more like I’m not even sure you can lose a level. Hopefully right now I’m not coming off as a massive ♥♥♥♥ because I got lucky and didn’t have to replay levels, but to me it seemed like you can really mess up the levels and still unlock the next one. There certainly is challenge if you're going for perfect scores, but not really in terms of progression.\n\nThat’s a nitpick really though because the developers even say that it is designed to be played in one sitting as an experience, and I can confirm after completing it in about an hour that this is definitely the way it is meant to be played. And this is probably the biggest criticism I have, is that it isn’t a whole lot of content for the $15 asking price. While I was playing the game for some reason I was thinking it was $5 and it would have been a steal at that price, but I feel like $15 is a little too steep.\n\nThat said the music is pretty phenomenal, though they do repeat the tracks sometimes they do it in a clever way. Each stage has sub-stages within them that have different music. It’s hard to really explain unless you play it but I think that it works pretty well.\n\nSomething that really impressed me was the effort put into the background. Since you’re playing through memories in the game there’s opportunity to put the player in different environments with different styles of music. The music did remain, maybe a little disappointingly, quite consistent in terms of style, but the developers did take full advantage of the premise when it came to backgrounds. There’s 12 levels in total, and each level has a unique section to it with a cool animated background. I’m just particularly impressed because for a game like this it’s pretty easy to throw the backgrounds in, and not really have a story or premise, but this game has a pretty compelling one, and by the end I felt a little emotional. I think it would have been more effective though if they had made this game as a tribute to a real life person; because that’s what the story feels like, but the main character is a nameless astronaut which is kinda disappointing.\n\nI should also mention that the gameplay is shaken up slightly with the sub stages within the stages, and a couple mechanics throughout.\n\nIf the game really interests you, go for it. I really enjoyed my time with this game. That said, if you're someone who wants time out of the money they spend, feels like $15 isn’t worth an hour or hour and a half of entertainment, or is just kinda sorta interested, then maybe wait for a sale. But, when on it goes on sale, absolutely pick it up because it’s a pretty awesome game.\n\nThanks for watching, if you feel that I deserve it and I’ve helped you with your purchasing decision, consider leaving a like. If you don’t think I deserve it, feel free to leave a dislike but if you do, try to leave me some feedback; let me know why you didn’t like the review. And if you wanna keep up with my reviews; I try to review new games pretty regularly, I would appreciate a subscription.","September 22, 2015","true","1.3"," 11 of 24 people (46%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","46","11","24","2","1"

Laserlife cannot be played without a controller. Its not that it has bad keyboard compatibility, it has none.\nIf you don't have a controller, Laserlife is 'Intel RealSense' compatible. See website for more details:http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/realsense-overview.html\n\nLike any game on Steam, Laserlife has its ups and downs. Luckily the ups far outnumber the downs.\nLaserlife has a story at its heart, as in the description, it is the story of a dead astronaut from childhood to death. And its a good one.\nTelling a story without any words* is always a challenge, relying upon visuals**, sound and imagination. And let me tell you, Laserlife has all of the above. It delivers a beautifully crafted piece of storytelling with brilliant creativity that really does make you stop and think. Take it from me, I'm no sentimentalist.\n\nThere are three "Acts"; Childhood, Adulthood and Death.\nEach Act has 4 levels, each leading to a different milestone in memory.\nEach level in the game is made up of 4 phases and is set up as a kind of twin-stick runner, utilising 2 lasers.\nThe 'Collection' phase. Using the lasers, collect memory fragments. Numbers increase and decrease through levels, typically 150-200 fragments per run.\nThe 'Harmonising' phase. This time, the lasers must simply impact the fragments. Unlike the previous phase, lasers cannot move across the middle of the screen\nThe 'Warp' stage. This is somewhat easier than the last 2 phases but frustrating if it is done incorrectly. It is a tunnel runner, making sure the lasers do not hit the oncoming obstacles. Hitting once will lose whatever chain was amassed the previous phase, repeated hits will result in restarting the 'Harmonising' phase.\nThe 'Power' phase. This phase lasts only a few seconds and has no lasers. Simply rotate the joysticks at speed.\nThe environment of the 'Collection' phase is the same over the Act, therefore there are only 3 'Collection' environments in the game.\nThey are a kind of pseudo-psychadelic representation of that certain stage in life. They are meant to stimulate thought, emotion and - most importantly - your imagination.\n\nThe environment of the 'Harmonising' phase is where the story really comes into play. Using the same kind of style as the previous phase, only much clearer, they tell a certain aspect of the story - a significant part in the astronauts' life.\n\nThe 'Warp' phase has a tunnel environment, nothing other than that. Various obstacles block your path, easily navigable...mostly.\n\nThe 'Power' phase revolves around the captured astronaut as the memory is vigorously extracted.\n\nThe music is a fine example of techno done right and complements the gameplay fantastically. It is also really quite helpful with timing.\n\nOverall this is a triumph of modern day storytelling, employing original and highly creative means.\n\nHowever, I did mention downsides.\nThe primary downside is that this game is far too short! I completed it within 2 hours and that includes a few repeats. The only way to make it longer is to aim for perfect scores.\nI implore the devs to add some more content, another story, anything!\n\nThis leads me onto the second point which is that the price tag is, for the gameplay time, pretty excessive. When you play, you can see where the money has gone and I, for one, can understand that but charging £11.00 (~$16.00) for just a few hours isn't something many can commend.\nAs such, I can't recommend full price for this game, brilliant as it is - buy it on sale.\n\n*The only words in the entire game come from random excerpts of real dialogue between NASA astronauts and ground control (added for effect) and the poignant explanation at the end of a level.\n\n**The visuals are truly great, however if you are playing properly you will only see them in your peripheral vision. I honestly recommend you to start up a Phase 1 or 2 and not play it, instead focus on the exquisite background.","February 13","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You are assembling a dead astronaut's memories in a very alien way through a really neat rhythm game.\n\nPros:\n+Visually impressive and well optimized (except right after level completion, occasionally)\n+Really fun and unique gameplay. I haven't played a rhythm game like this before (although I have seen comparisons made). If you could somehow put in your own music, this would replace Audiosurf 2 for me.\n+Futuristic and alien music. The music is easy to "feel," which is obviously important in a rhythm game.\n+Again, the premise and concept are just really cool. You'll be fascinated by the story and visuals by the time the menu screen shows up.\n\nNeutral:\n=Some of the fragments that you have to push an analog stick just partially to get are nearly impossible with the first person moving forward setup. You'll see what I mean in later levels.\n=You'll hear the same songs over several times in the first and third stages of each memory in a group.\n=The game is <2.5 hours. Concise, yes. But you'll probably want more!\n\nCons:\n-You have no idea what the camera/your trajectory will do, causing you to miss some fragments.\n-Your lasers move much too slowly for some of the fragments in later levels. I know it's possible, but it just feels unfair and clunky.\n\nAs you can see, my issues are mostly just minor gameplay complaints that can be overcome by getting good. If you have doubts about the game, I recommend just tossing it on your wishlist and waiting for a sale, as the game is short.","January 24","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I would have prefered some sort of analog input instead of digital input of controller analog sticks. In short the controlls definitely affected my gemplay negatively. I've started out with xbox 360 controller which was terrible, switched to wii u pro controller and it definitely made the controlls more bearable.\n\nThe presentation is superb though that might be because I'm a huge sucker for ambient kind of entertainment. The music is great as well as are the visuals, animation. The store is pretty barebones but I think that's actually a plus in this case.\n\nI've finished the whole game in 80 minutes as a casual run, meaning I did every level once with no resets.\nWould I recommend it for 15€ ? No.\nFor 5€? Probably, but only if the trailer caught your eye because the whole game is pretty much extended trailer with uncomfy gameplay tacked on.\nAt the end of the day the game just feels nice if you are into ambient elektronika.","January 14","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
