"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CueZero/recommended/316020/","CueZero","CueZero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CueZero/","1640 products in account","Arcade aficionados and score-chasing 1cc'ers rejoice; Hangeki is the counter-attack of leaderboard-driven, score-breaking, retro action you've been waiting for.\n\nThose of us old enough to remember the warm glow and the busy sounds of a bustling arcade remember a time when games were more of a social and competitive interaction where we wouldn't just play to simply say we finished but to perfect it and surpass the scores of those who came before you. Games like Galaga, 1943, or Toaplan's Batsugun were never a matter of simply "beating the game", these old classics were all about the points, maximizing your runs and learning every little detail about the game to get that perfect playthrough. Hangeki captures this arcade spirit all too well with it's bite-sized levels full of adrenaline and replayability as it pushes you to come back to each stage to try and try again with new weapons and gained skills or techniques.\n\nOn the surface Hangeki shows a similar concept and style to the row-reducing gameplay of Space Invaders with enemy variation akin to Galaga and it's many spinoffs. The similarities stop here, however, as the combat itself takes a much more modern bullet-hell approach to the chaos involved in dodging and timing your Hangeki 'counter-attack' which acts as a finishing bomb and is how you will advance each wave. Fans of the more recent Galaga Legions DX will instantly fall in love with the combination of old-school enemy formations with the frenetic satisfaction of modern visuals and pacing. Unfortunately that game never saw a PC release, but I'm happy to say Hangeki fills the void just fine.\n\nThe game is as flashy as it is punishing requiring full engagement of your audio/visual sensories and can almost be a bit overwhelming with how much is going on, but that's exactly how us shmup enthusiasts like it. Your eyes will be busy and a lot of your practicing will be focused on where you train your center of vision. You'll learn to strike a balance between watching enemy ship patterns at the top to anticipate which bullet-types are incoming and keeping track your powerup meter in order to time and aim your special weapons perfectly. One misplaced shot and you'll be back to dodging and waiting for your next weapon or Hangeki to powerup, costing you valuable time and points.\n\nVictory in Hangeki is also handled in a very unique manner when it comes to the classic shmup formula, as you aren't simply trying to shoot down each enemy to score. Your score, instead of being based on a mundane points-by-kill basis, is reflected by the quickness and diligence in which each wave is dealt with and how fast you're able to trigger your Hangeki through sustained chains and repeated successful shots. This creates a much more competitive and skill-based atmosphere on the very important, addictive and well designed leaderboards. If you love leaderboards you'll love Hangeki.\n\nHangeki boasts an impressive arsenal of unique weaponry counting in at 51 pieces of unlockable equipment, and they all pack a serious punch in their own right. These range anywhere from a piercing cannon that's capable of incapacitating an entire vertical row, seconds long shielding for that sudden moment of invincibility in the roughest of times, and huge rolling waves of flame that can take out large lines of enemies. These are only some of the beginning weapons, and as you play you'll continue to unlock better, more insane weaponry that will push you to revisit past levels and reattempt your score with new-found strategies.\n\nThis is a game crafted with a serious devotion to the arcade culture, and a detailed love for the shmup genre. It's a classic shooter with modern flair that I can wholeheartedly recommend to anyone from the most old-school of arcade veterans to the most hardcore and modern of Cave or Touhou-styled bullet-hell fanatics.","August 10, 2014","true","14.9"," 58 of 71 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","58","71","0","5"

It's fast paced and flashy, but under all that there's a challenging score attack game. Hangeki challenges the player to use their arsenal efficiently so they can continue their kill chain and maintain a steady charge for a "Hangeki" blast to clear the screen. The game's target audience, the people who loved classic arcade games, should find this very interesting. Those who might not be as inclined into score attack style games, it's always worth it to do a little more research.\n\nThough the game is fun, and is a unique take on classic arcade shmup, it's not with out it's flaws. There are 2 notable design flaws that hinder the player's ability to quickly read the battle field. The game demands efficient use of your special abilities in order to keep your kill streak going, but since the ability HUD is small and placed on the bottom left corner, it forces the player to take his/her eyes off of the main focus, the ship, in order to glance at their abilities. The bullets from the enemies I think are too small and blends in with the back ground. Couple these 2 issues with the bullet hell nature of this genre, along with all the other micromanagement that you'll have to do, it adds frustration in areas where it otherwise would be fine.\n\nOverall Hangaki is an enjoyable score attack game that evolves the old classic arcade shmup genre. For those who are interested in this sort of game, Hangeki is probably a good fit.\n\nPros:\n- Exciting gameplay\n- Flashy visuals\n- Evolves the classic arcade "shmup" genre with it's own flavor\n- Encourages replay\n\nCons:\n- Could induce seizure or epilepsy. I am not exaggerating, this is a real possibility with this game\n- Could prove repetitive to some","August 10, 2014","true","2.2"," 26 of 34 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","26","34","0","8"

It's pretty well done with a focus on having a vast array of diverse weapons that you can unlock as you clear stages and challenges. It starts of simple, with you keeping up a combo by destroying enemies and picking up items constantly to level up and unlock your stronger weapons, which also require keeping that combo bar up. This combination will keep you always at the edge trying to destroy things as fast and efficiently as you can.\n\nWhen a wave reaches a "critical" point after destroying enough enemies (shown on the upper side of the screen as a white progress bar), you can trigger the "Hangeki" to make all remaining enemies explode and trigger the next wave. Survive all the waves in any given stage and you'll face the area boss, which are also ery creative, challenging and force you to think a bit outside of the box by launching sudden melee strikes (ok, they give you a millisecond warning at the very least!) or drop waterfalls of lasers+bombs and more.\n\nSo, yep, a tactical choice between weapons, permanent aggression and knowing the enemy waves leads to victory. And mastering the controls: the ship is really fast which makes players prone to mistakes due to overconfidence in movement.\n\nIn some aspects, it reminded me of Super Crossfire (another good shmup in a similar vein although with a fixed position instead of free movement, unfortunately it's not on Steam despite having an awesome PC version) but with a mixture of the old Wipeout/Psygnosis style in the design of the weapons, which I found very cool. You in fact get achievements by completing stages using weapons from the same manufacturers, like Hangeki Initiative or Crystalix.\n\nExpect the difficulty to ramp up fast as you progress through the stages and good luck with the challenges, some of them are going to make you cry but, still, this is a shmup and if you like those, you are certainly going to enjoy Hangeki.\n\nSpecial mention to the music (freaking awesome, comes in ogg format inside the game but seriously needs an official OST release!!!) and the local co-op: banish the anti-social in you and bring a friend, bring two 360 pads and stay alive! The co-op is great, although a bit chaotic (nothing compared to the madness Jamestown's 4-player local co-op is though) it's highly satisfying to clear stages with friends.\n\nDefinitely recommended it for those who like shmups, those who don't perhaps will need the discount incentive to budge. Give it a chance, you'll be surprised.","December 20, 2014","true","10.5"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aralacran/recommended/316020/","aralacran","Arala Cran","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aralacran/","86 products in account","As a veteran SHMUP girl but also a casual player, I do recommend this game!\nIt's got retro graphics but it's intense, it's fun, and there's lots of weapons; even if someone isn't a top shooter, that person still will get even at least one weapon per stage cleared, adding lots of replay value. The further one goes and does well, the more he/she gets better weapons (like in Silpheed: The Lost Planet) and can edit up to four in prep for the next battle (Gradius)\n\nThe soundtrack has quite a catchy beat and is quite charming (like in Stage 3 on the Highway Zone, it's catchy!) as well as can get quite badass (like in Stage 2: the Supercell Area), and even up to how tense some bosses can be in familiar titles like Deathsmiles, Castle Shikigami, and Touhou (such as the final boss) adding a hint of sudden hard-rocking atmospheric music to a powerful climax of an opponent!\n\nSpeaking of which, the game has a fair difficuly curve as well, one can do quite well in the first few three stages and then it will challenge a/the pilot(s) of the Hangeki fighter(s) to how well he/she/they can fight. Stage 4 is where the action may kick up and become really exciting (in my oppinion).\n\nMake sure to learn how to utilize the fighter's weapon settings well, as the hostiles will not hesitate to litter the screan with lasers and streams of bullets later ahead of the game! There's plenty of lives and infinite continues regardless of not doing so well, so it's also very benevolent regardless of how strong the opponents later can be. Never give up.\n\nThere is ONE gripe however, beware of a sudden "Out of Memory!" error which could hit harder than the game's true last boss himself!\n\nOh but one last plus: Did I forget to mention that one can bring a "wing in arms" along the way locally? (There is Co-Op!) and this will make many of the fights much easier! Have fun!\n\nI will host a video of this game as well eventually.","March 25, 2015","true","15.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Starts off extremely easy on stage 1, but ends up being sort of like a Space Invaders type game with bullet hell shot patterns.\n\nThe main goal is to wipe out enough of the wave to activate your hangeki, which moves on to the next one. At the end of the normal stages is a boss. Hitting enemies with your normal weapon, increasing combo, and picking up yellow dots increases your meter which are used to activate the crazy weapons in the video.\n\nWeapons go from weaker level one weapons with quick cooldowns to wave clearing level 3s. They are all very different and there are over 50 to unlock. Some of them are very difficult to do so however. Clearing stage 10 without dying in particular would be brutal.\n\nOverall, a really fun game to play through and experiment with different weapon combinations. Very good for a shmup fan like myself, though it could potentially get a little frustrating towards the last couple levels for someone new to this sort of game or a completionist.","June 27, 2015","true","13.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EngIo/recommended/316020/","EngIo","ALL MUTED MID OR FEED","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EngIo/","26 products in account","This game is definitely worth even the full $10.\n\nI have a lot more time invested in this game on a CD copy, but I only recently got the digital version, so my hours in this game are a bit misleading. This game really shows the amount of effort the developers put into it, with the text blurbs explaining every single weapon, funny advertising bits, and immense backstory explained through the journals, Hangeki was a great buy for me. The gameplay feels incredibly smooth, and the developers even included a small "autostop" function where your ship will automatically prevent itself from running into projectiles to compensate for the lack of analog movement with a keyboard. With only 10 stages the amount of time you think you will be in is very false. With a massive array of weapons to unlock through optional challenges, this game poses a challenge for casual and expert players alike through awards for many tasks including but not limited to: clearing stages under a certain amount of time, clearing stages without dying, and even clearing all of 10 stages back-to-back, which is no simple task even for a fairly experienced shmup player like myself. The difficulty scales incredibly well, and only looking back will you see how you somehow went from defeating bosses that had their most powerful attack being shooting a beam of lasers straight forward to smashing a boss who surrounds you with flaming missiles which home in on your ship. The active developers are always a plus, as you can see them actively partaking in and listening to the community of their game as opposed to being a mysterious entity.\n\nFor a mere 30 minutes of stages, this game will last you a long, long time. You will love every second of the hours upon hours of fun this game will provide you.","October 4, 2014","true","75.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"
