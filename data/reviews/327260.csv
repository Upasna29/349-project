You would think that emulating the game and art styles would be important then. While superficially and at a single glance the art styles change they do not actually conform to limitations present by each system. Instead every console plays exactly the same other than a new coat of paint. If you are attracted to the idea of playing games through the ages this is not for you. If you want a bog standard platformer that doesn't seem to actually understand the appeal of its own themes then go nuts.","March 26, 2015","false","0.5"," 88 of 120 people (73%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","73","88","120","4","0"

On one hand, you have a nice little platformer boasting over 100 levels with simple controls, and sometimes challenging gameplay as you control a little green block face thingy (as best as I can describe it) as you dodge enemies, jump over pitfalls, make sure not to get hit by spikes, and collect jewels in a standard fare that you would expect from an old school platformer. It’s simple basically. And on that alone, just a basic (but sometimes challenging) game. Luckily, Life of Pixel has an ace up its sleeve. Its other purpose is to feed you a heaping dosage of gaming history, as each of the worlds is themed after a different classic gaming console or computer. You’ll be playing levels with graphics, sound effects and music like they were pulled from your childhood. Pixel includes a load of systems ranging from the Spectrum ZX to the Super Nintendo to the Commodore 64, and a heck of a lot more that inspire each of the worlds.\n\nThe Roundup\nGameplay7/10Pixel has your typical standard fare gameplay for a retro platformer. It works well on its own, but there does not seem to be much variety. It’s your typical collectathon on one hand, and a basic platformer with the usual hazards on the other. It’s clean in what it does, and the challenge is there, but I wish there was more variety.Graphics9/10This is one of the areas where Pixel shines. I mean my god, did they do a bang up job or what! If you’ve ever played any of the platforms that were used to inspire the worlds, you’ll feel right at home. Though I can’t give it a perfect score, because it’s not 100% perfect. Some obvious liberties had to be taken, as can be seen for example on the NES and Gameboy stages. But it still looks phenomenal all the same. And luckily, no character flickering!Audio10/10If the graphics alone did not have me hooked, the music indeed helped. Every world has music and sound effects either created with the original systems, or with emulators of the original sound boards. And the music is just superb chiptune magic!Replay ValueMediumThe levels themselves seem to be on the short side, though they get a little longer as you progress and are introduced into scrolling levels, they are still bite sized. And a level can be 100% completed in a matter of a minute or less on some stages, to just a few minutes on others. Easy stuff here, with no real need to go back, other than to reminisce. Still a good game to show off to your older friends. Or for you young’uns, your parents will get a kick out of you showing them this.Overall8/10Life of Pixel is a great trip down memory lane, and one of the better games to take this idea and run with it. You usually see games try to mimic one platform or another. But this game does it with over a dozen platforms. And while it may be a simple platformer, it is indeed very fun to play.","January 9, 2015","true","4.2"," 40 of 44 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","40","44","3","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/qcxv/recommended/327260/","qcxv","Glypha","http://steamcommunity.com/id/qcxv/","982 products in account","A nostalgic, colorful, simple platformer, Life of Pixel explores the evolution of consoles from cassettes to the 16 bit era.\n\nLife of Pixel is a fun, well constructed, lighthearted love letter for a lengthy history of gaming, demonstrating the evolution of graphics and mechanics for a basic one dimensional platformer. The game spans 13 consoles, beginning with the ZX81 and Atari 2600, and ending with the NES, SNES, Sega Master System, and Sega Genesis.\n\nYou are a square with a face named Pixel who has befriended an elderly, bespectacled, mustachioed, professorial pixel with a face who often shows up to give hints. Your friendship is based on your interest in the evolution of game systems over time and his knowledge of each, conveniently and informatively passed on to the player when selecting a stage from the appropriate system. Each system has 8 stages, and to progress to the next stage a number of collectables have to be collected, and the exit reached. Additionally gems and special food items can be collected on many stages, which unlock additional systems.\n\nThe main joy of the game is getting to play a game with 13 different graphical styles, 13 different bit appropriate musical selections, and some numerous design decisions/flaws/necessities of the past, experiencing the evolution of the artform and the graphical changes in Pixel, the environment and the various enemies in the game. The lower end systems serve as a simple gameplay introduction, being easy, more abstract graphically with low quality music, but this is part of the experience, and each new system seems refreshing for its recognizable advancements and differences. In addition there are a slew of referneces to classic games from the past, as well as some winks and nods to the platforming genre and classic game design, delivered with the classically dry English charm.\n\nThe controls are fluid and simple, with a clean double jump and a button for basic item gathering and use. There are also a handful of vehicles ranging from bubbles to skateboards that are used for a number of levels. At no point did I experience any frustration with the controls or jumps. The difficulty scaling is gradual, and the game overall is not designed to be challenging, nor is it ever significantly challenging with most stages completed after a few attempts. Though each stage is small, there are over 100 total stages, meaning that this game has a significant amount of content that can easily satisfy for long enough to justify its price. The stage designs themselves are often rather inspired, and finding secrets is of an appropriate difficulty to neither be frustrating nor overly trivial.\n\nAll in all, the game is a delightful experience to play, that is elegantly and thoughtfully presented with evolving audio, visuals, and game design coinciding with the actual development of the systems represented.\n\nThis review was produced using fair-trade pixels sourced ethically from local producers. Pixels have been in production since the early 60's, and though numbers vary experts predict there are between 2 and 20 quadrillion pixels alive today. These pixels provided in part by the Original Curator Group and the support of viewers like you.","January 22","true","12.5"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","1"

Pixel wants to harken back to a simpler time, when pixels really meant something other than a spec on a monitor/TV size chart and a speck on the screen. As a result, Pixel ventures back into the past when games and pixels were married to each other, an age when compressing graphical fidelity into a system required deftly manipulating the limitations of the console with every game.\n\nInside each console (there's quite a few) you can find a short but varied series of platforming levels, all of which are designed in such a way as to emulate the look and feel of many retro consoles and computers including the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Atari 2600, NES, etc. Needless to say, the visual design is wonderful, simple and effective at provoking nostalgic flashbacks and is easily one of my favorite features.\n\nIn the latest update, certain nostalgic rendering effects have been put in as well, allowing you to emulate a distorted CRT television, the likes of which were often used as personal computer monitors back in the 80s, among other display types with various color palettes.\n\nThe game also takes the time and care to ape the SOUND of the emulated consoles, as well. Choosing one of them on the levels screen, each console cheerfully plays a startup chirp/noise uniquely identifiable as coming from the original thing. This console-specific treatment also extends to the levels' musical tracks, all of which are extremely reminiscent of the original soundchips.\n\nEach console's levels and their start screens even go into specific detail on the release date, clock speed and onboard memory of the console among other things, making the game itself more and more like an easy-to-understand encyclopedia on each console's defining characteristics.\n\nThe gamepad controls in the initial release of the game were not perfect, but I'm proud to say the latest patch Xbox 360 controller support has been very improved with custom keybinding support among other things. This took out my main complaint about the game and I applaud the developer for improving it so quickly after launch.\n\nI have, unfortunately, not played the game long enough to encounter one of the many purported hidden easter eggs in the game, but I imagine them to be just as authentic as the rest of the game's retro aesthetic and will update this review accordingly when I bump into one.\n\nThe difficulty of each of the levels are, I feel, exactly what you'd expect from games from that era: shallow learning curve, exponentially steeper difficulty curve. Expect to make multiple attempts at beating each level in one life and in the shortest time possible, although this is not necessary to complete levels and your mileage may vary in terms of how difficult the game is for you. I imagine it is necessary to unlock hidden consoles and other secrets, however.\n\nFinal verdict:\n\nExactly what I expected in a nostalgia title. Retrogaming buffs will probably find a lot to enjoy from this game, and I feel it's well worth the price.","October 23, 2014","true","2.1"," 25 of 34 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","25","34","0","0"

It's hard enough that it's challenging, without being absurdly hard (like Super Meat Boy, and the like), at least until around 50% of the game. Had a very nice time revisiting many different systems, including the Spectrum, which I love.\n\nThe game's biggest fault seems to be the a very sudden difficulty spike that happens on the later systems (from the SNES onwards). This spike has much more to do with level size than with level design or mechanics. I personally feel that the bite sized levels are much more fun that the latter 3 minute long jumping sessions where most hits mean insta-death. I unfortunately still wasn't able to unlock 1 of the 3 hidden worlds.

The ZX Spectrum levels, for example, have the maximum of 15 colours, just like the actual machine; in fact, the colours even clash, further like the Spectrum! It's amazing how much care the developers put into the game to make the levels feel as if they are being played on the computers and consoles. Even the music for the levels is quite reminiscent of what was capable.\n\nThere are over 100 levels in the game, with a special gem in each one that help unlock more machines once collected, and some levels even have extra items to collect.

This can get frustrating with some of the longer levels, but none are so long that it felt unfair - Burning Down the House was about the worst it got. There's some glitchy behavior with instant-death water that's level with the ground (where sometimes you "fall in" and die despite being still visually on the ground), as well as the potions (which let you kill enemies by jumping on them, but sometimes you just die anyway), but none of it's game-breaking because the potions are never required and water that's level with the ground is rare.\n\nLife of Pixel is pretty amazing in terms of recreating the visual and audio styles of 13 different consoles and computers from the 80s and 90s. Whereas some other games (like Syder Arcade, for instance) had different classic visual styles as something of a gimmick, in Life of Pixel it's not just a gimmick where you can make the game look worse if you want, it's actually the game, and it generally stays fairly good looking even on the more limited systems.\n\nWhile you're likely to most fully enjoy the game if you've played at least some of the systems and games it attempts to evoke nostalgia for, Life of Pixel is pretty fun even if you just want to see a bit of what games looked like back before you started playing as well, and gets a solid recommendation from me.","November 12, 2014","true","8.5"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

What we've got here is a simple retro-themed jumpy game with the gimmick of going through different "eras" of video game consoles and home computers. Credit has to be given to the selection here; rather than just a simple Nintendo-centric view of old video games like a lot of this genre boils down to, they have a wide variety of consoles on display here, each with their own quirks. Consoles like Atari 2600 and Sega Master System are here, as well as 80's computers like the Commodore 64 or ZX Spectrum. The aesthetic for each platform is represented well enough, and there's plenty of variety; although there's only one track for each console's set of 8 levels. You'll be hearing that one track a lot.\n\nThis game's tough, and not an entirely fair tough. It's a masocore-esque jump game with lots of instant death hazards, and surprise spikes are in abundance here. If that kind of thing puts you off, this isn't for you. Hell, I like my games hard and it still soured me because there are also no checkpoints. Fine and dandy when you have single screen affairs, but the issues compound when the consoles get more advanced. By the time you hit the NES and SNES eras, the levels have become two to three-minute long sprawling stages where one missed jump or failure to know a trap was ahead in advance leaves you to redo the whole thing over. Some might call that being faithful to old video games and their high difficulty level, but I disagree; even the hardest NES games had checkpoints, for goodness's sakes. The shorter levels end up being tolerable, but those longer ones really drove me up the wall with this.\n\nThough the graphics and sound evolve over time as you advance console generations, the gameplay almost never changes. What few new wrinkles they add in are either minor gimmicks or rarely used. There are some powerups, but they're so few and far between and minor that they only alter things for a handful of stages. The majority of the game is just you and a double jump against enemies that walk back and forth, flying enemies guarding jumps that annoy more than challenge, and a bunch of instant death. If nothing else, the control is almost without fault; the only issue being the awkward momentum when jumping from moving platforms.\n\nAll in all, it's mediocre. I paid 2 bucks for it and got 5 hours out of it. It's worth that, I guess, and I'm giving it a "recommended" since I don't outright despise it. It's not terribly offensive or anything. It's just kind of there. An admirable attempt at emulating a variety of old console aesthetics, but the actual game part isn't really all that hot, I'm afraid. If you see it on sale and you like old video games and don't mind the "new" retro style of instant kill spikes everywhere, you'll probably dig it. Otherwise, it might not be your thing.","November 27, 2015","true","5.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","1"

I got about 1/3 through the game before I realized that there wasn't really any significant progression other than the graphical presentation. It would have been nice if your character actually developed as the graphics had, but just being a pixel really exacerbated the lack of development.\n\nThe concept basically masks that the game isn't progressing in any meaningful way as you play. Most of the enemies don't really do anything other than walk back and forth, even if they have completely different appearances. The game is over-reliant on spikes/pits/water in that they make up 99% of the challenge.\n\nI think this would make a really good game if a little more thought went into elements besides the concept, or at least incorporated that concept into the game itself. Maybe a story about bumbling fool protagonist in a town whose citizens get turned into blocks? With everyone looking like blocks the main character is mistaken for the town's hero and they send him out to save the town. The player has to visit the towns of Atariville, NESburg, who have met similar fates and free them. As the player goes through the game he begins to look more like his former self, before reaching the end where he battles the town's "hero" who was the villain. He returns to town looking just as he did at the start, and they learn that they have underestimated him.","May 1, 2015","false","4.7"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

While the actual gameplay is rather simplistic (grab gems to open the exit, avoiding enemies and obstacles - pretty much die from anything you touch) the real beauty of this game lies in it's nostalgia-inducing take on sights and sounds of homecomputers and consoles from yesterday and beyond.\n\nAs you relive the glorious days of old hardware, starting from b/w microcomputers to the first Atari and Nintendo consoles up to the incredible 16 Bit powerhouses of the nineties the challenges and (mostly) visuals evolve and become more and more complex as you unlock new machines. It's a neat concept and well executed, as the game features some stunning pixelart that is more or less based on actual games of the time. Kind of comparable to Meat Boy in terms of gameplay, it doesn't match SMBs level of frustration, that being said Life of Pixel it's not without some rage-inducing tricky bits - a few stages (looking at you, Apple II stage 2!) are really nasty in terms of difficulty. But I guess this just adds to the "okay, one more try"-factor and works in the games favor.\n\nIf you are actually old enough (or have obtained gaming-knowledge from the ancient times predating the Playstation and 64-Bit operating systems) to catch the references then buying this is a no-brainer. It's a really fun ride down memory lane as you will be eager to see what each new stage has to offer and wether you remember the game it is based on or not. A bunch of collectables and hidden stages as well as the HARDCORE achievements and emphasis on speed-running should provide some longevity and replay value.\n\nA loveletter to the sights of days long gone that any fan of pixels should at least try out.","January 17, 2015","true","9.5"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/327260/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Though it would seem self-evident from its nostalgia based advertisement, proclamations of historical knowledge, and general retro theming, I remain unclear as to what Life of Pixel actually wanted to be.\n\nAs a minimalistic platformer aiming to present itself through the lens of 13 dated gaming platforms, the immediate answer would seem that Life of Pixel is trying to encapsulate the evolution of gaming from its inception up through the 16-bit era. Except that here that evolution is personified as solely the product of graphical improvement without any of the underlying design principles of a particular era. Life of Pixel would propose to say that gaming’s heritage is rooted solely in the capabilities of a given platforms hardware, spouting off wiki-like tech sheets as if the only significant element of any given period of gaming is how many pixels a machine can push.\n\nThis seems an especially shallow understanding gaming’s history, because it neglects the ways in which those recognizable graphical aesthetics were so entirely linked to and created out of the ways developers were forced to compromise in all areas of design based on the limitations of the machine they were working with. One can’t begin to accurately recreate the technological development of videogames without first understanding how, in the presence of such limited resources, developers had to devise intricate and convoluted workarounds in order to have their games actually run on such low-powered hardware.\n\nAt no point does Life of Pixel manage to shake its artificial nature. It attempts to step back in time but one foot is always stuck firmly in the presence, creating a bizarre dissonance between the era Life of Pixel is attempting to replicate and the one it actually exists in. But let’s suppose Life of Pixel only ever aspired to chronicle the visual progression of games, entirely removed from any other variable but the most iconic graphical style of a platform’s lifespan. In this Life of Pixel fares much better, often coming close to approximating a memorable historical look even as everything underneath it feels wholly out-of-place.\n\nBut if Life of Pixel is solely a visual showcase then it is again betrayed by its adherence to modernity. Though it may appear to align with the graphical identity of whichever platform it is attempting to recreate itself upon, it doesn’t go far enough to actually represent that platform authentically. The resolution is too high, the frame rate and animations too smooth, and the amount of information on-screen too extensive to feel believable. It is unlikely many would like to play a modern game running at the same resolution as the Apple II or C-64, but with the graphics of those systems being so defined by the same capabilities that Life of Pixel ignores it is hard to accept it as a legitimate visual chronology of gaming history, rather than merely another game attempting to ape the appearance of games long past in order to sell itself on the basis of nostalgia.\n\nBut let’s again qualify Life of Pixel’s attempts at historical recreation by considering it as its own game that simply wishes to borrow the aesthetics of gaming heritage in such a way as to be recognizable, rather than genuine. Once removed from its attempts at creating a technological timeline, it seems crucial to consider whether Life of Pixel’s various aesthetics can really be considered retro anymore. Within the context of the game they are of course attempting to align with a particular era of gaming, but once we move beyond that (for reasons already discussed), what separates Life of Pixel aesthetic from any number of modern 8 and 16-bit games? With how extensively modern games (especially within the indie spectrum) have revisited and repurposed graphical styles originally synonymous with 80’s and 90’s game systems, it feels as if we have long since moved beyond the point where every gaming using pixel-art should be categorized as retro. I feel the distinction is necessary because while we continue to view pixel-art as inherently dated its usage will always seem driven by nostalgia, rather than being an intentional aesthetic decision chosen for reasons beyond its historical context.\n\nSo returning to Life of Pixel with this in mind, setting aside its middling attempts at historical authenticity, we are left with an entirely inoffensive but unremarkable platformer. Its visuals might be varied, but the art direction is routinely mundane, seemingly driven through a desire to exist within a given style of pixel-art but not do anything interesting with it. There is a solidity to Life of Pixel’s mechanics, but also a pervasive tepidity brought about by its simplicity and tedium. Early levels are dull for their basic, tutorial-like nature, where later levels are tiresome in their difficulty, becoming larger and more prone to cheap deaths while retaining the same meandering level designs of the more manageable early game.\n\nFrom all fronts it would appear Life of Pixel fails to find its footing. Its historical pursuits lack nuance, its visual replication proves inauthentic, and beneath all its appeals to nostalgia there is little to find but an overwhelmingly ordinary platformer, becoming then indistinguishable from so many other pixel platformers. And I don’t think that’s necessarily fair to Life of Pixel because it is at least trying for something more substantial in trying to pay tribute to gaming’s heritage, but its attempts are so sterile and superficial that they provide little to distract from an otherwise decidedly plain experience.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","March 17","false","2.8"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

It really needs a bit more attention to detail to nail the feeling of the old systems that are being imitated. My biggest complaint is the "analoguey", smooth movements and animations, particularly of the player. Making the graphics blocky with limited palettes is only going to get you so far, as the illusion is totally shattered when you can move in fractions of what is supposed to be a pixel. The weird particle effects are even moreso out of place.\nIt ends up just looking and feeling like a modern 2d platformer with a "retro" skin than a true retro experience. Which would be fine if retro wasn't obviously what the game was trying to go for.\n\nMore thought should also have been given to the music. Apparently to the developer(s), "chiptune" is enough description to qualify for a retro game. The tunes match neither the levels nor the system. The sound limitations were often just as interesting and characteristic of a system as the graphics, and to truly replicate the experience of a particular system the sounds are just as important as the visuals.\nThen there's the gameplay. It's not bad, but very uninspired and basic. Elegant simplicity is one thing, but this is just meh.\n\nTL;DR:\nThis game seems like it was made to look retro just for screenshots.\n\nIf you want a real retro experience that truly replicates the hardware limitations of a system, try "You Have To Win The Game" or "Super Win The Game".","June 4, 2015","false","2.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I absolutely love the idea behind it, but the execution is so flawed it is not worth playing.\n\nAs I am sure youhave figured out from the trailer, life of pixel is an old school platformer that takes you through various generations of games.  The game starts out in black and white, one room levels with very simple graphics.  As you progress through more and more levels you open up new systems which open up better graphics and more complex levels.\n\nThe problem is the levels are incredibly poorly designed.  The later levels are broken down into rooms and there is some exploration involved.  There is no way to look up/down/left or right, which in turn leads to an enormous amount of leaps of faith.  For example in one level you are on top of a cliff in a cave, you cannot see anything below you but the only way to go is down.  So you go down and are on another level of the cave, again you see an opening in the floor, and the assumption is to go down again, but this time it leads you to a pit with instant death.  The game is littered with moments like this where you blindly leap onto the next screen only to instantly die and have to redo the level, and there are no checkpoints so you always have to redo the level from the beginning.\n\nThis game desparately needs  a feature that allows you to look around the levels so you are not blindly running into things that you had no idea were around.  If the developers added that I would give the game another go, but as it stands the game is too much blind jumping to recommend, especially given how many other vastly superior platformers exist on steam.","January 15, 2015","false","1.0"," 17 of 32 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","17","32","2","2"

The design feels focused on frustrating player instead of creating a fun challenge. Jumping controls need to be tightened up for the difficulty of game to feel fair. The addition of variable jump height would have made a lot of the levels more enjoyable. The double jump is a little wonky on getting the maxium height as well, it doesn't feel intuitive.\n\nJarring menus between levels disrupted the retro experience. Screen was cropped while playing windowed with pixel perfect on, which was fine, but enemies that should be offscreen were still visible in front of the black cropping.

I god dam love this game mainly for the soundtrack but also for the art style. In life of a pixel you play as a pixel who has decided to travel into the history of pixels. In the game you play through various different worlds each having a look as if it was played on the particular system such as Atari. This creates a lot of difference between each world in the way it looks for example the first world is all grey and then as you enter the Atari you get some bright colours  such as pink and green. The game is a plat former and your objective in each level is to collect all the orbs and exit through well the exit. In addition to collecting the orbs there is some optional collectibles for all you completionists out there. The levels are filled with various hazards from spikes that come in and out of the ground to water to robots. The controls of the game are very well done if you use a controller use the stick or d-pad to move and x(or xbox alternative button) to jump, your little pixel friend has a double jump allowing you to reach high platforms. Now as for the music it is amazing if you love the retro 8 bit music then you will love this, each world has its own music and I am expecting the music to advance as the devices advance. At the start of each world you get some cool little history about the device and it is very interesting at least to me (but I'm a nerd so...). Overall so far I cannot fault this game it has 104 levels for you to complete and for the price of £5 or the American/Canadian/other equivalent it is a bargain. As I currently have no faults with this game and loved it after the first 2 levels I must give it 9.5/10  but be warned some levels can be difficult so if you do not like games with some difficulty I am sorry you will miss out on this treasure.","October 23, 2014","true","3.4"," 12 of 23 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","12","23","0","0"

Apparently the developers behind this game thought the same thing, because that's exactly what they have made.\n\nFor gameplay, this is a standard platformer.  You need to collect various gems to unlock the exit and progress to the next level, while avoiding traps and enemies.  There is not much mechanically to do.  You can jump and double jump; that's it.  The control is spot on and the game relishes in its simplicity.\n\nGraphically, Life of Pixel is quite good.  If anything, the various renderings of older technology look better than I remember.  Fortunately, there is an option to apply various filters to recreate the feeling of playing old games on a washed out CRT monitor, scan-lines and all.\n\nThe best for me, though, is the audio.  The game recreates the old-school chiptunes style soundtracks of games of old.  Just listening to the music for the various levels is the best part of this nostalgia trip for me.\n\nOverall, if you grew up through the 8 bit and 16 bit eras of games and want a dose of nostalgia, this is a worthy game to get.

But once I started playing this amazing, epic and fun game, I realised I NEEDED to buy this! I played through the whole game with a friend when I first torrented it, but I HAD to replay it! PLUS the game's been updated since then and changed a bit. This game is simple yet fun, and with every new stage there is a new artsyle! I love it! So the game is layed out so that there are something like 14 "consoles" which are basically stages and inside each is 8 levels. There's also plenty of collectibles and unlockable new stages which adds to the replayability. The level design is simple, yet hard and addicting! I personally love to play this whenever I'm having a slow day in class and am bored. Now right now you probably think I ove it because of what I've said but honestly I haven't mentioned what's bad about it, which is that it can get boring and it has some clear flaws.

Anyways you take control of pixel, who is a square pixel-looking object. Your main goal of each level is to collect a certain amount of gems hidden around each level, there is also a secret gem every level, but that ne isn't required. It can be really tedious in each level because sometimes the levels could be huge and the gems could be anywhere, also with only 2 health you can die very easily, and when you die there is no saving all the gems you collected. Fortunately there is no Gamover, but it does track your death total for each level and it also tracks your time aswell. Some of the enemies can be really tedious to avoid because their A.I. seems to be RnG based. And with no way to kill your enemies in the game, getting around them proves to be a challenge and you can end up waiting minutes for them to move into the perfect spot just so you can bypass them. there is a double jump feature within the game, but if you don't use it quick enough the gravity will outweigh your jump and you'll be left to fall. However even though this game ca be tedious at times there is an abundance of refrense content to the consoles and how they played out, also the graphic style changes each console and even soem of the enemies. Still I do not feel this is a game for casual gamers, or even medicore gamers, unless your super-dedicated and patient there is a high chance you will not like this game.

I refuse to play anymore of this game. I consider the NES levels to be the last level since Pixel got his cake and partied. I don't care about doing the other levels anymore. They're crap, the later levels are just terrible.\n\nOkay I should just explain what this game is. Life of Pixel is game where a Pixel gets tired of being one in millions of pixels on a TV screen so he takes a trip to a museum where he travels through levels of older computing systems and consoles from the late 70s to the early 90s. Sounds cute. So each level is aesthetically designed to look like their appropriate console and computer which is kind of nice, the chiptune music is good as well, the gameboy one in particualr is my favourite. I'll give a comment when I can.\n\nEach level you have to collect every diamond or gem or whatever to open the door to the next stage? Sounds simple enough. But no some levels are just bad. They take forever to finish with no checkpoints. There is a lot of trial and error in these levels as you will accidently land on one hit kill spikes and get hit by enemies. The enemies themselves are annoying. In particuar they are the flying ones and the ones that just move left to right on a platform. The reason they're crap is that they have no sense of direction or pattern. They might just hover on top of a vital spot you need to go to or maybe you're behind them just shifting along trying to get that one little diamond they seem to cover but then all of a sudden at complete random they might turn around without any notice. They did not reach the end of their platform, they just turned around. It get's really frustrating. On another note if you're one to hate bats or one hit kill spikes then STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME. This game is the king of spikes. I will update this if I am ever to find a leginimate game with more spikes than Life of Pixel. Maybe this game is supposed to be unfair considering one of the levels is literally called "Leaps of Faith" for crying out loud!\n\nI was going in hoping that this might replace my lost love that is Pix'n Love Rush. I sort of knew it wouldn't but this game just eventually breaks you down and make you go numb. This is probably the most I've ever said "Oh F*CK" in a game ever. The idea is cute but the level design is crap, it offers either loads of one hit kill spikes, a tonne on bad enemy placements or just dozens of goddanm diamonds to collect. If you're still interested in it go ahead. Maybe there is something that I cannot see that you find appealing but I didn't like it. I'd say try and get Pix'n Love Rush instead on PSP if you can. It's also on Android and iOS but I didn't like the controls.\n\nLife of Pixel gets a 4/10 It looks nice but the level design can be horrid with lots of one hit kills and long slogging platforming along with horrid enemy placement, leaps of faith and first time traps. Oh and spikes. Never ever ever forget about the spikes...","June 30, 2015","false","5.3"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

For each level, you have to collect all of the crystals to open the exit door. Then, you can look for a special gem and, sometimes, a fruit/candy/cake ... Getting all of them will unlock lots of things, so you might try to catch them all !\n\nRegarding the difficulty, this game is more or less easy, getting more challenging if you want to unlock all of the achievements. You are going to die a lot, especially trying to beat specific levels (this fire level ...), but do not worry, this is how this game is supposed to be :)\n\nFinally, if you are looking for a fun platform game that proves to be challenging for achievements hunters, you may want to buy it, it will take you ~7-10 hours to unlock them all !","February 8, 2015","true","9.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Although the graphics are often true to the system it's supposed to look like, the animations are still too fluid and the music for the systems are a generic 8-bit sounding tune. (with exceptions like the C64-stage.)\nI would love to have a bit choppier animations on the older systems and sounds more connected to the platform.\n\nIt's also a bit buggy. I wanted to check out the control bindings. Did so and accidentally pressed enter to back out. It selected a control to change and waited for input. Instead pressed ESC to back out which was all good and well until I wanted to use the menu again. Had to alt-tab out and force quit the game to end it.\n\nAll in all it's a feast for the eyes if you love retro gaming, and I hope the devs get all the love they need to expand this concept into a more faithful adaption of old computer- and video games.","March 24, 2015","true","5.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

It will probably be more popular with the people who grew up playing the older consoles but who knows. The game play in the video is accurate but it doesn't take you through enough to give you a better idea of how it feels. I have restarted this game a few times because I couldn't find the save file to back it up but I still enjoy going through the beginning again and again.

The gameplay itself is decently challenging and a lot of fun, but the main attraction with this game are the visuals and the sound. The visuals of this game make you feel like you are actually playing a game on one of those old systems, and the soundtrack is great and fits in with each system that the levels were designed for.\n\nAs I said before, the gameplay is a lot of fun, a lot more fun than the "collect all x doodads in order to advance" structure of each level would imply. Each system that you play on in the game has it's own set of mechanics that make each level interesting in its own right and a lot of fun to play.\n\nWhile you can learn about the systems that you are playing on before you start the levels of the system you are playing, it presented as a paragraph of text that is easily skippable, which makes it both avoidable and not a good way to convey that information. However I feel that the purpose of the game wasn't to teach people about the old systems, but to let people be nostalgic about the old systems, and with the wide variety of systems in the game, there is something for anyone who grew up in the 8-bit or 16-bit era to be nostalgic about, plus the developer is British and they included UK exclusive systems in the game, so unlike a lot of nostalgic looks back to the past games, there is something there for people who grew up with a UK only system.\n\nDue to the quality of the game and it's low price point ($6.99 full price), this is a game that I can wholeheartedly recommend regardless of whether it is on sale or not. At the time of writing, this game is 50% off ($3.49) and at that price, picking up this game is a no brainer.","March 29, 2015","true","3.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Walk, jump or double jump, occasionally carry an item. That's it. If you're looking for some original mechanics, look elsewhere.\n\nPros:\n- The art style. It's fantastic. When playing the C64 levels it almost felt like I was playing a real Commodore game.\n- The music is even better.\n- Controls. Responsive and accurate.\n- The difficulty balance on levels up to NES.  The game is quite hard but not really frustrating. Most levels are not that big and while playing you feel you're getting better and better every time.\n\nCons:\n- The difficulty on SNES and following. Suddenly the game becomes insanely difficult, having huge levels full of insta-kill traps and jumps requiring millisecond precision. Some traps are almost impossible to get through, like 1:20 chance and when there are several places like this in the same level... I don't get it. After a few levels the game lost me. What a waste.","October 3, 2015","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
