"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ohjjin/recommended/288470/","Ohjjin","Delirium","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ohjjin/","43 products in account","I was very excited about this game considering that Fable TLC is easily in my top 5 favorite games of all time. My expectations were simple: that this would be an upgrade to the beloved game I grew up playing. My mind was open when I first played Anniversary, knowing very well that the nastalgia from the first game would be influencing my feelings. Nevertheless, I would have expected my bias towards the series to lead towards a raving review. Instead I'm overwhelmingly compelled to advise other potential players to not waste their money on this lazy production.\n\n"Laziness" on behalf of the developers is truly the best summary I can offer. The graphics have been updated  but that's where the careful effort ends. This game is loaded with bugs and glitches. I had to stop playing about maybe 1/8 of the way through because the pause menu got stuck. Let me repeat that: the pause menu got stuck. This is the only bug I'll take the time to mention because I think it's the most telling of how severely poor of a job the developers did porting the game. At some point, for no identifyable reason, I stopped being able to access any of my clothing, inventory, or skills through the pause menu because it would continuously scroll through every tab and option. It was as if whatever key was supposed to scroll down was stuck (it obviously wasn't). To be unable to level up, use items or view quests in a game such as this simply means that it is unplayable.\n\nTake a moment to look up other glitches people have encountered. Even if they are not quite as critical as this they are indicative of the experience you'll have with this game. It falls short of so many basic, fundamental expectations; it is a product without soul or passion.\n\nMy final, most disheartening complaint is probably trivial in comparison, but I have to mention it: you can't get drunk anymore. I don't think it's much to ask for -- it was a quirky feature that made frequenting the taverns fun. I can't even begin to tell you how many quests I would go on in TLC with my character knocking beers back one after another. When questioned about this absent feature in public forums the developers claimed that it was "a low priority". They've sacrificied gameplay, gutted stability and tossed away functionaility for better graphics in a new game engine.\n\nI remember playing the first game and having fantasies of how it could have been better. The game was great, but there was something about it that you just instinctively knew there could be so much more to it. I kind of always hoped they'd somehow justify building it out some more, drilling down on the gameplay elements and turning it into a more immersive experience. The Anniversary release managed to step down that road then subsequently run in the opposite direction. It is a graphically-polished abomination.","September 12, 2015","false","1.8"," 460 of 555 people (83%) found this review helpful 38 people found this review funny","83","460","555","38","8"

Let me start this off by saying this: I was a late beta tester for this game and I am a Fable fan. I loved Fable (and similarly Fable: The Lost Chapters), thought Fable II was mostly great and hated Fable III... especially the dreadful PC port and the constant issues that followed it right until it got taken off of Steam. In retrospect, Fable: Anniversary was another Fable III -- mainly due to its disastrous launch. No mouse cursor on menus? Unbindable keys? These weren't big issues for me (mainly because I learned to put up with them) but I admittedly forgot to include them in my early review. On top of that, I seemed to have avoided most if not all of the technical issues that plagued the title at release date. The game, as far as I was concerned, was great.\n\nUpon feedback I quickly found out this wasn't the case and included issues as well as their solutions in my review. I also became more active on the community hub so I could learn of new potential issues as well as help out others. The developers also quickly reacted based on feedback and within a few months had pumped out a considerable number of patches and hotfixes. TODAY the game has: full mouse and keyboard support, blurriness and depth-of-field fixed, stuttering resolved for the vast majority of users, numerous crashes sorted and various bugs addressed. These problems shouldn't have existed in the first place but nevertheless, I'm happy they got fixed honestly. So hopefully this rereview is more accurate this time around (I've included a Pros and Cons list now) and it doesn't look so nostalgic-y.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nA little bit about the game: Fable Anniversary is a remastering of the 2005 remake of the original 2004 title "Fable". This 2005 remake is simply known as Fable: The Lost Chapters and was quite a sizeable overhaul in that it added new items, weapons, spells, monsters, quests, locations, abilities and more. In addition to minor tweaks, the remake also featured a slightly extended story as well as small subplots and relatively unimportant characters being made far more prominent in the game. Apart from this, Fable's still very much the same game at its core. It's an action/role-playing/semi open-world game and it has you playing as the Hero of Oakvale. I use "open-world" loosely as some areas are not unlocked until certain missions are completed (think Grand Theft Auto). Anyway, you start the game as a young boy who is to journey across the fictional land of Albion and make a name for himself.\n\nRight from the start the game's unique sense of humour, somewhat dark story and moral alignment system are all presented and are on display. It's totally up to the player as to how you interact with everyone else and what kind of Albion you envision. Gameplay and controls are solid and very typical of a third-person game, so they're not hard to get used to. Satisfying combat, the variety of enemies and the 3 distinct fighting styles (melee, ranged, spells) all keep the player engaged. While the main story takes around 10-15 hours: character customization, numerous sidequests and the various activities will massively inflate your playtime. There's also the memorable soundtrack to look forward to, however, the overall voice acting is something I struggle with -- its serviceable but it's not amazing either. All this being said, Fable's still a fun RPG and a game anyone can pick up and be entertained with.\n\nPROS\n+ runs on the Unreal Engine 3 and well optimized when compared to the original game (as of the latest patch)\n+ true widescreen (unrestricted resolution with appropriate field-of-view; V-Sync caps the game at 60 FPS but disabling it will allow your PC to run the game at whatever FPS it can manage)\n+ textures and “character updates” mostly look decent (although some will prefer the old look)\n+ the new lighting system + particle effects, better facial animations and improved lip-sync are all great\n+ audio quality has noticeably improved and surround sound is now supported\n+ controllers are supposedly fully supported (I used a keyboard for all my playthroughs though)\n+ new control schemes (one control scheme is inspired by Fable II and III which is neat)\n+ new Heroic difficulty mode is fun and surprisingly challenging\n+ most bugs, exploits, balancing issues and major complaints from the original game have been addressed (e.g. you now age 50% slower and scar less from combat unlike the original game)\n+ Steamworks integration (cloud, achievements and workshop) and Steam trading cards\n+ a few new outfits and weapons that weren't in the original game (these are free DLC from the Xbox 360 version)\n+ free modding DLC (this didn't take off though and you only have clothes and animations to work with)\n\nNEUTRAL\n+/- severe lack of Steam workshop mods\n+/- 2 pricey DLC packs that bundle together DLC from the Xbox 360 version (both are optional and give you additional weapons and outfits that weren't in the original game)\n\nCONS\n- the $35 price tag (for new players it's okay but I can understand why owners of the original game would feel it's a bit too much when the original game is great and still holds up well)\n- the near-perfect UI from the original game has been swapped in exchange for one that feels more orientated for controller users (it’s clunky but still serviceable and feels less cluttered)\n- the Hero of Oakvale’s face for all ages was changed (this visual update might frustrate some people as some of the faces in the original game looked better)\n- some minor bugs still remain unfixed\n- a few old animations that stand out nowadays\n- no mouse sensitivity option (mouse-related options can be tweaked externally though)\n\nIt's always hard to recommend a remaster because of the new-game price tag but if you really enjoyed the original Fable or are new to Fable altogether: I can recommend this title. For those who own the game already... there may or may not be enough to justify purchasing this game. Some who liked the original game may even prefer Fable: The Lost Chapters over this and that's fine. Indeed, Anniversary contains a lot of changes that can be noted as both good and bad but if you expected a remaster and just a remaster -- it should deliver for the most part. I think that's why it deserves a 8/10.","April 24, 2015","true","57.4"," 325 of 401 people (81%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","81","325","401","16","18"

But to be honest, it hasn't changed much since 2004. I bought this game because I had lot of fun with it in the past. The only things that had changed are some textures, dynamic shadows, the sunlight effects and the screen size (original 4:3).

Wait for a sale and than grab it! :-)\nFor all the other players outside there, I think it will be interesting for you, if you like RPG's and games were YOU make the story (in some little ways).\n\nbecause of those negative aspects, I have to give "Fable Anniversary": 6,5/10\n\n\nthank you for reading my review and have a good day :-)","June 26, 2015","true","24.0"," 182 of 217 people (84%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","84","182","217","14","0"

Sure the visuals got better each time, but each time the humorous additives lessened until they were eliminated in Fable III. This return to the original is very disappointing. They upgraded the graphics yes, but that seems to be just about it. The controls are the same but can thankfully be retuned to their better counterparts from later games.\n\nThe animations are a HUGE disappointment. The models look a bit better but definitely nothing like what we saw in Fable III, the animations for them are not even remotely changed and this makes the new models pointless if they don't have updated animations as well. They still remain stiff and awkward and very simple.\n\nThe models themselves don't even do the original characters justice. Maze looks awful with that awful goatee that just sticks out like a sore thumb. Whisper's head is all wrong for the entire prologue looking like it should on a young adult whisper as opposed to a kid a little older than the player. The child character, oh man is that a monstrosity. It doesn't even remotely match or even harken to the old child hero. The new character models for villagers are at least decent. But overall the lack of attention or faithfulness to the original character designs does not bode well.\n\nThankfully the music is still quite good, but it is disappointing that nothing appears to have been remastered or redone as would be normal for a HD remake.\n\nThe cutscenes appear to not be changed at all, still using transparent renders from the original version.\n\nOverall this "HD" remake appears to be not even worth the effort Lionhead put in it, I had high hopes the new creative head would lead the company to better endeavours but clearly this is not the case. The HD remake hasn't done the game justice in my opinion and is definitely not worth 35 dollars. Maybe 15 if you stretch it. This isn't a HD re-release, it's a nostalgia trap.\n\n4/10 While the original game is still there, there's not been near enough done to improve on the old and just leaves the remake a flashy mess.","October 28, 2014","false","15.0"," 778 of 1,046 people (74%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","74","778","1","15","14"

They put in new character models, and thats it. The animations are the same and the cutscenes were not redone and all have the resolution of a baked potato. Even the little gifs in the level up menu are the same. They show the old graphics and are compressed to all hell. On top of that, all the same bugs are present that were in the original. ALL OF THEM. Dialogue clips playing too late and getting cut off, bad camera that cuts off your face in cutscenes or shoots your neck, and for some reason the trader in the arena was closed (how?). There are also NEW bugs, like the animation for chests opening are apparently only 5 frames and look hella choppy. For god's sake the character models aren't even that good and all the hair and facial hair look plastered on. You can see that it starts as a texture and the hair model itself is just sort of hovering on top. At least in the original hair didn't look like it was glued on.\n\nThey also changed some of the game mechanics. Namely they changed it so that shops suck now. Its been a long time since I played the original, but I don't remember shops being this picky. A shop that specializes in gifts and crap that will buy rubies and diamonds, but not sapphires is ridiculous. Shops that will buy dark versions of armor but not bright or regular, shops only having 2 health potions in stock, shops that will buy my obsidian katana, but not my steel katana. What the hell kind of economy is this? I shouldn't have to go town to town just to find someone who wants to buy my ♥♥♥♥ing sapphires. They're sapphires.\n\nThis is a prime example of how bad a remaster can be. It's less "mastered" than the original. They managed to lose some master while remastering.","August 29, 2015","false","25.4"," 177 of 216 people (82%) found this review helpful 31 people found this review funny","82","177","216","31","0"

And that's honestly about it; it only ropes me in for the nostalgia.\n\nThis isn't a game for everyone, however, as it does run into some problems. I can't stand the new UI, which is clonky and harder to navigate than the original's, and the implementation of the DLC is pretty bland and honestly not worth considering. As others have no doubt already pointed out, the pricing is outrageous for a simple HD rerelease. For the full, and best experience of the Fable franchise, you're better off sticking to Fable: TLC which is only 10 dollars. Anniversary is about $35 with DLC being a total of $25. The DLC offers nothing new to the game except fancy accessories that are weaker than the Vanilla armors and weapons. $60 dollars for the full "Anniversary" experience versus a $10 fee for the original vanilla experience. The difference in pricing is absurd, and the fact that the developers want 60 dollars for an old game with a new paint job is just stupid.\n\nThe only bug I have run into personally is one where the game crashes while trying to spend experience points, but that in itself is enough to warrant negative attention as it breaks immersion.\n\nOnce the game goes down in price, I'd recommend this game to anyone new to the Fable franchise, as it really holds up better than the sequels of the original game. Until then, however, stick with the $10 TLC.","November 6, 2014","false","17.0"," 377 of 503 people (75%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","75","377","503","5","0"

When first announced, I was excited because I thought they'd improve upon the original. Fix issues with the old one, gameplay or glitch wise, maybe add in a couple new quests, and fix the bad user interface and player menus.\n\nInstead, it's really only a graphical difference. Worse yet, the graphics aren't really that much better. Sure, they smoothed things up and fixed up some lighting effects, but the models (especially the faces) are ugly as sin. I was hoping (more than anything else) they'd take a page from Fable 2 & 3, and give the option to buy a house without killing the occupants. Instead, it looks like that's still the plan. At least they looked at the menu options. Well, they looked but they did not fix. In fact, they made them worse. I bought this game for the PC, I WANT TO USE A KEYBOARD AND MOUSE. You cannot rebind keys. The default Keyboard/Mouse keys I cannot imagine are good for a right-handed player. For a left-handed player like myself, they're murder. The menu is horribly clunky. If I want an to equip a sword, for example. Imagine I've already navigated the maze of menu options to get there. Then, to actually equip the sword, you don't push enter. you push A. ON THE KEYBOARD. If you want to go back? B. The letter B. Not escape, that won't work.\n\nYes, I know controllers are available that work with my PC. I don't want them, I'm comfortable with my keyboard and mouse. As a big fan of Fable games (I own them all) this is insulting. The graphics are softer. The cutscenes still look like they're from the original (pixels EVERYWHERE). There's no customization to how I want to play a game that's all about customization. The User Interface is worse than before. There's a stupid book opening animation that has to play everytime you open the game or want to exit back to menu. This is a horrible addition to the Fable family. I'll probably play it again, I paid for it. Don't make the same mistake.\n\nEDIT: Upon assistance from another player, he revealed that you actually need to be on your sepcific character before the option to change controls appears. While this provides immense relief, left-handed players may be distraught to discover you cannot rebind end, delete, pgdn or pgup, home or insert. Further, the numberpad keys cannot be assigned to the hotbar keys.\n\nStill, I count this as a victory, and a lot of my stress about the game has been removed.","September 12, 2014","false","38.8"," 917 of 1,327 people (69%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","69","917","1","5","22"

Keep in mind it is the "HD Remake" not "Fable 4." So many people are giving this game a bad name for the wrong reasons, its been 10 Years since the release of the original game and to celebrate Lionheart have done a HD Remake of their game, of course it will run the same.\n\nNow lets talk about the gameplay. Fable Anniversary has been masterfully re-crafted the original Fable with beautiful textures. Its absolutely stunning, I could not help myself staring at the landscape while being ganked by couple of those filthy hobbes and bandits. The game ran smoothly for me and could not help myself reminicise good moments when I was playing Fable TLC. Combat system is still fantastic like its predecessor although some of the enemies I thought were just cheap and annoying. The NPCs are still funny and a tad stupid like one time I just went to the Bowerstone Inn for a Quest when random villagers kept applauding and laughing at me when I was trying to have a chat with a Quest Giver. The story for me is still excellent and lovely. Pretty much my experience with this game have been awesome the only problems were some of the bugs that were initally on before the update. Controls for the PC are a bit strange and would personally recommend controller. Now everything is great. Even though the game might not seem new this game has "mods" which will definitely have some bonuses.\n\nSo overall, this game I would recommend to people, even though people might say this game is trash it is their opinion.

It's a simple game with a lot of humor and a nice focus on character customization. I greatly enjoyed playing through it as a variety of characters from an Archer who only used bows to a guy who just used his fists. It had a nice story and had lots of content with it's Lost Chapters release. To coincide with Fable's 10th anniversary the developers at Lionhead went about to remake the game. While I think their hearts were in the right place the execution is way off.\n\nThe things the remake does well can be seen in the screenshots. They ported the entire game to the Unreal 3 engine. They made the environments and lighting look absolutely steller. The way they made the lighting look on the player's armor looks impressive as hell but that's to be expected from such a modern engine.\n\nThat's... about all the improvements that are worth noting. The game plays identically to the original. While this isn't necessarily a bad thing it means negative aspects of the original game like the pathfinding and the friendly AI are still terrible. They also refused to add any new content the fans begged them to add like a female protagonist option. It is just a straight up port of the game to the Unreal 3 engine and it feels almost like a fanmade remake of the game.\n\nThis would be all well and good but a huge problem with this release of the game is how they decided to replace the character models. The characters in Fable Anniversary look like goblins. It clashes heavily with the exaggerated proportions the game has. The hair looks like plastic, and as a result half of the hairstyles from the original game look like absolute garbage. The lipsync is completely out of sync. Which would've been acceptable back in 2004 but is completely unprofessional for a game in 2015.\n\nThe absolute worst part of this release was the changed user interface. They replaced the very PC style user interface with this extremely clunky unintuative gamepad interface. It's hard to find what you want in the interface and you constantly select the incorrect parts of the menu. I HATE the interface in this release of the game. I don't understand how they could've dropped the ball so hard.\n\nI can see the reasoning behind remaking Fable. But this really needed more care and attention put to it. It feels very paint by numbers like the developers really didn't know what people liked about the original game. Apart from the very welcome addition of xinput support, there is virtually no reason to buy this release over the original. Especially since the original is also on Steam, 30$ cheaper. I don't really know who to blame for this release of the game but considering how good Halo Anniversary was, I'm more inclined to blame Lionhead.","May 7","false","3.0"," 63 of 87 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","63","87","2","0"

Some stuff might be fixed latter.\n\nCons:\n1) Mouse can not be used in the main menu or any other menu in the game.\n2) Keybindings for menus are awful, every time you want to upgrade a skill or change clothes you have to use Ins/Home and Del/End.\n3) I'm not sure the save system is actually fixed like they promised (I reloaded a save in Hero Guild and I had to repeat all the quests that I already did once. Can't be 100% sure about this being a widespread problem as that was my only save/load situation for now). I'm never sure what will happen when I exit to desktop and return to game tomorrow.\n4) While they changed visual style, textures look nothing like HD at all from close up (ie. Jack's face mask after Arena is a blur).\n5) They said the character will age 50% slower than in TLC but mine was gray bearded after the first half an hour of the  game.\n6) Everything looks a bit blurry and my eyes hurt.\n7) Global map is almost unusable, just as before.\n\nPros:\n1) You can get more than $5 back from GMG/Playfire rewards... if you play now and not in a year or so.\n2) I had no encounters with game breaking bugs so far (progress: finished arena and met Jack), but be warned that some people from the forums did.\n\nSummary: It's the same game as before, with a visual style changed... not sure it was for better. The only improvement over the TLC is being able to play in widescreen, but my 16:10 monitor has black bars on top and bottom of the screen, so they could not even make that right. I'm not saying the game is unplayable, it's OK and after some time you get used to it's quirks, but the reason I'm giving it thumbs down is because you can have the better version of this exact game for 3.49 eur during the sales, and they are asking over $27 for this thing where you can't even use a mouse to navigate the menus.","September 13, 2014","false","19.9"," 167 of 265 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","167","265","0","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/b1ll1amh/recommended/288470/","b1ll1amh","B1ll1amH","http://steamcommunity.com/id/b1ll1amh/","138 products in account","It's been just under 24 hours since Fable Anniversary has come to PC. I'd been waiting for this edition since it had been announced, and now I have my hands on it (so to speak). However, looking at the review section on Steam shows no shortage of angry gamers complaining about what they see as a shoddy console port. Almost never do initial reactions approach level-headed, so I want to take a step back and try to tell potential players exactly what they're getting.\n\nLet me preface the rest of this review by saying that I don't strictly give this game a 'thumbs up' or 'thumbs down'. I'm not trying to be contrarian by labeling this review as positive, it's just what the system will let me do. We'll get back to this.\n\nSo, 'Fable Anniversary' is a remake-remaster hybrid of 2004's 'Fable', and includes the content from its expanded edition 'The Lost Chapters'. It was a very good game, and is now widely regarded as the best entry in the franchise (especially with regards to TLC). Unfortunately, the game suffered the fate of being way overhyped, by both creator and games media, and upon its release, fans were disappointed that some things were notably absent. The very first achievement you earn, “From The Smallest Acorn”, is a reference to a statement made by creator Peter Molyneux about just how deep the game world was supposed to be. Players were supposed to be able to knock an acorn off a tree, and it would grow into an oak. [NOTE: Molyneux DID say this, having discussed it in many interviews since, but I can't find the actual direct quote. If someone could source this I'd be grateful.] This was very obviously unfeasible given the time and technology, but it became a symbol of broken promises for people who bought the game with high expectations, and finished it feeling like something was missing. Again the acorn rears its head (or cupule if you're into trees, I guess), falling from the tree of the Lost Chapters, and foreshadows what is to come.\n\nWhen I say this game “is a remake-remaster hybrid”, what I mean is that this is Fable 2014. This is Fable as you (probably) know it. Oakvale and the Guild and Bowerstone and all of those places are still here, and look mostly untouched, but more polished. If you played Fable back on the Xbox and remember being impressed by the graphics, this is probably how you remember it looking in your mind's eye. The boost in visuals comes from the game being rebuilt almost ground-up in Unreal Engine 3, which is what blurs the line between remake and remaster. Ten years of advancements in 3D technology will yield obvious results, but the game itself is mostly identical to the original Fable (more specifically the Lost Chapters, which was Fable but with a bunch of new quests and items). The acorn is planted.\n\nThis purist approach is a double-edged sword, though. One one hand, it means that fans of the original can be assured that the team isn't fixing what isn't broken, and new players can experience the same game without being taken aback by blurred textures and models that speak only by moving their jaw. These two groups can discuss the game with no real barrier between them. On the other hand, there really are some things about the game that could have been done away with. As an example, the game world is divided up into little sections. The Greatwood Forest is not one big forest you can wander through, but 8 smaller maps separated by loading screens. This was a necessity at the time because the Xbox couldn't have handled such a map, but 10 years later we have machines powerful enough to handle Skyrim and Just Cause. Not every area has a cullis gate, and it becomes tedious to run through these small areas and hit a loading screen between them just to get to some quest or secret. Also, the FMV's (pre-rendered videos) haven't been changed. At all. The opening cutscene shows what your character can look like in the future, and it's footage from the original release. I don't mean just the cutscenes, either. I mean every instance. When you go to upgrade your skills, you'll see a video on the right side of the screen showing what a particular upgrade does. These videos are straight from the original, not redone, meaning that you'll go from looking at the remastered visuals of Anniversary to seeing low-quality video of the original models lifting rocks and casting spells, which is very jarring. No sign of any oak tree.\n\nFrustratingly, however, they didn't change these things while introducing new problems or altering things that shouldn't have been touched (or at least, should have been better thought-out). I'm not terribly near-sighted, but enough that I wear glasses for it. If someone wants to know what things look like to me without glasses, they just have to play this game. Distant trees and objects have this weird blur to them that can't be disabled in the game menu, instead relying on config file edits. The average user probably won't know how to do this, and the entirety of the video options menu really needs an overhaul. Speaking of which, the menus are horrendous, and they're what people have been pointing the finger at when they complain about Anniversary being a lazy port. These menus were very clearly designed with controllers in mind, and while I've been playing with one, I recognize that not everyone plays the same way. Rather than describing what's wrong with the keyboard and mouse controls, here's a video from TotalBiscuit going through the menu and showing how bad it is (youtu.be/3VP0aYKklsc). Maybe the acorn was a dud?\n\n“But this is a PC version,” I hear some say, “surely the modders will fix these! Maybe the acorn will grow better if other people help water it!” Well, no. There are modding tools for the game, but they're strictly cosmetic. Head to the 'Modding DLC' store page, and you'll see that the tools are described as “only able to modify art and animation assets”. More than the menus, this game is screaming for fan-made content. Mods for Fable existed, but were very few, and even less worth installing. But in a game where the protagonist never says anything, players should be able to go nuts. They should be able to make new maps and characters and quests and add so much to the game, but instead we got dress-up. At least we can retexture the acorn to be gold.\n\nI know I've spent most of this review criticizing the game, but that's because I was discussing the quality of the remaster and porting job rather than the game itself. The thing that made me choose to label this review positive over negative is this: Fable is a great game. It wasn't what everybody dreamed of, but I missed out on all the hype, and enjoyed the hell out of the final product. If you're the kind of person I'm trying to reach with this review, you want to know if this is worth buying. All I can say is that it depends. If you haven't played Fable before, or you have but just don't own it for PC, then I would recommend 'Anniversary', keeping in mind that the K/M interface is sub-par. If you already own the Lost Chapters, I can't justify recommending that you pay the current price for the same game, but with better graphics, controller support, a harder difficulty and achievements. But keep up with the news about this game. By the time this game is on sale, it will have been patched. Coupled with possible expansion of the modding tools, maybe this game will be what it should have been on release. Maybe, just maybe, if we wish for it with all our hearts, we'll see that oak grow.","September 13, 2014","true","24.0"," 134 of 210 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","134","210","2","3"

I haven't finished the story yet but I've played enough to know the ups and downs.\n\nI've seen a few issues mentioned, I'd like to say that so far they seem based entirely on personal preference. Not that they're wrong but issues like "crashing" I've not experienced any crashing what so ever and all the graphics are maxed out with TV being streamed on my second monitor. I would suggest that issue may be due to something else not that I'd know for sure but I've kept a solid frame rate without a single stutter.\n\nThere was a mention of issues with the controls. I have to agree slightly when I started playing I noticed they changed the controls by default to a new layout which is not so great for mages; To fix this just go to the controller settings and you can switch back to the original controller scheme which I prefer as you can access all spells rather than only having access to one spell at a time. The menu navigation isn't great but it's new, after a few hours I was used to it like any other game. The game clearly was only meant for controllers so it can't be faulted for not being perfect on keyboard/mouse.\n\nGraphics seem to be hated on? I love the redone graphics! It's certain changes that you really notice a difference, especially with some of the spells (I've not tried them all yet). I'm sure if you compare the 2 versions the graphics are much better on this! It's one thing that's kept the game fresh for me. Some of the faces are creepy in HD but really compare the 2. Also this isn't a next gen game you can only improve the graphics a certain amount.\n\nThis is a huge positive for me. The harder difficulty! I'm not sure if it was the same for anyone else but the original was far too easy once you worked out what spell combos to use. Hero mode has provided me with a new challenge, especially approaching The Arena! I made the mistake of assuming I'd ace it but multiple times came close to death meaning I'd have to restart it all. It really has added a new side to the game for me.\n\nThe additions to the game; I love the new additions, the new outfits and weapons. The original game was rather dull when it came to outfits and weapons so it's refreshing to have more choices now. I will say, the DLC is definitely TOO much! I mean this is a HD remake, an "Anniversary edition" I expect these new features to be included to justify the price! To expect another £10/£15 is taking it too far. I'm not paying double or triple the price of the original just because you made the game "pretty". Yes, DLC seems to be a fad in every new game but DLC isn't for Fable TLC. I would love to experience all of the new features you've worked so hard on but I will not pay such a high price for these menial extras.\n\nMy overall opinion (Trying not to spoil anything for people reading); I love it, it's revived a classic game without taking away what people loved about Fable. The graphics are improved, the new difficulty keeps you on your toes and the new features are what make this a worthy remake. I will say the negative reviews seem to be.. overwhelming but I didn't see a single reason that justified so much hate. I will agree, the price if you include the DLC is a lot I would say too much for what it's for but if you can wait for it to go on sale or if they reconsider the DLC prices then yes this is a definite buy.\n\nTruth is, if you loved Fable you will love this. I would definitely recommend it to any fan and for those who have not experienced Fable TLC then this will be the best version for you to start with. Try not to base your opinion on everybody elses, try it for yourself and decide but remember it's a HD remake, not a brand new Fable game. I preordered this because Fable has so much replayablilty (if that's a word) that this will only enhance that for me.\n\nIf you would like me to elaborate anything or have any specific questions I'd be happy to answer, my opinions generally are not biased so if something is broken or wrong I will include them but I feel that the 'negative reviews' have snowballed for no real reason. Hopefully this or another equally positive review makes it to the top so people considering buying the game have different opinions instead of just a bombardment of unjustified dislikes.","September 15, 2014","true","39.4"," 82 of 126 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","82","126","0","0"

As far as Fable Anniversary goes, save your money. Especially if you already have the original version, if you don't just spend the 10 dollars and buy the original instead of throwing money away for this 'paint job' as most are calling it. The game runs smoothly with very few bugs that I've run across yet, got stuck in a wall once, rolled into a rock and got stuck, couple of game crashes- nothing major since the game auto-saves for you quite often. However, it is still the original game! Nothing has been added besides a few extra colors, sure it looks pretty that your shadow now follows the lighting properly but most of us don't really care about that beyond the first couple 'ooohs' and 'ahhhs'. The extra colors add a few more hues and textures but nothing mind blowing or game altering especially since most of the maps are darker toned anyway. All the in game movements of the characters, both your own and npc's, are blocky and out dated.

The sound is decent as well, though the soundtrack is mixed incredibly and is all-around fantastic!\nThen why the negative review? Alright, well, it's because of the ending and the lackluster modding capabilities.\n\nWithout spoiling anything, the story ending is by far the most disappointing and lackluster I've ever played.\nIt seriously just drops everything, and there's nothing to do afterward. As someone who never played The Lost Chapters, this is heartbreaking. The journey up was pretty fun, but there was such a drop in content around the last quarter of the game. It became just story, with very few side quests. There aren't enough upgrades or unique loot drops to add any more replayability to the game. And the whole legacy of Whisper and Thunder just ends, regardless of the choices you make! What the hell, Lionhead?\n\nThe DLC in this game is $25 for skins and a few new weapons. There's nothing else.\n\nThe modding in this game is completely unpassable -- it requires 9 gigabytes of files just to run a mod! And there are only a small handful of them on the Workshop. Also, the way they made the modding tool only allows you to change very specific details, such as lighting in-game and skins. That's literally it -- and the tool is so user unfriendly that few people have even gotten around to making anything. This game has been out for a year, and there's only six or seven mods out for it. That's pathetic. And there's no one but the developers to blame on this.\n\nOverall, if you get this game on sale for 75% off or more, then I'd go ahead and pick it up. I spent $12 when it was on sale, however, and felt cheated. I did get some good hours out of it, but the ending blew so hard that it made me feel like I hadn't really accomplished anything.\n\nNot a bad game, but holy crap could they have done better!","October 3, 2015","false","22.0"," 28 of 39 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","28","39","2","0"

They improved the graphics... but somehow they just don't seem to look as nice as i remember with the original. I'm not sure why that is, perhaps it's nostalgia but the original just seemed more colorful and "glowy" this version is a bit more mundane looking.\n\nAll in all, the price is just wrong here. I got it on sale for $11 but i'm pretty sure the initial price was $40 and regular is $30 which IS NOT worth it at all. $10-$15 fine. But this is nothing but a very lazy upgrade if you can even call it that really. If you haven't played the original and you catch this on sale... fine be my guest but i prefer the original, again, maybe that's just nostalgia goggles idk.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, the game hasn't aged well and the camera is still very clunky, there are still bugs present like people freezing in time during a speech while training early on in the game. The combat is very basic, it always was but doesn't hold up well with current gen gaming.\n\nAll in all i feel this is a missed opportunity here, they could have expanded the story and added in AT LEAST 2-3 more hours of content like what they did with TLC. But no... we get a lazy visual upgrade with optional microtransaction DLC because F-YOU GIVE ME MONEY... skip this, it's a turd.","September 14, 2015","false","3.6"," 25 of 34 people (74%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","74","25","34","6","0"

I always loved Fable, it's probably the game I've played through the most (like 8 times now), it's one of my favorite games of all time and it was a part of my childhood. I played the original version on my old Xbox and I played The Lost Chapters on PC. So I think you realize by now how hyped I was for a remake. But despite all of that I always hesitated buying Anniversary, because of all the negative reviews about how buggy it is and such. Well, after my playthrough I can freely say that I didn't encounter a single bug and I didn't have any issues at all. That's why I could have an awesome experience with Fable yet again and I could re-live my childhood to a certain degree. My point is that you should buy this game, because it's hell of a lot of fun, it runs smoothly (even on not too good computers like mine) and because it looks amazing compared to the old game. If you're a Fable fan don't hesitate to pick it up and even if you're not a fan you should consider buying it, but you might want to wait for a sale because 32 euros kind of are a bit too much, eh?","February 13","true","16.4"," 21 of 27 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","21","27","3","0"

Not optimal but workable.\n\nHeroic Mode was a nice addition but once you got good weapons (Skorm’s Bow and Cutlass Bluetane can still be gotten early in the game) and can buy (trading was completely nerfed. Even with max Guile you can't make any money trading an item back and forth with a trader.) or steal good armor, it’s still harder but not that much harder.\n\nIf you don’t own Fable Anniversary yet, play Fable:TLC and wait for a Steam sale to buy FA.","September 12, 2014","false","93.8"," 154 of 265 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","154","265","0","18"

The Lost Chapters (which will be TLC from now on, go ahead and take a moment to load up Waterfalls on youtube) kept the faithful graphics that give it more of an edge, a grittier organic feel and the price difference is almost absurd.\n\nBut don't go chasing those waterfalls just yet. On a Chinese based website hosted on American based webspace ('g' two 'a' .com) this game is actually less than TLC, because of demand a lot of private sellers are able to sell this game for less than eight dollars, TLC is selling for just under nine.\n\nSo about my experience; I grew up watching my friends play this game when I was young. When it was originally released I was 13 and I didn't own an xbox. Many sleep-overs were spent watching my friend's epic adventures through Albion, at the time the game was pretty groundbreaking.\n\nNow 12 years later I am finally experiencing the game from the pilot's seat, damn does it feel good.\n\nThe graphics are great for its age, the worst part of the remake being the camera which didnt quite survive the tinkering process; it is a little wobbly but I got used to it after an hour. Like I said I never really played the Fable games for myself in the past so I do not need the older graphics for nostalgia reasons but it would have been nice to have the choice to toggle between old and new.\n\nSo since the price between the games are so close on that Chinese site, I can only say that either one will satisfy you, just get the one that you feel makes the most sense to you and please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to.\n\nR.I.P.

Where do i begin? Oh yes, this remaster sucks.\nFirst of all, the port is horribly done. The camera is locked on a slow as hell sensitivity, and it moves strangely. Mouse support in menus is non existent.  You have to use your keyboard purely when you're trying to navigate menus. And even that's poorly done. Sometimes in menus, the highlight for selecting will go into a random direction as if the arrow keys were sticking, making actually using these menus almost impossible to use. No matter what i do, it won't stop doing it. Some of the default keybinds are so random feeling. It's almost as if they attached printed image of a keyboard and threws darts to determine which key will do what. The combat lock-on is horribly done. You zoom in way to much, making your character take up half the screen. Fighting more than one enemy is extremely difficult. The dodge and block is the same key, which screws you over even more than most games that have multiple functions for 1 key. The delay in actually blocking has a massive delay, and not from doing other actions either. not matter what i do there's always a massive delay, making blocking almost impossible. Thankfully, dodging is actually useful, compared to blocking. The graphics have barely improved. It mostly looks like the textures were slapped onto the old fable 1 models. They look out of place and it makes the characters look hideous. Same for the lighting and environmental textures. Sure, you could say it's because it uses the same engine, but even then they were lazy in actually improving the graphics. The keyboard and mouse control scheme are horrid. Most of the time you have to go to the other side of the keyboard and back to actually do anything. I really wanted to like this game. I really did, but they were so lazy in actually making this as good as the original. If you really wanted to play this version, at least play with a controller. If even that doesn't work, get the Fable: the lost chapters. It's not only cheaper, but the combat mechanics are more enjoyable, and in general a better version.","November 7, 2014","false","7.3"," 91 of 159 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","91","159","0","2"

The player takes control of the hero and progresses from childhood to adulthood, making critical choices that affect your story. Quests are a dime a dozen, and although there might be more loading screens than most would expect from an open world game, it does nothing to contain the exploration of the wondorous realm. Albion is a fantasy like none other, with humor and intense action waiting behind every door. The combat is fluent and enjoyable; Not easy but not difficult to grasp. If you've played the other Fable games, it plays just the same. Yet the thing that stands out the most for me is the players interaction with the rest of the world. The expressions are fun and make for a very interesting mechanic, and the whole alignment system (as in good/evil) is one of my personal favorite mechanics of the game. Seeing the halo hover over my pomporous hero's head is very satisfying to say the least, and really gives weight to the choices presented to the player.\nAcclaimed as the best in the series, it's easy to see why this game receives so much love. Most of everyone is fully aware that this is a remake, and the original is available on steam. So is it worth $30? To me, very much so. It is a vast improvement from the original in all the best ways, without straying from the original greatness of the earlier edition. I know that some people prefer the original version, and there's nothing wrong with that. But this game isn't for those people, it's for new players to enjoy the game with a new and modern life in it, and for the true hardcore fans who are excited to revisit this beloved world in a new way. I understand that a lot of people are having problems with framerate and texture (which i haven't experienced my whole time in the beta), but the developers have been and will remain active! They have been great at addressing everyone's problems and fixing them, and i'm sure they will continue to do so. As for me, I'll continue to support Lionhead in hopes that this is the beginning of something great.

The old menus, though unresponsive in their own right, are gone and replaced with something worse.  The mouse control functions like a d-pad, moving only one option at a time and requiring multiple clicks to change to a certain tab.  The menu keybinds (F4-F11) present in TLC are missing from Anniversary.  The hotbar keybinds are gone also.\n\nThe game is probably fine for casual play, but it's far too expensive to make up for this.

Shops will have a limited supply of Health and Mana Potions, although you can still find both as loot for defeating enemies or from Traveling Merchants at a slightly marked up price.

Not for yourself, not for others.\n\nAfter much time and effort, I've only managed to be able to play this game for about 3 sessions so far. Every other time I try to launch or load the game I'll get hit with an infinite load screen, a freeze glitch, or there will be no sound and I'll have to close and restart it all from the beginning.. Obviously this isn't happening to everyone but it is to me, and probably to a few others too. Personally I just can't stand to deal with it anymore.\n\nI was really excited to finally get this game after finding it on steam and on sale for so cheap. I'd been wanting to replay Fable lately too, so I thought this was a golden opportunity to replay a great game with a few new things included. Even as cheap as it was though, it really wasn't worth it, and this is coming from a Fable fanboy. And though I call myself a fanboy I don't think I'm biased or unfair in my gripes with this "updated" version, it really does just feel like the changes made to this version are just worse than the way things were in the original. The unintuitive menu system that makes makes you constantly switch between WASD and arrow keys for no reason, the new opening menu which lags and doesn't load the proper save that you're trying to load (no matter which save I selected to try and load it always tries to load the same one). Also, am I the only one who thinks the characters were made so incredibly ugly in the visual updates? I mean really, they're  hideous. How is that an upgrade?...And then therey's the skippy framerate, even though I have over the recommended specs on all accounts and I've turned all of the settings to the lowest possible configuration. I don't know if my pc is to blame or if the game is, but something is just clearly messed up in this whole situation. The one good thing I have to say is that for the keyboard and mouse route, combat still holds up, but between the menus being abysmally annoying to go through, the game just isn't worth it. Even when it's on sale for super cheap.\n\nFor the sake of being fair, I'll also mention the good things. The visuals were really nice. Character design aside, the environments and buildings were pretty sweet to look at, even with the messed up framerate. The DLC was really cool too. I'd always felt the game lacked a wider variety of armor and weapons. A lot of the dlc stuff feels fillerish and pointless, but quite a bit of it is cool too. If your game works properly then it's worth having. The most exciting thing to me though was the new difficulty level. It added a new level of excitement to the game that's been lacking for me after so many playthroughs. I died 3 times on my way to Oakvale! I would never come close to dying in the original mode. So yeah, it's neat to be kept on my toes again. Shame the game turned out to be a bust.\n\nWith all of that stated for the record, Based on my experience, I can't recommend this game to anyone. Not even mega-level Fable fanboys and not even if the game is ever on sale for $2. If you do DL the game, I hope you have better luck than I did.\n\nUPDATE: After building a new, and much more powerful computer, the game is running fine for me. All the framerate and sound issues I mentioned above aren't happening anymore. I still choose not to recommend the game though because even my last pc was above the recommended specs and well above the minimum recommended specs. And I still stand behind the character design issues and the menus. Maybe the menus work better with a controller but for keyboard and mouse it's pretty lame. I guess if it's on sale for under $10, maybe you can take the risk and buy it though.","November 29, 2015","false","116.7"," 30 of 52 people (58%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","58","30","52","5","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/handshakes/recommended/288470/","handshakes","[BusyBees] Jim!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/handshakes/","246 products in account","Fable is a great game. The combat is simple and fun, with a good variety of weapons and spells that you are fully encouraged to explore. There is a lot of great British humor, and a lot of charming character is put into the environment and the people and things that inhabit it. There is a cool simple morality system, wherein the world and the people in it react appropriately to your deeds and if you are a good guy/bad guy. There are also a lot of little extra role playing touches, like the ability to get married and have kids, that ultimately don't change the game much but it is really nice that they are there. So yeah, if you like RPGs, you should totally dig up a copy of Fable for Xbox (or maybe the GFWL version if you can find it) for a very fun and light Zelda-esq adventure experience.\n\nUnfortunately, this port does not do Fable justice. This port feels like a step backwards from the original Xbox version in almost every way.\n\nThe first glaring issue is the menus. The menus are incredibly clunky and hard to navigate. Bafflingly, some of the menus seem to allow mouse navigation, and then other menus force you to use your keyboard to navigate them. As far as I can tell, there is no rhyme or reason as to which menus are mouse navigable and which are not. It is not uncommon to start off browsing through the first tier of a menu with your mouse, then when you get to the next tier you suddenly can't click anything and have to use incredibly clunky keyboard commands to continue through.\n\nThe next issue I have with this mess would be the controls. To put it simply, this game controls like absolute poop if you use a keyboard and mouse. The mouse feels jittery and not accurate. As for the keyboard stuff well, any time a game makes you use the "Backspace" key as a common control, you know you are in trouble.\n\nGraphically, this game is a mixed bag. On the one hand, some of the lighting techniques seem to have been modernized, and there seems to have been some modeling work. On the other hand, the new higher poly models that they added to the game just don't look very good. This issue may be entirely subjective, but the new models just kind of look weird and lack the same interesting character that the original models had.\n\nAs for the kind of graphical options tweaks, this game is your typical lazy PC port in that it offers you very little in terms of video options.\n\nTo sum this up, this just feels like a cheap, not particularly good port. Combine that with the ludicrous price tag, and I'd say that you should never touch this game with a ten foot pole. This is a shame, because the core game of Fable is really, really good. Fable deserves better than this. Moreover, YOU deserve better than this. Don't buy this game.","February 8, 2015","false","1.4"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

All and all it was a huge bummer for me as I am a huge Fable 1 fan (Not the "1") and I was looking forward to some good comeing from that ♥♥♥♥ company. Why can't couldnt a company who did everything right the first time replicate it in 2 or 3? I have no idea.

And for all these other people reviewing, they are downvoting because they expected even more stuff to be in the game, which I find quite stupid because the whole point of re-making games like this is so that people who haven't played it yet can experiance it where it looks even better, or for nastolgia's sake.\n\nAlright, so here is the basic run down of good and bad:\n\nGOOD:\n\n- All the models, animations (Some of these are still the origional), textures, and light FX have been redone\n- The game looks really pretty on the max settings, and some of the movement is even smoother than before\n- Combat is still massively fun\n- Stays true to the origional's everything, but they did add some outfits though\n- The game supports modding, and even gives a free DLC to get the SDK\n- They are releasing some new content packs to add more to the game\n\nBAD:\n\n- When you save, it only saves from your last checkpoint, sometimes you have to redo a thing or two (not very game breaking though)\n- The eye's pupils are too big on some characters, making the game look a little awkward\n- Textures can sometimes be a little lower resolution than would be expected\n- Texture poping sometimes happens (Unreal Engine's fault, not the devs)\n\nOverall, I would have to recommend this game. All the people asking for this need to stop complaining about the little things, all of them will either be fixed by lionhead or by modders. I don't know about you guys, but I am having a great time.\n\nSo overall, about an 8.7/10\n\nEDIT; They added keyboard and mouse support in menus.

The graphics are improved, and the game itself seems well preserved but.... yet another console port where keyboard and mouse support is terrible. Unlike its much older non-anniversary sibling, the menu is navigated by the insert, delete, home, end, "A" and "B" keys. Your mouse does nothing in the menu.\n\nThe controller issues coming out from these console ports (looking at you Dark Souls 2), that are never likely to be fixed or optimized are very disappointing- especially in this case- a re-release with worse controls than a decade old predecessor.\n\nIf keyboard controls are what you prefer and their poor implementation is a pet peeve for you, I would advise against this purchase- stick to the older version (still available on Steam)- and yes you will want frequent access to the menu so it is a bit of a game breaker (when i scroll through armor it all gets unequiupped).\n\nEdit: (22/8/2014) Since I wrote this review the game has been patched twice with small but significant improvements. If the developers continue to patch and update the game it will likely become the gem we were all hoping for.

This is good as it indicates that Lionhead are putting their money where their mouth is.\nHowever I still, honestly, believe that the incredible cost of this - around 3.5x more than the Fable: the Lost Chapters - makes this not worth it. At the end of the day it is, by and large, a "HD" redux of the original that doesn't look "HD" - Fable 3 looks notably better in everyway except the faces (which are done very well). With the mod support it has, maybe in time this will become a game that is worth the money it's asking for, however at the moment it is staggeringly overpriced.\n\nIf you don't have the game, the cost of the other one is better.\nIf you do have the game, the graphics are not actually that much better (or, really, that good to begin with - they use a DirectX package from 2010, and honestly, it looks like the game would fit that age quite well).\n\n[note: I use a 360 controller for many games anyway (the Fable series, in particular, does not need a mouse+key), so the pretty bad port mechanics aren't all that for me.]\n\nThe big selling point of this game is the graphics and, based on the iffy model and texture quality, I highly doubt they're going to get noticeably better. In Oakvale there are areas that, graphically, look lifted from the base game.\nIt looks like there will be mods (and if there can be mods there will be mods), but it also looks like there's some D1DLC.\n\nThis is not worth $USD35; skip it and be happy.","September 12, 2014","false","9.7"," 21 of 38 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","21","38","0","1"

TLC remains my favorite RPG to date. Some compatibility issues prevent me from playing the original Fable TLC on my PC, so I purchased FA in order to still play it. While the general gameplay is exactly the same, they destroyed everything else.\n\nFirst of all, this was supposed to IMPROVE the graphics: not just add more polygons and change the lighting. The textures are horrible, the models are even worse, and the lighting makes me want to carve out my own eyes. Everything is incredibly dull and grey - the opposite of the original, bright and colorful Fable.\n\nWhat's worse than the graphics is the menu system. At first there was no mouse support for any of the menus. NO MOUSE SUPPORT ON A PC GAME. Okay, it's not THAT big of a deal, right? We can still use the arrow keys and "enter", right? Nope. You use Insert and Delete to navigate. Explain this sh*t to me.\n\nThey have since updated the game, and we can now use a mouse in the menus. However, they are still the clunkiest, unnecessarily difficult menus I have ever used. This is the worst part of the game being ported from Xbox.\n\nAll in all, this game is the worst console port I have ever played. It's literally a port of a port, and it shows.

If you love Fable and you think its worth to pay 32€ for the same Game you already bought maybe 5 or 10 years earlier, then buy it. I bought this Game as Preorder with 20% off and Preorder DLC, and I can deal with it.\n\nI realy love Fable and I enjoyed this Game, for me it was worth and the graphic are much better then before, at least for me, well at the beginning the Charackter looked ugly but then it was okay, I had alot of fun playing this game again and I would buy it again.\n\nIf you are a player who ask a Crysis 3 graphic or better, then don`t buy it, this is a XBox Port, its the same game only with a better graphic, like all HD remakes the graphic isn`t HIGH END GRAPHIC.\n\nGame run well with XBox360 Gamepad, i would recommend to play this Game with Gamepad.\n\nFrom me this Game get a 9 of 10 Points, no metter if the graphic isn`t much better but for me its good enough.

Yes, there is a stuttering issue that is incredibly annoying.  It is rough being able to run Crysis 3 on ultra and not being able to run Fable on anything.  To fix this - cntrl alt delete and set fable's affinity to cpu 0 only.  The game was originally designed during a time when almost everything only ever used 1 core.  This does fix the issue and it runs perfect after.  I have a gtx 780...it is not nvidia that is the issue.  Nvidia runs fine with this program.  The FPS problem people are complaining about are because they have both integrated and dedicated graphics.  If you have an AMD APU or 4th gen intel the integrated graphics should be fine and you won't even notice (I have a 4th gen intel and just leave it running off that).  If you are still having issues though,  "just go to Nvidia control panel and select the Manage 3D Settings tab. After that “select Program Settings” and find Fable Anniversary and switch the game to your Nvidia graphics card". quoted from segmentnext.com because I'm lazy.\n\nThe game is best ran with a controller.  I have a cheap logitech i use for my emulated stuff and it works fine.  If you are going to use the keyboard, it isn't too bad but it isn't anything like the original.  I think people don't like change and just love complaining.  It is what it is.  Another complaint I heard plenty of was the lack of "video" options.  There are some assumtions made by the developers, if you have a computer today it will be able to play everything from 2009 on max.  They have some distance and shadow options for slower computers.  Fine assumption for a port, I'm not complaining - graphics are amazing compared to the original.\n\nOverall - great port/remake.  Lots of new stuff to play with, higher difficulty option, amazing graphics that will stun you.  If you have the original, do a comparison just for the wow factor.  I'll give it a solid 8/10.  I'd give it a 9/10 to have my mouse back and a 10/10 if you didn't release it before fixing the bugs.  Although I'm sure they'll get fixed in the near future, I hate paying to beta test.  Recommended to all fans regardlless.  Enjoy the nolstagia.\n\nUpdate - Through the nvidia control panel I increased all the settings to max (had to add the program because it wasn't there originally), enable the option to allow/optimize multiple CPUs and this helped a lot.  I'm now running perfectly with all 8 cores firing.  There is no delay when skipping dialog now and everything is much smoother.","September 13, 2014","true","1.9"," 18 of 33 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","18","33","0","0"

Fable was ahead of its time and as you might expect lacks a number of modern design principles we all know today, but which did not exist back then. There have been a few new features added (mostly just some spells and new armors/weapons), as well as some things taken away, including some plot elements. Beside that, this game is the old Fable + hi comp art + poorly executed KB/mouse control. They haven't done any bug/flaw fixing so your imerssion is just as regularly interrupted by mistakes in the game as it was in Fable for XBOX. The control and combat system is also quite awful. However, they've made the combat easier than ever because the enemies seem tremendously easier to kill and deal far less damage to the player's character. It is pretty much impossible to die, yet they throw extra lives at you like they are going out of style. Frankly they've made what was a fairly entertaining combat system into something unenjoyable and unchallenging. Special points like renown and alignment accumulate much faster than they used to, so they max out shortly after starting the game. So, if you're really not interested in a good, fun game to get into, and you just want to relax and goof off for a while with something graphically-rich, this may be a good option for you. Otherwise, go play the original Fable on XBOX, it is far more satisfying.","June 17, 2015","false","12.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

When I heard about Fable Anniversary and saw some of the preview pics I made a point to pre-order.  That was a mistake.\n\nThe graphics are largely better than Fable TLC, but still underwhelming.  On close up the hero's hair looks bad, and Whisper's looks even worse.  There's odd lighting around the hair and face of the models.  The hero's eyes look dead - totally a 2 dimensional surface.  You can see this in TotalBiscut's review at about the 11:25 mark.  The eyes in TLC by comparison look much better (which you can also see in his video).  There is a bit of a blur over everything and some of the ambient occlusion looks pretty bad.  There's already user-made .ini tweaks on the Steam forums to deal with some of these issues and using them does provide some improvement.\n\nThe real problem is the horrible controls.  There is no mouse control for the game menus and the keyboard controls are nonsensical.  They literally mapped the A, B, and Y keys of the Xbox 360 controller to the A, B, and Y keys of the keyboard to manipulate many of the menu functions in the game.  I've never seen the B key used to manipulate menus in a game before.  It's not a great innovation.\n\nThe inventory screen is completely changed from TLC's for the worse.  To do anything inventory related in this version you start with the Insert and Home keys to navigate tabs, then use the Delete and End keys to navigate sub-tabs, then switch to the arrow keys to navigate lists and sub-lists, then the A key wear, equip, or bind something, then B to exit out.  Sometimes Esc will get you back directly to the game, sometimes not.  It's really clunky.  The layout itself has a ton of wasted screen space on colors, tabs, and subtabs with only a small amount of screen real estate devoted to actually display the items you are carrying.\n\nThere is no mouse sensitivity adjustment.  When I first started playing in Oakvale just turning the camera was strikingly jarring.  I don't know why, I just finished Skyrim a few weeks ago and had no issue with swinging the camera around in that game, but here in Fable Anniversary I found it terribly jarring visually.  I thought maybe turning down the mouse sensitivity would help...but there's no way to do that.  Maybe this is just a personal thing that I'll get used to.\n\nThe oddness of combining orb gathering and spell use on the left shift still persists and is just as troublesome as it was in the original.  Blocking and dodging are on the middle mouse button.  Maybe that was fine 9 years ago when I played with a gaming mouse that actually had a middle mouse button, but today I have a scroll wheel there and that scroll wheel button is a terrible way to control such critical functions like block and dodge.  It's not as sensitive and fairly uncomfortable.\n\nThere is some key remapping available once you have loaded a game, but critical keys (like the A and B use to navigate the menus, attack, block, dodge, etc.) cannot be remapped.  I wish I could remap dodge and block to some of the other mouse buttons on my Death Adder 2013, but that's not possible.\n\nExiting game is probably the worst I've seen in any PC game in years.  You hit Esc, then A to select save game, arrow keys to choose a save slot, A to save, B to go back to the menu, hit the arrow down key 4 or 5 times to select Quit, A to quit, wait for a loading screen to the main menu, hit the arrow down key 7 or 8 times to select exit to Windows, hit A to exit. Every.Single.Time.You.Quit.The.Game.  In 2014 it should be substantially easier to save and quit a computer game.\n\nSome of these control issues can be mitigated by using an Xbox 360 controller.  I happen to have one and tried it but I thought the quick menu to access the many expressions and inventory items to be atrocious.  There is no key remapping for either of the 2 controller layout options.\n\nTo sum up: I'm disappointed.  I expected better graphics.  For regular (non menu) gameplay the keyboard/mouse controls aren't too bad or too changed from the original but they certainly weren't updated or improved.  The inventory menu layout is overly complicated and the menu controls are abysmal.  It all works, mind you.  It's all functional.  But it's not very well done and absolutely mars a really great game.\n\nAs for stability, I've only played a little over 2 hours and haven't had any stuttering or other visual issues being reported on Steam forums.  No crashes either.  I have an i7-3770, 8 GB RAM, and an Nvidia GTX 770.\n\nI wish I had waited for this come on sale on Thanksgiving or maybe Christmas. I still love Fable and still think it's a great game, but Fable Anniversary did not live up to expectations.  There's a really great game underneath the clunky interface and inventory menu system.  It's a shame that Fable Anniversary didn't really polish up Fable TLC and really make the game shine.","September 12, 2014","false","4.7"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Saphirus/recommended/288470/","Saphirus","Stark Paw","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Saphirus/","266 products in account","Bad Port, Terrible Controls, Same Old Game\n\nFable: The Lost Chapters was a wonderful game, but if you've already played it, you've already played this. This is nothing more than a high res texture/shader pack for Fable: TLC. This is not a full scale remake, leaving audio, animations and engine untouched. The character have been given higher detailed and higher resolution models, but they are stuck on the same old skeletons and use the same old animations. The worst offender are characters' eyes, which like the original game, still do not move. It looked weird 10 years ago, and it looks even weirder now. With the more realistic looking characters, with the old robotic movements, dead unmoving eyes, it really does give you the feeling of being trapped in some sort of fun house animatronic hell. The faces of the characters also feels like a downgrade from TLC, while they are higher resolution, most of the characters have rather ugly faces, and look a lot more generic than in TLC, losing a lot of their cartoonish look which gave them life in the first place.\n\nIt's also a bad port directly from Xbox, with absolutely no attempt at making PC controls. This game is practically unplayable with a mouse and keyboard, even if that's how you typically played Fable: TLC in the past. In-game controls can be remapped (only once in game, NOT in the main menu) but all UI controls are ripped straight from xbox, meaning you have to type "A" "B" "X" "Y" on your keyboard in order to interact with the menus, and there is no option within the game to remap these. Other control flaws exist such as needing to press "Insert" and "Delete" to go to different pages in your inventory/journal.\n\nAs for the environments and lighting changes, all is not well either. While a lot of the houses and scenery do look better with more detail than in TLC, the lighting kills the experience in a lot of places. They have in places put in some new real time lighting effects, but these are very localised. They look good if you are directly in that spot (in front of a fireplace for example) but look really out of place if you are viewing them from afar in an overall scene. You end up having a scene that is primarily ambient lighting, with a few spots of real time lighting that completely look out of place with the environment. You will end up with scenes like the Oakvale raid at the beginning of the game, where the scene is tinted heavily red, but the shadows and real time light sorces remain unshaded. It's hard to explain, but it ends up just looking very WRONG, like a badly photoshopped image.\n\nIf this was a fan made free overhaul mod for the original game, or a forum collaboration (which is what it feels like) I would really be on board with all this, as a work in progress. But this is not fan made, this game had a team behind it and a budget. It is not free, it costs more than a lot of better games on steam at full price. And it is certainly not a work in progress, this is as good as it gets. And it's certainly far from good.","September 12, 2014","false","29.2"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","12","22","0","0"

Obviously, the first major item on this list is mouse support in menus. However, you still CAN navigate the menus using the keyboard's arrow keys + 'A'/'B' keys for selection/back button. Although it's rather annoying, it IS there... so, there's that.\n* Options: The other thing that got to me before I even got into game was the (lack of?) options for graphics. You can set a few basic options from low, medium, or high. Basically, there's really no graphical options for the game. That being said, for a port from a game that was based on Xbox 360 graphics, I really cannot complain. Is it better than the original? Of course. Is it modern PC graphics? No, not by a long shot. But hey, it's a port. It's not like they went out and hired an entire staff of PC programmers for this single game (I wish, though).\n* Bugs/glitches: Well, again, for a port it's kind of 'to-be-expected'. Honestly, I'm kind of surprised about how many people are talking about this specifically. Does Darksouls get a bad rating because it natively cannot render 1080p, or display text/textures in HD? No. Everyone goes and downloads DSFix and then stops complaining. I really feel like this is something that people spend too much time on. I found that if I let the game load (e.g. I sat there for a few minutes), it would load the entire level and I'd continue without any disturbance of FPS issues. Later in the game this became extremely uncommon and within 4 hours of playing, I stopped experiencing this issue altogether. Other than a few brief run-ins with a laggy screen, I didn't experience any downsides of 'programming' on their behalf. (Note: I do have a gaming PC, I don't know if that makes a difference when experiencing these issues...)\n* Overview: Overall, it still feels like the same Fable I played years ago. The dialouge is the same (whether you decide that's good/bad is up to you, I didn't even care that it wasn't HD... you really can't tell, stop ♥♥♥♥♥ing), so the story still really hits home. Everything you used to do? You can still do it. With the exception of some really broken exploits, of course. I was still easily able to navigate the game in my old manner; I had a Master Katana within the first hour (first few quests), and by the middle of the game (before Arena), I was donating hundreds-of-thousands- to the Temple of Avo for all the glory they could bestow onto me. Buy/Sell schemes still work on merchants, the house buying/selling still works, etc... it's pretty much all there. I didn't ever try the time-stop glitch, but only because I didn't need it due to buying/selling Emeralds in Oakvale (honestly why would you need to stop time when you can buy anything?).\n* Combat: Alright, so I've been playing the whole game (yes, I completed Fable + TLC content) with a F310 Logitech controller. Honestly, combat is a little awkward, at first; having to hold 2 buttons (L2 trigger for lockon; R1 bumper for blocking) + pushing 'X' to attack, + rolling the thumbsticks for directional/camera changes is a BIT much, but after all, it's Fable... You can stop pretending you have to block attacks after you purchase Plate armor and upgrade your Health/Toughness. It becomes less hectic and becomes kind of mundane, but that's how the original one was as well (about to attempt Heric Mode), so again, I cannot complain. Magic use is a bit frustating too, as by default you can only have ONE magic spell readily castable. The way you cycle through them is R2 trigger + 'B', which becomes slow if you have a lot of spells and sometimes, you over-rotate spells and have to re-cycle through them just for the one you wanted... sometimes, in combat. Not fun.\n* Other Thoughts: I pre-ordered this game, so I was given Scythe's Pack for free. The items it added are interesting and, to say the least, are fun to mess around with. They are not game-breaking and give no edge over someone who does not purchase the pack. Again, I played this game with a F310 Logitech controller and found it rather easy to control after a while of getting used to the controls. I played my first play-through on Normal mode and plan to play again on Heroic and go for 100%.\n\nTL;DR version:\n* I do recommend this game, but remember, it is a port and is not designed for the PC. Please, do not hold it to the same expectations as a newly released PC game. Also, if you happen to encounter some of *many* bugs/glitches, instead of complaining and whining, maybe contact Lionhead support and let them know? Help them fix the problem so we can all enjoy the game. Use a controller for the gameplay, it'll make your life easier. Enjoy the game.","September 13, 2014","true","28.5"," 13 of 24 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","13","24","0","0"

A couple of the faces (like the hero as a kid and Maze's) look a bit odd to me though.

Even though it is "weak" re-master or however you wanna call it, I just have no heart to give this game negative review.\nI was waiting for the opportunity to return to Albion and enjoyed the prospect of first Fable in a completely new setting. However I didn't expect that the Lionhead studio so much wouldn't apply themselves to technical aspects of their production.  I don't want to describe the game because as most as mine review relates to remake of the game and not the game itself (Fable is the same genius game it was back then with graphics from today). The authors have suffered miserably trying to tame the Unreal Engine 3. We can occasionally notice screenlags and framedrops.  In general, discussed remake is in fact far from ideal. So it was not that I only complain, in the Anniversary graphics is tucked up into desired by so many 1080p. Indeed, the resolution does not end the list of the news, because in terms of graphic design fresh is almost everything - texture, lighting, and even colors. Oh and remember about improved controls. And that's basically all - everything else is exactly the same as in the production, which was played in 2005. So here we have not only identical advantages and disadvantages, but exactly the same charge of magical charm, interspersed with a large number of shortcomings and conventionality. If this game is for you, complete stranger, this is an ideal opportunity to become familiar with the now-iconic game.","February 10","true","18.3"," 15 of 28 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","15","28","0","0"

But i already played fable once and I felt that buying The lost chapters did not really warrant me buying a new copy of the game. Then Lionhead announced this game, and I was almost going to pass it up, until I looked into it further. Some people don't seem to appreciate the effort lionhead put into this, they COMPLETELY remade the whole game in a new engine. They had to port all the old textures and remake them into higher definitions which is pretty much saying they made new textures just the same style as the original game. It is not as buggy as the old one is on newer systems as well and thats a plus.\n\nTL;DR It is a complete overhaul of a remake, they left no stone unturned. If you liked the original game and never bought the lost chapters you should buy this. If you have the lost chapters, consider if all the bells and whistles are worth the money first.\n\nP.S. I also suggest you get a xbox controller to play this game with. It really makes this game shine and works flawlessly.","October 5, 2014","true","158.8"," 27 of 52 people (52%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","52","27","52","3","0"

I just started playing and I am already frustrated about the controls, I was really looking forward to this game too. I personally do not use game controllers for the pc due to the fact that I don't have one don't need one. Anyone who is like that will most likely run into the same problem as me. The main aspect about this version I do like though is the dlc and updated graphics. On a whole I think this game is definitly worth playing though, especially if you have a game controller for the pc.\n\nI also recommend  just playing the original fable the lost chapters, due to the fact that I have noticed many crashing and loading and lagging issues that I have  experienced on the Xbox 360 version of this game. Therefore I have decided to change my opinion on my recomendation, as I believe that this game could have been atleast improved from the Xbox 360 version, since it is on the pc.\n\nAlso There are many similarities that are familiar too the original Fable the lost chapters in the mechanics that I have used in the past for the pc specifically. There is also already mods for the original fable the lost chapters as well that has been out for ages.\n\nOn a whole I honestly feel pretty nuetral about this version of the game, I was disapointed, but I am also glad that I still have fun playing this game after all these years.  :)\n\n\n\n\n\nOk this game version sucks ***  i thought they fixed the keyboard controls! now since i can only modify some of them, I accidently set it so I can never access my inventory. Basically the controls still suck. I am very disappointed in you Lionhead. Shame on you! only put in 17 hours of this game so far compared to the 2000 something in some of my other games.

The core game is still in tact, and just as enjoyable (and recommended) but the original has had a lot more love put into it and is more deserving of your money.\n\nFable remains a very enjoyable experience, and worthy of multiple playthroughs.

The UI is still broken however. You still can't navigate though the menus with a mouse, nor can you reassign the (stupid) menu keys.  You can map more of the keys (note thats STILL "more" not "all"). While trying to reassign the keys to something a little more sane I discovered you can't map anything to ctrl or alt, and that left shift and right shift are treated as the same key.  also the ' key is forbidden for keyboard mapping.  No idea why, it just "is". Oh, and "accept" and "back" are still hardcoded to "A" and "B".  Nice first try, now how about giving us a patch that actually FIXES the issues we're all complaining about.\n\n-- ORIGINAL REVIEW STARTS HERE --\n\nI wanted to like this game, I really did. I even played it past the intro level (which has an annoying about of cutscenes) in the hope I'd get used to the UI and controls. But this has to be the worst port I have ever had the misfortune to pre-purchace.  The User Interface is horrible, the "new" graphics are nothing much (and some of the "new" faces are appalingly ugly).  This is a quick and dirty port of a console version rather than a PC version.  How quick and dirty?  The "A" and "B" buttons from the joystick have been assigned to the "A" and "B" keys on the keyboard so they didn't have to change anything else.  Half the keys (and as far as I can tell, all the mouse commands) cannot be redefined, some of the special moves (flaunt, first person perspective when using a bow) either don't work at all, or work so sporadically as to be unusable. Quest markers for secondary missions are either missing or randomly vanish (and so do some guard quest NPC's, don't tell someone to wait then go kill bandits, you'll come back to find they have vanished and the quest is now unplayable).\n\nIf there was a reasonable way to hand this back for a refund I'd be at the head of the queue.  Until they release a patch for at least the UI and quests, I'd advise leaving this alone and trying the older "fable lost levels" instead.  It's cheaper, and apparantly has a UI that actually works.","September 15, 2014","false","4.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","2"

Couple this with the fact that the game stutters it's way through sections for no apparent reason other than that that is what it wants to do. The controls are horrendous unless you use a game pad, with no option to key bind for the keyboard and mouse, you're left with some un-intuitive system that seemingly was designed by someone with no background in PC gaming.\n\nFor Lionhead's sake I hope they patch this quick, they're losing a large audiences attention very quickly with this.

Fable Anniversary is the re-release of the original game that was created in 2004 and is bundled with all the extra content that was subsequently released a year later.

It is far more than just an HD remake, It is a complete redesign on the graphical style of Fable with an absolutely impressive lighting system and a recrafting of the original textures along with a new streamlined control system modeled after the much better control scheme of Fable 2, but only those with a controller will be able to enjoy the new controls as the controls for the keyboard are still the same as the original.

I played the original and fell in love with it. Fable is a game that I can never get tired of even after 10 years. It is a mixture of both badass and funny. I believe that the story to this game is very well developed and each character is kept interesting. One thing I do have to say about Fable Anniversary is that the quality looks a bit odd and I still prefer the original one, but that's just probably because I grew up playing the Lost Chapters. Either way, I really do reccomend this game to those who like RPG's because the story is great and easy to follow along.\nCHICKEN CHASER!!!!","March 24, 2015","true","20.8"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","0"

Any bugs or glitches that were there, are no longer there so don't worry about that when purchasing this game. It has a great storyline, one of the best combat systems, a huge arsenal of weaponry/spells, and a great system for customizing your character.\n\nStorymode: The storymode in the game is one of my all time favorites in rpg's. Getting scarred as a child, then living a life where you thirst for revenge. And like every story, when seeking revenge, betrayal is not far behind.\n\nCombat Style: I've played a lot of rpg's and this is a combat style that I wish more fantacy rpg's will focus on. You can easily organize your massive library of spells to work with your combat when needed. Unlikeother games I found this one a lot easier to defend myself against enimies, yet still gave me a challenge if I wasn't paying enough attention.\n\nCharacter Customization: As you play the game you begin to aquire more clothing/armour, as well find some tattoo parlours/hairsalons. With clothing you can mix and match or easily set it to the presets. Each set of clothing not only helps you with your armour, but with how you look to other npc's, Rather you're trying to attract a babe, or scare a gaurd the Algorythm in doing so is very simple to understand. When it comes down to tattoo/hairstylists, there are several locations in doing so. Each location has different styles, and certain artists don't have a stationary building so you are able to go on a random walk in the woods and end up getting a haircut and a new tattoo along the way.\n\nBugs and Glitches: I didn't buy the game when it first came out so my following statement is how the game is currently. Mind you I 100% the game so I was still able to experience everything, and I'm not reviewing this whilst I'm in the middle of the game. The only bugs that I did get are the following: Getting stuck between two objects, when this happened I simply tp'd out and continued on (This happened only once through my entire play through). Near the end of the game I tried to kill an enemy with my sword and when doing so my game crashed, I resolved this problem by killing him with my bow instead. After doing so I had 0 problems with that quest and at no other point did I have that problem. After I 100% the acievments I was awarded the achivment via game but I wasn't via steam. Which is frustraiting but nothing to cry over. In simple terms the game has very minimal bugs, all of which were easily resolved.\n","June 20, 2015","true","26.2"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

The updates have been coming in, and we have recieved what we demanded in a quality game. This still doesn't change the fact that I feel the original remains superior.\n\nThere are a few big issues I still see in this title. The graphics, while improved from the original, fail to meet the current standards for games of this art style. There are many textures that don't even meet the debatable quality of the rest of the game. Many of the characters that looked fine in the original, now look disgusing.\n\nMouse support on the menus is enough to make me consider playing it more, but I'm experiencing frame-rate issues for no obvious reason. A shame, as I have complete the original many times, and want to play the harder difficulties that Anniversary offers.\n\nTL;DR My opinion on the game has increased immensly from its original release date, but it has yet to meet the standards it should. If the game continues to be improved by the developers, then it may just get my approval someday.","September 13, 2014","false","8.7"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","1"

Let this be a lesson to us all.\n\nThis remake has been designed for a console and not PCs and the shoddy porting does not justify the price tag. Porting a console game for PCs and not redesigning the control interface to take advantage of the versitility of keyboards is just outright lazy. The developers should be ashamed.\n\nThe simplified interface is a big problem. My impression is they designed it to be attractive instead of functional. Menus do not support mice and are awkward to navigate.\n\nAnother couple of flaws with this game are hard-coded keybinds and non-reprogrammable key functions. First off they are scattered all over the keyboard [Menu navigation keys especially]. Secondly if you are using directional keys you will find that a lot of the neighboring keys cannot be rebound. Unless you are born with a third, usuable arm it is difficult to use the controls effectively.\n\nLastly, for a game that is focused around cosmetic improvements it does not offer much fine-tuning for the graphics. It offers very few options [Which is a huge problem for lower-end computers, since minimal settings are still overstrained by the games poor optimization]. The only way to modify specific graphical features is to root around the files and modify configs. Players should NEVER have to do this.\n\nI have no found no notable qualities that makes this game superior to the original Fable.\n\nP.S - You can take your enforced Depth of Field and Bloom and shove it up your asses. If I wanted those on all the time I would just save my GPU the trouble and smear grease on my screen. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.","September 13, 2014","false","0.9"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","10","19","0","5"

I've got used to gameplay quite fast, either with keyboard or gamepad.\n\nAt most i've liked beautifull landscape, where you walk arround trees on an adventure, and feel like you are in some kind of a wonderland - just beautifull. Also there's a narrator that often commentates when you need to acquire some items or when you've finnished the quest.\n\nThere's also several outpost camps with different merchants(traders), where you can buy goods for an exchange of your gold you've collected through the game.\n\n\nFable Anniversary is definatelly worth buying if you like to play this genre of games.

It honestly feels more like a retexture and lighting mod than an old favorites' rebirth.\nThat's not as bad if you didn't count for the horrible menu's, tedious controls and exact same animations as the original version.\n\nMaybe my expectations were to high, but I thought this game would have enhanced controls, finetuned for PC.

The first half of the game I found myself questioning if I had really picked "heroic" in the beginning. The only way I knew for sure before I beat it, was the enemies did infact have obsidian & master weapons. That was it, just a visual indication. It's been a long time since I had last played TLC's but I didnt notice a lack of potions, experience, money or even an increase in enemy damage like they said. Im an average gamer when it comes to skill at best and I died a total of 3 times. With a difficulty labeled "Heroic" and described as "(it) will test the mettle of even the most hardcore Fable fan.", you would think it would present some kind of... challenge? Heroic mode was a joke.\n\nOther than that, the graphical upgrade was nice for the game imo, aside from the characters faces. And the menus were not intuitive at all. I found myself fumbling through them more than I would have liked. I can't really comment on the keyboard controls as I used a PS3 controller, but aparently those were chosen by throwing darts at keys.\n\nBottom line, I'd stick with the lost chapters or wait for this to go on sale down the road. I personally can't justify spending $35 for this knowing what I know now. In fact I spent only $21 and still regret it. The only thing that might make it worth the current price is if the integrate steamworks support.

Anniversary edition is NOT worth it, in MY opinion. The graphics, are not even better. I am looking at this game and wondering if they even spent more than a days worth of work, tons of stuff still looks like it was made in 2004. I do not recommend this, because it is exactly the same as The Lost chapters, which was an incredible game, one that i played several times now. This just felt like  a way to get us all to buy the same exact game again, "instead its HD" in my opinion, the game does not even look much better. I personally prefer the games graphics from 2004, it had more of a Fable feel to me. I'm disappointed that i purchased this, I am happy to support Lionhead, but they could at the very least put some effort it. This game runs the same, it is true, it feels the same, which is true, Is there a point in buying it when it practically looks the same? I didn't expect graphics that are of todays "AAA" standard, but i expected more than what we got with this game. Lionhead makes a good game, but not a game you should buy twice.

Trying to change your armour is a pay in the ♥♥♥ you have to use HOME and END keys. when really you could of just clicked on the stuff you wanted to use.

Sadly, that was the main grab for most of us. Imagine TLC with a higher polygon count, and that's what we are dealing with for the most part. There is a bit more detail on the armor, however the charater models seem to somehow look even worse. These graphics may have been mid-end 5 years ago.\n\nPlaying with a 360 controller, the new menu seems a bit clunky and the camera is definitely wobbly. Never bothered with KB+M, but I can definitely see why it is frustrating. Many of the glitches and issues from the original xbox release 10 years ago are still prevalent, unfortunately. Nothing game-breaking, but animations are far from smooth and the new combat system is not what I would call 'intuitive'.\n\nOne of the things that really disappoints me is how simple the achievements are. Nearly every achievement outside of the story-related ones give you two ways to attain it, making them all incredibly easy. "Unlock all demon doors... Or flip the bird at one locked one" is hardly anything to be proud of.\n\nHopefully the devs step up to the plate and fix some of the more severe issues, such as the KB+M compatibility. I'd love to see some additional content and better textures, but if they didn't do it while 'developing' this re-release, I can't se it happening now. Maybe the modding community can have a go at it.. Regardless, I will play this through. Still love the game, would happily recommend it to someone who has never played Fable before, but not in it's current state and NOT at $35.","September 12, 2014","false","38.7"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

You basically target and hold down the magic button.\n\nMoney is the "most useful" thing in the world as far as causing something to happen - and basically you need 100,000's of gold to buy up houses that pay back very little.\n\nThe most creative thing in the game is marrying someone and having sex I suppose.

Doesn't seem like anything new has been added so far, but I suppose that's because it's just remastered graphics?\n\nThe graphics seem ok, not fantastic. The faces seem very... ugly. I'm sure my character wasn't that ugly in the first game, and other characters also seem to have lumpy, mishapen potatoes for heads. some people have weird eyes that seem to glow, which is odd. All the cutscenes and animations like in the spell book (when you go to upgrade abilities, you see a little imge of the spell in the bottom right corner) seem to be from the old game, and are quite blurred. Which is odd, seeing as this is supposed to be an upgraded graphics game.\n\nThe controls are abysmal. I can't remember the original fable have these weird controls. It's very difficult to shoot bows and dodge and everything at once, which I can't remember happening in the original. The menus are terriblle and nothing is consistent. (As default) You walk using WASD, then the menu switches to using insert/home, delete/end and arrow keys.\nNo mouse is allowed in inventory/menu screen. It just makes it more difficult to use, and seems like a crappy console port.\n\nAging and scars are terrible. As a young adult in this game, I shouldn't look like an 80 year old man who's been whipped and tortured all his life. The slightest nudge of a leaf, falling gently from a tree, causes horrific and irrevesible scaring over 90% of your hero's body.

When I heard that there was a game that was exactly the same but with a graphics/physics update I thought great! Pre-ordered it without a second though. I've been quite disapointed with it though. Considering the graphics are the ONLY update to the game, which is priced at a hefty £26.99 I was expecting amazing graphics, although the graphics are better than its predesessor, they are by no means impressive. Rocky terrain is still completely smooth, and the game for some reason is quite blurry. Not even close to being worth £26.99. The game is also an obvious console port. You have to use the keyboard to navigate the menu's which can be quite frustrating and you are unable to bind the keys to the mouse, for the price tag its unacceptable and just lazy. I've already had an unrecoverable crash.\n\nIf you are a die hard Fable fan im sure you will buy this anyway. If you havnt played before, I suggest waiting until the game is at a more reasonable price. In conclusion this is a slight graphics update, with a lazy console port feel and leaves the impression that the developers just wanted to make a bit of easy money from a known title.","September 13, 2014","false","12.2"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","1"

I was so excited for the reboot after playing all the different versions dozens of times. The game looks okay...but the characters faces all look very waxy. The menu system doesn't support a mouse. Instead you navagate the menus with the A and B key which is odd on it's own. Then you get into the complicated menu system where you must use Ins, Delete, Home and End to navagate through the different categories of items.\n\nI got the game for 44% off and the pre-order DLC so I'm not to upset with my purchase, I'm hoping they'll fix it as time goes on. To anyone curious about this game, if you haven't played Fable: The Lost Chapters I highly reccomend that more, but you're a long time Fable fan like myself I would suggest this game during a sale event.\n\nTL:DR - Game looks good, better in my opinion (Other then weird character faces), but the menu system will drive you crazy.","September 13, 2014","false","11.4"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

It runs fine, the graphics are nice, but here's the thing...You don't play a game for graphics, I don't care who you are but if you give a positive review for this game, I'm calling bs. I'll give a few pros and cons that I have encountered in playing this.\n\nPros:\n\nGraphics are better than the origional/Lost chapters.\n\nDLC stuff (Trust me I'm scraping the bottom of the barrel with these pros for this game)\n\nPersonal Pro: You can dress up as a guard and beat up people with a Lute, I love that.\n\nPersonal Pro: It stays true to the story/doesn't add extra bs to an already told story that isn't needed.\n\nNow for the Cons:\n\nBuggy menus, I cannot tell you how many people I've talked to where its impossible to buy certian items cause, when I press down on my keyboard, it would instantly snap back up. I am forever Chicken Chaser with a normal haircut and normal beard cause of this. Hopefully this will be fixed one day but as for now, not happy. One other thing I nearly forgot, you have to have at least one item in one of the equipment tab if you accedently buy too much and you want to sell a few back. Sell all your sellable items in one of the tabs and you won't be able to get back into it without exiting the traider's menu and retalking to them, which if it was any proof in the origional Fable or The Lost Chapters, they usually decided to talk your ears off before you could talk to them agian, leaving you to simply wave till they shut up.\n\nThe animations are daited and it shows. Sure, The mouths move more naturally but holy ♥♥♥♥ you have one of those demon children stare at you or one of those really stiff guards talk to you its almost like your in a world filled with robots.\n\nBuggy Combat, I found this out fighting wisper and the wasp queen. I would hit wisper several times then suddenly she decided she didn't want to be hurt anymore, actually blocking some strong attacks till I eased up on her and decided to put away then requip my sword, giving her a free hit on me in the process. The wasp queen was a diffrent story, after hitting her several times with my Crossbow, suddenly she was invinceible to it and I couldn't use it anymore, even after unequipping and requpping the crossbow, thank god they start you out with lighting as a spell, though I nearly died to her cause of this. Agian, may be fixed, but I never once got hit in the origional fable unless I made the mistake of trying to block a power shot, or my mana shield went down. Not. Happy.\n\nNow I understand that's four pros and Three cons, but keep in mind that two of those Pros are personal and those cons are pretty damn big. Let me put it how I explained to my friends about the Fable franchise.\n\nFable, the origional fable, was a nice girl, and when she told me about The Lost Chapters, she was very "adult" when she talked about it, we still call eachother sometimes, but we've moved on.\n\nFable two was the kind of party girl, the perfect girlfriend who had everything almost completely perfect, even with how she ended. we still hang out on weekends and she still knows I LOVE the blunderbuss/Greataxe combo and her jokes never fall flat for me.\n\nFable three is the girl that forced me to play by her rules with her guns and weapons, a cruel woman who would usually tell me I have to be evil to get the most out of my weapons. I told her no, we don't talk anymore.\n\nI have never met Fable Journey, so I will not say anything about her till I have.\n\nFable Anniversary is a tart that trys to act like Fable, saying that she's better looking. Sure, she's better looking, but she acts way too much like Fable that, honestly, it makes me sad that I decided to actually buy her things thinking that she would also act better when its quite clear she doesn't. I'm not planning on talking to Anniversary and I'm going to talk with Fable.\n\nTL;DR I am an idiot and I do not like this game, buy the origional fable, fall in love with Fable two, but don't buy three or Anniversary. If you really wanna try it, get it as a gift, you'll feel less like you waisted your money if you do.","September 13, 2014","false","2.0"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MattiusMason/recommended/288470/","MattiusMason","Mattius!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MattiusMason/","232 products in account","I'm not going to write a conventional review on this game but I will leave my thoughts after playing it for about an hour.\n\nWARNING: This will be a rant in most places, but I will do my best.\n\nWhat I liked:\n\n- The Nostalgia: This is the reason I bought the game, and in most places, it delivered, at least aesthetically.\n\n- The Graphics: This is a bit of a double-edged sword... They look impressive enough (certainly an upgrade) but there are issues.\n\nWhat I disliked:\n\n- The Voice Acting: This is only a small point I suppose, but something miffed me about it... Much of this has remained from the original game, which is fine, absolutely fine, but the very first opening cutscene seems to have been re-recorded or remastered or they've done something to it, and it sounds terrible. The actor does not sound enthusiastic about this heroic tale that is about to unfold, and not only that, the sound quality is awful. Not sure if it's a problem on my end but it wasn't terrific, and for an opening cutscene I would expect something to excite me about indulging in my nostalgia and playing one of my favourite childhood games again, but in HD - the concept grabbed me and I threw my wallet at them, I really wish I hadn't now and spent it on something else, and I will explain why in the next point.\n\n- The Menu, Inventory, etc......... : I have no idea who designed this menu, but I do not think they were human. It is just so fiddly, so much so that it irritates me too much to even want to play the game. You can assign things, sure, but doing that takes some real jiggery-pokery, a little too much if you ask me. It's like trying to crack the da vinci code, when all I want is to eat an apple pie from my potions and produce tab. It has NO MOUSE OPTIMISATION. This is the big one everyone is talking about and I feel it needs to be heard. The original game had perfectly fine mouse optimisation. To call the game a HD remake and not have mouse optimisation is absolutely mind blowing to me. I know HD more so focuses on the graphics, but if its a testament to the original, I would expect everything to be in place that was originally, such as being able to use your mouse to select things in a menu... When I loaded the game up I was all excited to get stuck in, but my heart sank when I tried to use my mouse and realised I could not. That was the point where I realised that this would be a bad port, and it was from the very start.\n\n- The Options Menu: You are able to keybind some things... When you actually get into the game, mind you. But not the attack function, block function or anything important... The controls are fine for me, as I said previously. I can get on with them fine, it's a perfect setup for me. But for other people that's probably not the case, it's definitely something that should be there, why? Because Fable: The Lost Chapters had it. You could keybind anything.\n\nIt's a terrible port at the moment. I really hope that a patch is released to make things easier for people who want to enjoy it on their PCs with a keyboard and mouse. I enjoyed Fable: The Lost Chapters perfectly fine on my PC, in fact I have done at least 4 seperate playthroughs of the game because I enjoyed it that much. This was one of my main childhood games. I feel as if its ruined, all because of this console focus they have gone with. "Play it with a controller" some people are saying - no. Why should I? If you're going to release a PC port of a game, do it right. I play on a PC. If I wanted to play it on a console I'd buy the console version of the game. I don't.\n\nThe Graphics: As mentioned before, there are issues. Nothing major, the graphics do look okay to me. They didn't exactly blow me away, but they are certainly an upgrade, which I appreciate. I am not technically minded about this kind of thing, so forgive me for my simplistic manner of explaining it. There appears to be blur on some of the models. Yup. It's like blurry textures, and eventually they fade back to being detailed again. Its weird. It's only a small thing, it doesn't bother me that much, but the fact that they can't even get the graphics 100% right and they're calling this HD makes me laugh. Oh yeah, and the graphics options do not give you much freedom to do anything either.\n\nAt this point I am terribly disappointed and would not recommend to any like-minded PC gamers like myself. If you can enjoy the game with a console controller, fine. You will probably have a blast, but that menu is enough for me to put this game down until it gets fixed, if it gets fixed.","September 14, 2014","false","16.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

You have to use the arrow keys to navigate the main/ options menus and the "A/B" keys to select things. This shows almost 0 effort to accommodate for PC users at all and tells me that they were too lazy to change the controller schemes over. This IS PC we have mice, let us use them or at least bind "okay" to enter! It does, however have rebindable keys (only one set though) but this will not recognise any extra keys you may have on you mouse or keyboard unlike the old port (also in steam) were you were free to use any extra buttons.on top of this for some unknown reason I was unable to bind to "TAB" ( I only tried the auto targeting[default "Space"] so it may work elsewhere however it seems "TAB" is defaulted to chat which I find disorientating ) it did seem to register the button but just flashed red instead of using it.\nAs for the new graphics, they are fairly good but seem washed out and not as bright as they should. (after some fiddling I found that you can correct this by reducing the gamma) That being said, I do have issue with the character models, they look like there from TF2 (very cartoony) and it ruined the feel of the game for me. To me the game was like Skyrim is now. It was not dark per-say, more rustic and I feel that this is lost in the remake, however this is a personal gripe and not a big issue.\nAs for performance,\nI run a moderate rig (SSD hard drive and a GTX 660 on a 27 inch 1080p acer monitor) and cranked right up to max I get minor lag (25-34 FPS according to audacity) so I feel the optimisation of the game is good if not great.\n\nAll in all I think that it is amazing to think that the OLD port is better than the new one in many ways, the graphics do stand up today too if a bit low res, in my opinion. Its sad to see games like this are still coming out from MAJOR companies In this day and age and they will keep happening if we just ignore poorly designed game ports like this.","September 14, 2014","false","1.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

I *forgot* I already reviewed this game.\nI was actually so annoyed at the time, i feel like I didn't quite explain enough.\nSO. Allow me to clarify. First things I must adress: This was promised to be a complete recoding of the original game, from the ground up. Bull.\nI played a couple hours into the storyline, and here's what I experienced; Exactly the same thing as the one I had for the Original XBox, with LESS playability. In fact, every glitch from the original game is still in this! ALL of the awful Voice Acting and Poorly timed SFX I remember from a game system with the memory capacity of a large potato. Good going, Capaldi! I mean it. Getting hit in this game is like someone grunting gently AFTER an ♥♥♥♥♥♥. It sounds and looks just as ridiculous as it used to. It was so incredibly poorly ported, I would wish I just bought the XBox just to buy the XBox version... If this game wasn't so horrible in general. The first update of the game? Compatibility. They didn't even bother to give us bloody mouse support! They actually never will. The keys weren't even configurable until around the third update, I think!\nAnd what I'm about to say is true. No, it isn't the result of a bad or old computer. No, I don't have an oudated graphics card, full cache or some other nonsense. It's just awful. I can hardly walk around, after trying literally every fix I could find, I still walk around like a crippled puppy who also happens to be an epeleptic. That's not an off analogy either, it's really annoying to watch. It's ONLY character based. Enemies and NPCs are not affected unless I am moving. And apparently, there are many people experiencing similar issues... Alright, so. Assuming somehow the god-forsaken stuttering was fixed, and a mouse was useable.. I still would want to rip this stupid game OUT of my computer with my bare hands, defying the laws of reality, and visibly destroy it beyond repair. But somehow... Someone already did it.\nHere's what I mean. Nothing was changed. NOTHING. I can't emphasise this enough. The textures are STILL pretty ♥♥♥♥-poor. It's ugly. Literally one of the only new things this game has to offer is STILL god-awful!  The teeth look like someone grabbed a chunk of burning, texture glitched wood from Skyrim and shoved it in their gums. The new DLC? ALL RE-USED TEXTURES. The second out of the three new features in the game use textures already found in the stupid game, save for maybe one or two sets. And those look like slightly modified base textures with Balverine fur strapped on them. I'm almost positive that they just took the original Fable, spit on it after eating rancid tuna, rubbed it with their sleeve and considered it polished. After this, they proceeded to gently hammer the disk until miraculously, it worked on PC.\nNow for my final statement.. This is the first game that has EVER made me feel genuinely ripped-off. It's almost like they're punishing me for liking the original game. Why, in a remake, would you take OUT features that made the followup arguably BETTER than the sequel? And as much as I'd like to get a refund for this piece of trash, Steam's return policy has kind of.. well. It's not ♥♥♥♥ing possible! So, I'm stuck with this filth in my library. Forever. Imagine that. Sorry about all the caps for emphasis, but this used to be my favorite game. I loved Jack of Blades, all of the humor and hard choices. But really, now it's just redundant and annoying. There was no effort put into this, I'm almost sure.\nAnd again, sorry for seeming so butthurt. But I am genuinely upset.","September 18, 2014","false","19.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","1"

The heyboard and mouse controls were so smooth and combat system reworked for said inputs that I would argue that the PC version of F:TLR was not only better performance wise but its gameplay was superior to the Xbox original.

I would 100% recomend the original over this game, unless you have a pc godly enough to run this poorly optimized peice of crap, and you can stomach the art style.","June 22, 2015","false","0.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I never played the original Fable games myself, but I remember seeing friends play them and they looked like they'd be a lot of fun, so when this went on sale a few weeks ago, I thought, "Hey, I should check this out!"\n\nIn some ways, I'm glad I did. I got 25 solid hours out of it, for $8.74—which is not great, but is also not bad. But then I hit a wall. I'm the kind of person who has to get all the achievements in every game I play. I played WoW for, like, three or four months (most of it during Mists of Pandaria) and got about 85% of the achievements that the entire game had to offer, to give you an idea of how I play games. And for most of the game, Fable was working just fine.\n\nBut once I beat the game on the standard difficulty, I ran into some problems. There were a couple missing achievements (like beating Whisper without getting hurt) that I hadn't even noticed in time to get them on my original playthrough, so I figured I could just go through on Heroic and take care of those. I got that one, but found around the same time that hitting three enemies with a single flourish is essentially impossible to do on purpose, and I hadn't had it happen on accident throughout my entire Normal run. Likewise, there was the achievement for getting all the hero dolls that seems like it's going to be nearly impossible to do, without just sinking hours and hours into it in hopes of getting lucky. That's not how achievements should work, I'd say.\n\nAnd then there's Heroic difficulty. It started out just fine. I got through the training, ventured out to Bowerstone, did the first few quests, and then tried to make my way through Greatwood Lake. First I ran into an Earth Troll. "Uh oh," I thought. "This could be pretty difficult to beat on Heroic." But with some careful dodging, I took it down—only to run into three bandits who had such an incredibly high amount of health that I couldn't even take *one* down with ALL of my MP into lightning AND all the crossbow firing I could get out before they caught up to me and killed me.\n\nNow, I don't think I'm bad at this game. I made it through Normal without EVER dying. But I tried this same spot of Heroic three or four times and had the same result each time, despite gaining some experience from each of the failed attempts before dying, and then using it to boost some of my stats. I would have had to spend an inordinate amount of time grinding experience to just get past three random bandits in Greatwood Lake, much less that first Balverine you come across in the swamp area. This seems like poor scaling to me, and essentially made me quit the game.\n\nIt wasn't the only thing that pushed me in that direction, though. I thought the Good/Evil system was pretty good for a while. I went through all of Normal trying to make the most Good decisions possible, because I'm a good little boy. Then I found out that Good players just don't get as many options or as much good stuff as Evil players. It's quite limited, and I object to that design as well.\n\nAll in all, this game does have quite a few things going for it, and it has an overall enjoyable game style. That's why I'd give it about a 7.5/10. But no higher.","July 6, 2015","false","27.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

And now, that Lionhead allows us to mod the game with the Modding DLC, it's great! My review point to point:\n\n- Graphics. It's an HD remake of the original Fable, the graphics are really good, love that "Depth of Field" we have, the lighting, great too. You just have to see the images of the game :P Textures are great, maybe with mods they can even get better, same with the models. Some models have changed, and they got better! The animations, same animations as the original Fable, so... nostalgia :') Great effects too.\n\n- Gameplay. It's like the original Fable. I don't really like the movement of the camera, but it's still good.\n\n- Sound. Like I said with the animations, nostalgia when hearing the Fable music. The game has also the previous voice actors than in original Fable, and there is some characters that have a great voice acting! Also, the sound with the effects, really good.\n\n- DLCs, okay, some of them cost money and only add armours and weapons (which look great!), but for me, the good point is the Modding DLC. I remember modding the original Fable, and get desesperated because the tools (made from the Fable modding community) crashed, or the game crashed and you had to reinstall the game or restore it with a backup... Now that we have these tools, we can mod the game. Still waiting for a Steam Workshop for Fable though :)\n\nI think I haven't forget anything :S.\nIn conclusion, Fable Anniversary is a really good game, that have great graphics for the game it is and respects the original Fable things.

I should also mention that TLC, though its menu system was also a little clunky, you could use a mouse to navigate. Also key bindings are a good thing to be able to change depending on your play style but unlike TLC where you can change any of the keys, you can only change a few of them in anniversary.\n\nLaziest visual upgrades in a remake ever:\nWhen you buy a '9 years later' remake of a game, you’d expect visuals that would make your jaw drop when you compare them with each other. Fable Anniversary does not do this, though the textures themselves are of higher resolutions then that of the original, the new textures look out of place and quite weird on the models. They did nothing to the animations and barely anything to the models so most of the characters in the game, they may as well be mutants with how they look. The texture quality is terrible, on max most of the textures are still the quality of the Xbox 360, which is unacceptable for a modern pc game and is not worth the $35. This point is a bit of personal opinion but the non-changeable FXAA makes the game as a whole look way too blurry as well. TLC had amazing graphics for its time and nothing in it has aged enough to be unrecognisable. TLC also supports 16:10 ratios and can be used at 4k.\n\nFable Anniversary’s little bit of eye candy doesn’t make up for its many downfalls, TLC cost less than 1/3 of its price and is still a much better game then this garbage.

The first one did not give me a choice to be a female. Here I am in playing this amazing game, in this amazing world, kicking butt as the male I have always dreamed to be. Uh no! lol. Sorry, but I want to kick butt as a female thank you.  I wanted to look good in that shiny armor as female.\n\nThen the 2nd one came out. I have the choice to be a female.  But, now the armor sucks cause the the story goes into the future a bit! Still I played because I enjoyed kicking butt and I really enjoyed the rest of the game.  I did like the steam punk twist to things. I really enjoy that.\n\nI still would recommend this game. Because for gaming sake, it is still a fun game to play.","March 15, 2015","true","1.3"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","0"

Not only were the graphics nearly identical in all the environments I have so far experienced, but the small changes they made to important characters were awful.  Maze's hair/tattoos/face is broken, and all spell graphics are either the same or for some reason downgraded in quality.  My hero is uglier than sin, regardless of what type of tattoos, facial hair, or scars I try to apply to him.\n\nThe audio is, as far as I can tell, the same.  I have noticed that the natural pauses in conversation that I remember being present in the first game were either shortened or deleted in this game.\n\nThe worst part is probably the menu and lack of hero save.  The menu is terrible, clearly ported directly from console, as it does not support the mouse and you must use the 'insert, home, delete, and end' buttons to navigate.  In addition, you cannot re-bind any skills on your mouse  (since as far as the menu is concerned, it does not exist.\n\nLast but not least, there is no hero save.  That means if you're like me and work hard to get very powerful early in the storyline, you'll be age 65 when you meet your *maybe 20's* older sister.

Smiff","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198068277665/","9 products in account","FABLE ANNIVERSARY: DO YOU WANT IT!?\nHave you been looking at the new Fable Anniversary relaease, wondering if you should pull the trigger and add that pup to your library? I asked myself the same question almost two months ago when I decided to shoot for the stars with Fable Anniversary. Here I have for you a few words of caution and/or encouragement. My first exposure to the Fable franchise was a few months after the release of the original on the XBOX, I was blown away and drawn back, simultaneously, to the alluring pull of this new, ambitious and anglo-centric adventure. This was like re-living the debut of Ocarina of Time! Fable, however, was of an entirely different realm. Putting much of the focus into the adverse gameplay style and the design of this beautiful reimagining of the British Isles, Fable left a little to be desired of the story. This was remedied with the addition of The Lost Chapters which made the game almost perfect, aside from a few problems that still exist in the new Anniversary version.\n\nForemost, the game is supposed to be about making choices and becoming your own hero; the game is constantly trying to force you into being the well rounded and skilled player that the game needs you to be which makes certain boss fights or other missions difficult or undoable if your hero build isn't right. For example: Fighting Jack of Blades the first time the game wants you to use a bow. I dont want to use bows with my spellwarrior. I WANNA USE MY MELEE AND SPELLS!!! (fighting the Kracken will also take two hours if you try and use a sword and a lightning spell). This is a major problem with the Anniversary version because it still exists in every facet of playing this game making all of your decisions practically pointless and almost all the time reversable (i.e. you can go from good to evil with relative ease). It was ignorable the first time because all of this was so fresh and never really done like this before. After a decade of making games based on free will and adventure, you should be able to recognise the little problems that make your whole morality matrix and character role development feel a little redundant and pre determined. (i.e in Fable you always end up with A or B, never is a C or D involved) Fable was and is a game which does not require much time to complete the core of it but potentially doubles it's playability when you add in the side missions and all the other quirks of Albion. This was done extremely well especially with the addition of The Lost Chapters. I hoped and expected that with the new release we might get another 9 hours out of this game, but here we find much more to be desired.\n\nMoving on to the NEW issues with Fable Anniversarry, we take a look at what Anniversary does to leave the gamer longing for more, which isn't always a good thing in necessity. No new missions. If you remembered how to play the last game through, you know this one. Some might see this as a good thing, I figure my expectations were too high. But when I learned not even a single new side mission or interactable character was added to the Anniversary version, I was quite dissappointed. So what did they do? Is anything in this new-old game different or improved? Not really, its still the same semi-goofy adventure. Its the same.\n\nThe game is the same.\n\nIt is the same.\n\nIT'S THE SAME!!!\n\nHowever you do get a new and slightly longer Heroic mode: There are no ressurection phials and some healing abilities are somewhat gimped. Slightly prolonged eh? HOW IS POSSIBRU IF NO CONTENTS R NU!?!? Well if you never died before whilst playing Fable (this is not uncommon) you probably will die and if you haven't played a Fable game in a couple years like me and decide to jump right in, you may die a lot. All of this dying and reloading is what gives you those extra hours, especially if you're trying to be a good guy (the hardest kinda guy to be). The game is not necessarily more difficult, it just takes longer and sort of forces you to try and gain more experience to level up as you bump along those good ol' core quests. The difficulty in the boss fights comes from getting too bored to actually follow the attack sequences in order to hit the boss amid the 15 minutes of minion fighting/dodging before the 5 seconds you actually get to hit the boss with (assuming you have the right spell, weapon, blood type, zodiac sign, character alignment, age etc.) Here is the attack sequence for every major boss in the game *SPOILER ALERT*:\n\nDODGE, KILL MINIONS, DODGE, KILL MINIONS, DODGE, HIT THE BOSS (with the one and only attack), FIGHT MINIONS, FIGHT MINIONS, FIGHT MINIONS, FIGHT MINIONS, RELOAD, DODGE, FIGHT MINIONS, FIGHT MINIONS, FIGHT MINIONS, FIGHT MINIONS, RELOAD, BEGIN ARHYTHMICALLY POUNDING KEYS/BUTTONS *with specifically designated spells/weapons for that boss* PROFIT!?\n\nIt isn't even subtle the way the game trys to force you into being what it needs you to be rather than what you want to play with. If you have the same sense of conquest and need of self reassurance that I had when I started off, I would reccomend doing the heroic mode first to get it out of the way in order to enjoy the far and few between favorable little pieces that have been reworked in Anniversary.\n\nThe controls cannot be criticized too heavily as Lionhead was sort of venturing into new territory with operating systems being different these days on the PC, as well as two different controller formats, a total of three control types to be programmed and supported. I'm no expert but that probably sounds easier in type than it is in reality. I use a 360 controller, which can be tricky but you will get used to it and once you do it's almost like the good old days. So, have I gotten older, more mature or more jaded in the decade between the original and the anniversary. Yes I'd guess so.\n\nSO TO ANYONE NEW TO THE FABLE FRANCHISE, MEANING YOU'VE NEVER PLAYED FABLE BEFORE; THIS GAME IS FOR YOU! BUY IT TO SUPPORT LIONHEAD AND FUTURE VENTURES![/b]\n\nWords of warning; if you're a fan like me, you will most likely find more to complain about. But I'm no Negative Nancy. The second you step into Albion it is beautiful. The updated graphics are what I wanted, not too pristine but volumes more detail than the original. The integrity of the art is indeed intact. The new outfits, weapons and armor are also a great leg up in the game because you finally get more sets that can be more specific, even more condusive to building the kind of character you want to play...Assuming it still fits the Lionhead template. There is no damage done to the story, interactions with characters or any of the little running jokes and insider quirks we all adore hidden about the game. Would I have been willing to relenquish some of the humor or parts of the story in order to make way for new grounds in exploration of the map or exploration of different characters and I dunno, maybe a new mission or two? Definitely. Perhaps the most important and beneficial aspect that Lionhead added to the release of Anniversary was the ability for the community to create their own mods to the Fable program. I am very excited to see what the more skilled enthusiasts will creeate. Keep in mind this is all being written around/about the game that I wanted. Something slightly newer, something a little more in depth, something with a twist and above all something with a little more to explore. Some might say that what I wanted was a new game. In some ways, some people are right. But if you want something a little redundant, a little repetative, a little fickle, a little quirky and/or a little nostalgic, maybe even a little new; Look no further than Fable Anniversary...or this review\n\n\nRemember friends, keep your expectations and your promises low, but over-deliver with every opportunity.","September 18, 2014","false","56.3"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","47","7","15","2","0"

I have had no problems running this game, no crashes, no stutters, no blur problems that others have had and I don't really have the best setup.\n\nNow there are two issues that I have with this game, but they do not make the game unplayable.\n\nThe first issue is that there is only partial Mouse Support. You cannot use the mouse at all in the menus and the developers chose some convoluted keys to navigate the menus that are difficult to use, especially on a laptop. The keys that you use to navigate are "A", "B", "INSERT", "DELETE", "HOME", and "END". I have to press and hold the "FN" key just to use three of them. There is also no way to rebind these keys. Hopefully there will be a patch or a mod in the future to add mouse support to the menu.\n\nThe second issue is the targeting or locking on system. It doesn't always work and sometimes the system chooses the furthest enemy or, even worse, a friendly target. Again, this does not make the game unplayable, but it is annoying.\n\n8/10 overall a great game\n\nOS: Windows 8.1, 64 bit\nCPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-3610QM CPU @ 2.30GHz\nGPU: NVIDIA GeForce GT 640M LE","September 13, 2014","true","23.0"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

NOTE: A patch has been released relaxing the restrictions on keybinds. Regardless, I am leaving this review as it is to depict the intial release and because I still fully support the summary.\n\nLet me try to paint a picture of my experience with this game.\n\nI started out using a mouse and keyboard, huge mistake. For those who did not know, this very same game was released 10 years ago on PC, mouse and keyboard was the only option to play it. The original offered full customization of the control setup and allowed the use of a cursor to go through several of the menus.\n\nFor that reason, it was to my surprise to find out that, not only was the mouse not usable in any of the menus in this game, but it had been replaced with the arrow keys and the A and B buttons. This in itself was pretty jarring, although, if this had only been an issue with the pre-game menu, it would not have been as severe an issue. Instead, EVERY SINGLE MENU uses this control scheme. Fable is an RPG, it requires a lot of menu crawling, to have to use these asinine controls, every single time I need to select something, it wears pretty thin.\n\nNow, whatever, at least the mouse works ingame, right? Only partially. I glided through the Oakvale segment with little to no issue, but quickly found myself bumping into another wall. What would that be? The block tutorial. Blocking, like all commands that utilize the mouse, are unable to be binded to a different key (even though this was possible 10 years ago). Because of this, if you do not have the capability to use the middle mouse button, you're screwed.\n\nAfter accepting that this "updated" game was in no way built to use a mouse and keyboard. I switched to a controller. Unfortunately, while struggling to block with my mouse, I had taken a few hits. To avoid the scarring mechanics, which I heard had been arising quite early for other gamers, I reloaded a prior save. Unfortunately, a quest I had completed prior, and had no choice to repeat had bugged (this was a problem in both games although had been made worse by the fact that the new version requires you to repeat it unless you progress to a much further point) and because of this, I was required to completely restart the game.\n\nIt was at this point that I asked myself "why am I playing this?" I already owned the older version, it worked, and the graphics, while less impressive, weren't enough to warrant me slogging through this broken version.\n\n\n\nTo Summarize:\nThe visuals, while a decent upgrade, aren't enough to warrant wasting money on this. What you get in return is a diminished UI, a terrible menu system, and a mouse and keyboard system so broken, you'd be in disbelief to hear that Lionhead had ever made games for the PC in the past.\n\nI am a huge fan of the Fable series, I've been a fan since the first one came out in 2004, I can in no way, advocate buying this. Buy the original and you'll be getting the exact same game with a perfectly made menu system and control scheme. No content is added by purchasing this version and the updated graphics are in no way worth the headache this game can give you.","September 12, 2014","false","165.6"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

The gameplay is just the same clunky like in Fable:TLC, nothing has been touched there, except for the controller option. And probably the worst, NO NEW QUEST? NOTHING AT ALL?! I was hoping for a sandbox mode with new quest and maybe activities once I completed the game. but there's nothing!  Just your daily Fable life with your imaginary wife and sometimes helping out a wandering trader. The guildmaster also became silent and no one has something to say that I saved their life from Dragon Jack.\n\nImproved graphics doesn't make an Anniversary game Lionhead Studios/Microsoft, especially if they aren't that good.

Why not have mouse function in menus for an RPG game that's all about customisation?\nI hope a quality patch fixes these issues, the game seems like a rushed port and many will be feeling the burn from forking out good money for a barely functioning game.\n\nIn the end, I'm sure if Lionhead came out and said 'we need on more month to make it perfect' I'm sure everyone would understand. To release it as it currently is, well that's just unprofessional and a stab in the heart of the diehard fans who were hanging out for this game.\n\nWIll cross my fingers for a patch, as I know there's no chance of a refund.\n\nWhat a shame...","September 13, 2014","false","3.4"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","2"

It play's well and is far better than trying to play the old blocky version.

It's nearly impossible to see sequels or anything further, best the first and original game.

Runs a lot smoother than TLC and deifnitely the original. They had fixed some glitches from the previous versions and they have also developed new ones that are currently being addressed.

It doesn't deviate in anyway.\n\nPros:\n- Same gameplay controls as original (From what I've seen in youtube for TLC)\n- Their UI is different to the original (In my opinion, that's pleasin' to my eyes compared to the original)\n- Their graphics differ greatly, as they use Unreal Engine. Anniversary has more colours, shadows and details\n- It is moddable\n- It does have ALL TLC's DLCS included in it.\n- They did add new equipment to this game such as  Snowspire Guard Outfit and the Jackarse\n- It has the new difficulty that makes this game a bit challenging\nCon:\n- For anyone that have played TLC, they won't see any differences in it.\n- No mouse support in the menu and inventory.\n\nTL;DR - Worth getting it if you want to relive nostalgia in a new skin, or you never had a chance to play the original Fable in my opinion.

I'm playing on an HP Pavillion Laptop with an AMD A10 2.10 GHz processor and 8 GB of RAM - which should be able to handle the game. Instead I'm spending my first few hours playing around with settings to try to get my character to not pause for a frame between every step he takes. The cut scenes look terrible too - the sun rising took a quick break halfway up due to this choppiness - and the character interactions look worse than on the original XBOX version. I'm going to keep looking online for ways to improve the performance but 1 hour into the game it's pretty clear that Lionhead didn't put much effort into this. Thanks for the huge dissapointment :(\n\nUpdate - I ended up playing through the main story and mostly ingnoring the bugginess. The choppiness gets better after the Hero Guild Graduation - but not completely. I used the Slow Time spell to make the lagginess seem less out of place, and tended to skip all the cutscenes. I did put in a lot of hours, and did enjoy myself, but if I had a choice to go back and buy this again I wouldn't. I'd take a train out to my mother's house in the subburbs and plug in my old XBOX and play the original instead.","January 31, 2015","false","48.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

One of my all time favorite games. While the game stays true to the original, I felt as though it could have been expanded upon. For instance, a gender option or perhaps new spells and demon doors. Also since it's a remake there should be an option to switch back and forth to see what the game looked like ten or eleven years ago. From what I can tell a controller is pretty much the way to go with this game much like the original. Everyone seems to be complaining about the graphics but to me they look fine. All in all it's a very faithful remake with some minor flaws and missed oppertunities. I'd give it a 7/10.

One of my all time favorite games. While the game stays true to the original, I felt as though it could have been expanded upon. For instance, a gender option or perhaps new spells and demon doors. Also since it's a remake there should be an option to switch back and forth to see what the game looked like ten or eleven years ago. From what I can tell a controller is pretty much the way to go with this game much like the original. Everyone seems to be complaining about the graphics but to me they look fine. All in all it's a very faithful remake with some minor flaws and missed oppertunities. I'd give it a 7/10. If you're a new fan playing this then things may be a little confusing for you but as things get going, you get the hang of it.

So, with much reluctance I present to you the dot-point summary of my masterfully fleshed out glorious review of Fable: Anniversary; an HD Modern Re-Release of Fable: The Lost Chapters;\n\nThe Good\n- Expansive world which reacts to your decisions rather nicely\n- Visuals can be quite pretty in places (animations and models a bit uglier in other spots though)\n- Quick travel, mechanics and controls are quite good (set to classic. Seriously.)\n- Quests are varied, fun, and challenging when you 'boast'.\n- Humour is highly appreciated and nicely balances against the grittier elements of this game.\n- Play it in a bunch of ways, you'll probably be a mix of good and evil but tofu your way to goodness if you're like me.\n\nThe Less Than Good\n- Bugs. Here and there. Can be rather annoying\n- Audio is too compressed for my liking\n- No female character available, your control over how they look is both expansive but also limited (e.g. hair colour)\n- Aging can be ridiculously fast. Its cool, but like, chill.\n- Some aspects of the game which would be fun (stealing) are hugely difficult.\n\nFable: Anniversary is a game which has a wonderful soundtrack, excellent balance of darker elements with some tongue-in-cheek humour intersperced throughout, wonderful character-world interaction and an excellent quest and navigational system. It's held back by some distressing bugs and poor audio quality at times, but otherwise is a great romp into a classic RPG.\n\n8/10\n","June 22, 2015","true","30.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

The atomosphere is sublime, the combat is fast and diverse, and the music is incredible. Some people will argue against paying the $35 for the updated version, but I disagree. The graphics are much better than TLC, and it's overall just a better experience with support for higher resolutions and widescreen. The only pitfall with this version is the new menu system, which is obviously designed for play with a controller.  Overall, it's a great RPG with tons of replayability and a fantastic atmosphere unmatched by many games since.\n\n[EDIT: There's been a patch that disables weather effects in one of the areas near the middle of the game.

I will say that $35 is a bit steep for a graphical overhaul, as most of the mechanics (as far as I can tell) haven't been altered. For first timers it might be worth it, but if it goes on sale for 25% or more I would definitely recommend picking it up.\n\nFor those that have played/own the original version, the $35 price tag is way overpriced. I would recommend waiting for at least a 50% off sale before picking this up.\n\nBottom line... I picked this game up after get one of the mass distributed coupons for 60% off and I jumped on the offer, and I say it was well worth it. The graphics are beautiful to look at. Nothing revolutionary or next gen, but a great enough improvement over the original that makes playing through it again a whole new experience.\n\nAs for the few things I dont like...\n- If playing with a controller... Even though I have been using 360 controllers since '06 I still find myself attempting to hit those Black/White buttons to use my bow and sword, but those are now assigned to the LB and RB. There is an option for a more Fable II and III control scheme, where X is melee, and Y is the bow. I like that control setup more, overall, but it messes with my instinct to push Y to block like the original controls do.\n\n-The faces are the one thing that seem to have suffered in the overhaul. The Hero's, Maze, and the Guildmasters faces all look wrong, compared to what I expected from the original game. But it is easily able to be overlooked and ignored.\n\nThe things I have mixed feelings on...\n- The new menu interface... It is very different from the original. If this is your first time playing the game, dont worry. The menu setup is still logical, just different. lol It definitely looks nicer, I am just still adjusting to using the LB/RB and LT/RT to navigate rather than just having a list you scroll through with the thumbstick.\n\n- The difficulty... I recall that during my first one or two playthroughs of the game on Xbox, I used many Ressurection Phials. And then I got to the point where I could sell all but one or two, as I very rarely needed them. The Anniversary edition has two difficulties (the original just had one IIRC), the classic difficulty, and a harder one. I seriously debated playing the harder one right off the bat, as I remember that I had stopped playing the original in part because it felt too easy. But now... maybe the default is harder, or more likely I just lost my "edge" in the game from not playing it for a long time. I have only played about 4 hours I think at the time of writing this, and I have already used 4 or 5 Phials. lol\n\nThe things I like...\n- The graphics, obviously. I like seeing the detail on my gear now, and the world seems more vibrant. I have enjoyed just running around and looking at things.\n\n- Even though it seems I would have been committing suicide, I am glad that there is a harder difficulty for when I am ready to attempt that.\n\n- It is the same game I fell in love with so many years ago. Yes, including bugs lol. They had debated redoing the entire game, but I am glad they didnt. It would have been nice to see the bugs fixed, but there arent even enough to be concerned about really. This game gives me a rather large sense of visually updated nostalgia. Aside from the Halo games on Xbox, this game was my next favorite.","January 30, 2015","true","23.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I have fond memories of playing Fable on the Xbox 360 back in 2006, it was a great game and I was looking forward to a second playthrough...especially with all the "improvements" in the game. I mainly play games using keyboard/mouse now, being a PC Gamer, but I only bought Fable Anniversary because this PC port was supposed to be compatible with xbox type gamepads. I found out that it was NOT. I also tried downloading a few mappers and none of the profiles work.\n\nSo if you want to play with a controller, sorry.

It should be easier if I can use different set of spells while fighting since the block button is moved to RB.

While the visuals and story still hold their own almost 10 years later, the combat controls can be a tad clunky if you are using a mouse/keyboard.  I would recommend anyone that is a fan of the series give this game a try and hopefully we will see the rest of the series on Steam down the road.","March 23, 2015","true","29.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Its still junky dollar-store candy, but now its the BEST junky dollar-store candy.

Although it didn't live up to every claim that Lionhead Studios made, it did manage to deliver a great action RPG, with a lot of character and humour.

I found it on here for sale the other day, and I am glad I gave this one a second shot. I got to relive all the epic moments and see all the sights Albion has to offer, but this time with a fresh coat of paint and a few slight changes to bring this game up to par.

Since then however many years ago, Ive owned 6 copies of this game whether it be the original, lost chapters, or anniversary. It was on sale on the summer sale and for the low price tag, I had to try the PC port.\n\nIm a huge fan of the game, and the series, however this PC port is less than what is desired. Lets start off with the basic skeleton of the game, the graphics.\n\nGraphics\n\nThis Anniversary edition is pretty much Lost Chapters remastered, with a very linear reskin for graphics. The graphics have improved by a little bit yes, but some animations are still quite static and robotic. For a game they are asking $40 full price I guess there isnt too much space to complain about, but when you look at other aanniversary games (Halo 2 Anniversary as an example) that offer full redone and appropriate next gen reskin, its hard to pass this as acceptable. For owners of Lost chapters, its not worth spending that kind of money for minor graphical enhancements. The thing with graphics that drive me nuts with this game is the color palette and shadowing. Original fans like myself will notice this when you first start off, as the green and red outlines around foes/allies are a murky and dull shade, where these colors should be vibrant and identifiable such as the original.\nId give the graphics 3/5.\n\nSound\n\nFor me this games sound component has always been stellar. The composed music in this game is well written and very recognizable. The music composure fits the game well, and changes appropriately without being abrupt as situations in the game change. Whether its browsing throughout the guild, to entering the woods and entering into a combat scenario. As far as sound effects go there is quite abit of repitition, but its to be expected in an older title, and its only going to bug you if you focus on it. Voice acting is another strong point of this game as some of the main characters (minus your hero obviously!) have very interesting voices, and some of the scripting the speak is quite funny and entertaining.\nOverall, with the music being a strong point for me and the mix of it all into one works well, id give the sound 4.25/5, especially considering the age of the game (unsure if sound was remastered for the anniversary edition, will have to look)\n\nStory\n\nAnother great part of this game. Original fans will feel quite at home and know what they are getting into. New fans will have a great story mode to get into and see how it all intertwines. From the original Oakvale raid, to the battle with Jack of blades, its quite a nice vengeance based story mode that will keep you interested. The transition from the original game to the added extention of Lost Chapters has always been odd for me. You can definitly tell where the original game ended, and where they slapped on the added part of TLC. However, the variety in missions and rewards make this well worth looking into. 4/5\n\nControls\n\nHere is the major flaw with this PC port. The controls are awful. Controlling the camera with the mouse while trying to balance out everything else out on the keyboard is less than desired. In High tempo, higher ranked combat it is quite difficult to go from say a range attack, to melee, to will in a smooth way. I find myself getting lost on the keyboard trying to remember all the silly Hotkeys (Clicking in the mouse wheel to block?!). I havent looked to see if I can change these or not, but even fresh off the install, better controls should be offered as you seem to be all over the keyboard to map simple combos and interactions. Again im very new to the PC port, so I dont consider this part of the review to be fair. Im going to look into other control options, and test out the full control compatibility and update this.\nBut as of now, 2/5 for controls\n\nGameplay\n\nBeing a fan of this game I knew what I was getting into. There are gold quests which are your main storyline quests, while silver are selective. Theres a great balance between these quests and none of the main quests seem repititous in anyway. They are all interconnected and feel smooth, while the silver quests seem to be less polished. Whether its combat in the Arena Quest, or racing in your underwear in the prison, I think most gamers will be quite happy with the versatility offered in this game. Its nowhere near as in depth as other RPGs as Skyrim or WoW, but for a casual common gamer such as myself that doesnt want to put 500hrs into the game, its great for pickup and play.\nThe combat mechanics are simple, yet effective. You have a decent selection of basic weapons (Swords, Hammers, Scythes, Bows, Crossbows, etc) which are then placed into damage categories based on level (Obsidian, Master etc). Not to mention the Legendary weapons you can find in game through chests, quests, and other means. Like previously stated, the only amjor hinderance with the combat in this game is abmysal controls.\nGameplay 4.25/5\n\nOverall, would I recommend this game? For the $9 I paid for it, definitly. For users looking to get into it I cannot recommend it at $40. Owners of Lost Chapters especially, save your time and money,\n\nID RATE THIS PORT 3.5/5\n\nIts a great game for a great series, and those who didnt experience it on both xboxs like I did, I would recommned picking up this port and checking out this great story and game. For myself, I can look  past the flaws as im a huge fan of the game, and hopefully you will do the same and experience the core of Fable and where its popularity came from.\n\n*Thanks for reading my first review, I will update as I continue on with the game as obviously I dont have much time played right now.","July 3, 2015","true","20.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NigelBurke/recommended/288470/","NigelBurke","[TPG] Nigel Burke","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NigelBurke/","120 products in account","I hate Fable Anniversary. I HATE FABLE ANNIVERSARY. I don't hate Fable, but Fable Anniversary is what I hate. Satan wouldn't even accept this along with your soul. Now, there are games that are bad and then ones that are very bad. THIS ONE IS VERY BAD. However, how can I love Fable - The Lost Chapers, but ♥♥♥♥ing HATE Fable Anniversary. I'll tell you those reasons. Here are 5 reasons of why Fable Anniversary sucks balls!\n\nReason #1. The Price\nSo, let's refer over to Fable - The Lost Chapters, which in my opinion is amazing and awesome. Also, this is the current prices of both of these games, so if they happen to go up or down in the future, then this won't be accurate, but this is as of July 7, 2015. Fable - The Lost Chapters on Steam is only $9.99. However, Fable Anniversary is $34.99, which is almost 4 times the price of The Lost Chapters. I know people will argue "But this is a NEW game!" However, Fable Anniversary isn't a remastered version of a game that came out last year, it's a remastered version of a game that came out TEN ♥♥♥♥ING YEARS AGO. Also, it's not like it was impossible to get Fable on Windows or even the Xbox 360, as Steam has The Lost Chapters and Xbox 360 had not only a retail regular edition that was released in 2007, but you can also download it on the Xbox Live store. It would have made sense to make Fable Anniversary on the Xbox One $39.99! However, it's unacceptable that they made it only $5.00 cheaper on Steam.\n\nReason #2. DLC\nI have one simple question, ONE SIMPLE ♥♥♥♥ING QUESTION. WHY THE ♥♥♥♥ DID YOU ADD DLC TO FABLE ANNIVERSARY?!?!?!!? That's so much ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. The only way to have gotten the DLC for free is if you preordered for Xbox 360, but I don't know if that was the same with the Steam Version. They should of given this stuff for FREE if they were already going to make the game $39.99 at launch. Instead, they didn't and forced us to buy it if we ever wanted to have what was in there. ALL WELL KNOWN REMASTERED GAMES DON'T HAVE DLC TO BUY BECAUSE THEY COME FREE WITH THE ♥♥♥♥ING GAME! This is something so simple that you would have to be stupid not to do that.\n\nReason #3. SEPERATING THE INVENTORY AND OPTIONS FOR PC IS ♥♥♥♥ING ANNOYING!\nI liked when in Fable - The Lost Chapters that when I click the escape key, that I can go to my inventory and much more. Instead, they decided to make the options and inventory COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. They are now sepereate and it's annoying because I am so used to click to the escape key to go to my inventory, but then I remember I have to click F to go to the inventory. They made it F because that F stands for ♥♥♥♥ You to all the people who had gotten very used to the Lost Chapters ways.\n\nReason #4. THIS GAME IS THE EXACT SAME AS THE LOST CHAPTERS\nTHIS GAME HAS LITTLE TO WHAT MAKES IT THE EXACT SAME AS FABLE THE LOST CHAPTERS. On the FAQ for Fable Anniversary, they said the only new things they added was a new lighting system, new models, textures, and details, new particle fx, new facial and cutscene animation, Widescreen Support, and remastered sound. That's it. Can you make your character a female? NO! Are there new quests or content? NO! Is there CO-OP? NO! Are there any Easter Eggs? NO! Are there any small pieces of content at all? NO! Any Future DLC that is actually worth the money? NO! Is there a way to switch between the HD remastered version and the original version? NO! Will there be any changes to the way your character ages as they level up? NO! The amount of changes made is so tiny that it's stupid to even why they made a remastered version. Why couldn't it include all 3 Fables, but with the first one remastered like how this one is? DOOM 3: BFG Edition did that well, why couldn't they do it like that? This game is basically a remastered version of Fable - The Lost Chapters, which is a remastered version of Fable.\n\nReason #5, and this has to be the biggest reason of them all. IT'S THE ANNIVERSARY OF SOMETHING THAT THERE SHOULDN'T BE A ANNIVERSARY OF!\nWhy did they make an Anniversary version of Fable? It's the anniversary of an overrated, overhyped, and short RPG! That's like making a remastered version of Brink or WATCH_DOGS. Are they celebrating of how much Peter Molyneux overhyped this game? Are they celebrating of how much of a dissapointment of this game was? Are they celebrating the Anniversary that this game wasn't even able to sell 5 million copies exclusive to their system? Is this the anniversary of how short this game was especially for an RPG? Is this the anniversary of a game series that has gone down hill after the second one? That's what the Anniversary edition of Fable is, it's all of these. Also, unlike most other remasters, NOBODY cared about getting Fable remastered at all, unlike with other AAA games, like DOOM 3 and The Last of Us.\n\nSo, those are the reasons of why Fable Anniversary just sucks. I would not recommend it at its current price, but if it goes below $19.99, then you should consider getting it. Glitches make it even worse and the controls don't feel as nice as they did with Fable - The Lost Chapters. I heard many people complain about that game not having controller support, but I thought it had amazing PC controls, but Anniversary will FORCE YOU TO USE AN XBOX 360 CONTROLLER FROM THE VERY START!\n\nLet me know in the comments below if you happen to experience the exact same ♥♥♥♥ that i did and let me know more reasons of why to stay away from Anniversary.","July 9, 2015","false","4.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

It helps that it doesn't take itself seriously in the least.

Its still junky dollar-store candy, but now its the BEST junky dollar-store candy.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stockloc/recommended/288470/","stockloc","Anti-Cheat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stockloc/","285 products in account","This is more a remaster than a remake of Fable. Nonetheless, this is probably one of the greatest RPG's ever to have existed so it makes sense to remaster it to preserve it for upcoming generations.\n\nWhat is Fable? Fable is a game about the life of your in-game character. You will follow him from childhood to his elder years (age is simulated through playtime rather than story). Your decisions shape your character's appearance, reputation and social standing. The way people react to you differs depending on your in-game actions. Did you raid a farm in order to gain some gold, or did you defend it from bandits?\n\nFable is a game filled with lore and really gives you a good sense of growth. You will feel yourself and your character improve with gameplay. Fighting often with swords makes your character's muscles grow. Eating too much food will make him fat. Using a lot of magic will create rune lines on his skin. Doing good deeds will make your skin lighter and your eyes glow blue. Doing evil deeds will make your skin darker and your eyes glow red. Whatever your decisions, you can bet that the game will reflect it.\n\nI will not spoil anything, but this is one of the greatest RPG stories because of how varied it is. It really feels like you've lived a lifetime by the end of the game; the game feels that lengthy.\n\nThe combat is enjoyable as it is a hack n' slash game. This version gives you a 'heroic' mode which really ups the challenge. More tactics is required in heroic mode as you need to plan before heading into battle, "which enemies do I kill first, what spells should I use, how should I initially attack". One false move and you will die (and die for good as you will need to restart from a checkpoint).\n\nIf you've already played the game and are purchasing this for the upgraded graphics, then you're reading the right review. The graphics are a great improvement. However, I feel like the game 'feels' different with the new graphics. It feels more like 'clay' rather than the old World of Warcrafty graphics. Hard to describe unless you've played it yourself. In terms of gameplay, NOTHING was changed. Everything is the same; the bugs, the sounds, the interface. They have 'improved' the HUD (which isn't necessarily an improvement, just a reskin).\n\nAll in all, it's a solid remaster but not worth the $40.00 price tag. Wait for a sale; $20 and below and this remaster is definately worth it.\n\nThis remaster gets an 8/10. It lost 2 points due to no improvements/innovation.","December 24, 2015","true","4.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Now, there are games that are bad and then ones that are very bad. THIS ONE IS VERY BAD. However, how can I love Fable - The Lost Chapers, but ♥♥♥♥ing HATE Fable Anniversary. I'll tell you those reasons. Here are 5 reasons of why Fable Anniversary sucks balls!\n\nReason #1. The Price\nSo, let's refer over to Fable - The Lost Chapters, which in my opinion is amazing and awesome. Also, this is the current prices of both of these games, so if they happen to go up or down in the future, then this won't be accurate, but this is as of July 7, 2015. Fable - The Lost Chapters on Steam is only $9.99. However, Fable Anniversary is $34.99, which is almost 4 times the price of The Lost Chapters. I know people will argue "But this is a NEW game!" However, Fable Anniversary isn't a remastered version of a game that came out last year, it's a remastered version of a game that came out TEN ♥♥♥♥ING YEARS AGO. Also, it's not like it was impossible to get Fable on Windows or even the Xbox 360, as Steam has The Lost Chapters and Xbox 360 had not only a retail regular edition that was released in 2007, but you can also download it on the Xbox Live store. It would have made sense to make Fable Anniversary on the Xbox One $39.99! However, it's unacceptable that they made it only $5.00 cheaper on Steam.\n\nReason #2. DLC\nI have one simple question, ONE SIMPLE ♥♥♥♥ING QUESTION. WHY THE ♥♥♥♥ DID YOU ADD DLC TO FABLE ANNIVERSARY?!?!?!!? That's so much ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. The only way to have gotten the DLC for free is if you preordered for Xbox 360, but I don't know if that was the same with the Steam Version. They should of given this stuff for FREE if they were already going to make the game $39.99 at launch. Instead, they didn't and forced us to buy it if we ever wanted to have what was in there. ALL WELL KNOWN REMASTERED GAMES DON'T HAVE DLC TO BUY BECAUSE THEY COME FREE WITH THE ♥♥♥♥ING GAME! This is something so simple that you would have to be stupid not to do that.\n\nReason #3. SEPERATING THE INVENTORY AND OPTIONS FOR PC IS ♥♥♥♥ING ANNOYING!\nI liked when in Fable - The Lost Chapters that when I click the escape key, that I can go to my inventory and much more. Instead, they decided to make the options and inventory COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. They are now sepereate and it's annoying because I am so used to click to the escape key to go to my inventory, but then I remember I have to click F to go to the inventory. They made it F because that F stands for ♥♥♥♥ You to all the people who had gotten very used to the Lost Chapters ways.\n\nReason #4. THIS GAME IS THE EXACT SAME AS THE LOST CHAPTERS\nTHIS GAME HAS LITTLE TO WHAT MAKES IT THE EXACT SAME AS FABLE THE LOST CHAPTERS. On the FAQ for Fable Anniversary, they said the only new things they added was a new lighting system, new models, textures, and details, new particle fx, new facial and cutscene animation, Widescreen Support, and remastered sound. That's it. Can you make your character a female? NO! Are there new quests or content? NO! Is there CO-OP? NO! Are there any Easter Eggs? NO! Are there any small pieces of content at all? NO! Any Future DLC that is actually worth the money? NO! Is there a way to switch between the HD remastered version and the original version? NO! Will there be any changes to the way your character ages as they level up? NO! The amount of changes made is so tiny that it's stupid to even why they made a remastered version. Why couldn't it include all 3 Fables, but with the first one remastered like how this one is? DOOM 3: BFG Edition did that well, why couldn't they do it like that? This game is basically a remastered version of Fable - The Lost Chapters, which is a remastered version of Fable.\n\nReason #5, and this has to be the biggest reason of them all. IT'S THE ANNIVERSARY OF SOMETHING THAT THERE SHOULDN'T BE A ANNIVERSARY OF!\nWhy did they make an Anniversary version of Fable? It's the anniversary of an overrated, overhyped, and short RPG! That's like making a remastered version of Brink or WATCH_DOGS. Are they celebrating of how much Peter Molyneux overhyped this game? Are they celebrating of how much of a dissapointment of this game was? Are they celebrating the Anniversary that this game wasn't even able to sell 5 million copies exclusive to their system? Is this the anniversary of how short this game was especially for an RPG? Is this the anniversary of a game series that has gone down hill after the second one? That's what the Anniversary edition of Fable is, it's all of these. Also, unlike most other remasters, NOBODY cared about getting Fable remastered at all, unlike with other AAA games, like DOOM 3 and The Last of Us.\n\nSo, those are the reasons of why Fable Anniversary just sucks. I would not recommend it at its current price, but if it goes below $19.99, then you should consider getting it. Glitches make it even worse and the controls don't feel as nice as they did with Fable - The Lost Chapters. I heard many people complain about that game not having controller support, but I thought it had amazing PC controls, but Anniversary will FORCE YOU TO USE AN XBOX 360 CONTROLLER FROM THE VERY START!\n\nLet me know in the comments below if you happen to experience the exact same ♥♥♥♥ that i did and let me know more reasons of why to stay away from Anniversary.","July 9, 2015","false","4.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

Fans have been asking them to do an HD remake for years. The gameplay is exactly how it was on the original game (animations and all) and the only thing changed are the graphics. A lot of the reviews are negative for this reason but the majority of the people who were asking for the remake to happen did not and still don't want the original gameplay changed. Yes, there have been some features in Fable 2 and 3 that would have been nice to have on the remake (better animations once again), but a lot of fans, myself included, wanted to play this game exactly as it was. We just wanted to see this great RPG in full HD glory and updated so it ran better, so if you were a fan of the original but wanted improvements on top of the HD remaster, this probably isn't the game for you to buy, but if you, like me, just wanted to see this game in stunning HD quality, this is a great game to buy.\n\nThe only con I have is the new inventory menu. It takes some getting used to and I'd have prefered the original one, but oh well.","December 28, 2014","true","31.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Most major problems and concerns have been ironed out and the addition of mouse controls in most menus (but oddly enough not all) has made this an actual PC port worth considering. With this in mind, I'm changing my review to a recommended. I will not remove the original criticism, though, as I feel the "release broken port, then fix all the faults afterwards" trend has got to stop, and we as the consumers have to tell the developers and publishers that this practice is not okay.\n\nTL;DR: The current state of the game is acceptable. What we got at launch, was not.\n\n\nORIGINAL CRITICISM:\n\nIf you thought the original port was bad, boy are you in for a treat. This game features endlessly loading textures, with the graphical fidelity of a game from 2006. The menus seem like they've been made by aliens with no idea of how humans use their hands, and the most annoying controls are not rebindable.\n\nI think this is a crying shame, as I loved the original as a teenager, but as an adult PC gamer, I'm insulted by the lack of effort made on lionhead's part, to make this remake playable on PC. The least they could bloody do is make the mouse cursor available in the game. I'M PLAYING ON A PC, WHY CAN'T I USE MY MAIN INPUT TOOL FOR NAVIGATING YOUR MENUS?\n\nThat rant aside, just buy the lost chapters instead. It is at least playable, something that this remake is not.","September 12, 2014","true","20.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It still as good as when it first came out.\n\nI have tried playing this game with both keyboard and a controller. And I must say it's absolutely horrible to even try to figure out how to play it with the keyboard. The game comes with two setting for the controller, either the classicial one for Fable 1 or the enhanced version that are used in Fable II & III, depending on which control scheme you prefer.\n\nThe menus are re-designed and I'm sorry to say that it's to the worse. It's hard to navigate and you never really know where to find anything. You end up spending far too much time on browsing the menu than finding what you are looking for.\n\nThe graphics are indeed updated. One can question though if it's really as good as it can be. You still see the low poly and low ress textures. The alpha shaders (hair and vegetations) are beyond all criticism. It's just horrible.\n\nThat said, the game is still enjoyable and if you see it only as a slightly enchaed version of the first game, it's still as fun as it was back then.\n\nGraphics 4/10\nGameplay 9/10\n\n","December 24, 2014","true","15.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Gameplay's always fun (since it's fable). Of course, usually a remake is the original but reimagined, where you'd expect an entirely new game based off the original, though really it's still the same exact game, I think most of the animations are the same, weapons are mostly the same with a few exceptions. I honestly expected an expanded story, maybe more adult with the Fable Fan Community now all grown up, no longer in their teens or childhood. Honestly I wouldn't really "recommend" this game, though it's an improvement from TLC, it's nothing new or different. If you already have TLC I wouldn't say this is worth 60 dollars, though it won't freeze and crash like TLC did often.\n\n\nOLD REVIEW: This is subject to change, since this is only the first day, but essentially it's the same exact game as TLC, only with a new GUI that doesn't allow you to use your mouse in menus, and a screwed up combat system. If you want to learn more I have a nice big rant in the forums.

The menu was the main reason i didnt play Anniversary so far, it just made the task of doing anything in the menu unbearable. Thats fixed now. It could be better, but its ok.\n\nContols and fighting system are still like the original, i like that. Yet we werent able to fe. use special mouse buttons or rebind individual actions. All this is possible by now.\n\nGraphics had to live through some changes and are now less blurry and sharper overall. Nice to actually see the better graphics now ;)\n\nFor a review of the game itself (story, world gameplay) check my Fable - The Lost Chapters review, the games are 99% identical and control the same way (aside from menu as discussed before).\nI'll just say that the old version was/is one of my most favorite games of all time.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/st0l3nid/recommended/204030\n\nFable Anniversary finally got the curve, there is still some room for improvement, but we can finally enjoy with mouse and keyboard and nice graphics.

Or if you don't mind paying the $34.99, then I would certainly grab it now.","October 12, 2014","true","20.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Fable has a weird sheen over it now, but is quite lifeless compared to my nostalgia. If the cheap original has controller support, play that instead. (If you need controller support anyways) Sure it's fun for my faux OCD to collect achievements for a game that I beat 4 times 10 years ago, but its not as fun as I remember. I am spoiled by modern rpgs that do so much right, whereas Fable always faltered then, and still does now. If you loved the original (or even liked) don't bother with this version. It's not worth it. If you have never experienced Fable, jump right in. I'm sure its quite enjoyable, if a bit embarassing and antiquated. 6/10","January 19, 2015","true","15.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

With the enhanced graphics, it makes the game more enjoyable and playable in todays standards. I'm actually surprised that many were disapointed because they felt that this edition was "lazy".

If you haven't played it, it's fantastic, and worth the price.  Whimsical humor and deep gameplay make it a fun RPG.  Choices matter and change the way the world reacts to you.  There are several approaches to combat.  The voice acting is good.  The controls get a bit clunky no matter what version you have, but it's a small flaw in a large gem.  If you can get it on sale, great, or you can pay the cheaper price for the older version as it is the same game.\n\nBottom Line: At full price, you should probably get Fable: The Lost Chapters, but this is still worth it even paying full price, as it stands on its own.

Very rarely can I go back to a game and remember where I was or what I was doing in my life at the time but Fable was " good old days ".\nSo when I purchased Anniversary edition I was looking forward to going back again, kinda like those hippies who are all like " hey man, I gotta get back to the times of Woodstock man!"\nSure, I got sent back alright...back to the title screen to quit and uninstall. Don't be fooled by my playtime, if you've played Fable before, then you would expect things to be " just so". I actually spent all 5 hours of that troubleshooting performance and controll issues while playing.\nIf you have an xbox, better to get this on a console rather than on PC.\nI could say plenty good about Fable though, just not this particular version. It's just got a new lick of paint, some decent textures, enhanced lighting and god rays, different interface, game is still the same though....but with worse peformance. Even trying the plethora of peformance fixes out there that have been suggested, the game still runs like a wounded snail and no, it's not my rig.\n\nAs I type this review, I've actually started a new game in the original pc version. I honestly can't figure out why they thought it needed an Anniversary edition now looking between the two versions. The original ran perfectly well, has no hitches or gamestopping moments, the graphics yes are dated but there's nothing like running a game with perfect performance on full settings.\n\nThe one and only thing I can recommend about this version is that it looks nice.","March 9","false","5.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ergoth/recommended/288470/","Ergoth","Ergoth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ergoth/","25 products in account","Fable is what I would call a fantasy classic: You, the protagonist, suffer hardship at a young age, and then learn the skills required to be a Hero (quite literally) and save the world. I have always loved the combat system of Fable and Fable: The Lost Chapters. It feels smooth, and is easy to master. Enemies are always going to be challenging and willing to punish you if you let your guard down. The Fable Series has long been one of my favorite, and I love this remake.\n\nHowever, there are a few flaws to this. Firstly (and the biggest problem) is the menu. Occasionally the menu will glitch out and either randomly start scrolling through whatever screen you are on, or it will try to prevent you from scrolling through it, constantly dragging your selector (is that even the term?) back to the top of the menu. The second flaw to Fable: Anniversary is the colors. The origional Fable and Fable: The Lost Chapters were these brightly colored places that captured your imagination. Now, the world feels dull and somewhat bland. However, the balance of the coloring it still good, and you won't be bored looking at the world after an hour.\n\nThat all being said, I would wholeheartedly recommend this game to everyone, both those who have played the series since the first installments, and new players who found a sale going on.","September 17, 2015","true","100.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you haven't played it, it's fantastic, and worth the price.  Whimsical humor and deep gameplay make it a fun RPG.  Choices matter and change the way the world reacts to you.  There are several approaches to combat.  The voice acting is good.  The controls get a bit clunky no matter what version you have, but it's a small flaw in a large gem.  If you can get it on sale, great, or you can pay the cheaper price for the older version as it is the same game.\n\nBottom Line: At full price, you should probably get Fable: The Lost Chapters, but this is still worth it even paying full price, as it stands on its own.

The other animations sometimes clip through some armour sets and it detracts from what they are trying to achieve.\n\nHaving played it recently, the game is reasonably stable, with a few very, very minor bugs.\n\nIt plays very similar, if not identically to TLC.\n\nIt mostly lives up to expectations and its quite enjoyable, but doesn't provide any new content above what was included in TLC. Some find that infuriating, I don't personally. However, I would welcome new content in the same vein as the original titles.   // BOTTOM LINE VERDICT //:   The remake is  worth a sale price value (e.g $8 USD)  ,   NOT    its current full asking price.\n\nIf you've played TLC through and through, then the value of buying this is just updated visuals and I recommend  buying it at a low sale price if you really want it.\n\nIf you haven't played TLC or Any Fable games, this remake will do the series as much justice as TLC, so the value to a consumer in this category is vast in comparison, however I still only recommend purchasing at sale price as I feel purely updated visuals isn't enough to merit the full price.","July 1, 2015","true","20.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The day I installed Fable Anniversary and jumped right into the story, a wave of sentimental memories as well as newly influenced wonder washed over me. It was the same game that crafted my childhood, yet it was a whole new experience. The controls were almost exactly the same, the major differences being what buttons bring up menus, inventory, etc. and how to navigate the menus (like how in the original game in the menus the right mouse button was the back button but now it does nothing in the menus). It takes a little bit to break the old habits here but nothing that takes away from the experience. The sound quality is also better. I personally am especially fond of the sound effects of hitting enemies in this game rather than in The Lost Chapters. The blood looks a lot better and splatters more realistically.

Very rarely can I go back to a game and remember where I was or what I was doing in my life at the time but Fable was " good old days ".\nSo when I purchased Anniversary edition I was looking forward to going back again, kinda like those hippies who are all like " hey man, I gotta get back to the times of Woodstock man!"\nSure, I got sent back alright...back to the title screen to quit and uninstall. Don't be fooled by my playtime, if you've played Fable before, then you would expect things to be " just so". I actually spent all 5 hours of that troubleshooting performance and controll issues while playing.\nIf you have an xbox, better to get this on a console rather than on PC.\nI could say plenty good about Fable though, just not this particular version. It's just got a new lick of paint, some decent textures, enhanced lighting and god rays, different interface, game is still the same though....but with worse peformance. Even trying the plethora of peformance fixes out there that have been suggested, the game still runs like a wounded snail and no, it's not my rig.\n\nAs I type this review, I've actually started a new game in the original pc version. I honestly can't figure out why they thought it needed an Anniversary edition now looking between the two versions. The original ran perfectly well, has no hitches or gamestopping moments, the graphics yes are dated but there's nothing like running a game with perfect performance on full settings.\n\nThe one and only thing I can recommend about this version is that it looks nice.","March 9","false","5.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I have played every Fable that has come out other than Fable: The Journey so I think that it is okay for me to say that this is the best one yet and is wonderful edition to my Fable Collection on both my xbox and PC. This game has wonderfully remastered visuals and audio that will take your breath away when thinking about the first Fable in comparison. I spent a lot of time in the Beta for this game playing for countless hours because I could not get enough of it.

So when I heard tell of a remake in the works I quickly pre-ordered with all the DLC (like the massive nostalgia-sucker I am).\n\nIf you're expecting all-new quests and gameplay mechanics, look elsewhere. This is a faithful remake with beautifully tacky voice acting and broken economies aplenty. You can do all the things you used to do, fight all the battles you used to fight and listen to people call you chickenchaser in just the same tone they used to ("do you chase chickens?"), but now it's actually making use of the full-HD monitor you have sitting on your desk. This was simply a nostalgia trip for me, and that was all I ever expected.\n\nThe heroic mode is hard, and that's what was always missing from the original TLC. Real challenge has been added and that is welcome. The new costumes and weapons are fun, tiered well and implemented just fine.\n\nNow the bad:\nMost noticible for me were the incredibly jerky animations of the chests opening (of all things) and the entirely unintuitive menu system. The old menus were quick to navigate, efficient and fit the character of the game nicely. The newest ones are clunky, space-wasting and actually hard to navigate (even with the added mouse support!). I dreaded upgrading my character for fear of navigating the quagmire of poor design decisions and rudimentary grasps of UI design.\n\nOverall this was fun to play, particularly through rose-tinted glasses. And despite the menu issues, it still feels untimately like Fable. Maybe not worth £27+DLC, but certainly a good one to get on sale!","November 18, 2014","true","15.2"," 18 of 38 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","18","38","0","0"

It has always been one of those games that I've meant to play, but when I first heard about the HD remake, it seemed like the perfect time to actually do so.  First off, the game looks lovely - you only have to compare the visuals from the 2004 release to those in Fable Anniversary to see just how much of an improvement this release offers.  It really brings the game to a standard where you can play it today and it doesn't feel dated, and all without losing the original charm and style of the 2004 game.\n\nAs a new player, I've been really enjoying Fable Anniversary - the game feels open enough to give a sense of exploration (the side quests, mini games etc.) but has an interesting and engaging primary quest that keeps you moving forward.  RPG levelling is there and, whilst it might not be as complex as some RPG games these days, I like that I don't have to spend hours in the menus worrying about to which of the tens of attributes I should be allocating my experience!  It's a great adventure game, and one that you can just pick up and enjoy when the mood takes you.  For those who loved the original, I think you'll enjoy rediscovering a game that you played perhaps ten years ago in beautiful HD (or 4K if you're lucky enough to be an early adopter!).

Yeah, that first trailer with a bunch of people typing chat messages to one another did little to sell this one.  Yeah, the graphics are a lot less improved than I had believed.  Yeah, I preordered this largely because I thought I was getting some one-time shot at bonus content that you couldn't buy as a $5 DLC.  Okay, a little let-down, but it's not a terrible remake so far.  Some of the characters faces have gotten uglier than the first Fable tho.  Was that intentional?  I really expected Briar Rose to be more, um, appealing, given her self-absorbed attitude, and Mace to look less like he's lost some fights with his food processor.\n\nThus far I have played this with a controller, and have had no crashes, no issues, no glitching.  Not even the ability to buy a crapton of apples and buy/sell them for infinity money and archery exp.  Well, I guess they did fix some things, even if they kept some dumb game mechanics like having to murder people to buy their houses.  "Sorry I had to immolate you with magical fire so I could buy your house, but Bowerstone doesn't allow weapons, y'know...  Hey, I'll use your future rent monies to buy lots of tofu and it'll all be okay!"  Actually, now that I've played a bit more, it turns out you can still amass a small fortune by selling and rebuying 50 health potions.  It's a dumb mechanic, but it does remove any tedium from earning money.  And pretty much any meaningful value to the stealing skill.\n\nI have not yet dived in with my trusty mouse and keyboard, but so far so good.  Their latest patch, while fraught with complaints about the size, does seem to address issues I've seen reviews complaining about, like keyboard and mouse remapping.  What's not to love about a developer supporting their game?  Bottom line: maybe not enough improvements to make this worth all the hype (and price tag).  People can complain about how they loved some of the mechanics of 2 and 3, but if you absolutely have to play a female, go play the game that allows it.  Fable was a great game, and this seems to be at least as good, if only ever so slightly improved in graphics.","September 15, 2014","true","16.2"," 13 of 28 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","13","28","0","0"

A legitimate complaint would be why they're charging 34.99 for this, when Fable TLC is only 9.99. An illegitimate complaint would be all the ones I see about the controls.\n\nPC Master Race people, this is a console game that was ported to PC. And there is absolutely no reason they should have to go the extra mile to appease you. The mouse and keyboard were not designed for gaming, a 360 controller was. And as such the keyboard and mouse will ALWAYS be inferior for controls. Unless the game was designed for PC first, which Fable Anniversary was not. Accept that the PC has flaws when it comes to gaming and lower your impossible standards and you'll all enjoy games a lot more. And if you can't handle the fact that your chosen method of playing games is flawed then it is no one's fault but your own. Sorry to burst your little bubbles but PC gaming isn't as perfect as you all like to pretend it is. Especially when the game in question is a port from console.\n\nAnd I know what you're gonna say. "The game should have been designed for PC first" Well it wasn't. And no amount of whining (And that is what you're doing, whining, because you're not getting everything 100% your way) is going to change that. And you have no right to criticize the developers for putting their game wherever they like. Because it's their game.\n\nSure, the menu system sucks with a mouse and keyboard, but it wasn't designed to be used by those. And I imagine the developers have better things to do then tool around with this game for the 3rd time just to make a couple of idiots happy.\n\nIf you can look past the assinine control scheme (Like me, because Fable is really damn good) or have a controller to play with (If the game supports it), I think you'll have a good time with this, it's just Fable TLC with an new coat of paint, and that's all it was ever meant to be.","September 13, 2014","true","10.7"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","9","20","0","0"

Weird mishapen people giving off way more eye contact than nesscary. The absoulute best one I found was on Thunder, a large black hero. He, no joke, looks like a balck guy in blackface. Briar rose, a sexy nerd like hero in the original, killed my boner faster than the speed of light in the remastered. All-in-all, if you LOVE fable or somehow missed playing the original give this game a try, but only on sale. $35 is an outrageous price for a 10 yo game.

I had all his games to chose from, but only played that :)\nI pre-ordered this for my son and I, knowing he was a major Fable fan and I kinda liked it :)\nI read the reviews of others waiting for the download, and was a touch concerned. Nonetheless, I fired it up and got stuck in. My son was watching, telling me how much better everything looked. I experienced no lag apart from during dialogues, the "A" button doesn't always register. I've only played for 3 hours so far but it looks delightful. Maybe it doesn't have the famous cast of voice actors that it's sequels had, and the mix of accents were a bit dubious to say the least, but that can be forgiven.\nThe most welcome feature for me is the x-box controller support. I have MS (multiple sclerosis) so KB/Mouse is impossible - my left hand only has a working thumb and forefinger. Even with the controller I have to limit my session times - a 3 hour session was way too long but I was in da zone :)\nI'm loving Fable Anniversary so far.","September 13, 2014","true","58.3"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

I really don't see what the big fuss is. Self-entitled kiddos is my guess... Anyone outside of that should be ashamed of themselves for acting like one.\n\nTo be honest, I wasn't wanting additional content. I wanted a Fable experience exactly how I recall back in 2004.\n\nOn those grounds, Anniversary delivered tremendously.\n\nFable was a staple of my young adulthood. I beat the thing 20 times before Anniversary released, and after recently purchasing the original TLC for the PC; I really suffered through not having controller support. I ended up using Xpadder, which really sucked due to limited movement.\n\nThe added controller support, along with a redesigned UI really addresses the weakpoints of the original game.\n\nThe game plays on a completely new engine - Unreal 3, which makes it look incredible. That, coupled with the massive effort to retexture the game really gives the graphics a kick to make it competitive with current releases.\n\nFable Anniversary also features an audio overhaul, where some parts have been completely redone. No more out of sync voice overs with the character animations!\n\nThe majority of people downing this game are ignorant. I've watched people of the community refuse to buy this game for petty reasons like no more silver key glitching with hero saves, or no ability to play as a female. Those are features that were purposely left out because they weren't intended in the original game. These idiots are seriously bashing the game because they fixed bugs from the original...\n\nOverall, if you enjoyed the original game, then you are bound to enjoy Anniversary. As a Fable series enthusiast, and longtime fan of the game; I can definitely say that Anniversary's graphical rebuild does the original game justice. The added controller support and UI overhaul really make the game a much smoother experience on the PC!\n\nIt was just like experiencing the original game for the first time again - and in my opinion, you really can't put a price on such a great feeling of nostalgia.","September 15, 2014","true","35.5"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

The game has some graphical issues, Initially the games motion blur on camera movement is horrble, But you can turn it off, And the colour of the game is too 'dark'. But again you can turn this off, I'll leave a "How To" at the bottom for you if you are interested\nThe game lags or freezes alot and it drive people insane, But hey guys, Guess what, You can fix that too! jusy Verify the Integrity of the Game Cashe before you play it, It takes a few minutes, But its way worth it!\nNo mouse to operate menus, Yeah thats a bad thing I guess for a PC Port, But its really not ♥♥♥♥ing hard to use Insert, Home, Del and End to scroll through a menu, Is it?\n\nId say thats all for the bad besides just a few little things like hit boxes on the terrain being a little too large or something silly like that. So onto the good things!\nIn all this  game is FANTASTIC and I love the Fable franchise, I even like the shocking abomination that is Fable 3, But this game is great\nOnce you tweak a few things here and there the game runs smooth and you can play to your hearts content\nHit up the graphic fix by following the section below and the game is beautiful, Its bright and every works as it should!\n\nThere I'll leave it on a 3 to 3 basis, Because it really isnt a big deal that the game is a little unpolished, It has the same issues as the original from 10 years ago, It just looks a bit prettier, Thats all, Personally, I think they shouldnt have dont Anniverasy and just let Fable: The Lost Chapters on here and Fable 2 and 3, But hey, This is great and once you get used to the quirks of it, Its great, Ive played for 20+ hours now or something and I am loving it! Hope this helps And that it isnt too muhch text for my fair opinion and non pompus accusation!\n\nGraphic Fix\nGo to: Documents\My Games\UnrealEngine3\WellingtonGame\Config\nThen open WellingtonSystemSettings with Notepad\nThen change AllowRadialBlur to false and change DepthOfField to false too\nThen TADA, Game looks fine, Happy Adventuring!","September 15, 2014","true","33.2"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

I recognize that the gameplay could be smoother but it's not as terrible as I expected after reading some reviews by long-time Fable players and gaming experts.  The game is definitely playable, just not super smooth when the hero is running, etc.\n\nIt took me a while to figure out the D-pad items/expressions feature, so that lack of instruction gets a thumbs down (I still don't know why my assigned expressions only appear on the D-pad screen icon when I hold Right Trigger and why certain expressions/items get auto-assigned to the regular D-pad screen icon and why I can't change *those*).\n\nI also think there should have been an explanation of the save system at the beginning of the game (or anytime!). I think I'm about to graduate from the Heroes Guild & hopefully I can save anytime after that. Despite the couple annoyances, so far this game has lived up to my expectations. I was hoping for a game like this that would give me future nostalgia, like I have for the old days of playing the Zelda and Final Fantasy series. I'm sure they'll release some patches to improve the framerate but I'm going to continue playing in the meantime; I think it's a cool game and so far, I'm hooked!","September 13, 2014","true","50.7"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

Just like the original Fable, Lionhead hyped this game as much as they possibly could. At least this time, they didn't make tons of outlandish promises they couldn't keep. Instead they promised a remastering of on of their best games, and instead it's just sort of...updated a bit. Now, I can't play this game on anything but its lowest settings because I am poor, but the immediate reaction I had when starting the game was, "What's wrong with the controls?" And then I was immediately repulsed upon seeing the face of the hero as a child. In fact, the entire population of that beginning section has some serious facial issues that made me worry about the game. With the ugly models and the wonky controls, the first half hour isn't very enjoyable. Luckily, as you adapt to the new controls (or get a computer controller) and grow up, the character models settle into their skeletons and by the time you graduate from the guild, the game begins to show its true colors. While probably not deserving of the hype it got, neither does it deserve the immediate bashing. Are there problems? Yes, but the original Fable: The Lost Chapters on PC had plenty of problems itself and unlike the original, this one is going to have some modding support and possibly patching. Even on its lowest setting, post Guild Graduation, this game is a beautiful reconstruction of one of the greatest examples of RPGs ever released. Just calm down, keep an open mind, and enjoy it for what it is, Fable's Anniversary.","September 13, 2014","true","16.5"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

That said, it is not perfect.  Overall Score: 9/10  My simple review breakdown follows:\n\nPros:\n\n- Just like you remember the original Fable, except with better graphics.\n- One of the greatest RPGs of all time.\n- Steam achivements!\n- Modding!\n- Classic gameplay.\n\nCons:\n\n- Could have had spent more time redoing character motions and reworked their physics engine to make the game more fluid.\n\n- I hate to be cliche, but classic gameplay.  While it is a pro, it is also a con, because RPGs as well as all other games, have evolved.  I feel like this should have not just had new graphics slapped on.\n\n- No add in of previous Fable advances implemented into the Anniversary Edition?!  This is definitely my biggest pet peeve.  Lionhead introduced us to a whole new realm of customization of our character in Fable 2 and 3, and here we are, back at square one again without the ability to simply have different color hair.  It is my hopes the modding community comes up with a way to fix this.\n\nOverall, great game!  Still worth every penny!

This remake of Fable TLC isn't „bad“ or sth like that.\nIt has better graphics and a new gamemode, which makes the game a lot ♥♥♥♥in' harder, so why are there so many bad reviews you might think.\nMost of the negative reviews are very old and were written because of the negative sites of the game, which not really exist anymore.\nFor example, when the game came out you couldn't use your mouse in the menu - now you can.\nThe bugs that were complained about are fixed and if you look at the reviews for Xbox360 you can clearly see the game is very good and there are also not as much negative reviews as on PC, which probably is, because they never wanted a cursor based interface.\n\nThe only thing that I can really understand as a reason to not review this game is the price.\nThe game costs 30 bucks and is exactly the same game as the original Fable TLC, but has better graphics and so on.\n\nThere you know Fable is my favourite game, it's not really weird that I bought this game on the release day including all DLC's.\n\nI finished the game twice ( once easy mode, once hardcore mode ) and all I can do now is to highly recommend it to anyone, because it's just as great as the original.\n\n// If I made any mistakes in this text, or you don't agree with my review, feel free to dislike or comment .:)","November 15, 2014","true","35.7"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","3","8","0","0"

Those complaining about lag/frame-rate problems must have some sort of hardware issue (most likely down to their gfx).\n\nThere are plenty of reviews on websites such as IGN and YouTube and I'm sure that most people should have an idea what they're actually paying for.\n\nThe game has only just been released and modding has yet to achieve one of the main reasons why you have probably purchased this on Steam, rather than a console (that is if you own one).\n\nWhether there will be any new (official) DLC that was not in TLC, is completely a mystery, although one thing is almost certain.  Modders will most likely do so.\n\nIf there is one thing I would have to criticise about the game, it would be how easy it is to exploit stores to make money. If I had realised, I would've chosen to play at the Heroic difficulty from the start, rather than do a run-through on the original difficulty.\n\nAll-in-all, I've most definitely enjoyed the game so far. It is what it is. I highly recommend using a controller (preferrably a Microsoft Xbox pad) due to some apparant issues there may currently be with using a mouse/keyboard. The port isn't as 'horrendous' as people make it out to be, although saying that, it could have most definitely have been better.\n\nTo round-off this review, I'd like to say that if you are curious about buying the game, please do check out reviews/videos online rather than just insta-buying the game and then complaining because 'you thought they'd have improved it more'.\n\n7/10","September 14, 2014","true","65.0"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","1"

Keyboard and mouse controls work as well as Dark Souls. Graphic options are limited. Sound works. May crash, may not. May also stutter with certain hardware. Unreal game so you can tweak anything.\n\nThere are certain flaws that a lot of people pointed out already but it's not that bad, A few people like myself can play this game no problem. I play with a controller so the mouse and keyboard controls don't bother me as much. I bought this game knowing it would be a console port so keep that in mind if you're interested. The game runs smoothly and I've only had it crash every few hours. Hopefully they'll fix that soon but the game saves frequently so it's not enough to cause me much anger.\n\nIf you're not a fan of the Anniversary remake you probably won't like this either. The PC port is the 360 version with tacked on mouse and keyboard controls. It feels a lot like Dark Souls. It's rough around the edges but a good game if you play under optimal conditions(using a controller for ex.). Don't expact anything but a console port though and you'll find some enjoyment with this version. Keep in mind there is the original Fable on Steam too if that's what you want but it lacks controller support and that's actually one of the reasons I bought the Anniversary version.\n\nI'd recommend this to anyone who's ok with console ports, if you're not don't buy this game. Also it helps if you're a fan of the Anniversary remake because you know.. if you're not then why are you here?","September 15, 2014","true","41.2"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Keyboard+mouse be dun goofed apparently.\n\n------------------------------------\n\nI was an avid fan of the original Fable and Fable TLC, and the remastered edition doesn't fail to disappoint either.\n\nPROS:\n- WIDESCREEN SUPPORT AW YISS. Getting the original to work in widescreen wasn't terribly hard, but it was still hackish and bugged at some critical moments.\n- Very nice graphics, they've predominately kept to the core of the graphical characteristics of the Fable series, but it's amazing what a fresh coat of paint (proverbially speaking) can do with a game. Fable has definitely aged well.\n- Modding support? I'll be curious to see where this goes, and from what I've read, we may end up having Fable Anniversary coming to the Steam Workshop. Can't imagine it'd be like a Skyrim, though.\n\nCONS:\n- No Borderless Window nor scaleable UI. Just a bit of a bummer that I can't have the window maximised since it then causes letterboxing and the like, and considering this is a UE3 game, I'm surprised that we don't even have a borderless window option, since I often alt-tab between windows and would rather have the game appear full screen. I've tried tools to force the borderless window but it doesn't work.\n- Some graphical glitches exist where objects won't receive light from nearby light sources, kinda kills immersion a bit but it's not a deal breaker by any means.\n\nROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Mainly to do with the overall environmental lighting, particularly outdoors, but we could benefit from variations in luminosity, and actually be able to use the lantern at night, right now it just seems pointless to have the lantern since everything is so well lit.\n- Some head models can do with some improving too, the child Hero looks like he hasn't slept for a week, and Maze does not look like Maze at all, his characteristic stern look got ruined by an elongated, pudgy, wrinkly baby face with tattoos. |:\n\nI can't speak for the copious amounts of people that have whinged relentlessly about the whole keyboard + mouse thing, I do remember playing Fable TLC with a keyboard and mouse and it was working quite fine, though since then I've been playing games with a 360 controller, and naturally given Fable Anniversary was originally made for the 360, it still feels pretty good to play with. I did try playing with the keyboard+mouse combo, but quickly switched back to the controller. :P\n\nHaven't played through Heroic yet, but that'll be the next step.","September 17, 2014","true","50.0"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

But the video quality is updated massively; the models are much better, and the textures really pop as opposed to the original. The draw distance is greatly improved, allowing you to see your enemies much farther away now too, which can be helpful. Also the audio is improved too, but its hardly noticable honestly, given that so much of your attention is usally focused on the game itself.\n\nAchievments now come with it too, giving incentive to finish all those things you never did in the original, or just giving you a reason to finish them all over again. Inluded in those is one for finishing the game on its newly implemented "Heroic Mode," which among other things, removes exploits, makes enemies harder and removes resurrection phials, allowing for a much more difficult experience.\n\nThe DLC for this game is nothing more than custume packs, which are fun to use, but a little pricy. Still, even these costume packs can add a little more to your experience without feeling out of place from the original, and can also result in hilarious screenshots.\n\nAll in all, it's a fantastic way for fans of the original to experience it all over again, and for people who may have skipped it to reconsider and give it a go. It's by no means one of the best RPGs ever made, but its certainly unforgettable.","November 4, 2014","true","42.3"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

It's a great remake of Fable TLC with updated graphics that look beautiful and fixed a few things that made the game kind of a pain long ago. As well it has full controller support unlike TLC however being a PC game PC controls are quite important and upon release I will say this game was playable but uncomfortable to play, with all these patches left and right to put it up to the standards we all expected I really do think it's gaining it's worth. While the price seems hefty for an HD remake I will say with the dedication put in, if your new to the franchise I'd definetly recommend, if you already own it the decision is up to you but personally I'd recommend it, or wait until a sale and purchase. 7/10 (will go even higher as more is done to the game)","September 21, 2014","true","22.5"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Don't let the negative reviews fool you, if you were a fan of Fable in the original playing through this will be bliss.\n\nI can't speak of the keyboard and mouse controls as I used an Xbox 360 Controller to play and would recommend you do the same. Why anyone would want to play a third person game with a mouse and keyboard is beyond me.\n\nThe graphics have been mostly improved. The only downside I would say is some of the bright aesthetic seems to have been lost which is a shame\n\nThe sounds haven't been changed but don't feel poor quality. You'll love hearing "Hero your will energy is low, watch that!" The first time you hear it again and then hate it every time after\n\nI love the achievements they have too. Both interesting to achieve and full of funny references. "There's always a lighthouse" is a memorable example. A lot of achievements have two ways of getting them too which is nice.\n\nOverall, if you played this back in the day and you want an updated version, definitely get this. The combat isn't the best in the world at times but if they updated too much it would've been a different game. If you've new to the series, this is by far the best and is miles better than 3 (2 is pretty good, but is also Xbox 360 exclusive, which is a shame) so don't hesitate in getting it.

I haven't had any problems with the menu's in game or movement and visually this game casts a shadow over the lost chapters and the xbox original. There was added content but nothing that really matters because this is a HD remake not a reimagining or a retelling, personally I think that it is unfair to demand even MORE of a dev after they've already ported it once and now again. The game includes mods support with the engine editor so any problems to be had are going to be fixed whether we like it or not which is far and beyond what a lot of other games on steam can boast about. I've only just started it up and can't seem to replicate the issues so take this review for what its worth. This game probably won't have a good mouse and keyboard support because it was never intended to be played on a pc without a controller, they aren't even that expensive.\n\nThe issue in the end isn't the game its the coddling of the players that is absent that seems to upset people and that doesn't lend to fair judgement of the game.\n\ntl:dr - if you like fable / lost chapters, get it. it looks amazing it has all of the replayability and it has the editor.

Now first off, it's not Elder Scrolls big, there are certain things you can't do but can do, It's between massively open and limited, You can marry, have sex, Buy houses, kill townsfolk (Good luck fist fighting in Bowerstone), Open secret doorways to treasure, buy houses in the towns of people you kill, become incredibly evil or incredibly good (This affects your appearance massively, Evil causes you to lose hair, grow horns, create an evil aura about you and causes your hands and feet to become demonic, while being good causes you to emit a good aura about you, grow white hair and have a Halo above you), but you cannot customise appearance at the start (You can get a haircut, get a beard, tattoo's, become fat by eating too much, becoming good/evil, old, Muscly and scarred), you cannot create your own adventure, your name is always 'Hero' and titles you can buy, Not immersive that highly and do all that creating weapons (There is more but I didn't want to keep this going forever).\n\nNow is this like Skyrim? Certainly not, the only reason I compared them with openess because everyone recognises Skyrim as the big RPG. It's a medium sized fantasy RPG action game, most people would think that because it's a fantasy RPG action game, it's similar to Skyrim, however it has it's own unique style, instead of being an entire fantasy world populated with elves, orcs and all that, It's basically medieval britian with magic and monsters, Does this ruin the game? No, not at all, for the time it was a incredibly refreshing change from Orcs and Elf fantasies (Still is).\n\nThe combat for this game is quite basic, You have heavy weapons, light weapons, Bows/Crossbows and magic, Basic combat stuff like Swing, Block and a heavy attack, Heavy Weapons are incredibly sluggish to use (Don't expect to use them right away until your Physique is high enough) while light weapons are quick (No Dual wielding), Bows can be used to engage fights from a distance at first so they come to you, however headshotting an enemy will do high damage and can instantly kill them if strong enough and magic is something you can use to get around enemies, slow time, do deadly AoE attacks or summon/turn enemies against them. Leveling in this game is hugely different, in fact, leveling doesn't exist, you get EXP drops from enemies you kill or quests you complete, and you spend them at the guild to upgrade your magic, your skills (Speed, accuracy and guile) or upgrade your power (Health, Physique and Strength), killing enemies without getting hit will give huge boosts to EXP drops so make sure to be quick on your feet.\n\n\nNow for Actual opinion, The game is quite a great game, despite the series never living up to it's expectations, it's still a great game and the beginning of a great adventure, the story does better than most RPGs and keeps you invested to the end at least, the world is quite a lovely place, the gameplay is basic but good enough to get through the game, the music is absolutely gorgeus and the setting is amazing. Easy 9/10 for me\n\nNow is the graphical enhancement worth it?\nIt looks very beautiful compared to the old game, no edges seen, but it isn't exactly todays standards but still nice and it's definitely as I remember it, the only issue I had with this was the menus, some of the layouts weren't that great but the UI is definitely improved, The only issue I have with this compared to the old game was nagivating through the menus, it was a bit of a chore to do, but they seem like they will be fixing that eventually and they are planing to allow more mod making soon (Currently it's just small things).\n\nSo I do think this game is worth it if you are an RPG fan, it does it's job of entertaining you from start to finish and does contain british humour every once and a while","September 18, 2014","true","55.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

That's about my only complaint honestly.\n\nIf you've always wanted to play The Lost Chapters version but hated the "gritty" or "old" style look of the game - then this is for you! It plays faster, looks cleaner, and is every-bit the complete storyline plus moar!\n\nSide-note: I've found that if you decide to power-level your character prior even to the "Orchard Farm" quest - then you'll notice your character be this horrible-looking "old man faced teenager".... yeah... However, once you progress and "grow-up" in the storyline, your character's model will catch-up and things will start to be a little more anetomically correct.","September 23, 2014","true","38.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

If you nitpick every little thing, then what game is "recommended?" Not, I'm not going to go to the extreme and say it's amazing or it's terrible. To me, it's neutral. Is it a good port? No. Is it "terrible?" Again, no. After the dissapointment of Microsoft allowing Dead Rising 3 to be ported to Steam and that being horrible, why was everyones expectations for this so high? With that said, I will point out some flaws about this. Key bindings are there, but not for every key, which people are overreacting about because the keys themselves are fine, except for the blocking, which is the mouse wheel, and that's a bit weird but when they're physique shield and flourishes, who needs to block or dodge? Are people complaining about it because they WANT it changed or because they CAN'T change it? The FXAA does make the game a bit blurry but from what I can tell, it wasn't THAT big of a deal but I can understand some annoyance out of it. The HD graphics are improved a lot since TLC (obviously) and I saw a Total Biscuit review saying something about a door's resolution being lower than everything else... Really? A door? If it was something majoy like the NPCs, or weapons that's fine. But a door? C'mon... No mouse control in menus, frustration is somewhat understandable, but to me it seems more or less people not wanting something changed a bit, pushing a key instead of a couple of mouse clicks, again, seems something stupid to argue about. Performance issues, only problem I've had is in the very beginning as a kid in Oakvale, everything else I get 45-60 FPS with dual Radeon 6770's. All that being said, the game is still as fun as TLC and you get better graphics and higher quality sound. If you're going to nitpick every little minor thing about this game it seems more like you're trying to criticize everything rather than play an old nostalgic game with bumped up graphics and sound. If you're really complaining about it because "it's not worth the $35" then wait till it goes on sale this winter, it's gonna happen.","September 15, 2014","true","12.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Definately feels like a fantasy world now with the glow, lights and crazy amount of trees. Now with modding AND mouse support in the menus. (Should of done that in the first place but what you gonna do?) this game is a great remaster without simply slapping on some textures. (Though it does seem like it at some parts.)

I feel the art style the devs used works VERY well with the game, and increases the ammount of charm the Fable games give, so far everything I have seen looks asthetically pleasing.\n\nNot RPG enough, If you have never played a Fable game, you MUST realize before playing that this game is NOTHING like an Elder scrolls, Dark souls, or Witcher game. Fable is VERY casual in comparison, and doesn't take itself nearly as seriously. Despite there also being a harder difficulty to choose from than normal, the game is still very much casual.\n\nReal Complaints:\n\nThe AI, The AI of a lot of the NPC's in this game is very clunky, and a bit buggy especially when trying to get people to follow you.\n\nBad cut scenes, During a lot of minor dialogue cut scenes, everything in the background seems to stop moving except for you, and the NPC you;re talikng to. This can lead to some very distracting, or awkward backgrounds with NPC's just frozen in the middle of an activity. Also the audio during chapter progression cutscenes is very low quality, and even crackles at times like the original game.\n\nThe $35 asking price, $35 dollars is just way to much for ecentially upgraded visuals, and audio especially when the original, and its Lost Chapters DLC are available on Steam as well.\n\nOver all though this game is extremely fun and very replayable\nThe Achievments are also a nice bonus, especially since most of them leave you with two different methods to unlock it, so the path / play style you choose won't impact if you can earn the achievment or not.","April 10, 2015","true","35.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeadlyGambit/recommended/288470/","DeadlyGambit","deadlygambit2","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeadlyGambit/","209 products in account","Since I wrote my original review, there have been patches implimented into Fable Anniversary Edition! The game comes off as more stable, but still has rendering issues in the Arena when it comes to the cut-scenes with the hero, audience, Jack of Blades, and Lady Grey scenes. I also am confused by the system used to assign keys for the D-Pad. I assign them, but cannot seem to use them. Those are my only urks at this moment.\n\nAside from the urks of rendering issues with certain points of the game, Fable feels like the original. The game-play is very smooth with the XBox 360 controller and the Fable 2-3 controls (unless you are assigning to your D pad, as mentioned before). The game matains the feeling I had with the Original Fable and Lost Chapters versions of the games and gives you a nostolgic feel when you play it.\n\nIf you are a big Fable fan, and can get past the issues of rendering delays, and the D-Pad issues, then I would reccomend the game! Despite the flaws, it is still a lot of fun and a great trip down memory lane for those who once played it on the Xbox. There is much the world of Albion has to offer you, once more!\n\nIf you cannot stand those problems I listed, I suggest waiting for more patches or look into getting Fable: Lost Chapters instead (You cannot play that version of Fable with a gamepad unless you get a seperate program that allows it. It is a strictly a Keyboard and mouse version of the game). If you are still on the fence, the best I can tell you is to wait for the game to go on sale and take a chance on it.\n\nAs for the DLC, you do not need it. The DLC only gives you the ability to BUY the items in game, and they items are insanely expensive or hard to find. I was hoping we got the items off the bat once you became an adult, but nope. Unless it goes down to super cheap, I suggest you save your money and play the game as is.","September 12, 2014","true","18.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Lighting was improved, as well as minor details such as foliage, bumpmapping on armour and weapons. The character models recieved smoother animations, along with better voice recognition so the character mouths don't look so rigid or twitchy.  The lighting and shadows were also improved to give the overall look of the game a much greater atomosphere.\n\nSound;\nIf you notice one thing like I have, it's that most, if not all of the original sounds, from combat, ambient sounds, to the sound track, sound exactly the same as they did in the original and TLC. I'm glad they decided to go this route as to keep a sense of nostalgia. No use redoing what you already had done, right? Now don't get me wrong, a lot of the voice acting in the Original Fable along with TLC was attrocious by any means. They could have gone out and tried to rerecord all of the voice acting, but it's been several years since the original voice actors recorded. Also, it wouldn't be much of an "Anniversary" Edition with different vocals. I'm glad they decided to keep all of the original voices, because it brings back memories from when we played the original and keeps continuity.\n\nMod Support;\nLionhead has gone out of their way and addedgiven us a completely modable version of the game, even though it is quite limited as of right now. Just think of wht people could do. They could add entire new quests, create new weapons, new spells, new environments, and a plethera of other content. I'm waiting to see what the entire community has to offer .\n\nNow for the Bad.\n\nKeyboard And Mouse Support;\nWhen TLC launched for PC back in the day, it had a UI designed for PC users in mind. The in game menus had mull mouse support and you could rebind keys to fit your unique play style. This time around, they developed the game with Console controls solely in mind. Annoying and trivial key presses to navigate the menus, keys rebinding themselves or failing to bind after changing them(in my experience.) It's almost as if they want PC players to go out and buy 360 controllers for their PC's just to play this game. I hope they're able to fully reimplement Mouse Support in the coming updates.\n\nPaid Addon DLC;\nI can't really understand why they are doing this. It seems as if they're taking a page straight from EA's play book when it comes to addon Content. $15 just for some extra weapons/outfits that aren't even better than what you can find already in the base game? I can maybe understaing having maybe a season pass if they were to release some extra story missions, or even to have you play as another person in a paralell story. But that wasn't the case.\n\nLast but not least, The Ugly.\n\nReworked facial models;\nI can understand revamping the textures and models to utilize the newest technology, but they blew it when they completely recreated facial modles for most if not all of the main characters, including The Hero. All of the faces we grew to love and hate were completely scrapped and the one's we were given weren't all that good either.\n\nCharacter Progression;\nYes, The same hack and slash/Grinding for Experience mechanic is still there, but there was no deeper involvement than that. The same body types, from Slim through Obese, are still the only options. In some of the preview videos for the skill trees, The Hero can be seen as a person with near body builder proportions. But we don't really see that in the game(at least I haven't, if there's something I'm doing wrong in game, please let me know.)\n\nThis concludes my in depth review of Fable Anniversary. I would recomend this game to anyone enjoyed the first one who is looking for a visual upgrade, just don't expect anything spectacular.\n\n*This review is based soley on my personal perception and experience in playing the game. This review is not based on numers or facts, just opinion.","September 28, 2014","true","16.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I must say, the remastered version is superb!\nI've played a lot of the Fable TLC, back in the day, and I loved it. So, I had to buy the HD remake, even when I am low on money, just for the nostalgia, and for supporting Lionhead because lately they don't really trust PC gamers, so I wanted to help. And when I started to play I found out that the game is actually a really good fun. The combat the same, the silly dialoge and voice acting, but the graphics are more up to date(I must say, the old graphics made it a bit hard to love, but that's just me).\nSure, the game doesn't really looks like on the pictures here on steam, but it's still really nice and I like it, even a bit more the original.\nAnd sure, there are some keyboard problems, but It's good to see they are updating it now to make sure everything is just as nice as it could be.\nSo stop being so judgey all of sure.

I am  extremely interested in the history inside this fantasy setting, although I hypothesise that a next installment might cover this. Heroic mode, however, was mostly a rough start; acquiring a certain objective through a extreme amount of spawned enemies towards the ##spoiler boss was harder than that boss himself. In particular, the slow time spell is extremely powerful.\n\nAfter gaining competence in combat, I accumulated so many health potions that the shop exploit, where selling/buying/selling/cycles generate 2-3k gold per cycle, was accessible even in fable anniversary heroic.\n\nI can offer no alternatives for this; but I did greatly enjoy my first playthrough [heroic, good, archer] and started on a second [evil mage].","September 23, 2014","true","36.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

They did a great job bringing this game back. There are a few disappointing things, like the character faces look a bit too unnatural this time around and Oakvale has weird lag spikes when the hero is still a lad. Other than that, this game feels just about as satisfying as I was hoping.","September 24, 2014","true","8.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"
