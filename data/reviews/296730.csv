"http://steamcommunity.com/id/taylort210/recommended/296730/","taylort210","Wagglesworth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/taylort210/","3058 products in account","Viktor is a twin-stick shooter/platformer, with the unique ability to shift away from enemies in a way not dissimilar from Alucard in the classic Symphony of the Night. The difference here being that our hero actually teleports a short distance, allowing him to pass through enemy attacks, traps, and otherwise impassable barriers.\n\nThe ability to shift isn’t just limited to avoiding attacks, and serves in traversing the many perilous platforms and finding collectibles and upgrades, all hidden in only the most out of reach places in each of the 8 levels. The game takes a page from classic Mega Man game design, and allows each level to be played in whatever order the player chooses. But unlike in Mega Man, the bosses at the end of each do not appear to have any particular weakness to one specific weapon, nor does beating any unlock a weapon, so there is no repercussion to playing one level before another.\n\nAll unlockable weapons are found in the stages, either in a hidden away spot or locked behind a mini-boss encounter. Killing enemies can yield currency, which is used to upgrade your weapons’ reload speed, magazine, strength, etc. You can hold three weaspons at any given time, but it’s a shame that there aren’t more inventive weapon designs beyond standards like pistols, assault rifles, and rocket launchers, given the supposed inspiration from titles like Castlevania and Mega Man.\n\nRelatively short, the game’s levels could all be beaten in under 3 hours, tops. The desire to find all hidden upgrades and collectibles extends that time, as will any desire to take on the game’s hard and hardcore difficulties. Given that the title does not have separate save files, I’ve yet to sample the harder difficulties. As for normal difficulty, once you get into your groove, the majority of the game is fairly easy, with the boss encounters being most difficult, as they all consist of pattern memorization while you whittle away at their enormous health supply. I can only hope that the harder difficulties lead to more ferocious enemies and bosses, and not simply increased enemy attack power.\n\nAll in all, Viktor is tremendous fun. It isn’t the very best at what it does, but what it does is exceptionally entertaining nonetheless. Of the few similar titles that I can recall on steam (Bleed and Intrusion 2 come to mind) I can easily recommend Viktor as one of the superior. With several standout enemy designs, and a more than satisfying mix of platforming, exploration and gunplay, Viktor is a solid addition to anyone’s library.\n\n\nIf you have any questions about Viktor, leave a comment, and I'll be happy to try and answer to the best of my ability.","June 12, 2014","true","3.5"," 45 of 53 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","45","53","0","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gunslingerfry/recommended/296730/","gunslingerfry","gunslingerfry","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gunslingerfry/","816 products in account","Viktor is a 2D action platformer with 360 degree firing.   Shorebound Studios doesn't have the most amazing resume but this looks to be their first IP and it's feels like it was enthusiastically made.  I played exclusively with a wireless 360 controller.  I took a chance with this game and was pleasantly surprised. It's a pretty solid experience and it does some things very well. Some things... not so well. It's plays like a Megaman game and looks like a Castlevania game.\n\nHere's the nitty gritty:\nThe Good\n- The teleport dash is fantastic. It really feels good. The dash refreshes quickly and about 90% of the time it goes where I expect it. It was obviously the core mechanic around which the game was made (if not initially, then eventually). Cutting corners by passing through them and the snap through platforms feels really awesome.\n- The pistols feel good. Firing is definitely assisted but not overwhelmingly so. The aiming is sticky. If you let go of the right stick you will continue to fire in that direction. Initially it felt strange, mostly because I expected the character to face the direction of movement when not actively shooting. When I got over that, it lended itself interestingly. There are segments where enemies approach from the same direction and I was able to take them down while focusing on platforming.\n- Animation quality is excellent. Everything feels very smooth.\n- Each level feels unique and each boss feels unique. All of them have good pacing and frenetic action. Unique strategies are required to take each one down. The strategies are not obscenely difficult to identify and none of them feel cheap.\n- Alternate paths and secret areas are littered throughout and encourage exploration.\n- Enemies and bosses look cool.\n\nThe Bad\n- Normal movement feels off. The run speed feels too slow. Maybe I'm used to floaty jumping but you descend like a rock and it's especially noticeable since the teleport doesn't feel that way. Non-teleporting just doesn't feel like it's tuned quite right.\n- The art design no the levels feels nice and thematic but the areas themselves feel empty. I'm not looking for bullet hell levels of density but the spaces feel underpopulated.  Maybe it just needs more props/set dressing.\n- Lots of bouncy balls. The majority of the mid-bosses are bouncing balls of various types. Don't get me wrong, I like bouncing balls as much as the next guy but I think there could have been more variety.\n- The music is only ok. It didn't have me stopping to listen but it also didn't feel out of place. It was sufficient.\n- There are other weapons than the pistols but for the life of me, I don't see why. I have acquired the shotgun, rocket launcher, and grenade launcher. After using each for a few minutes, I was using the pistols again.  I will be blunt here. The weapons are unimaginative and underwhelming. They add very little value. Shorebound took some inspiration from the Megaman X series, to be sure, but failed to bring with it the interesting weapons that are so iconic of the Megaman games.  Each boss has a projectile attack that could be adapted to use by Viktor.\n- Boss difficulty is kind of all over the place from very easy to lengthy and difficult.\n-Viktor is the least impressive of the character designs.","August 20, 2014","true","3.1"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

Viktor has a lot of good ideas and elements mixing bits of contra, megaman, and DMC, but is hampered by poor execution. When the game is at it's best it's pretty damn good, but it is plagued by too many bugs, glitches and control problems in it's current form. Clipping into walls and getting stuck is the biggest bug that will cost you many a life due to no fault of your own.\n\nOutside of bugs it has some flaws including a damage recoil far too great for it's slippery controls to justify and needless use of a lives system (made especially frustrating due to the wall glitches eating up extra lives like candy) and a low item spawn rate that feels horribly imbalanced.\n\nThis game could be great with some more polishing but until it at very least fixes the serious wall bugs I cannot reconmend it in it's current form.","July 11, 2014","false","2.1"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","16","22","0","0"

The game is about dodging and shooting your way to the end boss then shooting him/her as well. You solve most of your problems by shooting at them actually.\n\nIt's pretty enjoyable, and the visuals are certainly pleasant. I would rave about the overall aesthetics if it wasn't for some of the earlier levels looking very dull and generic, but other than that, the character sprites are well illustrated and animated, and some of the later levels make up for the duller beginnings.\n\nPros:\n- (Mostly) Gorgeous game with top quality animation\n- Challenging with out being frustrating\n- Fun dodge mechanic\n- Shooting all the things\n\nCons:\n- Dull looking beginning levels\n- Can be arguably light on content\n","June 14, 2014","true","2.8"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

Enemy variety texture wise is lacking as most enemies appear in all the levels without a slight retexturing to make them fit more with the level but otherwise the game looks excellent and the enemy thing is nitpicking.\n\nGameplay (the only thing that affects my opinions of games)\n\nThis game is more or less a clone of Bleed gameplay wise but it does enough to differ itself from Bleed. When it comes to being a twin stick shooter it's excellent the dash to dodge mechanic is well executed and the shooting is enjoyable. The dodge/dash mechanic will allow you to phase through thin walls and dodge all projectiles and attacks quite easily. The Metroidvania elements leave a lot to be desired as the aren't that well hidden and none of the items you find are required to beat levels or find other items there's  also is very little reason to go back to previous levels to find stuff due to the lack of things to find so it's hard to consider this a Metroidvania. Platforming is meh there are a few areas where it does try to change it up but otherwise it isn't going to challenge you so there's no real benefits to using a controller. Now game breaking bugs are a huge issues as they're very easy to accidentally pull off and some will happen randomly and all require a level restart. First I ran into is when dashing into a wall at the wrong angle or if you're not close enough to phase through the other side you'll occasionally you'll be clip out of the map with no way back so you'll be forced to restart the level. One miniboss will (the one who bounces around) will sometimes during the fight vanish rendering the fight unwinable so you'll have to restart the level. On occasion a boss or yourself will get stuck unable to move and unable to take damage forcing you (you guessed it) to restart the level.\n\nIn conclusion Viktor is an excellent game and idea but is held back by a myriad of game breaking bugs that you'd expect in a pre alpha that should have been fixed immediately after discovery.\n\nI recommend that you buy heavily discounted or that you get Bleed instead.","February 8","false","4.6"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Wait... That's not quite right... Viktor has a very dysfunctional family in a very upbeat town. You have to help Viktor talk about past wrongs and...you see the issue here? There is kind of story almost like there is some noticeable bgm. But nothing of note.\n\nHowever what is kind of interesting is the bosses are each unique and Viktor himself has a teleport/dash mechanic to navigate/evade which once you get the hang of makes the game actually kind of streamlined. Easy/normal mode shouldnt run much more than 30-60 minutes and the unlockable weapons are purely optionable since your dual pistols do enough damage.\n\nReferences to Blood of the Werewolf and obviously Megaman since its a 2d sidescroller but I would note that there is not any obvious pathing. No boss is harder ♥♥♥♥♥ just... more annoying since there is no weaknesses? In my opinion I would put Shadow Caverns(Shadow) and the Twilight Fortress(Shapeshifter) as Easiest. Arid Wasteland(Djinn)and Frozen Summit(Frozen) as Medium and Molten Chasm(Demon) Sewers(Corrupted) Harder. Small hint for those having issues with Mephistopheles.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gomagomes/recommended/296730/","gomagomes","retrogomagomes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gomagomes/","378 products in account","Initially I've gave a positive review on this game, I felt very eager to grind through the levels and was curious to see the game has to offer. But as I progressed, I felt tiresome to continue playing it.\n\nAs I said on my previous review, the graphics are awesome, the soundtrack is very nice as well, the concept between the game is not bad at all aside from the cliché plot. You have a nice variety of weapons and few power ups which help you through the game. Also, the controls are fluid and I haven't had any trouble playing the game with my 360 controller.\n\nBut as I was progressing on the game, I've realized that Viktor felt like I was playing the same level over and over again. There's indeed a big difference between the levels, each level is an all different kind of world, but what makes them feel like the same? The design isn't much creative, the levels are just run/jump platforms/avoid traps/use your dash to pass walls/and such, in a very boring and linear way. About 60% of this levels you just run on a straight line and jump several cliffs to advance, and the fact that the enemies are the same in the entire game made the level run boring.\n\nThe levels are not much of a challenge, as the enemies don't change much. The bosses and minibosses are the real challenge of the game, but some boss fights  are just dull. You keep moving and jumping to avoid the attacks and keep shooting until the boss dies, but not in a funny way like the platformer classics as contra, metal slug, megaman, etc. On this games the bosses are challenging and fun, you walk all around the screen avoiding been hit, while on Viktor, you can move in a 2,3 inch radius on screen to avoid the boss' attacks and you're ok.\n\nOverall, I think this is a bland game. I wanted to like it because it looks like a neat game indeed. Maybe with more polishing on the level design and the traps surrounding the enemies, more different enemies to fight and a best utilization of the bosses environment (for example on the genie boss screen, there's not much room to move and the boss takes a big part of the screen, also he don't move a single inch) the game would be funnier.\n\nUnfortunately I woundn't recommend this game even to a platformer fan.","May 27, 2015","false","2.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

They are fun at the start, but some of them get boring when you get their hp bar to half, because instead of getting harder and more exciting, they actually get easier...\n\nAlso, some boss fights are the same from the beginning to the end. It's not that they aren't fun, but being a platformer twin stick and all, you kinda expect scenario changes/harder patterns when you get them to half of their hp.\n\nThe statues and shield bonuses are nice, they add a castlevania feel with the secret places and all, but I just wish we had more hidden secrets and better hidden areas.\n\nThe soundtrack is amazing.\n\nI wish we had more powers too. Most of the guns are okay, a few are extremely powerful and just removes any kind of challenge the game might give it to you.\n\nWe could use more enemies. Many of them are reused in every stage, with a few unique enemies per stage.\n\nWe could use a time attack mode and a scoreboard.\n\nZane is not well balanced. The stage is a piece of cake for him as he pretty much one hits everything. Some boss fights can be nearly impossible to him, though. But it adds a challenge, so that's actually cool. Boss fights get exciting again, all of a sudden.\n\nWith all this said, it is a decent game. It's actually a great game, being "Viktor 1". I recommend it, and I hope they make a second one with more content and better boss fights.","February 14, 2015","true","40.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It seems like they cloned the mega man meta without realizing why the specific elements they took worked.\n\n- Some bottomless pits are where you are supposed to go, some of them just kill you.\n- You can pick up different weapons somehow, but that is never explained anywhere, so there is no direction on where to go next. Is it money based? Are they in maps? The game doesn't say.\n- Health and powerups are all RNG based, ensuring you never get health when you need it or weapon powerups when there is anything to shoot.\n- After the first mission you unlock a mega-man style world map, but the basic gameplay upgrades are grinding based. So what map should you choose next? At least have a level recommendation on them or something.\n- The jumping is fine for parkour-like movement because it contains signfigant momentum. But then they throw jumping puzzles in there which are simply not fun. The main mechanic, your dodge/warp move, has an unpredictable movement distance.\n- The maps take too long to go through just to see how hard the boss is.\n- Bosses and mid bosses are bullet sponges with way too much health. You end up mastering a strategy or movement pattern by the time you have it at 80% health remaining, and then it's just endurance based. This is the main thing you have to use the levelling up to reduce so you can defeat some of the more hectic boss fights that are impossible to avoid damage from.\n- On top of all of this there is a timer which they use to give you a rank afterwords.\n\nYou can see that many of these design flaws are the same as mega man. Hower mega man had better platforming mechanics for jumping puzzles, and clearer game design to indicate where to go next. You could grind for health in mega man because enemies constantly respawned. Mega man contained 1up powerups, and powerups that were built into the level design which singificantly offset the 3 lives issue. Finally it was always possible to defeat a boss in mega man even if you didn't have the right weapon.\n\nThe TL;DR is the game devolves into trial and error very fast, and punishes you for it. It's basically all punishment\n\nThe art is passable, but not that amazing, It looks like it was all done by one 17 year old guy who just didn't have time to do everything since the game is huge.\n\nOne positive I can say was the sound design was solid, probably why I kept playing as long as I did. The metal soundtrack is nice and the bullet fire/enemy hit/death sounds have a satisfying punch.\n\nI hope they learn from this one though and keep making games, or continue to work on this one to make it "complete".\n\n","January 9","false","0.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

And you know what? I want more, it was really a short journey, but it was a good one.\nViktor is a mix of Contra and Castlevania series to me, it may be a simple game, but it has cool bosses, it has the atmosphere and it feels good to walk through the stages.\nSo, the good stuff:\n\n+The dark atmosphere\n+ Cool soundtrack. Really, I liked all the tracks in the game, oh those dark and melodic themes, I want more of this.\n+ Epic boss battles. Like in contra games, you have to learn their behavior patterns to win. And when you know what ypu're doing it will be a piece of cake.\n\nNow the stuff I didn't like:\n\n- The game is too short\n- Most of Sub-weapons are irrelevant. Twin pistols is all you need in this game, really. Well, Sniper-rifle is an exception. It kills everything in your path once leveled up\n- Common enemies design on stages is really bad. Would be cool if you encountered some more epic foes like I dunno, skeletons, giant vampire bats, zombies maybe, demonic creatures with wings etc. Blazing balls? little spiders? Flying eye-bombs? Little skulls shooting projectiles at you? Really? Those are lame\n- Levels should be more animated and interesting, they feel a little bit empty as of now.\n\nWell, it turnd out to have more minuses than pluses, but hey, I liked the game and I recommend it. I just feel that it had much more potential than this, if there ever be a sequel I hope the guys from shorebound will work on stuff I mentioned and add more interesting things ino the game.
