I usually go through the options but somehow missed this. For me it makes it an even greater experience.\n\nI was surprisingly drawn more and more into this the more I played. There's still plenty of things to discover, quests to finish and find even, as I sort of rushed the second half of the game and never came to a full personal and satisfying conclusion of the ending.\n\nMy second playthrough was really pleasant and fun, having a cautious, caring style and it was a genuinly great experience leaving me wanting for more still. A 3rd run will most likely be coming up soon to be honest.\n\nIf you like mystery games with great dialogues and choices, different endings and outcomes with albeit subpar and at times annoying stealth elements but the second playthrough made them much easier (and the gameplay can be a bit "too simple" perhaps) but with a lot of important reading, investigating clues and items, engaging in conversations carefully and "create your own path" style gameplay then do check it out!\n\nTo top it off the soundtrack is enjoyable as well, not many tracks I believe but with an ambient/downtempo genre, the main(?) exploration theme is dream-like almost so ethereal that it's out of place but it does actually fit into the mystery mood of the game.","March 28","true","8.5"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","15","18","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EdenStarGazer/recommended/424640/","EdenStarGazer","EdenStarGazer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EdenStarGazer/","429 products in account","A Steampunk casual point & click mystery that reminds us of what we like to love about indie games Karaski: What Goes Up brings back the simplistic, yet comical style of Papers, Please, but in a 3D exploration model of an airship.\n\nMinimalization:\nThis is a simplified adventure game with no cut-scenes or video, yet still in classic 3D format. You interact with various objects with simplified controls that do not get in the way of the action. This creates a casual game experience that allows you to just run around the ship and search for clues, without trying to keep up with key-mapping. Clues, maps, and data are all kept at hand for you to retrieve on demand.\n\nGame Mechanics:\nThere is a large stealth element. The sound effects become part of the detective work, as you find yourself listening for footsteps to grow louder and then quieter again to monitor the passing of guards. You are able to lean left or right to peer around doorways, with the camera angle accommodating your changed angles.\n\nDialogue Choices:\nI was surprised to see that not only did my choices matter, but even becoming suspicious by being caught snooping around caused me to be able to gain more info from shady characters like myself. The story line seems malleable to the character you create.\n\nNarrative:\nThe story is filled with references to Steampunk genre subjects; like technology, religion, and progressive utopian dreams of a “Scientific” society.  The player chooses from a variety of responses to each of these topics in conversation, ranging from agreeable, to snarky (Think Deponia.) The player character also is allowed to choose buffs at various points in the narrative to choose a focus on conversation, mechanical repair, stealth/breaking & entering, for example. In this sense the game reminds me of Deus Ex, though on a simpler level. You are also able to choose how to respond to being discovered. You are able to bribe the npc’s to look the other way, or you may choose to be a bully.\n\nGraphics:\nThe graphics are not as simple as point & click hidden object mysteries, or The Shivah.  Yet, it is not as complex as The Portal. It fits nicely in the same complexity of graphics as Stanley’s Parable.  Once I warmed up to the style of game, I soon became caught up in the story; probably because the ease of play facilitated simply doing the missions I was given. It makes solving the mystery enjoyable, rather than stressful, providing a lightly humorous spin on politics and revolt, with cartoon-style artwork.\n\nPros:\nMinimal & easy to learn\nHumorous\nWho-done-it Mystery\n\n\nCons:\nSimplistic Graphics\nLow complexity game play\n\n\nI recommend it for casual and family gamers. Overall, the replay-ability is average, with achievements for playing through the different branches of choices. The game is suitable for most age groups, and simple enough for even the casual gamer. But, it is not a game for hard-core gamers who like complex games. The achievements are simple enough to be mastered by most gamers. Many gamers could complete a play-through in less than 3 hours. (Longer required for mastery.)  It has cards and artwork.","March 6","true","5.9"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","15","19","0","2"

Each represented a core belief system; faith in technology, business, religion, and nationalism albeit to different degrees and even sometimes with a bitterness at the core.I applaud the creator's efforts at making a believable background and that each of the main characters is largely more than the sum of their parts.\n\nThe gameplay and aesthetics remind me of The Ship:In both games stealth plays a large role although with Karaski you are utilizing it much differently and are not meant to kill or be killed. Bribery,lockpicks, and even slippers which somehow smother your footsteps enough to render you completely silent are your tools to solve the mystery of who sabotaged the A.A. Karaski.At first it seems exciting to have to listen to the footsteps of stewards and guards in order to avoid detection, but there are many ways to mitigate any effects of being caught and eventually I got lazy and stopped caring.\n\nThe writing shows elements of wit and humor, but it never really feels tense or dramatic and at times those "big ideas" feel shoehorned in to the plot.\n\nThe game boasts of replayability and perhaps there is truth to that but I doubt I will be playing it again any time soon. It must be said that the current asking price is too high for what the game gives you, in the end.\n\n6.5/10, recommended to fans of casual point-n-click adventure titles.","March 10","true","6.7"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","15","20","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BirdCute/recommended/424640/","BirdCute","BirdCute","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BirdCute/","1507 products in account","Karaski: What Goes Up ... is a good-looking indie adventure game that is happening on an airship.\nIf this review is too long for you, I suggest you to only read the first paragraph about the game's content and the final verdict at the end.\n\nWhat is happening in the game:You are on an airship, but it has been sabotaged. You have to talk to passengers and uncover the truth about the mystery. The problem is that your suspicion is raising as well, so you could be the one accused of sabotage.\n\nPros:    Sounds | The soundtrack is really good, it fits the whole vintage airship theme. The sound effect (walking, interacting and environment sounds) are also very nice.\nGraphics | If you look at the Store page screenshots, you'll see that this game has a unique style. It looks really nice. I like their choice of fonts used for dialogues and animations. I won't say any more words, though, because I have no clue how I would describe how this game looks. All I know is that it looks nice.\nStory | Every adventure game needs a good story, and this game certainly doesn't fail at this. There are multiple choices you can make, from bonuses that help you, to dialogues that influence how much people on the airship like you. Based on what impression you give and what choices you make in the game, you can also get different endings. There are not a lot of adventure games that offer variety like this, so I'm considering this as a very huge plus.\nAtmosphere | This game invokes that mysterious atmosphere that I simply love. It's like a horror game without the horror element, it just leaves this tense and wonderful feeling when you're playing. This is mostly because of nice graphics and the soundtrack combined. Airship turbulences that shake your screen every once in a while also help a lot.\nAchievements | There are a lot of achievements. However, most of them don't unlock when you progress in the story you're playing, but are unlocked when you obtain certain items or do certain actions. This leaves a lot of space for replaying the game over and over again. Some achievements haven't even been unlocked by anyone yet!\nClues, Quests and Suspects | You have a special menu where you will find your current quests. This is really good, especially for people who tend to forget what quests were all about. There is also a menu where all clues are stored and another one where you can find everything about potential suspect on board. The more you learn about them, the more filled out the menu is.\nUpdates | The developer obviously cares about the game, as there are regular updates that fix a lot of bugs, add new features or improve some things. I had my problems myself that were fixed in the latest update, which certainly improved my opinion of the game. The developer is also very active on Steam Discussions, helping out players that have experienced bugs.\nPricing | For 12 $/€, I think this game is certainly worth its price. I've seen some worse adventure games for higher prices, so this one is definitely a good deal. More about this in the final section of my review.\nCons:    Linux/MacOS Support | Sadly, you can only play this game on Windows operating system. Support for other systems shouldn't be too hard to add, since this game is made in Unity and that makes multi-OS builds very simple to make.\nStealth | This is the most annoying problem for me. Sometimes I just feel like there are way too many guards around and they notice you pretty quickly. When they do, you have to bribe them, which uses up your entire wallet pretty fast. The game would be just fine with less guards, in my opinion.\nResolution Problems | When playing the game in certain resolutions, some parts of in-game menus may "fall" off the screen. This can only be fixed by selecting a different resolution, often even playing in windowed mode. I heard that this is getting fixed, though.\nThe final verdict:The game is pretty good. With its awesome graphics, nice soundtrack, a great story and other things it should give you the perfect adventure game experience. I especially liked the mysterious atmosphere, which just makes you play more and more. There are 50 achievements, which also add a lot to the replayability value. This is of course one of the things I use to decide whether the game is worth its price or not. Karaski is definitely worth it! It even has multiple endings and your actions really affect the gameplay flow a lot. This is a textbook example of "your choices matter" games.\nIn short, if you like adventure and point'n'click games, definitely consider getting this game. It's one of the best adventure games I've played in quite some times and it's constantly getting improved.\n\nGreetings,\nBirdCute\n\nNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes. However, this did not affect the quality and objectivity of this review.","March 11","true","6.2"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","12","15","0","1"

Chose yourself. Your past? Unknown. When you wake up from what seems to be the result of someone hitting you over the head, you'll soon learn that the airship has been sabotaged by terrorists. The fact that you were near the crime scene instantly turns you into one of the suspects, so it's only in your best interest to find the real saboteurs.\nA mysterios voice over radio gives you instructions, but who are they, and can you trust them? It doesn't matter, as you get thrown head over feet into a thick complot of either selfish, nationalist or economic interests. Everyone onboard of the airship seems to have is own motives for turning this first ever airship flight into a disaster.\nOver the course of the game your main activities consist of talking to the various crew and passengers, scavenging for evidence, breaking into rooms, bribing or sneaking around guards to get into prohibited areas. If you aren't careful, your suspicion level will rise and your dialogue partners will be a lot less cooperative. Stealth is a big part of Karaski, so thankfully the game provides you with various tools like lockpicks, vent openers and more to make your life easier.\nPros:\n- interesting characters with their own stories and motives for sabotage\n- pretty & atmospheric art style and music\n- various endings\n- nonlinear, mission based gameplay\n- very intuitive UI with tabs for suspects, clues, inventory and missions\n\nCons:\n- sneaking can get dreadful at times, esp. if you have to find that one item in the middle of a prohibited area\n- no spoken dialogue\n- lots of running back and forth\n- relatively few usable items\n- very open ending\n\nWill you find the true saboteur(s)?

I enjoyed the developer's previous title Postmortem, but it had many problems and the gameplay wasn't all that entertaining. However, they fixed all of that with this game.\n\nSTORYThe story is inspired by classic whodunit novels by Agatha Christie. You play as a Sir/Madame who partecipates to the first flight of the Glorious Commonwealth's airship. However, one day someone knocks you over your head and you wake up in the ship's lower deck, where someone sabotaged the engines and killed a guard. You find a two-way radio from which someone mistakes you for an Agent, and it orders you to discover who the culprit is.\nAs a fan of mystery novels, I loved every aspect of this game, from its mysterious setup, to talking with all the different people who are on the ship (passengers, bartenders, workers) and to the outstanding and satisfying ending where you will choose, based on the clues you found, who is to blame for damaging the ship. There are also political subplots, conspiracies, spies, and a lot of lore to further help you in your final decision.\n\nGRAPHICSThe game is developed with the Unity engine, and it looks pretty darn good. It uses cell-shaded characters and locations for a more cartoonish and light-hearted feel. The areas that you explore feature some great steam-punk architecture and furnitures, and I loved exploring every inch of the map, from the Crew Deck to the Private Lounge and Bar. The only real issue is the walking animation of some characters, which looks more like they are floating rather than walking.\n\nGAMEPLAYYour goal is to find enough clues by exploring the different decks, talking with the other passengers and picking up objects. Some areas of the ship are off-limit, which means that you must stealth your way through them, avoiding getting caught by guards. If they ever manage to tackle you, you can either pay them or talk your way out of it, otherwise a Suspicion Meter will start rising, and less and less passengers will start believing what you say to them.\n\nCHALLENGEThe game is not all that hard, but even the slightest mistake (getting caught by the guards when trespassing, disagreeing with some you're talking to,...) will make you lose trust, and every character will start suspecting you of being the saboteur. However, if you are even slightly familiar with stealth games, you won't have that big of a trouble avoiding guards.\n\nSOUNDThe soundtrack is really good: I really enjoyed listening to the music that was coming out of the radios, and, while it is royalty-free music, it further immersed me into this living and breathing world. There are however a couple of sound effects, especially when going to the ship's maintenance rooms, that are extremely loud and annoying.\n\nREPLAYABILITYEvery time you play the game, there are different choices to make that will change the way other characters react to you, as well as a different culprit based on the clues you find hidden in the environments. There are also newspapers and letters that fully explore the game's universe, and many Steam achievements to unlock.\n\n\nOverall, Karaski is one of the better detective games I have ever played thanks to its interesting dialogue and layered characters. The focus on choosing how to get different information and the stealth section also improve the enjoyment factor, delivering a full experience that will satisfy fans of mystery and stealth games.\n\nStory: 9\nGraphics: 8.5\nGameplay: 9\nChallenge: 7\nSound: 8\nReplayability: 9\n\nENJOYMENT: 9\nFRUSTRATION: 3\nFollow me on Twitter: @nickygra97\nSubscribe to my channel\nLike on Facebook\nJoin my Steam group","March 3","true","3.9"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","11","15","2","1"

What a sensational way to go from one part of the Commonwealth of Danube to another. However, on the third day of this exceptional trip, you will wake up in an unfamiliar room with a rather strong headache (well, someone knocked you on your noggin pretty hard –that’ll do it!).

The story is very well written with great dialogues. As you interrogate people, you will be able to choose several options available to you. Depending on your response, it can affect your relationship which each person. At the start of the game, you will not have anything on you and you will not be able to open certain doors until you manage to get the “ lockateer”  tool.

This did not influence my review in any way.\n\n==========================================================\n---------------------------------------OVERVIEW-------------------------------------\n==========================================================Karaski: What Goes Up is a first-person exploration adventure game, very similar in graphics and general feel to the Ship.\n\nYou play a passenger on the maiden voyage of the Karaski: the first airship built by the Glorious Commonwealth. But something goes wrong only days into the voyage and it falls to you to investigate and find the culprit, with the assistance of a strange voice on the radio.\n\n==========================================================\n----------------------------------------QUALITY-------------------------------------\n==========================================================Graphics - The graphics have a consistent feel to them, but they seem a bit dated, with simple, blocky models; fairly bland and sharply mapped textures; and occasionally wooden animations that sometimes seem to cause NPCs to become stuck on world geometry.\n\nSound - Music and most sound effects are good, with propaganda-style music playing in various areas that brought a smile to my face. Footsteps, though, which you'll notice a lot while sneaking on metal surfaces, sound particularly bad, like someone banging on a pipe with a hammer.\n\nGameplay - The gameplay seems to me quite similar to the Ship, but single player only and with a bit more focus on stealth. Controls are typical FPS (mouse to look, WASD to move, CTRL and Space to crouch and jump, etc), and for the most part it moves quite well, although given the relative scarcity of objects and simplicity of most of the world geometry I was a surprised that it stuttered a bit in places.\n\nThe game is played entirely on board the Karaski airship after some sort of sabotage. You must roam the corridors and explore the rooms of the various airship decks, keeping on the lookout for guards. Through exploration and conversation, as well as using a small number of objects in the right places, adventure game style, your task is to uncover the perpetrator while also deflecting suspicion from yourself.\n\nKaraski plays more like an exploration game than an adventure game, though, but you'll need some FPS skills to successfully sneak past all of the guards without getting spotted and reported to the ship's captain. Unfortunately the stealth sections don't feel that natural to me, with world objects sometimes completely hiding you from view and at other times seeming to make no difference. Having recently spent a few hours playing Styx: Master of Shadows, I can't help but think the stealth system needs a bit more work.\n\n==========================================================\n-------------------------------------PROS & CONS------------------------------------\n==========================================================Pros:\n+ Interesting setting that I found cynically amusing, sort of like Papers, Please\n+ Multiple plot turns that depend on decisions you make, promoting replayability\n+ Lots of achievements, further promoting multiple play throughs with different goals\n+ Trading cards\n\nCons:\n- Stealth is a big part of the game, but could still use some work\n- Somewhat dated-looking graphics; some frame rate stuttering in long hallways\n- In-game text could use some proofreading. It's better than many indie games, but I caught a handful of errors in my first few minutes of play\n\n==========================================================\n--------------------------------------CONCLUSION-----------------------------------\n==========================================================Karaski is one of those games that's hard to pin down. I've played it for a few hours and I'm generally interested in finding out what happens next. The game world is interesting and darkly humourous, and I want to see where the story goes. But the stealth side of the game is a fairly key focus and it's not that much fun, especially when parts of the game have you travelling through large prohibited areas with multiple guards.\n\nIt's a good game, but with a bit more work could be a great one.\n\n6/10\nFor more recommendations by LL's Game Giveaways and Reviews on quality indie games or ones with high potential follow our group curations here!","March 2","true","3.7"," 17 of 27 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","17","27","3","0"

A genre once thought dead, or at least dormant got an injection of adrenaline from two sources: Double Fine (helmed by veteran adventure game designer Tim Schafer) and relatively newcomers Telltale. But giving those two fine companies ALL the credit for the resurgence of adventure games wouldn't be fair. Others have also done an amazing job keeping people interested in the genre. People such as the fine guys over at Cardboard Computer or Unbound Creations. Today we'll be talking about a game released by the latter (who also released the most excellent Postmortem: One must die)\n\nKaraski: What Goes Up... is that game. The interesting thing about Unbound Creations is that their games don't focus all that much on puzzles, QTEs or life altering decisions. They instead chose to focus on people and small, personal stories. Karaski is a game about a magnificent airship which has experienced a catastrophic accident. But that's not really it... It's a game about the people in that airship, their motivations, their small quirks and what they did before they got onboard.\nAs an agent for an unknown organization you must discover what happened to the airship and who's the saboteur (or is it you?!) In order to accomplish your objective you can sneak, talk, intimidate or steal stuff. But there's nobody there to tell you exactly what happened, and nothing is set in stone. Your actions will dictate the ending, and you will decide what happened by yourself, after hearing what the characters have to say, or obtaining the information by other means. It's a game designed to be replayed, and in many ways it works similarly to a choose your own adventure book (or a Way of the Samurai game)\n\nWill you discover what happened to the magnificent airship Karaski?

A. Karaski. When I joined this miracle of technology, I was excited with curiosity, how it works and what I’ll experience during the flight. I actually thought that I would spend the entire journey in a bar on the upper deck sipping fancy whiskey with casual conversation. After boarding, I picked up a boarding pass, introduced myself to a guide of the airship and headed to my cabin. Well, was just going to, because just around the corner I somehow fainted and my plan was screwed a little. A lot.\n\nI woke up in a store room somewhere in the lower deck. I was glad I’m alive, my head screamed with pain. When searching for a way out, I just remembered that the guide told me something about, that I will question a lot of people on various issues and it will depend a lot on what I’ll know about them. I would rather know, how to get out and complain to the captain, what happened to me. I want an apology and a big glass of whiskey! Right in the next room it became even weirder. There was a turned on radio speaking to me. So, the thing is, there's someone on the ship, who does not want it to reach its destination. And I'm here to solve this question. OK, well, but who is it and what he wants to do? And there are apparently wardens to immediately lead me out or arrest when they spot me.\n\nSo I crawled around the first warden through a ventilation shaft and ran into the next room. I have discovered a wounded technician, broken ship control panel bursting with fire and acid bottle with a glove near it. Someone wanted to sabotage the ship! I went back to the radio and was told that it could easily be me. Such stupidity… I had to find out what is really going on and who is to blame! I ran up on deck and immediately met Jean, enthusiastic journalist. All passengers apparently felt the turbulence and thinks that something strange happened to the ship. She asked me to cooperate in the investigation. But could I trust her?\n\nI had to explore the entire ship, avoiding guards, sometimes even bribing them not to report me, pick locks into the private rooms, search the crates with cargo, scuff my knees in the air ducts, but also talk to all the people on board… one of them had to be a saboteur. Sometimes it wasn't easy, I had to share a bottle of booze with them and to force them to talk. It seemed that it had to be one of the big four, Mrs. Boyel, that weird doctor, designer of the airship Karaski or even the captain? And then these lost parachutes... I felt at the end like Hercule Poirot, but I found the person who was responsible for this ... I think so at least. Or was I wrong?\n\nKaraski: What Goes Up, is a smoothly playable mix of steampunk adventure with stealth action, where the main thing is well written story with deep characters. Nonlinear progress and stylized graphics help to desire to explore all parts of the game and also thanks to multiple endings and achievements it’s fun to play it repeatedly. The only major drawback I see is the absence of voiceovers, which decreases immersion a little. Lift off!\n\nThis review is part of the Steamified Community Review program.

It’s an indie adventure game that was awarded strong praise in some corners of the gaming press back in 2013. It was praised because it had well written and nuanced characters. Unfortunately not everybody on Steam appreciated that game and thus it has only received mix review scores. However, the development studio that made that game is Unbound Creations and they are back with Karaski: What Goes Up. It certainly appears that they’ve listened to the constructive feedback, both good and bad, from Postmortem and have put the lessons that they have learned into execution here. This is an adventure game with plenty of action and of course the characters are again written superbly.\n\nAt the very beginning of the game you are told something that is clearly ominous. You will be asked many questions. However, the correct answers are the decision that you make. The truth is woven by your decisions. Each of your actions has an impact and consequences follow. I’ve always enjoyed games that do this if they are able pull it off without making the player feel that regardless of the decisions that they made the story and its outcome would have remained the same. It’s incredibly difficult to make it work. To this end I believe that Unbound Creations really did well with this in the game.\n\nThe game is set upon an airship – the first ever airship in fact – and somebody has sabotaged it. You are potentially a prime suspect due to your proximity to it when you awoke from the concussion. The good thing is that it is entirely up to you to determine who did it, why they did it and how they did it. The great thing, in regards to replayability, is that there is more than one solution to the game and by that I mean that unless you play the same way – choosing the same options – you’re never going to play the same game twice.\n\nThe  graphics and the sound featured within Karaski are certainly apt and aide immersion. They’re not state of the art by any means but they have been carefully chosen. They follow the principle of ‘KISS’ – keep it simple stupid – so as to not take away from the game play, the story or the mystery of the game which are the clear and decided focuses of the game. The graphics are almost cartoonlike in stature and you’ll be able to notice this from the very beginning as you walk through the exhibition on the way to getting onto the airship.\n\nIf adventure and action wasn’t enough the game also introduces a well thought out stealth mechanic. When a steward, the doctor or other members of the ship can see you you need to be careful. If you get caught going into places where you should not be your level of suspicion will rise. This has a lot of impact on the way people will see you on board the ship. You may even find yourself being found guilty of a crime that you didn’t commit. It really is a great touch.\n\nA feature on Karaski would be remiss if I failed to mention the humor. It’s present all throughout the game and helps provide the game a certain charm that really aides the player in wanting to continue playing the game through to the conclusion. For such a serious matter the lighthearted presentation really works. This is an enormous strength and demonstrates the depth of the writing to see beyond the base layers. There is humor and delight to be found in even the smallest of matters.\n\nA rock solid adventure game with stealth play, a lot of well written humor, deep characters and a great narrative. Karaski: What Goes Up ticks all of the boxes.\n\nFor similar reviews and our popular daily giveaways visit http://www.steamified.com/\nPlease feel free to join our wonderful community on Steam","March 9","true","8.2"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

While it is a genre that has never had huge mainstream appeal, when done right it creates quite a compelling space.\n\nCONTROLS (3.5/5)\n\nKaraski is a social stealth game and plays a bit like a blend of a fairly basic stealth title and adventure game. Its stealth mechanics are not deep or refined, and mostly consist of making sure you’re out of line of sight before you do anything risky. That being said, the options available are generally more than adequate, though not mechanically interesting enough to be a reason to seek out the game.\n\nAdventure elements play like most other first-person adventures, running around talking to people, digging through their personal effects for doodads and currency, and occasionally using what you find to get more access to the plot.\n\nGRAPHICS/SOUND (2.5/5)\n\nAs a low-budget affair by a small development team it should surprise no one that the visual side of things isn’t very impressive. Karaski is visually Spartan, favoring big and exaggerated geometry in the level designs over small details.\n\nCharacters designs are similar, with ornaments like hats and beards distinguishing characters more than unique faces. I’d found there could also be some strange judder with the game when mousing over objects that could be interacted with.\n\nThere’s no voice acting, which can be a little distracting, but it does allow for characters to have a wider range of dialogue. Music seems highly inspired by the type of tracks you’d hear in old propaganda pieces and fits the game’s tone rather well, even if it does little to stand out.\n\nSound effects are a bit hit or miss, with footsteps drowning things out a bit too much, though it does make for good positional cues when sneaking around.\n\nGAMEPLAY (3.5/5)\n\nThe airship Karaski is taking its inaugural flight as a demonstration of the might of the glorious Commonwealth, a fictional stand in for the U.S.S.R., and the player has managed to snag a ticket. As you are boarding, however, you are quickly bopped on the head.\n\nFrom there on you can make the story your own as the game allows you to play it as just a temporary knockout, or perhaps it gave you amnesia. Soon a mysterious radio is asking for your help, offering another opportunity where you can also play along or craft your own backstory. The game is full of little moments like this that allow you to fill in the blanks of your past.\n\nRegardless of whatever backstory you decide on, the main thrust of the plot has the player investigating the mysterious sabotaging of the ship. It seems someone doesn’t want the flight to be a success, and there are four prime suspects: the architect Karaski, whom the ship (and thus the game) are named for, the rebellious ship captain, the religious doctor that sees mankind flying as a sin, and the train magnate that could view airship travel as competition.\n\nAt the start of the game you’ll get to choose a tool you fancy, and these significantly affect the gameplay. A fake police badge will get you out of trouble and might coerce information out of people, while a lock-pick will get you into the many locked rooms you’ll find in the course of the game.\n\nMost of these items can also be found later in the game, but some are well hidden. During my first playthrough, for instance, I never found the item that lets you unlock and navigate vents, which closed off a few story beats.\n\nPlayers are given relatively free rein to explore the ship, provided you can uncover the tools needed to get there, though there are a few choke points in the story. Many things you do impact the fates of the various characters, so even if you’re given a side-quest that you think is helping, the effect of completing it may end up doing more harm than good.\n\nKaraski’s stealth mechanics are probably the least interesting element of the game, with the story and the ways you can change it being the strong point. Wisely there is no combat or death if you get caught; instead you’re ejected from where you were trespassing.\n\nYou may be able to bribe your way out of trouble, though if you don’t, your suspicion meter will rise. That can affect the way characters view you. Some actually seem to like a bit of a nasty streak, and might open up more, while others will consider you with disdain.\n\nWhile the story is enjoyable, it does feel a bit more limited compared to other standouts in the genre like Consortium or Last Express. There are only a few characters, and events are more oriented around the player rather than everyone sort of having their own life.\n\nThis makes repeat playthroughs less attractive as, while the tools of the trade change things up a little from a gameplay perspective, the story doesn’t appear to have much to offer beyond the end sequences.\n\nThere’s also some lovely end credits that players get to explore rather than watch, including an extra room that showcases elements of the game in an alpha state when the art style was much different.\n\nOVERALL (3.5/5)\n\nWhile Karaski: What Goes Up… is a bit rough around the edges, both visually and mechanically, it does offer a good mystery story with a variety of ways to approach it.","June 4","true","4.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I set my hopes a bit too high. I love mystery adventure games and really believed that maybe we have something new going on here.  What I experienced was nothing short of mediocrity wrapped in a blanket of promise. First let me say that the premise of the game appeared to be Agatha Christy like and that appealed to me. I thought I would give it a go.  At first it seemed like it was going to be a fantastic mystery but then things became monotonous and unchallenging. There is a plot here but it does not really matter at all. Lots of boring dialogue with very uninteresting characters that made the game feel more of a chore than a challenge. No puzzles or enigmas to deal with. Then we have the the stealth part that is nothing more than listening to footsteps. Really nothing here that I would call over the top.  There is no challenge, there is nothing at all actually. Very mediocre attempt at making a good experience.","March 7","false","23.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

If you'd like to read our full review, you can find it here: https://www.universalgamingreviews.com/karaski-what-goes-up-overview-and-review/\n\nI had a lot of fun with Karaski: What Goes Up, I'm also a pretty big fan of mystery type stuff so I knew I'd enjoy it before going into it.\n\nThe game is a who done it type mystery game where you must solve a mystery revolving around the sabatage of a commonwealth airship. You do this by exploring the airship, collecting clues, conversing with the 4 suspects and ultimately choosing who you think is the perpetrator. The game is open ended in nature so your actions during the game have an impact on the outcome of the story.\n\nThe game also incorporates some stealth elements too but they aren't punishing in terms of consequences. If you happen to get caught exploring areas you're not supposed to you can try to bribe the guard to look the other way but if you don't have the coin they'll report you to the captain and your suspicion level will go up. If your suspicion level gets too high the crime may get pinned on you in the end so you'll have to be careful.\n\nThe game is a lot of fun and only takes around 4 hours to complete and up to 5+ if you discover everything the game has to offer. Definitely a game that's worth checking out if you're a fan of mystery type adventure games.\n\n-Shaun Meyers (Kyo Akiara) out!","April 8","true","3.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/altered_confusion/recommended/424640/","altered_confusion","Altered_Confusion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/altered_confusion/","289 products in account","Take to the skies in this whodunit mystery. You will take on the role of a passenger on this one of a kind airship, but something has gone wrong. The airship has been sabotage, but who has done it. Was it you? Will you be able to uncover who did it? Will you be caught snooping around and have everyone expect you of doing this heinous act?\n\nIn Karaski: What Goes Up... this is exactly what you'll be doing. You will be playing through the game with your main mission being to get to the bottom of the mystery of the sabotage, but there are other quests that you can take on to perhaps pry information from other passengers. In this game you will have the chance to bribe guards to look the other way, entice passengers with the promise of alcohol, and of course gain tools that will allow you access to different areas of the ship.\n\nI'm going to be honest when I first picked up this game I didn't really get into it. I was really just running around the airship aimlessly while getting frustrated, but when I tried again from scratch and really tried to sink my teeth in I found a game where I didn't know what was going to happen next. There is definitely the need for stealth in this game, and early on I got caught ALOT. Thankfully as I played more and more of the game I was able to develop strategies of how to move around the different sections nearly undetected.\n\nThis game was a lot of fun, and there were plenty of clues that you had to be on the look out for to help solidify your case against the evildoer. There were quite a few repeat clues scattered on the ship as well, but something tells me that these locations are just the places where random items are placed so that you can experience a unique playthrough each time you play. That's right folks the person who did it in one playthrough might not actually be the the person who did it, if you were to play it again.\n\nGraphically there was definitely a good art style going on, however sometimes it did come off as cookie cutter in certain areas where the same assets were used over and over again. Not surprisingly it was mostly the NPC guards that were all the same, the boxes/trunks around the ship, the different bedrooms, etc. Sure there is going to be duplication of areas and items in real life, but I just feel like there should have been a little more for a personal effect in the different people's rooms.\n\nOne of the things I always hope to see is voice acting in the game, unfortunately this game does not have that component, and there are sections that have pretty lengthy conversation pieces that after a while you just want skip through and hope that they weren't too important. However that's usually when there's something key in finding out who did it.\n\nThis game might not be for everyone, there's definitely some rough spots to the game, and as I just stated there is A LOT of text to read at certain parts of the game, but I did enjoy playing the game, and I think many people out there would enjoy it as well. This game gets an 8.0 out of 10.","April 14","true","8.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
