I got turned on to it because I found out a long time MTG pro named Brian Kibler was one of the driving forces of this game.\n\nThis game seems to be one of the best games to limit the amount of randomness that can happen in games that have a resource system. You get to play 2 cards a turn (as long as they have targets when applicable), discard your hand at end of turn and draw 5 again. Whenever you play a card a leveled up version goes into your discard pile which gets reshuffled into your deck every 4 turns. So there's a neat strategy in which cards you play and when. Most cards have 3 different levels (with some having 4 and some that are just 1 but that get buffed based on what turn it is). All combat takes place in lanes (5 of them) which creates some interesting strategy.\n\nYou can buy packs and gold in the game but you don't have to. You only need to win 3 games a day to get all the special bonuses (which include packs/cards and silver) and you also get tickets for tournaments. My favorite game mode is there version of draft. You start off with 6 cards that are figured out based on a logarithm of which cards get picked higher. No waiting on other players to choose their cards as yours are all generated just for you. It's a nice approximation of a traditional magic drafting but without having to get 8 players gathered and without waiting for others to choose their cards,","January 18, 2015","true","389.1"," 39 of 45 people (87%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","87","39","45","5","1"

I ended up just playing proxy decks with my friends, but no longer showed up to tournaments/etc. Magic the Gathering is just way too expensive to play, as the cards rotate out of standard too quickly. Extended/Modern is even more expensive to play if you don't already have the cards from when they were in the Standard rotation.\n\nSo then Hearthstone came out, and I started playing it. Had no cards so I was playing zoolock/hunter (when uth was broken). Nax came out and I didn't wana spend 20 dollars on it, so my decks stopped being competitive and I quit for about three months. GVG came out, bought packs with gold i had saved up. Still wasn't competitive. Decided to buy Nax for 20 bucks. Turns out Sludge Belcher/Loatheb win games. Also mad scientist pretty much needed in every hunter/most mage decks. Then Blackrock Mountain came out. I haven't bought that one because i don't think it brings anything to the table besides Thaurissan/Flamewaker/Quickshot. I have a pretty good set of legendaries and have fun playing the game, but that is only cos I sank a lot of time into it since it came out of beta. Everytime I try to get a friend to play it, they get turned away by the inability to acquire cards for free. The quests require you to win games, which is really hard with the starter cards, and you will only get a pack every 2-3 days assuming you do the quests. The arena, at 150 gold, is prohibitively expensive for new players, and since theyre inexperienced they usually go 0-3. You don't get to keep the cards either.\n\nNow to solforge. I started playing this game a couple of days ago and I have to say it's great. A lot of the card abilities seem to be Magic abilities with a name change, but that's fine. What is great is the ability to be able to play it for free. Completely for free. You get a pack just for logging on every day. You get another pack after three wins every, which can be against the computer. Free packs for no reason.\n\nBut card packs aren't what make this game, it's the drafts. To get into a draft you need 3 event tickets. You get an event ticket for your first online win of the day, every day. That means you have to beat a guy, but you will probably get wrecked if you're a new player with no cards who hasn't mastered the game yet. What I recommend is you make a second account, and every day you make the accounts play each other and get an event ticket on each. That way you can draft 2 out of every 3 days (one day on one account, the next on the other).\n\nThe drafts are like in Magic. You open a pack, pick a card, then the computer passes you their pack, which is now missing a card. Maybe I'm biased because of my Magic experience, but I much prefer this to Hearthstone's "pick one out of 3 cards" method. Anyway, you get to keep all the cards that you draft, so it's really easy to build your collection.\n\nThe first few drafts I played were stomps. I went 0-4 multiple times, but it is nowhere nearly as frustrating as the first few arena fails in Hearthstone because you keep the cards. You also get 3 card packs for going 0-4. The game is extremely friendly towards new players.\n\nAssuming draft is not for you and you want to play constructed, you can just go to solforgeladder.com and sign up for the unheroic ladder. This means that you play against other people using only commons or rares, no heroic or legendary cards. Commons or rares are very cheap to craft. I was able to craft an unheroic netdeck on my third day of playing just from the login rewards. Of course, I still got destroyed because I wasn't used to the game mechanics yet, but at least I knew that it was my fault and not the fault of my poor cards. Losing mirror matchups in unheroic ladder made me realize ways in which I could improve my play, which ended up boosting my draft win rate.\n\nSolforge is truly a free to play game. Way more accessible than Magic/Hearthstone\n-Paper card games like Magic are definitely pay to win and prohibitively expensive.\n-Hearthstone isn't really free to play due to the single player adventures, which require you to shell out cash. You can be competitive if you grind Hearthstone without spending money, but you would have to be some sort of arena wizard or grind quests for months.\n\nCONS OF SOLFORGE\n-the client is ugly. super ugly. Hearthstone is extremely beautiful in comparison.\n-Some mechanics are ripoffs from Magic\n-The unheroic ladder has long queue times unless its nighttime in the US\n-There are like five people total who play this game (draft queue times are almost instantaneous though)\n\nStill, greatly recommended over Hearthstone. Really don't understand why this game is so shunned.","June 22, 2015","true","89.2"," 25 of 27 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","25","27","0","0"

And I'd been eagerly awaiting the full release for a while.\n\nWhat did I expect?\n* Some bugs removed.\n* A way to manually sort decks.  It used to auto-sort A-Z, so you had to number your decks to sort any other way.\n* Better card search options.  Especially across levels.  That is, you were only able to search for the wordings on the level 1 versions of cards.  This meant you couldn't search for, for example, the cards that are 'free' at level 2 or 3, because those cards have no text at level 1.\n* Larger 'at a glance' cards or an option for at a glance text overlays, so you could easily read what several cards do, side by side.\n\nWhat did I hope for but not really expect?\n* Extra stats for cards.  Especially stats for which decks they're used in.  I love having multiple decks (essential for solo play), with as much variety as possible across decks.  Ideally, I like each deck to have entirely different cards from each other deck.  This is almost impossible if you have 10 or more decks, because there's no way to remember which of the hundreds of cards you've already used in another deck.\n* More solo options.  At the very least, developer designed decks to play against (some of which could be based on previous community decks or tournament winning decks).\n* Better AI.\n\nWhat did we actually get?\nNONE of either my hopes or expectations.  In fact, quite the opposite in most cases:\n* Loss of even the automatic A-Z sorting.  So now my decks are just a random jumble.\n* Loss of the ability to even VIEW the level 2 or higher versions of cards at a glance.  So now you can't even skim across the cards to try to spot which are, for example, 'free'.  You have to click on each, one by one... yeah, through hundreds of cards.\n* Not that that point matters now, because in addition to that, the text has been removed from the cards entirely.  The only way to see the text is to click on them and have a pop-up tell you what it says.  So there is now no way to compare cards at a glance.\n* AND the cards are actually SMALLER!  Most of the screen space has been given over to the background/playmat, with the cards as tiny, shrunken little things in a small section in the middle!\n* The random deck options and 'quick play' option for solo battles have both been removed.  Now the only solo option is to choose two of your own decks, one to play with and one to play against.  Not nearly as fun as randomised choices.\n\nOn top of all that:\n* MORE bugs, not less.\n* Slow loading times.\n* Slow in other ways too (eg. it goes through a series of mini-freezes when opening new packs)\n* Multiple other problems just for iPad versions, that aren't a problem on PC (eg. right-click options; and scrolling that doesn't work).\n\nSo... what was it all for then?\n* Shiny silver background.\n* New card format.  Shiny, sci-fi style.  Bright lines around the edges.  (All negatives for me: The sci-fi style doesn't suit the more fantasy oriented setting.  The bright lines distract from the art.)\n* Over the top special effects, like packs blowing up instead of opening; and the whole deck flying around the screen when it's time to level up.\n\nIn sum, the only 'improvements' are all flash and no substance; the game is now frustrating on PC, almost unplayable on iPad, and certainly unplayable on anything smaller than a standard sized iPad.  Major disappointment, for a game with so much promise.","June 1","false","5.0"," 26 of 30 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","26","30","0","4"

The company behind it is rather high on themselves because they had a few big names behind their game, and so they charge outrageous prices for things, and have little value for customers because the entire game was kickstarted, meaning all of the money they make afterwards is more or less entirely profit due to the low maintenance cost of digital card games, and most of it being data being pulled from a database. They don't do any form of maintenance between large updates. Most games have a weekly downtime for a few hours to fix bugs, and add improvements to interfaces, or make the game flow more smoothly, not this. They only update when they have content that they can monetize, such as a new handful of cards, which leaves existing bugs present in the game for months. They have a difficult time managing the iPad version with the PC version, and both appear to be neglected at times because of it, though personally I can not speak for the mobile (phone) version. They had closed beta last for the better part of 8 months, the first six of which involved literally nothing for the player, you had the same demo decks for six months. It was technically longer than that, since it came out shortly before Christmas, but i'll round down because I don't have the exact dates, and frankly don't care enough to get them. Then, in the summer following the closed beta, they come out with their first set of cards, and go into open beta, but they give a brief window of just a few days for any of the closed beta participants and kickstarter backers to spend their store credit after having nothing to do with it for the past six months, and post it in an obscure section of their forums to even announce that it was happening. Nothing on steam, nothing in the client, nothing in the announcement section of their forums, and nothing on their homepage of their website. They did announce it on twitter once or twice, though. So if they happened to be the only people you follow, you may have seen it after having no reason to look at their page for six months. Personally, I chose to read that as trying to squeeze what value they could out of even the players who backed them before the game was even a demo, but read what you will into it.\n\nGameplay: If you have ever played Magic: The Gathering before, this game is incredibly simple to pick up. The mechanics in the game are outrageously simple; and many of them actually exist in Magic under other names. That being said, imagine one of the game rules in Magic being changed so that a Wheel of Fortune was cast every turn. All of the multiple-turn decision trees, and all of the long-term strategy would be removed; and that is exactly what SolForge did. You get a new hand every turn, and with no resource system, you are instead limited to how many cards per turn you can play (two, aside from a few cards enabling other cards to be free here and there, but two is the default by game rules). So you have a hand of five cards, and can play two of them, every turn, forever. With a new hand every turn. Which basically equates to you have five cards to choose from, but the game state usually dictates which of them are the best to play (if you're behind on board, or if your opponent has a creature you have to kill or you lose, that sort of thing) which leads to very few decisions actually being made by the player. Early game, of course, you have the options of what cards to play in order to level them, sure. But you have a relatively high chance of never seeing the leveled version when it matters again, which happens far more frequently than you'd think.\n\nWhat the mechanics equate to, at this point is: Level your important cards, and level answers to your opponent's important cards. If you draw your answers to your opponent's cards, while they don't draw answer's to your cards, you win. The opposite is true, as well of course, but it creates for very little interesting gameplay, without ever having any complex board states, or very many things you can due since you can (almost) always only play two cards per turn.\n\nAll of that being said, I didn't mention their failure to balance anything outside of a large update, and even then, there is rather little of it going on. They don't do any balance changes until they have their large updates (which has averaged once every four months or so, thus far). Which means if something is overpowered, it is overpowered for a while. And if something is garbage and unplayable, it is that way for a while. The game is stagnant, and in a bad place, and it won't get better for a very, very long time, if at all. They couldn't even balance for draft, as everyone who has drafted more than twice can tell you exactly what the best factions are in order, and what cards among them matter. And once you know what cards you have to draft to win, it boils down to who draws what cards, and when they draw them. There is no concept of: "First turn, i'll play Dude A, and then the next turn i'll play Dude B that goes really well with Dude A" because you have a high chance of not even drawing Dude B, and in the next combat phase, Dude A is dead.\n\nAnd then you have the lazy game design. All sorts of RNG where it really isn't needed. Not just in the Wheel of Fortune every turn. Not just in whether or not you drew a leveled version of a card. It is a huge factor in draft, as you aren't guaranteed any cards of any specific rarity, and once you choose two factions, you have no say in what you get beyond that. It gets even worse; though, because they have it literally invade their cards. There are currently 10 cards that have built-in randomized effects (random amount of damage, random movement, etc); which to me, is just lazy design. And that's not counting cards that only have things happen at certain times (upon leveling, for example) which is - in a way - pseudo RNG in the sense of it's much stronger on certain turns than others (An example of this would be one card that if you draw it the turn before you level, you can play it and have it end the turn with twice as much attack and health as on any other turn). Even better games implement some RNG on their cards, Magic for example has cards like Mana Clash, but the percentage of the total card pool is much lower, and it is almost never on very relevant cards (due to the whole future future league testing a set for two years before it's released publically).\n\nAll in all, the game itself is okay. But if you play it as strictly free-to-play, you're going to have a highly negative experience, as there is no built-in way for you to not be paired up against someone who has played for over a year and has every card, as opposed to you with just starter cards. And if you play against their AI, you miss out on the most relevant reward for the daily system, which is only given for an online win. All in all, I can't very well advise anyone to get into this game. There are better alternatives for your money and time, but this is just one person's opinion.","February 19, 2014","false","217.2"," 137 of 222 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","137","222","0","3"

I'm not talking technical issues either (allthough it has those), I'm talking major design flaws in the game itself. I've been playing Solforge for some time now, over 200 hours so far, and while this game has the usual balance issues, and other minor technicalities associated with an early release game, the real killer (and why i no longer play) is the rediculous tedium of having to wait...and wait....and wait...and wait some more just to take each of your turns. For some ungodly reason your given 20 min per game each for a total of 40 min, but no time limit on each individual move, so you find yourself quite often que'ing for a game, about 20-40 sec, loading the game screen, about 5-10 sec, THEN STARING AT YOUR MONITOR FOR LITERALLY 15 MINUTES WHILE YOU WAIT FOR YOUR OPONENT TO MAKE THEIR FIRST MOVE!!! But here's the real pinch, the game also allows you to create what seems to be an unlimited amount of games running at the same time. So not only do you get people who enjoy letting the timer run from 20 min down to 3 min before they make their first move, or people who "give up" by simply moving to another game and letting what remains of their 20 min timer run to 0, but you also have to contend with the fact that in 95% of all Solforge games, your opponent will without a doubt have at least 3-4, maybe even 7-8 other games running at the same time, which means while your making moves in 10-20 seconds, your opponent is take 4-5 minutes per move because they're jumping from game to game, and not actually even in your game looking at the same screen you are. This to me is a MAJOR design flaw, and a source of a lot of complaint and debate on the Solforge forums. When you actually get lucky, and happen across another player who seems to only have the one game open like you, and moves are happening in usually less than 30 seconds or so, then the game is actually quite fluid and enjoyable, to the extent I'd even spend real money on it to bolster my collection and "finish off" a few of my decks. But as it stands you spend far to much time doing nothing but staring and waiting. Not cool. In fact its just plain boring and quite frustrating. The Dev's say the official release is on the horizon, and i pray they dont leave the game the way it is, because the "influx of people" they're hope'ing for wont stay for long i can assure you. Which would be a real shame, this could be such a great little game, but for now, ill be off playing something else.","July 20, 2015","false","208.3"," 28 of 35 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","28","35","0","0"

It sets itself apart by being made by ex Magic and by having a unique take on things. As an example. You have some lanes and each card can take up one lane.  Once that card is in the lane, you cannot move it (unless it has movement) until it is destroyed.\n\nIt is unique in that sense. The game revolves around a hand of 30 cards, cards come out each turn and stay for the duration of the turn. You have no mana costs so you can throw down any card in your current hand in any free lane (or no lane depending if it is a spell card (up to 2 cards per turn)). But each card does have a level. As you level up, so do your cards. And each level makes them stronger.\n\nAs said it is F2P, so you'll be expecting the costs of the game. Well there really isn't any. You can play and enjoy the game "as is". Each day you login, you get free silver and a free booster pack of cards. You can spend silver to get boosters or misc items. And if you really start to feel the vibe, you can lay down some actual money on gold. Which is not needed to enjoy the game. I have been playing for a few hours and I have to say, I log in each day, and claim 3 victories against the computer for my goodies and enjoy every minute of it.\n\nEnjoy the game for what it is, a F2P game that wont rip your purse from you.","April 25, 2015","true","26.7"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","17","18","0","0"

Some reviews claim this game is pay to win. It is not. If you think about it any TCG is "pay to win" at the start. You should never start playing a TCG with the belief that you're going to be on par with players that have played several weeks more than you, it doesn't work that way. This is the nature of any TCG. You can't believe that you will be able to beat any player with more experience and invested time than you in any TCG with your starter pack. Be it an IRL TCG or a computer TCG.\n\nLet's compare SolForge to some other TCG's like Hearthstone and Scrolls. In all these three games you can pay real money for booster packs. Does that make them pay to win? Well, maybe. But let's compare them to some IRL TCG's... NO WAY! You pay MONEY for CARDS that may or may not be better than mine!?!?!++ PAY TO WIN!!! PAY TO WIN!!!\n\nYou see how silly this becomes? Yes, a core element in a TCG is that it IS pay to win. But in all the TCG's I mentioned above there is the option to "grind" for in-game gold that you can buy cards for, and doing casual drafts in SolForge will surely get you started!\n\nAnother complain I've seen is that some reviews claim RNG is a major part of SolForge. I'm baffled.\nIn SolForge you play with a deck with 30 cards. You are allowed to have 3 copies of a single card. This means that you could make a deck of just 10 separate cards (such constistency!). In SolForge you discard your hand (5 cards) and draw a new hand every turn (in which you may play 2 of them). This means that you in theory can go through one copy of each of your cards in just two turns, and there are a lot of cards with good synergy!\nCompare this to Hearthstone. You can have 2 copies of a single card and a maximum of 30 cards. This means 15 different cards in your deck, minimum! You can also only draw one card every turn (with some exceptions). This means that you would need atleast 15 turns to go through each separate card in your deck.\nIt does not take a math genius to tell the difference between 2 and 15...\n\nExcept from this the whole "So much RNG"-point is strange since RNG is a core element in any TCG. Some TCGs have more and others less.\n\nTLDR; Do not listen to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t reviews, try the game because you may or may not like it.","January 24, 2015","true","30.3"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","20","24","2","0"

Currently the game is in 'free mode' (cheap ingame currency purchases, no real money purchases allowed, rollback after a certain point). After that rollback and some time with the game, I will revise my review posthaste.\n---\nSolForge is a digital collectible card game created by Stone Blade Entertainment, prior Gary Games and creators of Ascension: Chronicles of the Godslayer. Taking experience from their previous game and Richard Garfield's work on Spectromancer, SolForge has the same kind of fluidity of a deckbuilder (though not the main construction mechanic) and combines it with lane based combat. What results is a fairly decent game; proper planning and foresight is required to secure the game. There's no traditional resource system, and instead players must manage a limited amount of card plays each turn to both gain control of the board and level up their cards for later turns. It's a unique mechanic that takes fair use of the digital space, and although it's not readily intuitive it offers a lot of flexibility in card design and deckbuilding, as not all cards are equal at all levels.\n\nThe system itself is problematic in a number of ways, though. Each player's hand consists of a new set of five cards each turn. Fresh hands each turn are nice, but occasionally you can get a raw deal that breaks the rest of the game (the dreaded five spell hand). Further more, even with a thirty card deck, you only see about twenty cards per rank (every four turns), meaning you can end up missing key cards that need to be leveled. Drawing leveled cards on the rank is required; especially at rank 3 and beyond, leveled cards are drastically superior to their lower leveled counterparts, even where cards are designed to be low-level monsters. It's a flaw adapted from Ascension's design of first come first served powerhouses. It's not serving of a strategic game to have such drastic swings in ability due to chance, and though it usually isn't the norm to draw a stinky hand in a well constructed deck, when a player draws a perfect or perfectly trash hand, the effects are felt for the rest of the game.\n\nOutside of the gameplay itself are a myriad of other problems, mostly rooted in its initial offering as a mobile formatted game. There's no right clicking anything: Every interaction is done through a series of clicks and drags. Sometimes those 'gestures' change between screens: Double clicking to zoom in game would instead add or remove cards in the deck builder. Elements of the game lag, as if the client does no work in handling gameplay. It's poor optimization all around, and has been around since the very beginning, and this game has been in development for quite some time. Worse yet, and quite possibly the most sinister flaw to ever be unaddressed is the in-game timers for each player. Instead of going with a sensible, scalable turn timer, each player gets 20 minutes minimum to take all their turns.\n\nExpect every win to cost you 15 minutes of your life. There is no end to how many times this is abused outside of moderated events.\n\nNo game of SolForge ever legitimately takes the entireity of a player's clock, and of course the whole reason the clock still exists to this day is not only poor optimization burning away seconds just to execute one of your two card plays (and god forbid if you can do other things in a turn), but is voraciously defended because of the game's mobile roots, to allow players on poor connections to enjoy the game, or so it is justified. No other card game, to my knowledge, no matter how complex it is, uses a death timer over flexible turn timers. This flaw alone, that you're constantly playing chicken with trolls over the clock's function, ruins any sense of reward and competition the game brings. The multiplayer component, core to the dueling card game experience, is completely obviated by a dumb design decision. Any other space, any other game would punish you if you simply got up and walked away from it to waste the time of other players. You'd likely get banned over unsporting conduct.. SolForge never discourages it. It's the other player's burden to bear.\n\nThe clock is in fact the core reason I do not recommend SolForge. Everything else is overlookable. The interface isn't good at all, but it is borderline functional at least. Getting a bad turn ruins the game, but that's simply what you buy into with these kinds of games. Nobody should have to monitor a game where nothing is going on for fifteen minutes just to declare victory. It's a poor point in the game that the developers have overlooked, an inconvenient problem for them that they'll never address, and it'll bleed out their playerbase down to the patient saints and the sinner provocateur. It has lost me, and I'm saddened to have lost the experience of this game to this albatross hung ceremoniously around SolForge's neck.","September 19, 2014","false","116.9"," 28 of 40 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","28","40","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Yverthel/recommended/232450/","Yverthel","yverthel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Yverthel/","146 products in account","Early Access Review\n\n3/23/14: When I originally wrote my review, SolForge had a very strong pay to win aspect, as getting competetively viable cards without paying real money was a major chore. With the latest update however, the severity of that chore has been greatly reduced.\n\nThey have added the ability to trade in your unwanted cards for silver, buy single cards for silver, increased the amount of silver you earn from daily rewards, and perhaps most importantly greatly improved the boosters you can get for silver, giving more cards with a better chance for decent rarities (and thus qualities) of cards.\n\nTrue, you'll still progress faster and be more competetively viable if you pay real money for the game, but it's now much easier to build a competetive deck without expending real money.\n\n--Original review follows--\n\nSo there's 2 questions to ask yourself before starting to play SolForge:\nDo I want to pay money?\nDo I want to be able to compete?\n\nIf you answered yes to the first, your fine. If you answered no to the second, you're fine.\n\nIf you answered no to the first, yes to the second... you might want to go elsewhere.\n\nDespite what some want to say in their reviews, SolForge IS a Pay To Win. Yes, you CAN get everything without paying a dime. You CAN build a competetive deck without ever spending money. But you CAN also get a publishing contract that turns in to a multi-million dollar franchise the first time you throw a manuscript at a publisher.\n\nSolForge is a pretty nifty CCG, with a mechanic that can only really exist in a computer version. Every time you play a card, it gets better for the next time it comes up. Which is cool, but slightly gimmicky. If you ignore that quirk, it's standard fare:\nPlaying field is 5 lanes. Each creature played attacks the opponents critter in the same lane. Attack Vs. Health. If there's no critter, opponent takes the damage instead.\n4 factions: Necromancers (Nekrium), Druids (Uterra), Elementalists (Tempys) and Technomancers (they're not as fun as the elves from Spoils do I don't care). Each deck can contain 2 factions.\n\nDeck building is the best part of the game, and the worst. You build a deck of 30 cards and see how it fares against other decks. It's cool! And you can get the currency to buy boosters by playing the game? SCORE!\n\nExcept only the basic (3 card) booster can be purchased for Silver... if you want one of the larger packs with a better chance of good cards you have to either pay money or get lucky.\n\nOutside of paying real money, there are 3 ways to get cards:\nAt 'achievements' each day you get a reward, which is anywhere from 1 card to a standard booster pack. These points are: First log in, First win, 3rd win (including against the computer).\nAt each of those noted points, and after beating players, you earn Silver, which as mentioned can be used to buy the 'basic' (3 card) boosters.\nTournaments, the first time you beat a player every day you get a 'tournament ticket', for 7 tickets you can enter a tournament... and probably lose miserably, but you get cards for playing at all.\n\nNow the problem with this, is the odds of beating another player when you're on a free to play deck is ... not great, especially not early on. So when you're starting out, unless you want to throw money at the game, you're pretty much stuck beating the computer 3 times a day to get your rewards, and constantly trying to build a deck you can actually compete with.\n\nIt is a pretty fun game though, with interesting potential deck synergies and some cool cards. Decent enough way to pass the time.\n\nIt is also worth noting that whilst I consider SolForge Pay To Win, the price point of cards is not at all unreasonable. It is perhaps slightly high when one considers that they're entirely digital and if the game goes away, one is not even left with cards they can look at or use to play with friends.\nA 3 card pack, with a chance to open to decent things is $.25 (or can easily be earned in game)\nAn 8 card pack, with a guarantee of decent things and a chance for awesome things is $2 (and occasionally can be earned in game)\nA 10 card pack, with guaranteed awesomness (1 legendary, 3 rare, 3 heroic) is less than $12\n(prices assume spending $20 on gold, spending lower amounts will lead to slightly higher prices, while spending higher amounts will lead to slightly lower prices)\n\nIf one compares this to a real CCG, one will find this just as easy to spend stupid amounts of money on in the hopes of getting the perfect cards for your deck, but also much easier to spend very little money on.","February 13, 2014","true","81.8"," 33 of 50 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","33","50","0","2"

One is Ghox other is Yuru. \o/)\n\nSo after 4 months  i still think that game is the best Digital Card Game on the market (after trying Hearthstone, DOTP, DOC, IW, Scrolls and HEX). Stone Blade Entertainment is doing an amazing job with pumping new sets, cards regularly.\n\nIn this 4 months, i only spent 5-10 bucks per month and i have competitive decks now which can be used in constructed tournaments. For card games with paying that little and having some competitive decks is great because we all know that card games are expensive hobbies in general.\n\nAlso, realized that i didn't praise enough how the game has an amazing art. I don't know how they keep pushing that level quality of artwork with every set but they are just beautiful, amazing.\n\nI criticized the UI of Solforge in my first comment and it's still the same. But at least, we know that devs are thinking to improve it. Here's a mockup from them: http://imgur.com/a/NNxYN\n\nIf you're looking for a good card game with a mature community (one of the best communities i've seen in any game), best DCG artwork in the market with some fresh game mechanics and huge potential, there's still one choice, Solforge.\n\n\n\n--------\nNewbie here who just started Solforge and playing it for a week. I read reviews to learn what people think about the game and most of them say that the game is pay-to-win and as a guy who have been playing Hearthstone for a long time and got nearly all the cards in the game, i didn't ♥♥♥♥ing understand how Solforge is P2W.\n\nComparing to Hearthstone, game is much more generous. You get silver for every win, you get a huge amount of silver for every 1st and 3rd win and 1st online win. Opened a few booster packs (pack of 6 cards) and saw that possibility of getting legendary or heroic cards are much bigger then getting an Epic or Legendary cards of Hearthstone.\n\nForging/Crafting cards are also much easier than Hearthstone's dust system. And think about it, even daily login prize is ~2000 silver and you can buy a common card for only 150 silver (rare for 1400). By just loging in and winning 3 -specific- games in a day, you can buy 30-40 common cards or 3-4 rares.\n\nTo put it simply, game economy is much better organized than both Duels of Champions and Hearthstone i think.\n\nAlso I'm playing with Starter packs mostly and i won many matches against those decks with lots of heroics or rares. Game is not P2W not just because of getting packs is cheap but also you can create good decks with common cards too.\n\nOne problem of the game is UI, especially the lack of native full screen mode.\n\nOther than that, game is great; yeah, really. Leveling up the cards is a great idea and i felt like i'm playing Heroes of Might & Magic III. Game is fast, fluid, fun  and being able to play multiple games at the same time is a good idea too.\n\nGame is also in early access state for now but i hope player base will grow because it has big potential.","June 22, 2014","true","728.7"," 24 of 34 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","24","34","0","0"

It's an interesting ccg, lots of fun to play, but the gap in power between legendaries and other cards is a bit much.

I still can't recommend it to others though, for the many reasons already listed in the negative reviews.  I really only draft myself, and running into players that run the clock down so often kills the experience.  Having to to wait 15+ minutes to be able to move on to the next draft game about 1 out of 8 games is very frustrating.\n\nI'm a free to play player, and they time the new releases to come out just as the last release finally comes down to the regular silver (in game currency) price.  So if you want to try and play with the big boys you either have to pay double silver for the newest Legendary cards or spend money.  I'm not sure if it's power creep or not, but the top decks always have the newest cards in them.\n\nThey recently lowered the tournament payouts again to make it nearly impossible to go infinite in draft as well.\n\nIt's free to check it out, and if your personal play style (expectations) might fit with the game, so it's probably worth the time to take a look, but I wouldn't feel right recommending Solforge in its current state","February 17, 2015","false","711.4"," 23 of 33 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","23","33","0","0"

Save it up. Sell your extra cards for silver. Use the silver to buy legendaries.\n\nLegendaries cost around 140,000 silver which can seem daunting, but if you "rare draft" (draft the rarest cards you can every round) you can sell them all for quite a bit. A really good draft can net you 35-40k silver.\n\nDon't start the game and expect to play constructed PVP in the first week. or first month.

There just aren't that many cards when it comes down to it, which means that strategies are limited. This is something that can be improved as the game develops.\n\nCurrently, the metagame revolves around a battle of attrition where the person who has the cards that offer the best value win nearly every time. Cards can offer value in terms of what they add to the board state or how difficult they are to deal with. Synergy is not nearly as important as raw power. Anyone who has played this game knows how absurd Echowisp is for example. Everflame Phoenix is essentially impossible to recover from once it gets online. The design of these cards just don't lend themselves to comebacks.

The cardplay is innovative; cards you've played in earlier rounds  get stronger  and 'level up' in later rounds. This adds a great deal of strategic depth as ones must decide whether to trade off one card's immediate utility against another's future 'leveled up' usefulness. I've seen a great many deck types have success, and the available drat-style games are different enough from the constructed variety that there's a great deal of fun to be had here. Why then the thumb's down?\n---- One design decision alone: When a game starts, each player is given 20 minutes to complete his game. Usually, at the start oif a game, eaxh player moves relatively quickly. However, when one player appears to gain an advantage, VERY often the other will begin to use the time on the clock as a strategic resource. By this I mean, you'll play 10 turns in fairly rapid succession, each using only a minute or two of time. Then, one player pulls ahead and then will wait 10-15-17 minutes for the other player to move. He may be hoping you'll have lost interest, or just to catch you unawares, attempting to win via boredom what he cannot through skill. This effect is compounded by the fact that one can have a large number of games open at one time.  In constructed deck play, you are rewarded daily through three victories, and sealed deck takes 4 games to complete. Ineither style, prepare to devote majo amounts of time waiting, staring at an unmoving screen, before you can finish up.\nApart from this, the game itself is well-designed and fun to play., It is possible to be competitive without spending real money, though it can take a little patience. The trade-off here is cash vs. time to build reaonable decks, but the mechanic is fair. No real complaints on that score.","December 20, 2015","false","054.8"," 16 of 23 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","16","23","2","0"

I won't waste time describing the same issues others already have:\nTimed and untimed matches encourage abuse. Trolls either wait until the clock is about to run out before they play, or they leave untimed matches sitting there until the opponent concedes to get rid of it.\nA single mediocre draw basically ends your game because there's no way to catch up once you're behind\nThe interface has obnoxious inconsistencies (i.e. Double-click does very different things in differet screens)\nVery laggy performance, especially in the deck builder\nMany other issues...\nInstead, I'm going to focus on a single point that has grown to end any chance of the game being playable for any incoming player. At this stage, there's no realistic way to compete with players that have been around for months because their decks are loaded with the rarist cards in the game (legendary and heroic). Catching up at this stage would require an investment of several hundred, or even thousands of dollars.\n\nI've played dozens of people, to the point that I see certain names often enough that I know their decks and what to expect; and every card in their deck is wildly more powerful than almost every card I've been able to get in more than a month of play. At this point, I'm pretty sure the only people still active in the game are long-term players. The few new players come in briefly, see how much of a mess it is, and promptly leave.\n\nIt's a complete waste of time to invest in this game, even if the balance issues are worked out, the cheating/trolling is curtailed, and more players join.

Pure and simple.\n\nLuck plays too big a part:\nThe 'luck' factor is way to high. With that I mean the chances of one player drawing lower level cards (consistently) and the other player drawing higher level cards is devastating in any match. No amount of strategy or color of cards can make up for that. I dont base this on 1, 2 or 3 matches but many matches and draft tournaments.\n\nThere is simply no telling what u get but u can be damn sure the opponent gets better cards. U try to improve the odds with cards like 'meta transfer' or 'technosmith' and other discard and level up mechanics but the result is still the same... the chance u get lousy cards late in the game are simply too damn high... getting your first lvl 3 card(s) in round 3.3 or later is going to devastating for any match especially if the other guy is playing them from the start of 3.1\n\nServer connection:\nThere is also the server connection. For any online cardgame to work u need a stable connection. At the moment however that  stable connection is not there. To many times during a tournament the error message is shown that the client is unable to communicate with the server, frequently resulting in a big amount of lost time that u dont get back...and could mean the difference between winning a match or losing.\n\n9 second refund:\nThere is also the point where u get about 9 seconds back after each turn to make up for slow connection between u and the server but it also means u can play whole rounds without losing any time at all...why have a maximum playtime if u are goimg to build in a way to cheat the given time? Something to look at for sure!\n\nAll in all this game could become a favorite of mine but for the moment with the above mentioned problems being what they are... this game is irritating as hell...\n\nI will keep playing though in the hopes of it getting better but for now the tournament is off limits due to the extreme luck or bad luck u generally have as a player!","July 27, 2014","false","355.4"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","2"

Everyday you get two packs from dailies that often net you a few commons and some rares and an occasional heroic.

These three can be completed in less than 10 minutes and will net you the regular ingame currency, new cards, and a booster every day.  If you win an online match, you also get an event ticket which can be used in various tournaments, including a booster draft where you get to keep the 30 cards you use.\n\nOn the down side, the cards I've seen so far point to this being either pay to win or patience to win.

Graphics aren't everything for sure, but this game looks like it could've been made a few years ago as one of those completely free flash games.  While playing Solforge I've been trying to look past it, but unfortunately this game has too many parts that seem to have been totally overlooked.\n\nMy biggest complaints:\nNo tutorial that goes beyond "drag and drop to play your cards, press these obvious buttons to end your turn, here's a quick explanation for the leveling and rank system, here's how spells and effects sorta-work, good luck!".  The game doesn't really explain the various factions in any form or the way that thier ally abilities work, now does it go on to explain any sort of basic strategy in this game at all.  There's so much missing for a game that's already a year old.\n\nThe card balance is pretty bad.  There are several cards that are simply better than other ones.  There are several clones of Zombie Soldier that have the same stats as well as an added effect, for instance.\n\nThere's no undo button, which is pretty vital for a card game.  You can't undo any actions whatsoever.  This is especially annoying when you start to realize the full potential of the battle and turn phases being seperated.\n\nThe interface as a whole isn't as streamlined as it could be.  It works better than most games that have recently come out, with thier 20 buttons and 50 menus at least, but it's much nicer to click on a button that says "settings" over fishing around for a cog symbol....\n\nThere's only 4 factions, and no lore.  I don't understand why factions even exist except to have those little ally effects, but almost all of the ally effects pool into Tempys so they don't matter very much.\n\nThere are too many similar cards, except for spell cards.  The spell cards tie into my aforementioned gripes about the card balance in this game, where one faction has many powerful spell cards while another faction has some OK ones to get by on.  I could understand it if 1 of the factions had particularly strong spells and particularly weak creatures, but this isn't the case.  Because half of the monsters in this game could be clones with very minor stat differences.\n\nIn summary, I'm glad that I got these starter packs in a huge Humble Bundle, because I would have regret my starter pack puchase if I had not.  I'm going back to Infinity Wars, I'll take its' more punishing economy over this game's less fun, less explodey, less varietal gameplay.","January 28, 2015","false","2.9"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","10","14","0","0"

Now as a gamer one has to think what is the value I am getting for my money. When I compare the value I have gotten for my money from current master of digital CCG's Hearthstone one has to conclude that Solforge is a ripoff in comparison.\n\nThere are a few reasons for this lack of value:\n\nA) The rewards for tournaments are weak for example one has to win all matches to get enough game's F2P currency of silver to play another.\n\nB)The rewards for playing the game are at most an insult i.e. you will get 100 silver per win and less than 10k for dailies and you need 60k(casual) or 140k(competative) to enter a draft so you do the math.\n\nC)So as the prices of everything are beyond reach of F2P currency one has to spend a lot of money in order to actually play the game and then feel bad as you will probably lose at the tournament and get nothing for you money.\n\nNow obviously as I spent over 70 hours on the game I actually liked the game mechanics, but come to realize that I like roller coaster rides as well but doing them daily is just not economically viable.

I wanted to like it, especially since it has an Android port which meant I could play it on the go.  Something Hearthstone has just recently added.  The single player vs AI is smooth and decent for trying out new decks and getting daily rewards.  However, the problem, and why I have to say not recommended, comes from the abyssmal responsiveness and overall laggy feeling of any actual multi-player game.  I have a feeling since it has an Android port, even on the PC it doesn't stay connected to game servers and only periodically communicates.  In multiplayer games that seems to be when you finish your turn or your opponent finishes theirs.  Occasionally I've seen part of an opponent turn, then wait 30 seconds, then the 2nd part of their turn.  I guess they needed to think.  It feels very rough and unfinished and doesn't stand up to Hearthstone or MTG.  I wanted to like it.

As a card levels up it gets better. You can play two cards per turn and discard the remainder (so they go into your deck but don't level up) while drawing 5 cards at the start of your turn.\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nYou can't hold cards until they're strategically useful, you just have to play what you got.\n\nMid game is dominated by level 2 and level 3 cards as neither player will have access to them.\n\nLate game is entirely dominated by level 3 cards and the loser is often whoever has less rare cards available to them.\n\nThe limit of cards played per turn makes cards that grow in power amazingly good, or cards that can deal with multiple cards.\nThis means that with the correct combination of spells it's easy to quickly create a giant creature that's unkillable and will win you the game.\n\nOf course with the correct combination of spells it's easy to dismantle that strategy but c'est la vie.\n\n\nSo is this game fun? Definitely, the mechanics are fun.\nIs this game worth money? Definitely not. While the mechanics are fun and interesting they don't really reward skillful play, many games will be lost to simply drawing level 1 and level 2 cards when the opponent plays two level 3 cards and then two more the following turn.\n\nWorth a bit of fun if you don't care about winning/losing for no apparent reason.","November 25, 2013","false","29.3"," 14 of 23 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","14","23","0","0"

While on average a legendary level I card is somewhat more beneficial than non-legendary one, it usually isn’t in a game breaking way; it is at end game when level III is achieved that the P2W aspect manifests in full, and games come to an abrupt end, virtually always at the expense of the non-whale without red star cards.\n\nSo one can break open their wallets and start enriching their decks with reds (but don’t be surprised if you just end up losing in turn to a larger whale) or try to enjoy the game with the exclusion of legendaries, smartly avoiding the overt monetization mechanics by immediately dropping from matches when a legendary comes into play; if one is a small fish in a sea of whales you are going to have to accept that you'll be taking the whale bone frequently, and don't expect the devs to step in because they designed the F2P game to foster just that feeling of unjust frustration on the loser's part, and the thrill of crushing victory on the whale's side.\n\nSo since the whales are paying to keep the game afloat, the freebie players need to respect that and give them their due, but one should feel absolutely no responsibility to get ridden for longer than necessary. Just immediately concede and get on with a balanced match in spite of the SolForge dev's intentions. By analogy I wouldn’t find it entertaining to join in a seven card stud tournament, where I am restricted to five cards; could I win, perhaps, but obviously the cards would be stacked against me, so why bother?\n\nI do like seeing the non-heroic/non-legendary player sponsored tournaments in the forums, but of course even their existence points to the ugly pink whale in the middle of the room.\n\nThis last day of playing, even among decks of comparable strength, I found the sheer luck factor was too much for me to ignore. We have all been there where in late game the opponent is playing out III’s and II’s and by the chance of the draw we get a hand of I’s which stinks to lose in such a way. Conversely I can’t help but to feel sympathetic when I just played out a couple of III’s and the opposing player blocks with two level I’s; you kind of want to send them a “sorry” emote.\n\nLastly I think such power disparity fosters a virulent community of frustrated players that in my experience won’t think twice about walking away from a match to slowly let the timer run down once the realize they lost, as if to say ♥♥♥♥ you.\n\nGive me a B2P CG where everyone has access to all of the cards, and I’ll pull out my credit card happily, but there is no way I am going to constantly ride the red legendary dragon FTW! ;)\n\nhttp://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/195806/chasing_the_whale_examining_the_.php?print=1\n\n","February 18, 2014","false","250.3"," 30 of 54 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","30","54","0","0"

Then I was lucky enough to open a Tarsus Deathweaver from a booster pack, forged 2 more, and built a whole new synergy-based deck around it. Only commons and rares, a couple of heroics and no legendaries. It worked literally awesome, I won 80% of my matches even against players with better cards overall.\nAfter a while, I felt, I'm being paired agains players who had spent a bunch of money to buy the same starter deck 3 times (since this is the most reliable way to get legendaries). Now, I can only win 20% of my matches because in the other 80%, my opponents present more legendaries in their first 4 turns then I have in my whole collection.\n\nYou might feel tempting to buy legendary chests. Once you spend money on the game to play better constructed deck, you are part of the big grinding. The daily rewards are far not enough to get good cards.\n\n\nOn the other hand, drafts are suprisingly good. The system works differently than anything else I've ever seen. You draft alone, which means no other players are involved in your draft procedure, thus you can draft in your own pace. Once you drafted the 30 cards, it becomes your deck and you are now ready to play your matches. However, you don't need to play them on the spot! Play them whenever you have time. If you're too tired in the evening, you can draft the cards and play the games on the next day or whenever you want. This means you  don't need to spend 1-2 hours to draft and play at the same time.","August 17, 2014","false","46.1"," 20 of 35 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","20","35","0","0"

There is always an IMBA Nekrium card or more, the main reason I waited 5 months to update my review was to "give devs a chance to mature the game". and it just didn't happend despite false promises of "quicker balance".\n\nDraft is fun, the game engine and concept is fun, but poor design and balance kills it, there's a 4 color wheel but you only see the same one (Nekrium) with another as a sidekick, so don't bother with it. I won't even bother giving full details as to why gameplay is broken, as it's always one Nekrium card, this time it's Duskmaw, if you read my older entries you'll find out it was something else, like the previous one, broodqueen never got anything but a soft nerf, she still dominates games.\n\nSo move over to some other TCG, don't waste your time like me, I'm too deep like to just leave it now.\n\nOn a sidenote, Richard Garfield is no longer involved in this mess, he was in the initial design when it was balanced towards 3 out of 4 factions.\n\n***Previous review***\n\nAs of 9/19/14 there's been a new update with a new set of cards, guess which side got the most OP cards? Nekrium! how surprising, on the bright side, SBE is finally doing some rights...\n\nJust some weeks after they finally nerfed Zimmus the unnerfying all the Nekrium fanboys thrown their Zimmus aside, but for them to be happy the guys at SBE decided to launch some more OP nekrium cards, so instead of getting beaten hardcore at Rank 3 you can get beaten badly at rank 1.\n\nThese cards are broodqueen, doomrider and xithian direhound, I don't even bother, everytime I see my oponent playing any of the first 2 I know it's over, I just concede, it's POINTLESS to play UNLESS you got a VERY SPECIFIC Tempys deck that requires... more heroics, in other words $$$ or grind because I have yet to draw ONE of those heroics, set aside the idea of building a deck and pulling one in the right moment.\n\nThe folks at SBE decided to "nerf" broodqueen by nerfing it's spare token, but it can still destroy any creature matching it's level by sacrificing any creature or token that player controls, the other 2 are left untouched.\n\nCard design is still as terrible and lazy as ever, there's this mechanic called overload you play a "very strong card" and then remove it from your deck, so meanwhile Tempys deals 8 damage and uterra gives +6/+6 to an allied creature and Alloyin does EXACTLY the same as an already existing rare without any other benefits (lets say the older rare metasight is better) Nekrium lets you debuff a creature for -5/-5 AND put a solid 5/5 into play, because Nekrium needs even more power right?\n\nOn the bright side, SBE added a handful of achievments that can help new players get a legendary each time they reach a win milestone, it's very nice, but it's not enough for new players to catch up.\n\nNon-nekrium removal is as terrible as usual, it's hard-gated and still costs a lot of board advantage to get it to work properly, Uterra "removal" sometimes ends up benefiting your oponent rather than helping you.\n\nTarsus is still as OP as ever, just some people forgot about him already due to the broodqueen frenzy, in the worst cases which are many, people combo Tarsus with broodqueen.\n\nThe rewards where a little beefed up from 30 silver to 100 silver (a booster costs 5k silver) setting aside the generous 3 daily rewards which are the core for f2p players.\n\nSo it's still a GREAT game, really the best among the free to play card games as far as mechanics go, but it's ruined by lousy balance and design.\n\nOn another bright side, SBE recently started re-adjusting old commons and rares, I think this is great as starting players won't have as many useless cards as they did, IF they keep this trend of re-balancing the old cards I will say this is another great step for SBE, all they need to do is nerf the ♥♥♥♥ out of Nekrium cards and the game can be solid and enjoyable.\n\nIt can improve, but we're VERY far away from a desirable state of game, it has a lot of potential, but right now it's still broken, if all classes where equally balanced I would say the game would be very enjoyable until then it's frustrating because most people rely on power-play.\n\n\n***Here's my old review***\n\nOkay, before you look at my hours playing it and say "but this guy enjoys the game", let me just warn you, I'm a masochist hence why I still play this, but you should avoid it.\n\nSolforge is a fun card game, but it has a huge problem, and that problem is balance, developers just sit self-entitedly making OP nekrium (a faction) cards while all the other factions remain gimped in comparison.\n\nAll nekrium cards outclass any of the other factions, sometimes even combined, to the state where the game has become "play zimmus, you win".\n\nall nekrium fanboys sit in denial saying there are workarounds, and yes, there are many counters, the problem is they cost ALOT of card and position advantage.\n\nPicture this: you can play 2 cards per turn, if you play for example Alloyin you must play a disable (not even a removal) and then your creature and your 2 cards are gone, you must still kill the disabled creature someway and on top of it all, you must level up your disable if you want to use it on higher leveled creatures, if you didn't lost your card position advantage leveling the stupid disable, you won't be able to disable a higher level creature, meanwhile Nekrium has creatures with free removals or removals with free creatures, and the devs say it's fine.\nThere's also the card inequality, meanwhile Uterra has a "target creature gets +3/+3" Nekrium has a "target enemy creature gets -4/-4 you gain 4 life" in a game where most creatures have 3 to 5 health it's an instant kill.\nThere's an alloyin heroic that gives all enemy creatures -3 attack, there is another alloyin heroic that gives all allied creatures +3 attack making that casting 2 cards, but there is a Nekrium rare that gives -2 to all enemy creatures and +2 to all allied creatures in one card.\n\nGreat design, props to Stoneblade.\n\n90% of the kids in this thing play Nekrium or splash nekrium as it's the easy way to get around, and they maintain their "everything it's fine" mentality, but it's not, even when the tournament deck winners are often not nekrium or just splash nekrium but they require alot of legendaries and that's microtransactions or time your choice, I won't say it's pay to win because it's not, you can grind your way out or you can pay your way out.\n\nCards are easily available for everyone at the steep cost of $20 for one legendary or around a month and half of saving silver and not buying anything during that time, knock yourself out, the apologists will say "oh that's cheap compared to MTG" the difference is, a real MTG can be re-sold, these cannot.\n\nSo we get a game with alot of powerplay, that doesn't reward creativity, high costs, and on top of that we get a lousy community with A LOT of AFKers holding your scarce wins back away from you, did I mentioned there is a lousy RNG too? yeah, sometimes you take a game leveling cards to never see them again while your oponent just summons their freaking godzillas twice, because every 4 turns the cards cycle back

Now the people who pays can trade cards making them even more powerful than the free players.\n\nAs a free player, after opening hundreds of free packs and 4 legendary chest i have only collected 17 legendary cards, no even one of these are one of the more know powerful legendaries.\n\nMy conclusion is that free players dont really get good cards, for that you have to pay. So for all people interested in playing take into account that only if you are willing to pay you can have a posibility to win in this game.\n\nFree players dont bother with this game.\n\n08/10/2014\nLike all cards games is a P2W. You only can obtain free cards 3 times a day, whit the first login, whit the first win and whit the 3rd one. The cards you receive are random and fluctuate from a pack of six cards to only one of any rarity. Like this you can get only 3 green cards daily (the lower quality) and be done. This is insane, how can you imporve your cards if you maybe only get 3 greens a day? So you have to pay. You can buy packs for silver but taking into account that you only earn like 6000 silver whit the daily rewards and that PvP only give you 100 silver for a winned match ( who normally take like 20 minutes to end) you can only affort to buy one pack a day, so another 6 cards to add to the 3 of the dailys, not really too much, right?\n\nAnd theres only that in the game, free PvP (you enter in a MM who put any other player agains you) and tournaments who are full of people who have payed her way in (full of decks of legendary cards). Nothing more, no campaing no nothing ( i dont count the PvCPU who is based only in the basic decks of the game and very easy to beat).\n\nYou can have fun for the firts hours of gameplay, after that you crash to the wall who is the P2W and the game becomes much less fun.\n\nIn resume, stay away and dont lose your time here.","October 8, 2014","false","257.3"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","0"

You draw 5 cards and select 2 of them to play. Each turn you draw 5 new cards.\nThis leads to a situation where you cannot plan your next step, since you do not know which 5 cards you will draw next. This game mechanic drastically reduces strategic options in this game.\n\n2.) The 2 cards you play level up. After a certain amount of turns you have access to the leveled cards. Additionally, there are many cards that can snowball within a single turn. If you are simply unlucky not drawing your leveled cards ( or a viable counter), your opponent can snowball to an unbeatable situation quite quickly. This increases the RNG factor a lot, which is quite negative for a card game that already has a lot of RNG.\n\n3.) While this game is not actually pay 2 win (as you can get all cards for free over time), there are certain cards that are clearly better in all aspects compared to some of the cards you start with. Some cards are even unbeatable by the starting decks. Additionally the amount of free cards you can earn per day is limited.\nThe game is much less enjoyable if you do not pay for it or grind for weeks to get the cards you need for a solid deck.\n\n\nSo in the end.. it offers less strategy than other trading card games and is less casual as well, making other games clearly better.","March 19, 2014","false","20.2"," 20 of 36 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","20","36","0","0"

It has some neat mechanics that I haven't seen in any other CCG.  I have 700+ hours on record, so it cant be that bad, or can it?\n\nThe bad:\nITS SLOWWWW: About that 700 hours.  A  lot of that time was spent playing other games or working while waiting on a slow opponent to take their turn.  Games take too long and players are slow. The only game mode is a 20 minute timer on both sides. Many players rage AFK when losing making you wait for 15 minutes to collect your win.  Many other players play so slowly they take their whole 20 minutes. This is really frustrating to me, as I rarely use more than 5 minutes of my time.\n\nNOT FTP FRIENDLY: Decks are 30 cards, and most top tier decks use 9 legendaries or more. That makes it very difficult for FTP players to be competitive. Spend money or you will be locked out of competitive constructed games.\n\nPOWER CREEP: Power creep seems to be a real issue.  Every set has a couple of godawful broken cards that are then nerfed later on (after the paying player base got a chance to abuse them, of course).\n\nNO MARKET: There is no public market for cards, instead there is a trade system. Its okay, but a market would be much preferable. As it is now cards have little value.\n\nCOPY_PASTA: Copy-pasta meta.  I have played CCGs quite a bit, never have I seen a meta so dominated by builds that are blatant copies of winning decks. It makes things really dull.\n\nSWINGY:  Recently the game has become much more swingy due to uber powerful cards and combos. By this I mean you may be 10 turns into a game, have your opponent locked down at every turn, ahead on life, ahead on board position, then suddenly you lose. Its pretty frustrating.\n\nI dont enjoy the game anymore.  I liked it the first hundred hours or so,  now I just play it due to inertia.","March 15, 2015","false","673.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Blatant powercreep, a lack of limitations on legendary cards, and ridiculous powers for those legendary cards has basically turned matches into the typical who-has-better-cards and curtailed the amount of strategy in the game. There is no purpose to owning any cards othen than the top 2 out of 5 tiers for the most part, with a few exceptions. Sadly, you'll only get a legendary chest about once a month as a free player, and considering the ridiculous price of a single chest, it's kinda tough to justify the purchase, especially knowing the next set will powercreep your collection out of the game.\n\nWhile I'm gonna stick around for a bit and hope the tide changes, it's pretty difficult to recommend right now.\n~~~\nI've been pleasantly surprised by this game. While there is a power advantage to having rarer cards, there is enough of a synergy requirement, and a large enough playerbase, to prevent it from being too annoying thus far.\n\nThe card-leveling mechanic is really engaging and refreshing. It adds progression to a CCG that isn't found elsewhere, along with another strategic layer. The small deck size (30) helps mitigate the odds of not drawing the card you want. This creats a slight negative in that deck variety is a little limited, but after 100 wins (which I reference because that's the achievement that just came up) I'm still excited to load up a match.\n\nThe tounaments are a lot of fun, and seem to be pretty accessible (~2 per week as a free player, maybe more). I got in through the Humble Bundle, which gave me 2 starter decks, and I've been pretty competitive (though I wouldn't recommend buying the packs, as the cards have been powercreeped out), winning at least half my games, though I have a lot of CCG experience. The 4 factions have distinct styles, and seem very well balanced.\n\nThe interface leaves a LOT to be desired, but it gets the job done. Hopefully it gets a serious makeover in the near future.","February 26, 2015","false","124.0"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

I've played the game DAILY since January 2014 on iOS, when the deck customization was implemented to the game.\n\nSolForge is one of the two actually proper digital card games around for the people looking for depth in mechanics. The other would be Battle Decks, not Hearthstone, but let's not go there now...\n\n-30 card deck\n-Draw 5 cards on each turn\n-Start with rank 1 (tech level in game)\n-Played card gets a leveled up version to your discard pile\n-Each rank consists 4 turns for each player\n-Discard pile and the rest of the draw deck gets shuffled when new rank (tech level) begins\n-Based on actual effects and combinations, instead of flat out power/health of the cards\n-Most of the cards are capped to rank 3, but these are few that have rank 4 as well (not necessarely better)\n\nThe table consists 5 lanes. Creatures attack the players, which both have 100 health at the start. The goal is obviously to get that to zero. If there's a creature at the opposing lane, the damage is exchanged. The damage is permanent and not healed on turns.\n\nThe reward mechanic is VERY fair for a F2P game. There are no premium only -cards.\n\n1) You get a booster (or better) reward as daily login and silver worth around ~333% of a booster.\n2) From a first daily win, you get a draft ticket worth 4 boosters.\n3) From a third win, you get a similar reward as daily login - booster (or better) and silver worth ~33% of a booster.\n4) Each win also gives you 250 silver, which is 5% of a booster price.\n5) With 3 draft tickets, you get to enter a draft where you KEEP the 30 cards you draft. On top of that, you play 4 matches and get better rewards depending on how you succeed. Minimum reward is 4 boosters on top of the 30 drafted cards, which eg. include all the legendary cards in the game.\n\nThe only real downside is that the legendaries from the past few sets have been power creeped. Legendaries used to be very situational, but the fact that there are now quite a few lengedaries that work.\n\nI suggest you play the game on iPad.

Shocking, I know. I was always intrigued by table-top rpg's, and card duel games like Magic, etc. but never really had anyone in my social circle who shared the same interest so I never got into it.\n\nWhich is why I'm probably really garbage at them now as an adult (except drunk d&d, I rock that!). Having said that though, this game is great. It might be more complex than I feel that it is, but it doesn't seem that way. It is nice and easy to drop in and figure out how to play, the rules are simple but the matches can be intense.\n\nThe game has a few flaws, but unless you are die-hard over details, nothing you can't overlook to enjoy a quick match here or there. I recommend giving it a shot, since it's free you know, so why not?

Cards in Solforge level up as you play them, from levels one to three, getting more powerful as they go. Decks are composed of 30 cards from 4 factions with no more than 3 of each card, the interesting part being you can mix and match from 2 different factions. Each turn you draw 5 new cards and discard your old hand, and you're allowed to play 2 of these 5 cards in any one of 5 lanes. After 4 turns your deck is reshuffled and every card you played is leveled up. The goal of the game is to get your opponent's life total from 100 to 0.\n\nCards vary quite diversely as you would expect from any good CCG or TCG, there are direct damage spells, buffing spells, cards that allow you to play or draw more cards, creatures that are weak at low levels but extremely powerful at higher levels and vice versa. Within the Creature category there are many abilities they can possess, ranging from regenerating lost health, to having armor that detracts damage being done to their health, to ignoring summoning sickness that other creatures have, and much more.\n\nGameplay is very fun and VERY strategic, although still occasionally plaqued somewhat by RNG as most other card games - however I find it to be completely managable. Balance is pretty decent, there are a few cards that are too powerful as you might expect, but nothing too drastic in my opinion. The main problem I see with the balance is that the rarest cards are, for the most part, the cards that make the biggest (and strongest) impact, the kinda cards you can build a whole deck around, which brings me to the Free-to-play aspect of Solforge.\n\nThe F2P aspect of Solforge is probably where the game fails most in my opinion (although once again, nothing too bad). Card rarity varies from Common, to Rare, to Heroic, and finally Legendary. Common and rare cards are very easy to get, heroics a little harder, but legendaries are very difficult to come by. You can obtain cards by completing daily rewards for playing, purchasing packs with an in game currency, and of course using real life money to purchase packs/additional cards. I find the prices to be placed on these to be placed too high - HOWEVER, Stone Blade Entertainment (the creators of Solforge) are still testing the market and have definitely discussed lowering the prices, so in a few months they might be better priced.\n\nThis segways nicely to the next topic of developer communication and commitment. The developers are very involved with the community as you might expect from a game that started on kickstarter, they have answered many questions and made balance descisions based on community feedback. Updates are pushed out decently quickly and I believe an 100+ card expansion is coming soon. Other things that are planned are a card "forging" feature, which will give a way for players with excess cards and in game currency to create the cards they still want, and a campaign mode to go along with the regular "constructed" and "draft" modes and I believe a trading feature.\n\nAll in all a really great game that has the potential (and I think its potential will be filled) to be even better. In my opinion a real contender in the Online CCG market that is MOST CERTAINLY worth a try.","March 6, 2014","true","44.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Those familiar with CCGs such as Magic might be skeptical about the lack of an explicit resource system, but the game manages beautifully without lands to pay for your cards.  The idea that you can play any card in your hand is incredibly empowering, but the knowledge that the cards you don't play will be discarded makes for agonizing decisions.  Each turn is a difficult balance between playing for short-term needs and long-term strategy.\n\nCards can be bought with real money, but they're also handed out quite generously through simple play rewards.  One can earn the play rewards by beating the AI, and AI difficulty can be set to make the rewards trivial to obtain.  A downside is that there's nothing that can be done with duplicate cards, but I hardly find this to be a significant fault given how quickly it's possible to build a collection.\n\nSpeaking of the AI, I'd never have put as much time into the game as I have if the AI wasn't interesting to play.  The Hard AI poses a reasonable challenge, and is great for quickly testing out deck strength.  Humans will always pose a better challenge, but the AI is good enough to making beating up on it fun, and if I can't beat it consistently then I know my deck needs work.\n\nI highly recommend SolForge.  It's a fresh design in a world where so many games are simply tweaked clones of those that came before.  It's fun, it's challenging, and it's free to try.

I was wrong and the beauty and the simplicity of this game is that the choices you make early can completely change your end game strategy.\n\nAs a CCG I will personally score this game highly because it breaks away from the Magic the Gathering formula that many recent ccgs are clutching to (Hearthstone, Hex). Though I love the game in the case of Hex, Shards of Fate, the best way I can put it is that they made some very basic and simple modifactions to MTG mechanics and cards and tweaked it to take advantage of digitial playing field. To be honest its nearly a blatant copy and some will hate on that but Hex took a great concept and made it better. Given that MTG has failed miserably and shamefully to be able to do the same with their own product I will just quitely applaud that the product is there to enjoy. I will however stand up and applaud louder when someone strikes out into some different territory and manages to make a few decisions (usually only two or three per turn) evolve into a complex web of moves and counter moves. There's alot here to love and I am ashamed I missed out on it the first go round.\n\nThere are some weak points I will touch on but I would like to point out that there seems to be alot of hate in this review sections for this game that are centered around the "pay-to-win" aspect of this game. EVERY colletible card game has some element of this (Scrolls comes close but you can still get an advantage by tossing in some extra coin) and If your passing this one by because of all the hate you see in the forums or on the internet you are making a mistake. I paid absolutely nothing into this one for the few weeks and acquired a MASSIVE collection of cards to play with. There is plenty of fun to be had here without paying a dime.\n\nThe worst thing far and away about this game is the User interface which I have found to be awkward and counterintutitive. There are achievments that can not be found anywhere in game which is a bit odd to me. The collection screen where you make decks is frustrating to say the least. This is a real shame because all the accessibility bonus the core mechanics offer to draw new people to the genres is lost pretty quickly when you can not figure out what is what after the brief tutorial.\n\nOverall Solforge offers something great from a mechanics standpoint and the f2p factor gives it a big boost for me (don't believe the hate).\n\nRecommended if your a fan of TCG's and want something a bit outside the box.\n\n7/10\n\n\n","February 22, 2015","true","387.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's set up well, a lot of fun to play, and you don't need to sit down to an hour-long play session to enjoy a few games. The visuals are good, and the reward system for playing brought me back day after day.\n\nWhat killed it for me? The power differential: between the library of cards you amass from free play, and what you can purchase in the in-game Store. After months of daily play, I've put together a pretty decent deck. In random constructed matches, I win the vast majority of the time against decks with a similar number of Rare/Heroic cards. However, most random matches pair me up with players whose decks are suffused with Legendary cards (which have been purchased). In these games I'm consistently flattened, even when my opponent makes some serious misplays.\n\nIf you've ever played MTG before, think of it in these terms: if you're not spending money, you're going to be playing a Pauper deck against top-tier constructed ones. If SB is going to continue this (which is perfectly valid, they're a company out to make money!), they might consider giving players the choice of seeking a random Casual match with low win rewards, or a Pro match with better rewards.\n\nIf you're willing to spend money to win matches, go for it!

The fact that your hand resets after every turn removes a very key strategic element from the game, the ability to plan. Combined with the 0 play cost of any card each round is essentially each player slapping their 3 most powerful cards in hand down.\n\nAdmittedly there's random chance in all card games but imagine if you will a poker game where after each round everyone discards all the cards in their hand, shuffles them back into the deck and draws a new set of cards; It'd pretty much knock out many important strategic elements of the game. IN this game simply, there's no reason to not play your most powerful cards which is the frist sign that strategy has been pushed to the side in favour of fast games. In MTG there are very good reasons not to play your super cards, because you have to figure what sort of cards the opponent might be having that'll pretty much destroy opr turn the card against you. Moreso in YigiOh because of the trapcard system, here, none of that exists.\n\nIs the game enjoyable? Yes, to a point, and that's about the point when you realize winning or losing is basically a dice rolls. Imagine a game where each player takes turns rolling a dice, the first one to accumulate a total of 30 wins. Such a game can be fun and nail biting yes but in the end it can be rather unsatisfying because your actual input in the victory as the player is minimal.\n\nA good game for those who want to test the genre of COllectible Card Games but for seasoned experienced players, skip this one.","January 5, 2014","false","5.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Principally the lack of any 'resource' generation and the 'leveling' of cards, allowing for more powerful versions to be played in later rounds. However, it suffers from three major flaws:\n\n1) If you are interested in deck building and/or competitive constructed play, don't bother unless you intend to throw down a significant amount of money, or are patient enough to wait (playing every single day) for several years (and even then, you likely won't have close to a full play-set of all the key cards you'll need to play at the top level).\n\n2) RNG is a massive determinant in games. While this helps keeps mediocre players 'competitive,' it's very frustrating to have game after game decided by a series of bad draws.\n\n3) Power creep. New cards are frequently just reprints of old ones with superior abilities, completely invalidating the older sets. Rather than augmenting existing decks or adding new and interesting folds to the metagame, they simply obsolete everything that has come before.\n\nDraft format helps with this somewhat, but without spending real money, you're only looking to play a handful of times per week.\n\nWhile these troubles aren't necessarily peculiar to this game compared to many other competitors in the TCG genre, it is enough to keep me from being able to recommend it.","November 12, 2015","false","250.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

In comparison with other games like Hearthstone, this game focuses more on gameknowledge and actual player skill and thus has not implemented more than a few elements of randomness, thus making skill, deck choice and knowledge much more valuable than "luck". There are plenty of cards with crazy effects out there which makes the game so much more fun once you acquire some of them and put them into your deck or even build one around these cards. Thanks to in-game tournaments you can be able to play completely for free and get your hands on everything. Also there isn't anything in the shop that gives you any advantage whatsoever other than well having more cards. And while that definitely helps you grow your collection and be able to share cards with other players it is by no means necessary!\n\nAnother incredibly amazing thing about this game is that the developers give you 2 free boosterpacks every single day for logging in and winning 3 matches. If you are short on time that day you can play against the AI and it will still count! The developers did an amazing job in designing the game and its mechanics. It is free to play and easy to get into. The developers are also very generous in giving out plenty of codes to the community that provide you with ingame benefits such as, but not limited to, cards, booster packs, alternative arts, gold (real money currency) and much more. You can acquire these for example by playing on the ladder (http://www.solforgeladder.com), playing tournaments on the same website and much more. There is also an achievement system which will provide you with codes once you reach certain milestones.\n\nThe close-knit community is extremely friendly and very eager to help any newcomers! People will share some of the powerful cards with you without expecting anything in return!

The only cost you pay is the regret of having to discard the cards you didn't use but ended up needing. But that's all circumstantial and a bit easier to mitigate once you've a better grasp on the cards and mechanisms.\n\nThat said, some cards might put you off at first. "Big whoop," you might say, unless it's within the first 'round' or two of hands and you realize, "Holy balls, the level-ups are incredible!" So yeah, drop those cards. Even if your ranks are full and the spells you have aren't necessary, it still pays to play *something* if only for the sake of getting a stronger version of it later, and you're on hand 3 of 4 in the round. And again, no 'mana' cost.\n\nIt has a "snowball effect" appeal to it, I guess. Which can be refreshing. While I appreciate the cautious, long-haul strategy of Magic and similar card games a bit better, sometimes I like something with a faster pace and exponential growth - though I seldom see my level 3 cards.\n\nThis is all online play notwithstanding. I base an assumption of "Legendary Stomping" on other reviews, and have had enough experience with Hearthstone to be frustrated by feeling incapable of beating anyone. Fact of the matter is, I'm a heavy gamer, but spread my attention across many games. I simply don't invest enough time in these F2P games to build a strong collection and be competetive. And that'd be a lame excuse to pay real life money, so I won't. If I get tired of playing against CPU and draft tournaments feel too noncommital after awhile, I'll just stop playing again.\n\nBut again, fun game/concept and worth at least a small chunk of your time to try.","September 21, 2015","true","3.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

It has some very annoying flaws. Like there is no skill or rank based match making ... every time I try to play pvp my opponent will have a perfect deck with 18 Legendary cards in it while I dont have 10 legendaries in my whole card collection. Legendaries are not really over powered but they are pretty close so giving player having them a great advantage. Only way to get legendaries is to pay a lot of money or win pvp matches to get silver to get those legendary chests. Yes you can get legendary cards from ordinary packs but it is very very very rare ... also to make the most of the legendary cards is to make a deck solely built arround their strenghts and to do that you need to get those legendaries drawn from the deck rather freguently so you need multiple copies of those legendary cards to make them really op making this game also like many other cardgames of this type more or less pay to win.","December 6, 2015","false","100.3"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Each turn is basically a coin toss as to whether or not you will be able to do anything good. While strategic play can influence this to a point, the fact that you discard what's left of your hand and draw a brand new one each turn makes planning ahead difficult, not to mention that going several turns drawing level-1 cards which no longer have any impact once the stronger level-2 and level-3 cards appear is incredibly common and will often lead to losing any advantage you may have had, if not to losing the game outright.\n\nAside from the fact that luck is far too great an element in this game, the balancing is an issue as well. Having spend 150 hours of in-game time on this game, I managed to acquire a grand total of 3 legendary cards and there were plenty of heroic cards I hadn't even seen at that point. At this point, I feel like I should mention that not only are the interesting effects mostly limited to legendary and heroic cards and many (if not most) deck archetypes are completely based around them, but in the few cases where they can be compared to the less rare cards they are almost always better. Who'd rather have a nexus core than a thundersaur? Who could make a removal deck without dreadbolt, a lifegain deck without Oros/Arboris or a metamind deck without Drix? Why is Chrogias better than scrapforge titan, echowisp better than ether hounds, hinterland watchman better than cypien infiltrator, etc?\n\nWhen we take the combination of poor balancing, slow releases, and the always overhanging element of luck and then add a UI that would've looked bad in 2005, the fact that card effects trigger in a random order, the fact that there is no reason to play more than 3 games a day, locking drafts to an average of 6 games (not 6 drafts, 6 GAMES) a week if you win half your games, the poor matchmaking and the frequently exploited fact that there are no turn timers - only a chess clock of 20 minutes, we get a game with interesting basic mechanics but unspeakably poor execution.\n\nWhile the review says I don't recommend this game, I actually recommend that you play this ONCE if you're intersted in TCGs, because the mechanics at the base of SolForge are actually fairly interesting and might change some things you take for granted in a TCG. But I do not recommend playing more than that and I beg you not to spend money on this. SolForge might be worth returning to one day, but do not expect that day to come anytime soon.","April 19, 2014","false","146.5"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","0"

It's a fairly simplistic card game, but with a suprising amount of depth / theorycrafting to your decks once you've unlocked some cards. It has the unique aspect of your cards levelling up as you play them; adding a depth of strategy that other card games haven't really explored. Not only do you have to think about what card to play right now, in order to damage your opponent, or save yourself from damage, but you also have to think about the future - and which cards you'll want then and how your deck will evolve compared to their deck.\n\nThe starter decks are playable, but I would strongly advise you to buy some packs (you can use silver which you can get from logging on daily and from winning matches) and get a custom deck going. You will get your ♥♥♥ kicked taking your cheap/free decks into PvP, but you can win your silver rewards playing against the AI - which is beatable on all difficulties with the starter decks, although the higher difficulties will be a challenge. If you do use real money to purchase packs, you will have a higher chance of getting the best cards, ultimately people should remember that card games are about spending money and RNG, but overall this is very playable as a free player too.\n\nOne of the big advantages of this game right now to me is that the Ipad app is extremely fluid and responsive. You can play untimed games with friends and the push notifications are accurate - meaning if you have a lazy day with 5 minutes to spare here and there, you can have a good duel with your friend from anywhere. (Untimed) games save despite the application being shut down; and you can start a game on the ipad and continue it on the PC, or have the game running in two locations at once if you so desire. A lot of digital card games right now have promised this sort of cross platform interactivity, but few have competently provided it yet. The android app is sadly not out yet so I can't comment on that - but they have said there'll be one in the future.\n\nI'm pretty happy with it overall and would recommend.","December 1, 2013","true","9.3"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

So consider this a review of a very half-finished game.\n\nThe game is VERY rewarding for playing. A good 10 minutes a day is all it requires for you to farm yourself some excellent currency and a chance at packs of cards that go from poor (3 cards, one rare) or amazing on a seemingly very random process.\n\nThe balance of the game is a "work in progress" to say the least with some factions having some seemingly near impossible creatures to answer. The investment necessary to kill those cards is so high that you put yourself too far behind to do much of anything against the lesser threats that still kill you.\n\nThe game pace is great for quick games, and I think there is definitely a niche for this card game in the digital trading card game market, but they need to move quicker to solidify their position with a completed game before games like hearthstone and hex completely lock them out.\n\nThe one thing as you may have gotten out of this review so far is that the game is truly free to play. You can be very successful in gathering cards with only investing time, and perhaps if there is actually a criticism, it is that they are giving you very little reason to play living opponents at this point.\n\nAll in all, this game is headed in the right direction for a mobile digital card game especially and for that, this game gets a thumbs up from me.","December 5, 2013","true","38.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/princeegg/recommended/232450/","princeegg","Aegon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/princeegg/","205 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nBack in January, I was a relatively new Hearthstone player who was also relatively new to card games in general. I was watching Brian Kibler's stream when he mentioned he was a developer for another free to play collectible card game: Solforge. He spoke a bit about it and I was intrigued enough to check it out.\n\nNow, in April and having played Solforge for a few months, I think I can speak enough about the game to warrant a review. Solforge has four factions and hundreds of cards. Games are played with creatures and spells, the former being placed in any of the five lanes and the latter having various effects. Creatures in lanes will "battle" opposing creatures in the same lane. If they are unopposed, they attack the player, removing a given amount of base HP. The first player to drop to zero, naturally, loses the game. As cards are played, they are discarded and "leveled", and when a rank is gained, the discard pile is shuffled and becomes the draw pile.\n\nIf you enjoy CCGs, you will *probably* enjoy Solforge. It has a generally great community, many of whom are always willing to share cards with new players to help them get on their feet, which is really important because, as with any CCG, new players begin with an inherent disadvantage as all the veterans have more cards. This is something that all CCGs struggle with, and not even Hearthstone has a solution for it. Another thing to note is that the developer, StoneBlade Entertainment (SBE), seems to really enjoy ridiculously strong cards. They update often (new cards, nerfs/buffs, etc), but in the few months that I've played they've nerfed some strong cards while leaving other glaringly, fun-suckingly strong cards like Wegu untouched. The card Herald of Destruction recently received a massive buff that makes it as un-fun to play against as Wegu. Luckily (?), there's no ranking system, so games can be conceded without a second thought when you discover your opponent is running one of those decks. (Caveat: beware that complaining about cards will occasionally be met with "get better" replies or other variants of the same thing from veterans who have played the game since Kickstarter and will defend all of SBE's decisions to the death)\n\nSolforge has some incredible art, like the Byzerak Frostmaiden[hypershotgaming.com] and the Cindersmoke Wyvern[i.imgur.com], and some pretty bad art, like the Weirwood Ranger[solforgespain.files.wordpress.com] and the Tarsus Necrolord[www.ghoxssocks.com], though apparently many of the latter cards are from the Kickstarter, where backers were somewhat poorly photoshopped onto cards.\n\nI would be remiss if I didn't mention the incredible Kaelari and his unofficial Solforge Ladder[solforgeladder.com], where you can chat with other players, participate in tournaments of various kinds (the best are the unheroic and unlegendary ones, where the really strong cards that new players won't have are "banned") for different prizes, set up trades, and actually participate in a ladder ranking system. Most of the stuff that Kaelari's site does should ideally have been done by the developers themselves as opposed to an unpaid third-party, but SBE is seemingly more focused on pumping out cards than they are with smoothing out what they already have. There is a downside to this ladder, however, and it's that most of its users are veterans, so if you queue up for a ladder or tournament game, it's very likely the person will be better than you. Other than release day for new sets of cards, the number of people who concurrently use the Ladder sits around 50. That means that if everyone's queued (which is never the case), you've got a solid chance of playing the same person more than once. Not enough of Solforge's several hundred daily users either know about the Ladder, or care enough to use it, which is a damn shame, and it'd probably be a different case if it wasn't third-party. Indie developers only have so much money, though.\n\nAs I said, I think StoneBlade needs change the focus from more new cards (which everyone loves), to doing things like meshing most of the Ladder's features into the game, overhauling the UI, and actually advertising the damn game. That being said, I'd still be hesitant to label this an Early Access game if it weren't for the big blue label on the store page (otherwise it'd just look like an indie game). Despite all its flaws, I do enjoy Solforge a whole lot and I implore you to give it a shot if you're even remotely interested. It's easier to get into than Hearthstone, as packs and cards in general are easier to acquire. SBE recently revamped the Draft (Arena) queue, where now you can pay 2 event tickets (acquired from your first win of the day) to draft 30 cards that you KEEP after the tournament, which is a fantastic value for new players.","April 6, 2015","true","212.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Coupled with the fact I'm rather poor at giving feedback, I apologize in advance for this review's probably not being up to par with most peoples'. I'll be returning to this review to alter and add onto it, as I am oft wont to do; and just as well, as a read of what is below will demonstrate that in a single session, I cannot compose anything even remotely approaching the standards of an acceptably comprehensive body.\n\nDisclaimer: This review is based wholly upon my own experience and opinion of the game. I do not claim to speak for anyone else, nor presume to, nor do I believe my opinion to be factual, nor any closer to objective truth than anyone else's. I entrust the reader to understand this applies to the whole of the review, including sentences wherein clauses that disclaim this are absent.\n\n___\n\nLike more than a few 90's kids, I definitely met the Battle Card Genre growing up. The Pokemon Trading Card Game; Yu-Gi-Oh; Digimon; and many more battle card games caught the interest of so many others in my age group (and beyond, even!). All of these were very popular, I took a look at all of them- and I never took to any of them. The Battle Card game genre was simply not for me, and still largely hasn't been.\n\nEven so, there's been something interesting about the genre and many of its products in my opinion, even from a distance. So I've spent time of late looking for one that I might be able to enjoy. Countless ones, I've read of, seen numerous demonstrations for, and found myself uninterested in, just like old times.\n\nThen, the two nights preceding the one wherein I write this review, I gave it another try. I found two very interesting prospective games. One, is Infinity Wars. It looks amazing, and I'd love to try it, but it commands space my potato cannot provide.\n\nThe other is SolForge.\n\nWell, I installed it last night, started playing today, and if my impressions must be expressed in a single sentence, let it be this: I, someone who has never played a battle card game before, like, perhaps even am finding love for, this game.\n\nI must start with the gameplay itself. As most reading this probably know, the game's playing area consists of ten spaces in a five-by-two arrangement. One strip of five is used by each of the two players; each space can be occupied by a card. In my opinion, this provides enough room for strategy to truly matter, while at the same time not intimidating a player as the presentation of a vast field can sometimes do. This having been said, a somewhat claustrophobic feeling often sets in when placing a card, adding a feeling of tension that can throw a player off-focus- which, in my opinion, is very satisfying to focus through the fog of.\n\nCards come in two variants: Creature and Spell. Creature cards have two statistics, Attack Power and Health, and most of them have a special ability (and/or multiple ones, in the case of some cards) There are four main factions, each with its own pool of cards. Once again, simplicity that provides room for complexity.\n\nThere are many other rules of the game that I'd love to individually praise, but I realize this is dragging on. I'll probably return to add onto the list and give my critique of each element of the gameplay that I can in kind on one of the aforementioned review edits I'm bound to do. Until then, let us move on.\n\nThe instilling of a feeling of tension mentioned in the paragraph about the playing field is just as well, as the cards in this game represent troops fighting and dying within the game's fictional universe. That brings me to what I'd like to talk about next: The appeal thereof.\n\nIn my opinion, the creators of this game have done a splendid job of making the lore and universe of this game very interesting. Each of the four main factions has its own unique characters, locations, and (most notably in my mind) culture and elements there-comprising, including their own unique ideals, established government, and general mindset toward life, the world, and even to each other. If you are interested, I'd advise to go to the developers' official website for the game and read their lore section. The descriptions there are highly descriptive, and will give you an idea of the world one is stepping into. There are no direct third-person descriptions of such nature in the game itself, ironically, nor any link to the official website- something I have mixed feelings about.\n\nEven though direct explanations are not provided in the game itself, the game's universe does shine through- and how! In the campaign modes, the "Info" bubbles often relay colorful descriptions of the setting in which your avatar (you?) find(s) her/him/yourself, and/or interactions with the culture of the given faction that one will be facing off against.\n\nAdditionally, and in my opinion most noticeably, the images on the cards themselves associated with each faction give insight into the creatures, constructs, and, in particular, the people and, again, culture of that faction. In my eyes and mind, the characters themselves, their attire, their stances and activities, anything they might be holding, the setting each one is portrayed in, even the variations between the images for the different variations in each card, each and all seem to portray living beings with stories to tell, things to show, and a culture/environment/etc. to go back to after the dust of battle has settled. I find myself imagining what they do in peace-time, and in different situations, what a day in each one's life is like. Numerous specific examples swarm my mind, which I've been tripping over myself on my keyboard trying to type as examples, before finally deciding to leave it at this and hope it is moderately acceptable in the way of portraying my opinion of the developers' success. As I look at this paragraph, I am aghast at the degree to which I have utterly failed to express my true wonderment, and opinion of the importance that each card's image plays in picturing the fictional universe. Perhaps I'll come back and go into further detail.\n\nOn this note, the artistry of the images themselves is, in my opinion, utterly breathtaking. Even outside of what it does in communicating each character's place in the fictional universe and as an extension thereof, there is much, in my opinion, to be admired. The lighting, shading, and coloration of each item and creature make each one feasible to visualize existing and moving in real, three-dimensional space, even with the obvious fantastical flair of the objects and creatures themselves.\n\n\nThere are other elements of this game that are meritorious of praise. I also fully intend to go back and add onto, edit, and otherwise adjust each and every paragraph to be more descriptive, and adhere more loyally to the purpose of describing the experience that I have with this game. Additionally, there are numerous elements of the game I've not yet experienced, such any of the campaign missions beyond the first four, or the Multiplayer mode.\n\nFrom one who never liked battle card games before, and is still wary of them for the most part, this game receives a hearty recommendation. If you're interested in battle card games, and/or otherwise turn-based strategy, and you have five-hundred Megabytes to spare on your hard drive, I would recommend giving this game a try. Though there are card packs for sale (none of which I've yet patronized), the game itself is free of monetary cost. Worst case scenario, uninstall if you don't like, no less the wealthy for having tried it.\n\n(Review created/posed 11/23/2015, 10:17 PM, GMT-6.

Being an EA game (something should change here, EA game means something evil and should not be attributed to early access games) I guess missing stuff is normal. Even though, IMO ranked MP for games like these is a core feature, not something one should plan to implement at a later date. Right up there with "make an online gameplay system" regarding priority.\n\nMy gripe with this game is its economy system. I simply have to compare it with Scrolls because there are many similarities. I'm personally not that much into competitive play and in this regard this game really doesn't offer much, past some OK campaign missions and a sub par AI with 0 rewards. Collecting cards and building decks would be interesting to me, had it not been for some problems.\n\nSo, in scrolls you had (at the time I still played the game a few months back)\n\n- 360 cards in 4 factions\n- possibility to make some 1k gold daily, with a few daily trials and maybe one AI match. 1 hour tops, doable in 30 minutes.\n- with 1k gold you could purchase a pack of ten random cards, of which one was guaranteed to be a rare card and another two were uncommons. There was also a chance of about 10-20% to receive an 11th, higher tier card.\n- standard decks typically require one faction so upon choosing your color you practically had a pool of 90 cards from which you could choose.\n- most expensive cards on the market went for about 1800 gold, which in effect would be an equivalent of 5 LOST online matches, something like 2 hours of your time.\n- as long as you managed to put up a decent fight, online losses were rewarded nicely. AI matches were also rewarded, less handsomely, but the same principle applies - more fighting means more gold.\n- there were precon decks which went for 5k and 8k gold so all in all, if you wanted to build a specific deck you could do so without grinding to death. Say, two hours daily for a month should net you 60 to 80k with which you can build almost any deck you want. If you were good in competitive play you could net even more easily.\n\nIn SolForge you have:\n- around 570 cards, not really sure how to check the grand total nor how many are there per faction since the interface is lacking in some regards.\n- easy daily rewards which require three victories against anyone, netting about 2.5k silver, two packs containing 6 random cards and a ticket which you need for online events. This requires about a half an hour of your time, if you played against easy AI probably doable in 15 minutes.\n- these packs guarantee only one rare card and offer a decent chance of getting some heroic and legendary cards. The problem is you are getting 6 from a pool of ~570. Compared to 10 out of 360 from Scrolls, which also gave one highest tier card guaranteed, this is quite bad.\n- to make things worse, forging prices are rather high. Common cards go for 150, rares go for 1400, heroic 32500 and legendary 142500 silver. If you decide to build a specific deck with say 15 heroic and 15 legendary cards you will need 2625000 silver which is an equivalent of about 1000 days of daily rewards.\n- online victories net 250 gold, max 10 daily I think so that could split above 1000 to 500 days of grinding, but with a lets say more significant time investment.\n- there are preconstructed decks for purchase and a sharing system so that, as long as you can find someone with whom you might share, you can cut deck costs to about $5 a piece.\n- there is also the option to earn some cards in the drafting portion of the game, which seems interesting and I'd like to get to know the cards a bit better before getting into that. You can play one casual draft match every three days for free, as things stand now.\n\nAll in all, it is my opinion that, as a card collection game, SolForge sucks due to a bad business model. IMO. Even more so for new players.\n\nI'll update this after getting some drafting experience, maybe that can change my opinion dramatically.","August 27, 2015","false","41.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

You can buy cards with currency you earn by playing though.\n\nSolforge is a fun free to play collectible card game. It plays a bit differently than your average card game like Magic the Gathering and Hearthstone. There is no resource system, each turn you can place up to two cards into lanes on the play field. Cards can only battle the cards directly across from them (not counting special abilities) in that lane, so you'll need to place them to counter your opponent's cards.  When you play a card, it levels up, and a higher level version of that card goes into your discard pile. Every four turns you shuffle your discard pile into your deck so you can play more powerful cards. They can level from rank one all the way up to three.\n\nAfter you play your cards you can attack and if there is no card blocking your attacking cards you'll deal damage to the player. Your cards have a persistent health number, so weaker cards can eventually take down a more powerful one unless the player uses healing abilities or buffs. Some cards have the ability to switch lanes. There's a wide variety of card types, spells, and special abilities. There are pre-made decks or you can build your own.\n\nThe game is also available on iTunes and Google Play and your account is shared across platforms. So you'll have all of your cards whether you play on PC, Apple or Android devices. I tried playing it on my phone, but the cards were too hard to read so you'd have to play it on a tablet (unless you memorized what every card does).\n\nThe client needs some work. The cards and text are a little blurry when you play the game fullscreen so hopefully they'll be introducing higher resolution graphics later on, but it's still readable and works fine.\n\nOnce the game is out of Early Access I think it will be pretty great. It's free to play so it's worth trying out at least.","June 16, 2015","true","32.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/princeegg/recommended/232450/","princeegg","Aegon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/princeegg/","205 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nBack in January, I was a relatively new Hearthstone player who was also relatively new to card games in general. I was watching Brian Kibler's stream when he mentioned he was a developer for another free to play collectible card game: Solforge. He spoke a bit about it and I was intrigued enough to check it out.\n\nNow, in April and having played Solforge for a few months, I think I can speak enough about the game to warrant a review. Solforge has four factions and hundreds of cards. Games are played with creatures and spells, the former being placed in any of the five lanes and the latter having various effects. Creatures in lanes will "battle" opposing creatures in the same lane. If they are unopposed, they attack the player, removing a given amount of base HP. The first player to drop to zero, naturally, loses the game. As cards are played, they are discarded and "leveled", and when a rank is gained, the discard pile is shuffled and becomes the draw pile.\n\nIf you enjoy CCGs, you will *probably* enjoy Solforge. It has a generally great community, many of whom are always willing to share cards with new players to help them get on their feet, which is really important because, as with any CCG, new players begin with an inherent disadvantage as all the veterans have more cards. This is something that all CCGs struggle with, and not even Hearthstone has a solution for it. Another thing to note is that the developer, StoneBlade Entertainment (SBE), seems to really enjoy ridiculously strong cards. They update often (new cards, nerfs/buffs, etc), but in the few months that I've played they've nerfed some strong cards while leaving other glaringly, fun-suckingly strong cards like Wegu untouched. The card Herald of Destruction recently received a massive buff that makes it as un-fun to play against as Wegu. Luckily (?), there's no ranking system, so games can be conceded without a second thought when you discover your opponent is running one of those decks. (Caveat: beware that complaining about cards will occasionally be met with "get better" replies or other variants of the same thing from veterans who have played the game since Kickstarter and will defend all of SBE's decisions to the death)\n\nSolforge has some incredible art, like the Byzerak Frostmaiden[hypershotgaming.com] and the Cindersmoke Wyvern[i.imgur.com], and some pretty bad art, like the Weirwood Ranger[solforgespain.files.wordpress.com] and the Tarsus Necrolord[www.ghoxssocks.com], though apparently many of the latter cards are from the Kickstarter, where backers were somewhat poorly photoshopped onto cards.\n\nI would be remiss if I didn't mention the incredible Kaelari and his unofficial Solforge Ladder[solforgeladder.com], where you can chat with other players, participate in tournaments of various kinds (the best are the unheroic and unlegendary ones, where the really strong cards that new players won't have are "banned") for different prizes, set up trades, and actually participate in a ladder ranking system. Most of the stuff that Kaelari's site does should ideally have been done by the developers themselves as opposed to an unpaid third-party, but SBE is seemingly more focused on pumping out cards than they are with smoothing out what they already have. There is a downside to this ladder, however, and it's that most of its users are veterans, so if you queue up for a ladder or tournament game, it's very likely the person will be better than you. Other than release day for new sets of cards, the number of people who concurrently use the Ladder sits around 50. That means that if everyone's queued (which is never the case), you've got a solid chance of playing the same person more than once. Not enough of Solforge's several hundred daily users either know about the Ladder, or care enough to use it, which is a damn shame, and it'd probably be a different case if it wasn't third-party. Indie developers only have so much money, though.\n\nAs I said, I think StoneBlade needs change the focus from more new cards (which everyone loves), to doing things like meshing most of the Ladder's features into the game, overhauling the UI, and actually advertising the damn game. That being said, I'd still be hesitant to label this an Early Access game if it weren't for the big blue label on the store page (otherwise it'd just look like an indie game). Despite all its flaws, I do enjoy Solforge a whole lot and I implore you to give it a shot if you're even remotely interested. It's easier to get into than Hearthstone, as packs and cards in general are easier to acquire. SBE recently revamped the Draft (Arena) queue, where now you can pay 2 event tickets (acquired from your first win of the day) to draft 30 cards that you KEEP after the tournament, which is a fantastic value for new players.","April 6, 2015","true","212.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's a TCG. Compare it to an IRL one, where you HAVE to pay money (often LOTS of it)  to increase your collection, and it becomes FAR less so. Another is RNG. I've seen a few cards that use a "gain between 1 to 20 health" and similar, but frankly it doesn't detract that much from the game as you're just as likely to roll crap as you are fantastic.\n\nStart out facing the weakest AI level, build up your collection a little bit at a time. When you have collected 3 Event Tickets, start doing the Casual Draft - you keep the cards you draft, which will often include half a dozen Heroics, and are guaranteed at least 3 booster packs after you've played 4 matches with that deck. It's the fastest way to boost your collection. Don't bother buying booster packs with your earned silver, you can collect enough of those by playing, save it up for a Legendary chest.\n\nOne thing I wish would be implemented is an inbuilt chat and trade function: maybe it's already there but I haven't seen it.

You can buy cards with currency you earn by playing though.\n\nSolforge is a fun free to play collectible card game. It plays a bit differently than your average card game like Magic the Gathering and Hearthstone. There is no resource system, each turn you can place up to two cards into lanes on the play field. Cards can only battle the cards directly across from them (not counting special abilities) in that lane, so you'll need to place them to counter your opponent's cards.  When you play a card, it levels up, and a higher level version of that card goes into your discard pile. Every four turns you shuffle your discard pile into your deck so you can play more powerful cards. They can level from rank one all the way up to three.\n\nAfter you play your cards you can attack and if there is no card blocking your attacking cards you'll deal damage to the player. Your cards have a persistent health number, so weaker cards can eventually take down a more powerful one unless the player uses healing abilities or buffs. Some cards have the ability to switch lanes. There's a wide variety of card types, spells, and special abilities. There are pre-made decks or you can build your own.\n\nThe game is also available on iTunes and Google Play and your account is shared across platforms. So you'll have all of your cards whether you play on PC, Apple or Android devices. I tried playing it on my phone, but the cards were too hard to read so you'd have to play it on a tablet (unless you memorized what every card does).\n\nThe client needs some work. The cards and text are a little blurry when you play the game fullscreen so hopefully they'll be introducing higher resolution graphics later on, but it's still readable and works fine.\n\nOnce the game is out of Early Access I think it will be pretty great. It's free to play so it's worth trying out at least.","June 16, 2015","true","32.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I don't know how I'd be able to beat the boss when spell cards are not very viable against him, defend only minions would allow him to get higher rank cards and I lack "deathrattle" or powerful enough monsters to clear a lane (or all the lanes?) to finish him off after he activates some kind of a shield when reaching 0 HP.","April 17, 2015","false","2.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","2","4","2","3"

That, and my impression of the game has changed quite a bit, so I decided to delete the old review.\n\nThe core mechanic of Solforge, card leveling, is incredibly unique, to the point that a lot of people won't grasp how it affects deckbuilding and gameplay for a very long time.\n\nWhile SolForge seems like it doesn't have much strategy, it is actually incredibly deep, and every turn has very intricate decisions. You have to balance the desire to not fall behind on the board with leveling the cards that are going to help you win later. Using your life as a resource is imperitive when you are behind, and choices such as choosing the correct empty lane to put a creature into can be incredibly important. Tight play is rewarded very well in SolForge.\n\nDeckbuilding is also incredibly deep. You see your entire deck every game, which allows for narrow but powerful cards to be included in decks. When building, you have to plan the entire arc you want to follow in game. Do you plan to play very aggressively with powerful level 2 cards, or do you fill your deck with insane level 3 creatures, and build the rest of the deck to buy you time to get them out?\n\nThe leveling mechanic makes drafting SolForge incredible. Every game I play with draft decks feels unique, since different cards get leveled, based on what my opponent was playing.\n\nIn short, in a lot of ways, SolForge is too clever for its own good. The game's design is super simple, but the leveling mechanic has a ripple effect on strategy. I have so much fun brewing decks every day.","November 26, 2013","true","304.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Coupled with the fact I'm rather poor at giving feedback, I apologize in advance for this review's probably not being up to par with most peoples'. I'll be returning to this review to alter and add onto it, as I am oft wont to do; and just as well, as a read of what is below will demonstrate that in a single session, I cannot compose anything even remotely approaching the standards of an acceptably comprehensive body.\n\nDisclaimer: This review is based wholly upon my own experience and opinion of the game. I do not claim to speak for anyone else, nor presume to, nor do I believe my opinion to be factual, nor any closer to objective truth than anyone else's. I entrust the reader to understand this applies to the whole of the review, including sentences wherein clauses that disclaim this are absent.\n\n___\n\nLike more than a few 90's kids, I definitely met the Battle Card Genre growing up. The Pokemon Trading Card Game; Yu-Gi-Oh; Digimon; and many more battle card games caught the interest of so many others in my age group (and beyond, even!). All of these were very popular, I took a look at all of them- and I never took to any of them. The Battle Card game genre was simply not for me, and still largely hasn't been.\n\nEven so, there's been something interesting about the genre and many of its products in my opinion, even from a distance. So I've spent time of late looking for one that I might be able to enjoy. Countless ones, I've read of, seen numerous demonstrations for, and found myself uninterested in, just like old times.\n\nThen, the two nights preceding the one wherein I write this review, I gave it another try. I found two very interesting prospective games. One, is Infinity Wars. It looks amazing, and I'd love to try it, but it commands space my potato cannot provide.\n\nThe other is SolForge.\n\nWell, I installed it last night, started playing today, and if my impressions must be expressed in a single sentence, let it be this: I, someone who has never played a battle card game before, like, perhaps even am finding love for, this game.\n\nI must start with the gameplay itself. As most reading this probably know, the game's playing area consists of ten spaces in a five-by-two arrangement. One strip of five is used by each of the two players; each space can be occupied by a card. In my opinion, this provides enough room for strategy to truly matter, while at the same time not intimidating a player as the presentation of a vast field can sometimes do. This having been said, a somewhat claustrophobic feeling often sets in when placing a card, adding a feeling of tension that can throw a player off-focus- which, in my opinion, is very satisfying to focus through the fog of.\n\nCards come in two variants: Creature and Spell. Creature cards have two statistics, Attack Power and Health, and most of them have a special ability (and/or multiple ones, in the case of some cards) There are four main factions, each with its own pool of cards. Once again, simplicity that provides room for complexity.\n\nThere are many other rules of the game that I'd love to individually praise, but I realize this is dragging on. I'll probably return to add onto the list and give my critique of each element of the gameplay that I can in kind on one of the aforementioned review edits I'm bound to do. Until then, let us move on.\n\nThe instilling of a feeling of tension mentioned in the paragraph about the playing field is just as well, as the cards in this game represent troops fighting and dying within the game's fictional universe. That brings me to what I'd like to talk about next: The appeal thereof.\n\nIn my opinion, the creators of this game have done a splendid job of making the lore and universe of this game very interesting. Each of the four main factions has its own unique characters, locations, and (most notably in my mind) culture and elements there-comprising, including their own unique ideals, established government, and general mindset toward life, the world, and even to each other. If you are interested, I'd advise to go to the developers' official website for the game and read their lore section. The descriptions there are highly descriptive, and will give you an idea of the world one is stepping into. There are no direct third-person descriptions of such nature in the game itself, ironically, nor any link to the official website- something I have mixed feelings about.\n\nEven though direct explanations are not provided in the game itself, the game's universe does shine through- and how! In the campaign modes, the "Info" bubbles often relay colorful descriptions of the setting in which your avatar (you?) find(s) her/him/yourself, and/or interactions with the culture of the given faction that one will be facing off against.\n\nAdditionally, and in my opinion most noticeably, the images on the cards themselves associated with each faction give insight into the creatures, constructs, and, in particular, the people and, again, culture of that faction. In my eyes and mind, the characters themselves, their attire, their stances and activities, anything they might be holding, the setting each one is portrayed in, even the variations between the images for the different variations in each card, each and all seem to portray living beings with stories to tell, things to show, and a culture/environment/etc. to go back to after the dust of battle has settled. I find myself imagining what they do in peace-time, and in different situations, what a day in each one's life is like. Numerous specific examples swarm my mind, which I've been tripping over myself on my keyboard trying to type as examples, before finally deciding to leave it at this and hope it is moderately acceptable in the way of portraying my opinion of the developers' success. As I look at this paragraph, I am aghast at the degree to which I have utterly failed to express my true wonderment, and opinion of the importance that each card's image plays in picturing the fictional universe. Perhaps I'll come back and go into further detail.\n\nOn this note, the artistry of the images themselves is, in my opinion, utterly breathtaking. Even outside of what it does in communicating each character's place in the fictional universe and as an extension thereof, there is much, in my opinion, to be admired. The lighting, shading, and coloration of each item and creature make each one feasible to visualize existing and moving in real, three-dimensional space, even with the obvious fantastical flair of the objects and creatures themselves.\n\n\nThere are other elements of this game that are meritorious of praise. I also fully intend to go back and add onto, edit, and otherwise adjust each and every paragraph to be more descriptive, and adhere more loyally to the purpose of describing the experience that I have with this game. Additionally, there are numerous elements of the game I've not yet experienced, such any of the campaign missions beyond the first four, or the Multiplayer mode.\n\nFrom one who never liked battle card games before, and is still wary of them for the most part, this game receives a hearty recommendation. If you're interested in battle card games, and/or otherwise turn-based strategy, and you have five-hundred Megabytes to spare on your hard drive, I would recommend giving this game a try. Though there are card packs for sale (none of which I've yet patronized), the game itself is free of monetary cost. Worst case scenario, uninstall if you don't like, no less the wealthy for having tried it.\n\n(Review created/posed 11/23/2015, 10:17 PM, GMT-6.

Being an EA game (something should change here, EA game means something evil and should not be attributed to early access games) I guess missing stuff is normal. Even though, IMO ranked MP for games like these is a core feature, not something one should plan to implement at a later date. Right up there with "make an online gameplay system" regarding priority.\n\nMy gripe with this game is its economy system. I simply have to compare it with Scrolls because there are many similarities. I'm personally not that much into competitive play and in this regard this game really doesn't offer much, past some OK campaign missions and a sub par AI with 0 rewards. Collecting cards and building decks would be interesting to me, had it not been for some problems.\n\nSo, in scrolls you had (at the time I still played the game a few months back)\n\n- 360 cards in 4 factions\n- possibility to make some 1k gold daily, with a few daily trials and maybe one AI match. 1 hour tops, doable in 30 minutes.\n- with 1k gold you could purchase a pack of ten random cards, of which one was guaranteed to be a rare card and another two were uncommons. There was also a chance of about 10-20% to receive an 11th, higher tier card.\n- standard decks typically require one faction so upon choosing your color you practically had a pool of 90 cards from which you could choose.\n- most expensive cards on the market went for about 1800 gold, which in effect would be an equivalent of 5 LOST online matches, something like 2 hours of your time.\n- as long as you managed to put up a decent fight, online losses were rewarded nicely. AI matches were also rewarded, less handsomely, but the same principle applies - more fighting means more gold.\n- there were precon decks which went for 5k and 8k gold so all in all, if you wanted to build a specific deck you could do so without grinding to death. Say, two hours daily for a month should net you 60 to 80k with which you can build almost any deck you want. If you were good in competitive play you could net even more easily.\n\nIn SolForge you have:\n- around 570 cards, not really sure how to check the grand total nor how many are there per faction since the interface is lacking in some regards.\n- easy daily rewards which require three victories against anyone, netting about 2.5k silver, two packs containing 6 random cards and a ticket which you need for online events. This requires about a half an hour of your time, if you played against easy AI probably doable in 15 minutes.\n- these packs guarantee only one rare card and offer a decent chance of getting some heroic and legendary cards. The problem is you are getting 6 from a pool of ~570. Compared to 10 out of 360 from Scrolls, which also gave one highest tier card guaranteed, this is quite bad.\n- to make things worse, forging prices are rather high. Common cards go for 150, rares go for 1400, heroic 32500 and legendary 142500 silver. If you decide to build a specific deck with say 15 heroic and 15 legendary cards you will need 2625000 silver which is an equivalent of about 1000 days of daily rewards.\n- online victories net 250 gold, max 10 daily I think so that could split above 1000 to 500 days of grinding, but with a lets say more significant time investment.\n- there are preconstructed decks for purchase and a sharing system so that, as long as you can find someone with whom you might share, you can cut deck costs to about $5 a piece.\n- there is also the option to earn some cards in the drafting portion of the game, which seems interesting and I'd like to get to know the cards a bit better before getting into that. You can play one casual draft match every three days for free, as things stand now.\n\nAll in all, it is my opinion that, as a card collection game, SolForge sucks due to a bad business model. IMO. Even more so for new players.\n\nI'll update this after getting some drafting experience, maybe that can change my opinion dramatically.","August 27, 2015","false","41.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/recommended/232450/","colonsimulator","Hippo Turtle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/","1772 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThe developers of this game are simply awful. Some of the worst around. SolForge was released on Steam in March of 2013 as an Early Access title and its current development status is still very close to what it was back then. There is usually only one update per year. Sometimes two updates per year if we're lucky and those updates change very little about the game client and user interface. The developers care more about releasing new cards than patching and fixing the game client and user interface, which is currently the equivalent of a phone game from about the year 2006. Due to the developers' decisions and unbelievably slow progress, the player-base has been getting smaller and smaller. The death of this game is near and the developers have practically abandoned any prospect of a positive future as the updates come rarely and slowly. I haven't actually played a SolForge match in over two years. The only reason why I still have it installed and why I still load it every day is because I stupidly and regretfully spent money on it. Every day I load the game only to get the daily rewards. At least that way I don't feel as bad for wasting money on this worthless piece of software and on awful developers.\n\nDon't be like me. Don't waste your time and money on a product that has been developed like garbage by despicable developers who couldn't care less.\n\nSolForge is a disaster.","April 26","false","431.9"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","6","12","0","0"

I mean, I can\'t even get into a game. Solforge won\'t let me. The pack opening, while it tries to be more organic and true to a traditional paper and ink card game (such as Cardfight Vanguard and Future Card Buddyfight) it just seems clunkier compared to the old way of opening packs.\n\nThe new release of a game should be a step forward, improving things that need improving, and highlighting aspects that are good. The new update doesn\'t really hold true to this so far. Only time will tell if they can move forward and try to make a game that can hold its own against Hearthstone eventually.","May 31","false","243.7"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bearsman6/recommended/232450/","bearsman6","Zan (bearsman6)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bearsman6/","29 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSolForge is another entry into the recently-full group of Collectible Card Games, but it takes a fresh and unique approach to the otherwise-tired genre. Gone are the typical Magic:the Gathering clone features -- it removes the single card draw at the start of the turn, the 60 card deck slot, and even the concept of a graveyard. Instead, you get an incredibly deep, strategic system that demands you plan ahead, but flexibly (since RNG is still going to determine which cards you see).\n\nThe most interesting part of the game is also its core: the cards you play level up each time you play them, to a maximum of level 3. Each time you level a card, it gets more powerful, sometimes exponentially so. But what makes this more strategic is that every 4 turns you reshuffle your played or discarded cards back into your deck. Since you draw 5 cards a turn, you're seeing 2/3 of your 30-card deck every 4 turns. It adds an insane level of consistency to your draws, if you plan accordingly.\n\nAll in all, it's a game that's got a lot more depth than your typical CCG, and it is entirely Free-to-Play if you're willing to take a beating at first. (It takes about a month to really build the card pool based on the current daily rewards, but they're working to improve that too.)

After a few hours I was playing on hard against the computer, which is just right for me (I lose, I win, I groan at missing the obvious move after ending my turn, I am happy when I manage to turn the table from a bad start,...).\n\nGameplay: You play creature or spell cards against an opponent, taking turns. Creatures have attack and health, and some have nifty special abilities. That and the spells is what makes this so fun and always different every game. Do you play a spell that gives one of your own creatures +3 attack, stolen from a creature the opponent has, or do you play a creature that can hit anyone with its attack on the next turn? Playing a card also means it's better next time you are dealt it (each has 3 levels), look to the future! You only get 5 cards to pick from every turn (exceptions may come with new, non-starter deck cards).\n\nThe game is also very nice at asking you to confirm stuff that isn't really good for you.\n\nYou start with 2 decks of 30 cards each, of which you can use either, or a combination you make yourself from the cards in them. To start with the opponent is the computer on easy, normal, or hard, whose decks you can also decide.\n\nI eventually caved in and signed up on their site for the rewards you can get. (For logging in, winning 1 game, and winning 3 games, once every 24h.) And I already got some nifty new cards to use and in-game currency to buy moar cards, all for free!\n\nThis also enables me to make my own decks, with said nifty new cards! Only restriction is that you can combine only 2 of the 4 different groups of cards (kinda robots, elements, undead, and nature) per deck. But you can make more than the obvious 6 different combos, with all the cards you soon pile up!\n\nThere is the option to use real money, but from what I can see and read in discussions, everything can be had without that.\n\nAnd  I'd like to play with friends (you need to sign up too, for that). I'm too much of  a coward to play with random strangers yet (also an option when you're logged in).\n\nPlus there's tournaments for folks who are into that!\n\nHere's some screenshots.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=206888740\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=206932525\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=211887233\n\n(Edited for some more info.)","December 31, 2013","true","189.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Many possible deck variations choosing from 4 different card pools. Nice short games (usually). Very generous with booster pack unlocks and in-game currency. Syncs with mobile versions of the game. Nice level-up mechanic that introduces addition strategy into the very act of playing the cards. Simple, easy to read interface. Great artwork and some of the cards have a neat evolution of appearance as the cards level up. Recent updates slowly add a new expansion set of cards.\n\nThe Bad: A bit simple if you're a veteran of Magic: the Gathering. Hard to see what the opponent plays sometimes because it flashes by too quickly (although you can go back to the log to look). Only 4 schools/houses of spells. Not as well polished as Hearthstone which has nice spell animations and creature sounds and highlights spells and effects as they happen. Deck construction is a little messy the way the cards are displayed although the filters do help. Slightly clunky menus and interface in general.\n\nOverall: Great card game that is worth spending your time in. Great on the go, especially if you link the game to a mobile device. Simpler than Magic but still fun. Lacks the polish and oomph of Hearthstone's sound and animation but far more generous with free card/booster unlocks and in-game currency. That's honestly the main thing that really keeps me hooked to logging in daily. Otherwise, I'd probaly spend more time grinding Blizzard's game which requires a lot more grinding to unlock cards unless you want to spend cash. Ultimately, I am divided between both online CCGs and find them both equally enjoyable in different ways.","April 7, 2014","true","1.0"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

I can only assume it isn't common enough to be worth their time to figure out what it is. After trying a bunch of different things on my own I gave up in mid  August which is when they went gold with it.\n\nFull disclosure: I do have the game installed on my laptop too and that works fine but I rarely use my Laptop at home (where I have a guaranteed internet connection) and when I do go out with it I usually have other things I need doing instead. Sol Forge seems like a fairly basic game but I can't really say whether I like it or not since I've never played a person with it, only the bots which are predictably bad.\n\nMy "no" is with the caveat that is you like simpler CCGs and don't want to really think too much during play then Sol Forge might fit your bill. But Caveat Emptor. There are no refunds (if you buy packs and then find it suddenly doesn't work for some reason) and no one will care if it doesn't work for you.\n\nMy initial reason for getting Early Access had less to do with what I knew about the game (not a lot) and more to do with who was making it. Brian Kibler, Justin Gary and crew have been involved with CCGs for a very long time indeed and have some amazing credentials between them. I've never gotten a chance to play their other big game Ascension but as I understand it, it is quite elegant and powerfully fun. Sadly Sol Forge didn't strike me that way though it has its charms.\n\nThe 5 factions are I assume just the beginning of the diversity as I am sure many sets will be produced eventually. I hope someday I have something more positive to say about the game.","November 28, 2013","false","11.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

There's not too much strategy to the gameplay itself since there's no mana system and you just play 2 cards a turn. While the previews talk about "leveling up" and "evolving" your cards, the way it really works isn't what you would expect. Instead of altering the card on the battlefield, playing a card puts the next level or evolution of the card into your deck, which you can play once you hit a certain point in the game.\n\nI'll try this game out again when it fully launches, but it isn't complex or engaging enough to really hold me, and it's difficult to get the better cards when playing for free.","January 5, 2014","false","6.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The UI isn't as nice as it could be, and frankly it feels worse than Hearthstone overall. And, like all F2P CCGs on the computer, it is vastly inferior to Magic: The Gathering.\n\nWhy can't any of these games be as good as Magic? Who knows.\n\nThis game's central mechanic is the idea of levelling cards during a match - by playing a card, you get a better version of the card shuffled into your deck in the future. This means that over the course of the game, your cards (and your opponent's cards) get progressively stronger. This leads to, in principle, an interesting tension of now vs later, but the reality is that the best cards are simply good now and even better later, and while there are some trade-offs, and there is some strategy involved, in the end it isn't really all that amazing.\n\nIt was a valiant effort, but frankly, you're better off playing a real game.","January 31, 2015","false","3.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

A feature which really sets it aside, is that once a card is cast, it levels to the next tier, adding new abilities and stronger stats the next time it is drawn.

The card art is great for the most part. Each creature card has 3 levels, and the card art changes as the card gets stronger mid game. A really unique mechanic and it's fun to have the game evolve to a stronger and stronger level as time goes on.\n\nThere's no mana in the game, so you can play any two cards in your hand during you turn, with the hand being entirely rerolled each turning, giving weight to the decision of which cards to play. This is because each time you play a card, you level it up, so the next time you draw the card, it'll be one level higher, often unlocking new abilities.\n\nThe game's not flawless though, there's not nearly the same amount of polish as a game like Hearthstone, and there's no visible ranking, although the game has a hidden ELO system, and there's a new UI incoming.\n\nThere's a great card selection, easily over 400 cards, if my math is right. A bunch of different types of spells and creatures, although there is some overlap between them. The best part about the game is that it basically throws currency at you, so you're able to buy a ♥♥♥♥ ton of basic cards. You get about 2000 to log in each day, and the most common of the cards can be bought for 150. I respect that, and I'm alright with there being rarer cards worth up to 34k. The game's free to play, they need to make money somehow.\n\nOverall, I heartily recommend the game.\n","January 2, 2015","true","41.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The great thing about Solforge is that all you have to do is login once a day and/or win a game and you get free cards and Silver.  The Silver you win can even be used to purchase additional booster packs with more cards!  After a week or two of playing the computer, I had a decent enough collection to build my own decks and play against others online.\n\nIf you download the android version, it syncs with your PC account so you can take your collection with you to the toilet.\n\nThe game isn't perfect.  I think the interface could be improved especially in deck building mode.  This is more of an issue with the mobile version of Solforge as opposed to the PC version.  There are still some balance issues to work out with individual cards but that's what patches are for.  Some players will let the timer run out on their turn if they are losing and force you to sit there for 10 minutes because they refuse to concede.  This is more of an issue with the community rather than the game but it's the only time I have ever been frustrated with Solforge.\n\nIf you are a fan of Magic: The Gathering or Adventure Time's Card Wars, you will enjoy Solforge.

Not saying they're all broken, but since they're ubisoft products, they usually are.\n\nSimilar to hearthstone, better in some ways (card selection), worse in others (pvp match timers)\n\nGood:\n- AI can provide a decent challenge on hard mode (when you first start out) since you can let it randomly use some of your best decks (or not).\n-It's NOT P2W, no matter what anyone says. If they need to p2w then they're doing something seriously wrong. I do quite well for myself and have built a competitive number of decks just by doing dailies and competing in tournaments.  The game gives you quite a large number of good cards without having to buy extras - especially with the new campaign rewards.\n- There's good balance amongst the factions\n- lots of different ways to build your decks, you can combine 2 factions, or just go with 1, using as much or as little mixing as you want\n- the cards themselves are well thought out and balanced, and the artwork is nice\n- it's a nicely paced game, if you enjoy taking your time while you drink coffee or eat\n- you can play multiple games at once, so you can play against the AI and a few opponents at once if that's your style\n- lots of features and well thought out, simple, UI\n\nBad:\n- the timed pvp matches are WAY too long. It's a good amount of time if you're not in a hurry or playing multiple opponents, but often an opponent will go AFK on you for most or all of the match, leaving you to forfeit or wait till the 20 minute timer is up. Each turn should be timed IMO, instead of the entire match being timed.\n- Servers seem really unstable lately (May 2015), physical infrastructure support is needed.\n- Client is really sluggish, too much loading, time between loading, and glitches\n\n\n- Not sure what the "Early Access" thing is about, I've been playing for like a year already","October 26, 2014","true","475.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","2"

You can not directly choose which of your characters attacks the enemy characters nor can you directly choose which of your characters blocks the enemy characters.

Very old-school mechanic which have been repeated by games like Battlegrounds with almost no success.\n\nMy review is based on about an hour of gameplay so that must be considered.  However, I don't see much value in this game when other free-to-play games are much better.

Example: i played a game vs a guy who summoned 3-4 creatures the whole game. his legendaries were far more powerful than anything i could summon, and he then used his legendary spells to continuously augment them. the game was horribly painful for me.\n\ntimer: this has been mentioned again and again, but even as i write my review this is happening. you have a thrilling game. your enemy is at 6 hp and you are at 7, but your position is finally overpowering & he is going to lose in 1 or 2 turns after you overwhelm his defences. well guess what, the game has a 20 minute timer per player and sore losing is always an option, right? so if he has 15 minutes left be prepared for a 15 minute wait. Actually, scratch that. what he will probably do, like many others, is wait 14 minutes. by then he is hoping you are doing something else, and he will make a move. if you are doing something else and not paying attention, now YOUR timer will run out, and YOU lose.\n\nhaha so fun. trolling BUILT INTO the game for losers to exploit how great.\n\ndraft play: well this WOULD be fun, but honestly is just kind of makes the whole game silly. it's a CCG, and now instead of being a CCG it's just a card game. i guess if this is the only mode you will ever play i can honestly recommend this game.\n\nA NOTE: dont assume most players you meet will be playing with just the free cards. people spend enormous amounts of money on iaps, and this game is no different. odds are you will get crushed, ESPECIALLY if you are a new player entering the playerbase at this time.\n\nthe saddest part of all this is that it's easily fixable by introducing a matchmaking mechanic similar to the one found in banner saga. every card can be given a value based on it's rarity: then players can be matched up to people whose decks "total rarity" is similar to your decks. that would make things pretty fair, as it would all be up to skill at that point.\n\nthe devs will NEVER do this. do you know why? they want you to get crushed. they want your soul to get crushed. because then you will spend money.\n\nso just go away now.","March 7","false","234.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

In my honest opinion I love this game, it has a very unique gameplay in which you level up your cards as you play them, offering some interesting combos and themed fights that will be diverse with each duel depending on what you level. It's complex, yet simple.

Unlike a lot of these, you can easily play for free and have a great time.  My favorite feature is the untimed games, so you can take your turn when you have a couple minutes, and put it down until you're free again, by which time your opponent usually has gone.  Makes it much easier than setting aside a chunk of time to actually play out a full match.","October 28, 2014","true","3.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Also there are some bugs in it, like you can't have the same avatar all the time, sometimes the cards doesn't work (for example once Weirwood Patriarch gave it's bonus to lvl 1  Spirng Dryad which had no extra +1/+1 when entering the field, other times not), and there are days when the computer literally works against the player. I've seen people making combos which have chances to be possible below 0%, like drawing 2 Legendary cards in simple draft, or putting down two creatures and getting them back lvl 2 on the next round, or getting Solstice Reveler IN EVERY TURN when it worked but always upgraded. And as usual, it's impossible to defeat the rich kids, who have 3 Oros and 3 Varna's Pact in one deck...\n\nAs a cardgame it's inventive and enjoyable, but the little bad things make it a suffering on long terms.","July 15, 2014","true","357.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I look at it as a great way to isolate and decompress my day for 15-20 minutes at a time. The game is pretty rewarding with its daily challenges. If you start off expecting to have under-powered decks (as you would in MTG) without spending money and stick to just getting the dailys done as best you can you will be happy with the result. After doing drafts once or twice you will see the cycle that works for players in the solforge f2p ccommunity.\n\nThis game offers both strategic, indepth thoughtful plays with fully-sculpted decks and it also offers very casual games amongst friends. Playing with a single buddy is a great way to start off for getting rewards and improving your own play.\n\nA buddy of mine introduced me to it and I can say after 2-3 weeks of playing that I'm satisfied with what the game is. If you look at it as an actual indulgence and spend money, you find yourself playing amongst other tacticions who bring overwheling deck strategies and scary combos. And that makes YOU want to build those, unleashing horror on poor first-timer nooblets.\n\n6/10.

If you like card games, you will probably like it a lot.  If you don't, you might still like it because it has a very unique and intuitive ruleset.  I love the card transformation mechanic, I like that decks are consistent (discards are shuffled back into the deck).  I like the five lanes and the way creature battles work--it simulates a battle on multiple fronts--though I think I would like it if you could choose on your turn for your creature not to attack (you could make it a defender, but that's a permanent solution to a temporary problem).  Because of all of these mechanics, this is also a good example of a card game that wouldn't work at all in physical form--it would be a pain in the ♥♥♥ to do all of that by hand.\n\nThe deck builder is rather well done, though I wish I could rescale the card size so I could view more of them at once (you can do it in text only, but I like to see the card).  The number of cards of that type you own is also right over the flavor text, which is annoying.  Deck building mechanics are similarly simple, yet interesting; there are four schools/kingdoms/worlds/colors/whatever and you can have no more than two in your deck.  You must have 30 cards in your deck.  Easy.  I normally don't like deck building--I'm a draft/arena kind of guy, from my M:tG days to the present with Hearthstone, but this game makes it simple enough to be fun.\n\nThe AI is also really good. I like to play against the computer primarily because I mostly just build decks and test them.  Hard computer is formidible enough to be interesting. If I've built a solid deck, I can beat them almost every time, even if they're using the same deck.  It is tuned to be a rather good gauge, I think.\n\nTL;DR: It's free, it's easy to learn, there are a lot of interesting mechanics and interplay between them, and it's fun as hell.","August 29, 2014","true","153.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You only really get free points to buy additional cards with from the dailies (login, first win, and third win) with minimal point gains on pvp wins beyond your first. There are also tournaments that you can enter using tickets that you obtain from pvp wins that can get you some cards even if you lose horribly.\n\nAlso as much as you can build a strategic deck and increase your chances of winning, this game is still very luck based and I have lost many many games purely because I get nothing useful in my hand (even with some of the prebuilt decks the game provides). This also applies to draft tournaments (where you build a deck off random cards the game gives you), where I have have had times where I was given only low tier cards, only to find my opponents having legendaries and many heroics (common -> rare -> heroic -> legendary) in their decks.\n\nThis game is early access though, so I hope they fix up some of these annoying mechanics and add ways to make your deck at least a little more reliable. I'll recommend it for now as it is free, and you can always get a head start on your card collection for when its polished up and released.","June 21, 2014","true","37.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Most have a system where there are multiple colours/factions/races and there are some differing mechanics to how you can construct a deck.\n\nOk, onto the game itself. The first thing will strke you about this game is the ease of learning it. I remember learning the mechanics in maybe 15minutes after playing the tutorials and a game or two - something not even remotely possible for more complex games like M:TG. This is actually good for players new to the genre, so as not to build fustration before getting into the game. Play on a bit more and you will also learn that learning is not mastering, and to beat other human players(and the hard AI as well), you will likely need to build a decent deck -- which brings me to the concept of deck building and building the collection of cards(because you obviously can't build a deck without cards).\n\nDeck building in Solforge is super simple, with less things to ponder about like lands and the other myriad of card types in other card games. In Solforge, there are only two card types -creatures and spells- and no consideration of off turn acitivity like counterspells and such. Your deck can comprise of up to 2 factions(there are 4), and must have a minimum of 30 cards. That's pretty much it, but as I said if you are new to the genre, you will probably need some time to build a good deck. Along the way, you will realise losing is part of the process of deck-building-- what works in theory may often not pan out in actual games.\n\nI will imagine new players having a little trouble getting some decks up in the first month or two while they build up their card collection. I started with 20 blue packs(some early puchase deal of sorts) as well as having the early access benefit of having access to all cards to experiment(just to play, not own them). However, the one BIG plus about the game is the speed of earning rewards. In solforge, there are 3 daily rewards(login, 1win and 3 win reward) and 1 for winning an online game. You may get boosters or individual cards, and will always earn silver, which may be used to buy any card which you already own. This system is especially useful if you dont wan't to blow like $10?(not sure how much exactly) on a single legendary which you may need more copies of to play around with.I recommend new players to play the easy/normal AI for a week or 2 to earn some rewards and build a deck before playing the hard AI or humans.Overall, having recently tested a couple of other games, I will say the rewards system in SF is pretty generous.\n\nThe gameplay mechanic revolves around the "ranking up" system of cards where often cards that are weaker early on are more powerful at rank 2 or 3. There may be a few exceptions to this balance, but these are almost always legendary cards. Actual turns consist of 2 actions - either a spell, or a creature played down to one of the 5 lanes. Creatures in a lane fight against the opposing creature in the same lane every turn, so no tapping or assigning blockers needed. Despite the relative simplicity of the game I feel like it remains relevant and fun.I came from being in the chess club back in school and my only gripe is the RNG factor of drawing the big rank 3 cards during the first turn of rank 3, but coming to a card game you have to accept some random luck factor will be unavoidable. Overall, for players like me who may not want to spend hours everyday figuring out the next meta-defining deck, combining generous rewards and simple gameplay makes Solforge a good 30minutes-a-day to destress type of game. For more experienced card gamers looking for a complex challenge, I'm not the right person to give you an opinion - however, having dabbled with M:TG like 15+ years ago I'll say that M:TG definitely feels more intense to me.\n\nLastly, I would make some suggestions which would make the game enjoyable. First, would be to slightly lower the prices of the cards. I'm not sure about the rest, but the only time I've spent money on this game is during sales. I have spent $100, which for a year isn't that much but not that little either, but overall I think the prices on decks/packs as well as tournament tickets to be a little too high. Regarding the gameplay and game types, the developers are currently working on a campaign, but if they are reading this, I would really like to see downloadable AI decks. These decks could be from online tournaments held,etc, but for players like me who mostly only play draft format online and are not competitive enough to play tournaments and all, having a chance to see these decks in action may be fun. Playing against the AI(using my own decks) can be tiresome after a while, and not everyone can afford to spend that much time waiting around for online opponents or human players taking their time etc.\n\nOverall - 7/10. For a free game, worthy of spending some time on it.\nPros: Easy to learn, generous rewards, very low time commitment\nCons:Expensive cards, limited game types or preconstructed decks to play against","September 1, 2014","true","297.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

(I've played hearthstone and a bunch of others.)\n\nThe thing that I love most about this is you don't need to play against random players to actually get cards and feel like you're progressing. I've played my entire time with my girlfriend and I still get the same rewards as anyone else who plays with randoms. We've both gotten plenty of legendaries too. It's not at all necessary to buy cards.

Most have a system where there are multiple colours/factions/races and there are some differing mechanics to how you can construct a deck.\n\nOk, onto the game itself. The first thing will strke you about this game is the ease of learning it. I remember learning the mechanics in maybe 15minutes after playing the tutorials and a game or two - something not even remotely possible for more complex games like M:TG. This is actually good for players new to the genre, so as not to build fustration before getting into the game. Play on a bit more and you will also learn that learning is not mastering, and to beat other human players(and the hard AI as well), you will likely need to build a decent deck -- which brings me to the concept of deck building and building the collection of cards(because you obviously can't build a deck without cards).\n\nDeck building in Solforge is super simple, with less things to ponder about like lands and the other myriad of card types in other card games. In Solforge, there are only two card types -creatures and spells- and no consideration of off turn acitivity like counterspells and such. Your deck can comprise of up to 2 factions(there are 4), and must have a minimum of 30 cards. That's pretty much it, but as I said if you are new to the genre, you will probably need some time to build a good deck. Along the way, you will realise losing is part of the process of deck-building-- what works in theory may often not pan out in actual games.\n\nI will imagine new players having a little trouble getting some decks up in the first month or two while they build up their card collection. I started with 20 blue packs(some early puchase deal of sorts) as well as having the early access benefit of having access to all cards to experiment(just to play, not own them). However, the one BIG plus about the game is the speed of earning rewards. In solforge, there are 3 daily rewards(login, 1win and 3 win reward) and 1 for winning an online game. You may get boosters or individual cards, and will always earn silver, which may be used to buy any card which you already own. This system is especially useful if you dont wan't to blow like $10?(not sure how much exactly) on a single legendary which you may need more copies of to play around with.I recommend new players to play the easy/normal AI for a week or 2 to earn some rewards and build a deck before playing the hard AI or humans.Overall, having recently tested a couple of other games, I will say the rewards system in SF is pretty generous.\n\nThe gameplay mechanic revolves around the "ranking up" system of cards where often cards that are weaker early on are more powerful at rank 2 or 3. There may be a few exceptions to this balance, but these are almost always legendary cards. Actual turns consist of 2 actions - either a spell, or a creature played down to one of the 5 lanes. Creatures in a lane fight against the opposing creature in the same lane every turn, so no tapping or assigning blockers needed. Despite the relative simplicity of the game I feel like it remains relevant and fun.I came from being in the chess club back in school and my only gripe is the RNG factor of drawing the big rank 3 cards during the first turn of rank 3, but coming to a card game you have to accept some random luck factor will be unavoidable. Overall, for players like me who may not want to spend hours everyday figuring out the next meta-defining deck, combining generous rewards and simple gameplay makes Solforge a good 30minutes-a-day to destress type of game. For more experienced card gamers looking for a complex challenge, I'm not the right person to give you an opinion - however, having dabbled with M:TG like 15+ years ago I'll say that M:TG definitely feels more intense to me.\n\nLastly, I would make some suggestions which would make the game enjoyable. First, would be to slightly lower the prices of the cards. I'm not sure about the rest, but the only time I've spent money on this game is during sales. I have spent $100, which for a year isn't that much but not that little either, but overall I think the prices on decks/packs as well as tournament tickets to be a little too high. Regarding the gameplay and game types, the developers are currently working on a campaign, but if they are reading this, I would really like to see downloadable AI decks. These decks could be from online tournaments held,etc, but for players like me who mostly only play draft format online and are not competitive enough to play tournaments and all, having a chance to see these decks in action may be fun. Playing against the AI(using my own decks) can be tiresome after a while, and not everyone can afford to spend that much time waiting around for online opponents or human players taking their time etc.\n\nOverall - 7/10. For a free game, worthy of spending some time on it.\nPros: Easy to learn, generous rewards, very low time commitment\nCons:Expensive cards, limited game types or preconstructed decks to play against","September 1, 2014","true","297.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

(I've played hearthstone and a bunch of others.)\n\nThe thing that I love most about this is you don't need to play against random players to actually get cards and feel like you're progressing. I've played my entire time with my girlfriend and I still get the same rewards as anyone else who plays with randoms. We've both gotten plenty of legendaries too. It's not at all necessary to buy cards. It got updated recently to add 100 + cards or something too which is really nice.\n\nThe game itself is also pretty simple and there is an RNG factor of course (like all card games) but it really does depend on how you play and set up your deck. If you just wanna play a card game with your friends and not stinky randoms, this game is perfect.\n\nI've never understood why games like hearthstone demand you play against randoms to actually get cards. especially when you can just buy them anyway. ANYWAY OK THANKS BYE ILU.\n\nGame is a good free card thing. A bit cheap looking at times.

The game is not at the level of smart one would have hoped for it to be.  Really, with the game as it stands, it is a troll game once you start to get good cards.  The only skil it seems to foster is in draft games: you need to be a good shopper and pick the best produce to fit in in your basket - then pretty much let the game run itself on auto pilot when you play.  Very rarely do you get to use your brain in this game, because:\n\n1) card shuffle randomness\n2) there is no deck for every situation\n3) does your battle of the bulge beat your opponents blitz?\n4) rarely does using multiple spells combat simply very strong creature cards- so being cute, fancy or inspired doesn't cut it in most matches against nerd players.\n\nFinally, there are a ton of FTP card games out there that have a much more involved system than this one.

A card might be bad now at Lv1 but during the match it might be better at Lv2 so do I play it now in order to level it up or do I stick to my better cards now?\n\nTheir is a lot I would have to explain about the game in order for this review to make sense and honestly even then it would sound confusing so you are better of trying this game out if you like card games.\n\nTheir is an active player pool still playing even after 2 years and the game is taking the usual cardgame routes in terms of playstyles but the in-match leveling system really sets Solforge apart from its competitors and that is probably why Solforge is still going strong.\n\nSolforge is not for everyone, it is middle of the road as far as card games go but it is still young and the expansion packs have really shaken up the formula for how you play this game because originally it had some flaws to put it mildly whereas now it is a deep and engaging experience both creating and playing your deck.\n\nAs far as I am aware, ELO rating is not implemented yet which I am fine with because matches give no rewards. Win 3 games per day (even against AI, or oddly even from the AI fighting itself) and thats it for the day. No more and no less. The game does have a cash shop, its free to play so of course it does but outside of that everyone is pretty limited in how many cards they can farm a day and while that is okay it does also make playing feel kind of hollow at times because you may need a card to finish your planned deck and after your three wins of the day you are out of options.\n\nOr you can pay, of course. Even if you do though their is no in-game ladder showing who is #1 etc and while that may be planned in the future if you are the kind to spend money on games like this be aware that you don't get any kind of trophy to show for your wins but on the flipside if you are not very good at card games then no one can see your low rank in this game so you are classed as equal amongst your peers which is a rare oddity in a competitive game.\n\nMatches are too random though so the game is terrible in the face of its competition.\n\nJoin Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needs\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews","March 22, 2014","false","99.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Choose cards from four factions (nature, fire, death, and robots), make a 30 card deck, and fight the computer or an online opponent. You get two actions per turn (except for the first turn, when the player can only play one card), and as you play you gain levels in order to play higher-level cards. Any cards you don't play don't gain levels, and any cards you don't use get discarded.\n\nSeveral cards synergize for higher levels of strategy, but overall this is a simple game anyone can play.

I liked Spectromancer a lot, and the idea of making an original fantasy world with factions and lore, and adding leveling and deckbuilding mechanics to it brings about a phenomenal and innovative gaming experience.  However, I dislike that there is very little music, and the music that is there is very plain, and does not add to the SolForge experience.  This is a shame, as Spectromancer's soundtrack was one of the key elements of making it great.","March 9","true","119.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This is clearly an attempt to make people purchase boosters with real money which is a shame.\n\nThat being said, what I like about this game is how the combat works, everything gets a lane and everything is required to attack, there is no saving a monster on the field for later nor in your hand as it gets refreshed every turn. This also prevents people from being total asses and just destroying all your monsters and leaving you alive forever like in other CCGs. When you use a card it levels up into the next tier and becomes unusuable until  you yourself level up, as the cards go through levels they get stat boosts and ability boosts, some of them even gain abilities they don't start with.\n\nThis IS a game you will have to play daily  if you want to have a decent deck though, you need 3 wins per day in order to get all the free rewards which include silver(free currency that can be used to buy basic boosters) and a random item that can be  an event ticket, a card(which is usually terrible and the worst reward) or a booster pack of any tier(I think I received 3 premium packs in the first month of playing). After about the first 2-3 weeks you should be able to assemble a decent deck and after that it's all a matter of tweaking. you are allowed to use cards from 2 out of the 4 factions in your deck which also creates some interesting combos.\n\nLegendaries are well...legendaries, they either fall into the massive stats and terrible abilities type or the very  very squishy but amazing ability  type. Legendaries tend to start off way weaker at the first level but become better at endgame, what this means is that if you can put the pressure onto your enemy and  force them to put up normal monsters in order to defend, do it. This will cripple their lategame and potentially make the difference on whether you win or not.\n\nSpells are also a major part of the game, there are no traps or secrets just regular spells. They can be buffs like armor, damage,  heals, special abilities like moving on the board or damage that goes through defending monsters etc. Or debuffs and damage: straight up nukes, poisons, debuffing of hp and attack(debuffing hp to negative CAN be used as a killing technique and has the benefit of going directly thorugh armor at the cost of usually doing way less damage than a nuke does).\n\nIt is a different system to get used to but once you do I find it is quite fun, matches are quite quick and you can play multiple at the same time, plus they just got android support so you can officially play it on just about any tablet or phone now. As long as you long in once a day and do your 3 wins (you can even play against bots if you're lazy since they're very easy) you will have very nice cards. The only cards you cannot get for free are the alternate arts*(essentially shiny cards) they release once a week","June 29, 2014","true","134.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I love the art, music, lane-based combat, leveling cards based on what's used and drawing an entire new hand every turn, etc. But, as I've come to realize, the in-game currency is short of useless for anything other than painstakingly collecting tickets for tournaments.\n\nSee, Silver (earned) currency can only buy a handful of things. Decorative skins, new deck slots, tournament tickets, and the vanilla booster pack. This booster pack contains cards from all sets currently released. There are also the expansion booster packs, which require gold to purchase (via real cash). Every time a new set comes out, the Normal Booster has a lower and lower chance of getting specific cards. Sure, you could build those specific cards (after a month and a half has passed since release), but that requires tens of thousands of silver. Not to mention I noticed a dramatic drop in pulling rarity chances a while ago, probably in an attempts to push people into purchasing their 'legendary chests'.\n\nAnother game with great, unique mechanics flying the F2P banner, when really, they've been slowly making things more miserable for their players that can't afford to pay.","August 25, 2014","false","291.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Having more cards, and a draft mode has made it better too..... almost gave a 6 and a recommend. Sadly the interface is still killing it. You still can't even tell what card the other player cast when they do spells, especially now there are more cards so it's alot harder to know. Seems the game still requires memorizing all cards. The new draft type I tried was also lacking (IE no way to view levels that was apparent)\nClose, but no. Keep working on your game solforge and you might just get some more recommends (not just from me...)\n\nLong and short is the interface actually works now, and now that it does I can see how crappy the interface really is..... It deserves going from a 4 to 5 just for the sheer miracle of improvement/bugs removed and the fact that they have some visible progress/effort. Now if they could just fix the interface I could make it a 6 and tell my friends its more fun than a headache now and try to play it again.\n\n\n(Old as of 2 months after 'final' release)\nHopped on this game as an alpha/beta. Game couldn't even load without crashing. Have tried re-installing and checking out many times. the only thing that has almost no bugs/crashes and works decent and doesn't lag has always been the shop.\nThe ipad version seems to be alot less buggy (but not much). Luckily if you try it and like it you can unlock icurrency and packs to expand the game, so you can try or even persist to play without spending money on it.","October 8, 2014","false","122.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I have played alot of hearthstone, and this game, like most card games, reminds me of the Blizzard game, however it has less of the childish (sometimes annoying) noises. Obviously like all F2P games there is a way of purchasing a head start (like extra card packs, tournement tickets, etc) but as a F2P player I have yet to need to purchase such items as the game is extremely well balanced and fair about rewards. Unlike alot of F2P it is easy to catch up to those that pay for such items, if you only put in some effort and time.

When starting out, you should do the tutorial.\n\nHowever, in order to see your card's stats, you must click on cards. The problem with this garbage is you get a pop up menu that's GIGANTIC. You have to try to remember all the stats for the cards you want to check and then again for whatever to you want to play. So you live and die in pop-up's HELL / sub-menus. Not friendly for new people and the people who are not blind or are flat out too impatient to deal with this non-sense. Really made the game very difficult to get into. Infact, it pist me off so much I just removed it entirely. It's like those terrible mobile gaming apps with the million insultive adds. I can't stand this game mooning my face every time I need to see stats on something while being new. Due to this, I can't get into the game. I do not like having gaming obstruction when I'm trying to play any thing over lazy dev design. Not recommend for the IMPATIENT people. Having several large monitors I just couldn't get over at how clunky and poorly designed the UI is. Every thing is way too big. Are the DEVS BLIND PEOPLE? Are they coding the game with keyboard's that have braille? Is that why they can't see what their game looks like? WTF IS THIS MESS? The only dev that can doesn't have vission issue's is the art guy. If you click from main menu in chat, you just a long, strange, gross chat window for the game. It's just nasty. Blech! Gross, & more gross.\n\nWhy are we even paralle parking the damn cards like vehicles on the side of curbs on the road? We don't need it. You need to park a card to play just because you have so many cards. That's just eww & lazy. WTF FOR? Just let us slap down a card like in Hearthstone and so the stats on the cards or in a slide out menu or even just displaying the card when you click on it as a preview on the left side. Those DLC'S are just as expensive if not more as HearthStone. So for the price and the terrible vision displays, might as well play HearthStone. Unless if you are bored with HearthStone, then have at it. I don't see what's so attractive here or entertaining. WTF is up with the load screens? Taking turns seem's wonky in time as well and not quite balanced out properly. Passing on this one since it's for the blind with lot's of time to burn on turns. Turn's out people can have inappropriate names too that are highly offensive.

It's a free to play (not pay to win) collectible card game which takes advantage of being digital to incorporate a core mechanic which would technically be possible in analog but would be clunky and annoying at best. Cards level up and go back in the deck when played, making it so that the player must consider not only what cards can do now but what they can do later in the game when making plays. The game is 100% worth a try.","December 18, 2014","true","2.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Its a unique CCG where you shuffle your discard pile back into your deck every 4 turns, and rank up your cards by doing so.  It makes it so you may play a crap card early just because later it get better, which in any other CCG you would avoid putting it in your deck to begin with.","November 3, 2014","true","69.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

But SolFoirge feels unfinished; like it's still in Beta. The lack of user trading really detracts from the deck building strengths within the game, and the expensive rare cards generally dictate the good decks. There isn't a ton of metagaming that can be done. It's a good game that needs about twice as many cards to allow for competitive play.\n\nI'd play it in a year from now, assuming the above features get added, but I wouldn't recommend it to people at this moment.","November 25, 2013","false","120.6"," 7 of 17 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","7","17","0","1"

Just outlast to level 3 units where you will actually duke things out.\n\nPROS\n1. Nice Visuals\nThe artwork for the cards are great.\n\n2. Easy to Learn\nJust play 2 cards every round if possible. Preferably choose units over spells as the stat point growth for units far exceed spells. E.g. Stone Giant 6/9 to 20/20 vs a 6 damage to 12 damage.\n\n3. Interesting Abilities\nArmour (Negates X damage on the first hit), Aggressive (Attack on Summon)\n\n4. Campaign is okay\nIt's still another AI battle but it's campaign is better than some other online TCGs that I've played E.g. MMDOC (Google it)\n\nCONS\n1. Peculiar mechanic\nThe idea of a default mechanic where you gain a higher level card by playing a lower level card first is quite strange. E.g. Play a Level 1 card to gain a Level 2 card of the same card.\n\n2. Repetitive cards\nCard Levels go into 1, 2, 3. The next level is merely a buffed up version of the first card. E.g.

People who spend cash on this game will get better cards than those who don't.\n\n4. No Trading System\nCan't see anyway to trade your cards so your cards are valueless.\n\n5. Low Multiplayer Count\nHardly anyone playing.\n\n6. Tournaments\nMinimum number of event tickets to enter is 2. You need to pay cash to get these tickets. With such a low player count, I wonder why they even charge.\n\n7. Bugs\nLot of bugs\n\n8. No unique narrative\nStandard undead horde, wild animals, technology city and primordial tribe cards.

Plays very fast for a card game of its type and yet the game isn't over until it's over, you can still win with 1 health and a lucky hand.\n\nNow that there are more cards and the ability to "sell" extra cards for silver I'd definitely recommend this game as a F2P card game. I really have only two complaints:\n\n1. As with most games with micro transactions, if you buy gold you'll have difficulty spending all of it due to the prices of the items... A standard tactic to get you to spend more, but it annoys me as it's effectively throwing money away.\n\n2. The random number generator occasionally seems to get stuck, at least in the effective end result (when selecting a random deck I've literally ended up with the same one 30 times in a row... no joke).\n\nBeyond those two things, it's pretty decent.","August 22, 2013","true","131.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/justchris/recommended/232450/","justchris","justchris","http://steamcommunity.com/id/justchris/","109 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAs a CCG, SolForge is one of the most solidly constructed games I've played in years. It takes full advantage of the fact that it exists in virtual space to explore mechanics that would be difficult or even impossible in real space. Also, instead of banning or restricting cards, if a card becomes unbalanced in play, they won't hesistate to update it to make it more functional. However, they don't go overboard changing cards all the time, either.\n\nLike all the best games, it is fairly easy to learn, but hard to master. The basic concept is simple. You draw a hand of 5 cards, of which you can play two. There are spells and creatures. Creatures occupy one of 5 lanes. When you play a card, it levels up into another version of itself, usually a better version. How much better varies from card to card. Each turn you battle, any creature that doesn't have summoning sickness attacks the creature across from it, and if there is nothing across from it, it deals damage to the opposing player. At the end of your turn, you discard your entire hand, and draw 5 new cards. After four turns, you level up, meaning you reshuffle all your cards back into your deck, except now some of those cards are higher level. And this repeats, with your deck getting stronger as the game goes on.  There are four factions, and each of them plays differently. Decks are 30 cards, and can be made of one or two factions.\n\nFrom that simple structure, there is a lot of depth in the game. This game was designed by Stoneblade Entertainment, the same company that created the Ascencion deckbuilding game, with the help of Richard Garfield (creator of Magic: The Gathering). Most of them are Magic protour veterans as well. The plan, for now, seems to be to release one major set and one minor update each year. There are timed and untimed matches, as well as tournaments and drafting. The game is built to be free to play, although it is still in beta, so many things like a single-player campaign and trading cards between players are not in yet, but the game is updated fairly regularly. I definitely recommend it to anyone who is keen on strategy games or CCGs, and the free to play nature makes it easy to try out.","April 19, 2014","true","137.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However I have exhausted a considerable amount of time into the game and have come to the conclusion that RNG 'feels' like it plays too large a hand in the game.\nWithout going into specifics becuase people who are reading this may not have experienced the Solforge leveling system, I will say that more often than not you will lose matches and 'Feel' like you had absolutly no power. And unlike magic wereby matches you lose due to RNG are lost in the first few draws due to mana, Solforge matches are lost turn 20-30 around 10+ mintues into a match.\nBasically an average game of solforge has you play a card you will need leveled later and then you cross your fingers in the hope that you draw that card when you need it. But more often than not you will never see that card again and if you do see it there may be no benefit in playing it.\n\nIn conclusion I don't mind losing when the game is close but the majoritiy of time you will lose because the level 1 creatures you draw will NEVER beat those level 3's your opponent keeps playing.","April 24, 2014","false","317.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has a bit of a learning curve to be noted. Your first win against an actual opponent each day gives you an event tickets, seven event tickets is a draft, a draft is effectively 6 packs. The game is about action economy, and there is a lot of potential optimization for it. Most legendaries aren't powerhouses innately, they're more of synnergy and improving deck archetypes. Extra copies of cards can be sold for silver, the non premium currency. Silver buys packs, individual cards (that you already own a copy of), backgrounds, and event tickets. If you need help or someone to trade wins with, join the steam chat by hitting the chat button in game.\n\nTl;Dr The game is about getting the most out of each card you play.

So, if you enjoy Mgic the Gathering type card games, here is a pretty polished early access game to try out.\n\nThe game is still very much in development, but one can already play against the AI or other players. Daily rewards help new players to get started with their card collection, and after about four months, I've got most cards (including heroic), and even some legendaries, just from the daily rewards. Tournament play was introduced just before christmas 2013, and offers additional chances for new cards, and another way to play against equal powered decks (draft tournament). Due to daily rewards, one can play maybe one draft tournament per week for free. Winning enough matches in them will provide additional tickets, allowing even more drafts without paying anything.\n\nOnline play tries to match players against roughly equal skills/cards, so the games should be relatively close ones. And remember, due to game mechanics, it is quite possible to win even after being 100-10 behind, so know and trust your cards and decks.\n\nIf you enjoy the game play, then there is a lot of fun to be had for free. If, on the other hand, you can't resist the urge to get all the legendaries, then prepare to pay. While legendaries have their place in decks, they are not required, and certainly do not guarantee a victory. Knowing the strengths and weaknesses of all cards is more valuable, so just playing with any deck against the AI will help you improve. Playing against other people allows you to see how cards you don't yet have might work, and allows for differing play styles from the AI.","September 21, 2013","true","719.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Matches don't last long because of the leveling system.This leveling system is pretty unique in that it does not in any way reflect a leveling card system outside of the matches. It is in fact you, the player, leveling up and the cards follow suit; which makes the match become faster when someone levels up.\n\nAlso, as a sidenote. There are three kinds of daily achievements in this stage of the game (early stages). these are 1 the daily login reward, 2 win a match (which is easy when you create match against easy ai) and 3 win three matches.\n\nAfter those rewards, you're capable of buying a couple of small boosters.\n\nSo at this moment of the game, it's to play 15 min max a day.\n\n\nEDIT  Ok, I've been playing the game for a while longer now and I have to say, my enthousiasm hasn't been depleted. One of the possible login rewards is the event cards which in the end (for example with 3 events cards) permit access to a tournament. The awesome thing is that, when you play that tournament and you lose all three matches, you still receive a normal booster (contains a lot more cards than small booster). If you win one out of three matches, you get your event cards back :o\n(And I haven't even begon about drafting which, in the end,  gives you even more cards at your disposal (even after tournament).\n\nWith the adding of Iphone players, the playerbase has become larger which, in turn makes it faster to find an online opponent. AAAAnd if you win your first online match of the day, you receive another reward (this would be the fourth daily achievement). :D","January 18, 2014","true","55.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For a casual gamer like myself, that is a big plus.  The mechanics of "leveling" a card were new to me at first and took a little bit of time to get the hang of, but the best times I've had are figuring out good combos to play.  I played M:tG years and years ago, and at first I tried to approach SolForge like that, but I was not very successful.  I like that there are a bunch of powerful cards that you can work towards and hope that they turn up in a booster, but the ability to purchase basic booster packs using silver you win in game is a much easier way to start growing your collection.  I don't like that you can't trade cards (hopefully that get implemented in some fashion, someday down the road), and all the tournaments that I have entered were filled with very powerful decks (so I lost almost every time), but overall, this game is a great way to spend 15-30 minutes at a  time.  It's still in beta right now, and they tweak the cards when trying new game balances, but it is very polished and I have only had one or two instances where something buggy happened.  Lag is sometimes an issue too, but that might be my local connection more so than anything in the game itself.

You don't have to wait around for land cards to come out before you can start playing cards, and the cards level up as you play which adds an element that I haven't seen before in this type of game.  Decks can only be two-toned, which means you can't put every card you like into a deck, but at the same time makes you experiment with a lot of deck combinations that you would probably ignore otherwise.  I've never bought a card myself, and my decks are pretty good, but if you want the best ones you'll probably have to fork over some cash.

Matches don't last long because of the leveling system.This leveling system is pretty unique in that it does not in any way reflect a leveling card system outside of the matches. It is in fact you, the player, leveling up and the cards follow suit; which makes the match become faster when someone levels up.\n\nAlso, as a sidenote. There are three kinds of daily achievements in this stage of the game (early stages). these are 1 the daily login reward, 2 win a match (which is easy when you create match against easy ai) and 3 win three matches.\n\nAfter those rewards, you're capable of buying a couple of small boosters.\n\nSo at this moment of the game, it's to play 15 min max a day.\n\n\nEDIT  Ok, I've been playing the game for a while longer now and I have to say, my enthousiasm hasn't been depleted. One of the possible login rewards is the event cards which in the end (for example with 3 events cards) permit access to a tournament. The awesome thing is that, when you play that tournament and you lose all three matches, you still receive a normal booster (contains a lot more cards than small booster). If you win one out of three matches, you get your event cards back :o\n(And I haven't even begon about drafting which, in the end,  gives you even more cards at your disposal (even after tournament).\n\nWith the adding of Iphone players, the playerbase has become larger which, in turn makes it faster to find an online opponent. AAAAnd if you win your first online match of the day, you receive another reward (this would be the fourth daily achievement). :D","January 18, 2014","true","55.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For a casual gamer like myself, that is a big plus.  The mechanics of "leveling" a card were new to me at first and took a little bit of time to get the hang of, but the best times I've had are figuring out good combos to play.  I played M:tG years and years ago, and at first I tried to approach SolForge like that, but I was not very successful.  I like that there are a bunch of powerful cards that you can work towards and hope that they turn up in a booster, but the ability to purchase basic booster packs using silver you win in game is a much easier way to start growing your collection.  I don't like that you can't trade cards (hopefully that get implemented in some fashion, someday down the road), and all the tournaments that I have entered were filled with very powerful decks (so I lost almost every time), but overall, this game is a great way to spend 15-30 minutes at a  time.  It's still in beta right now, and they tweak the cards when trying new game balances, but it is very polished and I have only had one or two instances where something buggy happened.  Lag is sometimes an issue too, but that might be my local connection more so than anything in the game itself.

It has a bit of a learning curve to be noted. Your first win against an actual opponent each day gives you an event tickets, seven event tickets is a draft, a draft is effectively 6 packs. The game is about action economy, and there is a lot of potential optimization for it. Most legendaries aren't powerhouses innately, they're more of synnergy and improving deck archetypes. Extra copies of cards can be sold for silver, the non premium currency. Silver buys packs, individual cards (that you already own a copy of), backgrounds, and event tickets.

And SolForge has been one of the most commonly played games. Currently I am sitting at over 150 hours played (though some of that may or may not have involved accidentally leaving the game on overnight a few times) and I have played countless hands. The style of this game is what I would call a lane game (as opposed to a MTG-like or a board game like game like Faeria).\n\nFirst of all it is free to play. The game comes with 2 precon decks that are not in your card pool as far as I know (meaning that those 4 legendaries between the 2 decks you do not own). The prizes currently are fast to earn. Every day at midnight pacific time it resets. You get bonuses for loggin in, first win and 3rd win. The prizes are silver (free to play currency which can be used to buy play mats, the smallest booster pack, and deck slots), and randomized prizes which currently only includes cards or packs.\n\nThe pacing of this game is the most enjoyable I have ever played. It is easy to play a 5-10 minute hand and just as easy to lose yourself for hours at a time. The basic gameplay is so simple that I think my cat could learn it. But the strategy does present itself if you give the game a chance. Leveling up is the resource in this game and you need to play the right cards at the right time to progress your deck properly. There is still plenty of luck... but trust me. It is less than you think there is the first time you play a hand.\n\nPlans for the future include: booster drafting and in game tournaments (coming in next patch that will be "soon").\nA new 20 card psuedo expansion which will be added to the current set. Save your silver to buy those new packs but don't be afraid to open any packs as old ones will not have new cards.\nGraphical and UI upgrades.\nAnd most importantly some form of trading and crafting.\n\nIf you are not in this game for the long haul now is the time to warn potential players. The pack system is currently very frustrating. You can only get the 3 card pack for free now. I recently opened 110 of these packs and only got 2 legendary cards. Premium packs guarantee 1 legendary card. But they cost $10. And there is no way to guarantee getting the legendary you want unless they are in one of the faction starter decks. Legendary cards aren't necessarily always better. But they add depth to decks and make certain strategies work better (or make SOME viable since they do not work without specific cards). Between the fact that there is CURRENTLY no trading or in game card crafting, it can be very frustrating for new players. Or even players like me. I Kickstarted this game. I used my store credit to buy 1 of each starter pack and 145 of the middle sized booster packs. And there are still numerous legendary cards that I have 0 copies of.\n\nThis game is good enough that I recommend it to anyone that loves lane based CCGs. But I want to say. If you are easily frustrated by RNG with packs. If MMDoC made you flip tables because of the lack of trading. I recommend just doing your daily bonuses against the AI, playing occasionally with your friends, and waiting until trading is implemented in game. If you have the patience to slowly build a decent card pool, then go for it!  Otherwie just remember that beta is beta and SBE is still a small company. And there are plenty of CCGs out there right now while you wait for Kibler, Justin, and the rest of the team to continue developing SolForge.","November 29, 2013","true","464.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So, if you enjoy Mgic the Gathering type card games, here is a pretty polished early access game to try out.\n\nThe game is still very much in development, but one can already play against the AI or other players. Daily rewards help new players to get started with their card collection, and after about four months, I've got most cards (including heroic), and even some legendaries, just from the daily rewards. Tournament play was introduced just before christmas 2013, and offers additional chances for new cards, and another way to play against equal powered decks (draft tournament). Due to daily rewards, one can play maybe one draft tournament per week for free. Winning enough matches in them will provide additional tickets, allowing even more drafts without paying anything.\n\nOnline play tries to match players against roughly equal skills/cards, so the games should be relatively close ones. And remember, due to game mechanics, it is quite possible to win even after being 100-10 behind, so know and trust your cards and decks.\n\nIf you enjoy the game play, then there is a lot of fun to be had for free. If, on the other hand, you can't resist the urge to get all the legendaries, then prepare to pay. While legendaries have their place in decks, they are not required, and certainly do not guarantee a victory. Knowing the strengths and weaknesses of all cards is more valuable, so just playing with any deck against the AI will help you improve. Playing against other people allows you to see how cards you don't yet have might work, and allows for differing play styles from the AI.","September 21, 2013","true","719.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I feel like you should be able to keep the cards you like. Also, when playing against the A.I, everything happens so quickly that I sometimes feel like I don't know what they did.\nI do like the quick pacing of the game, and the fact that there are 3 "levels" to cards that increase as you play them. Some concepts like that are original and unique to SolForge, and I think that is great.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/smashsenpai/recommended/232450/","smashsenpai","Repel | ToS IGN","http://steamcommunity.com/id/smashsenpai/","1 product in account","Early Access Review\n\nPros: Wide card selection, easy to learn, and high skill ceiling.\n\nCons: It takes a LOOOOONG time to get anything done. You must double click on a card to view it's card text, but that takes several seconds to pop up and then some more time just to close it. Before you view a card's text, all you see is the art, power, and life. If it showed even a portion of the text box, then I'd be able to tell at a glance if the card is vanilla or not, but I can't. It also doesn't show you the faction (color) of the card without double clicking on it first - which is absurd. This MUST be sped up and changed into a mouse-over if the game is going to proceed at a reasonable speed.\n\nBrowsing through your card library is very slow. You can either view cards iOS app store style (1 at a time, swiping through hundreds of cards), or in a vertical list (very little information displayed). We need more view options that isn't as extreme as these 2 choices. Viewing card text is a single click, which is different from the main game. Double clicking adds a card to your deck. If you were just trying to read the card text, you'll then have go to a different menu (which is also slow) to remove the unintended card from your deck (and for some reason, the game allows you to add more than max deck size). This could be fixed if you could add cards with a different command, like right click.\n\nIn game timer is ridiculous. You have 20 minutes total to make all your moves, like speed jenga or speed chess. If that runs out, because either player is playing a defensive deck, then you have to start making moves faster. However, once that time gets down to around the 1 minute mark, you get an additional minute to make your moves, but that minute isn't added onto your total time. So if you had 1:05 left, at the beginning of your turn, you would have 2:05. Then if you finished with 1:10 left, your total time is now 0:10. Then for the rest of the game you have roughly 1 minute to make your moves, which is NOT enough with how SLOW it is to play and read cards. Just put a time limit on individual turns, like 180-200 seconds.\n\nThe font size in the game log (which is a text version of what moves each player made) is WAY too small. I'm talking like times new roman size 7 on windows. When I tried this on my android device, the text was indistinguishable from the dust and scratches on my screen protector. Probably font size 1.5 there. ALSO! The game log is hidden away in the menu, so it takes even MORE time to access. Since all spells aren't shown to the opponent as they are played (recycled animations are shown instead, so different spells may share the same animation), I have to rely on the game log to see what was played. The log MUST be more accessible and LEGIBLE if the game continues to animate the way it does now. I'm sure there are more problems with the game log, but I couldn't read any of the text. At the very least, I can make out the highlighted text to see the card that was played.\n\nGreat game with a bunch of potential. Fix these problems and I will gladly return.","September 11, 2014","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have played this game more than any other game on steam, and besides the $20 I spent to buy the game before it went F2P, I have not spent any money on it. Solforge loses complexity by only, generally, having the option to play two out of the random five cards you draw each turn. However, it makes up for this lack of strategy by forcing the player to not just play whatever card is most optimal in the given situation, but also consider what cards you are leveling up and how this will impact your late game (a card "levels up" into a new version of that card whenever you play it which makes it more powerful by increasing health, damage, and sometimes granting or changing abilities. Generally a card has three ranks and your hero levels up every 4 turns allowing you to play cards of the next rank and all previous ranks). I absolutely love this element of strategy that, as far as I know, is unique to this solforge. It also helps that the card art is absolutely gorgeous. The only negative thing I can say about Solforge is that it has some minor p2w elements, however they have mostly been fixed by the latest patch. This patch made booster packs easier to get, have more cards,  and have a better chance of more rare cards. It also allowed you to purchase specific cards with in game currency if you are tired of rolling the dice with booster packs. Stoneblade has continued to support Solforge by adding tournaments and new tournament options, necessary balance fixes and relatively frequent releases of new cards. I look forward to seeing what they continue to do with Solforge.","June 29, 2014","true","523.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You may read alot of reviews nagging about the P2W, but what card game isn't.  If you are into MTG, Pokemon, Yugi, or any other CCG then I am sure that you have dropped more money then you would like to think about. Think about it for a momment.  A booster of MTG will cost you $3-$5 depending on the set which will get you 15 cards. Same goes for any CCG. Then there are the single cards that can go for way more than what a booster or even a box will cost you.  If you are a serious CCG player then you know what I am talking about. I didn't start paying for things until I had played for a few months.  I figured that the game had provided me with plenty of entertainment that sending a few bucks here and there wasn't a bad idea.  As for this grind people speak about it really isn't that bad.  During your dailies you can get up to 3 free boosters and enough silver to buy 2 more and boosters are worth 5000 silver which will get you 6 cards.  I have also recieved legendary chests as a daily reward as well.  I have collected a majority of my legendaries this way. Yes, I have bought a few of the precon decks, but thats like buying a precon deck with any CCG.   So I do not see the big gripe with the P2W asspect when it is the same for all CCGs.  The other complaint I see a lot is that you need legendaries to win and I call BS on this.  I played for the longest time without legendaries and I would still win online matches against people with stacks of legendaries.  Do legendaries help? Yes, they can. So can mythic rares and rares in MTG but they don't always make the deck. Its all about synergy and knowing how to make a proper deck.  When I played MTG those were my favorite decks to win with.  Playing against people that have dropped hundreds of dollars on their deck where mine would be but a fraction of what they spent.  One of my MTG decks that has yet to lose consists of nothing but commons and uncommons.  I took this tactic over to Solforge and it still works time to time. Like in any game you are going to win some and lose a lot.  You have to keep analysing whats out there and try to think of something that no one else has and surprise people.  If you are into CCG then I say give it a try cause as a person with 18 years of CCG playing I say it is worth it.","October 3, 2014","true","073.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I won't waste time describing the same issues others already have:\nTimed and untimed matches encourage abuse. Trolls either wait until the clock is about to run out before they play, or they leave untimed matches sitting there until the opponent concedes to get rid of it.\nA single mediocre draw basically ends your game because there's no way to catch up once you're behind\nThe interface has obnoxious inconsistencies (i.e. Double-click does very different things in differet screens)\nVery laggy performance, especially in the deck builder\nMany other issues...\nInstead, I'm going to focus on a single point that has grown to end any chance of the game being playable for any incoming player. At this stage, there's no realistic way to compete with players that have been around for months because their decks are loaded with the rarist cards in the game (legendary and heroic). Catching up at this stage would require an investment of several hundred, or even thousands of dollars.\n\nI've played dozens of people, to the point that I see certain names often enough that I know their decks and what to expect; and every card in their deck is wildly more powerful than almost every card I've been able to get in more than a month of play. At this point, I'm pretty sure the only people still active in the game are long-term players. The few new players come in briefly, see how much of a mess it is, and promptly leave.\n\nIt's a complete waste of time to invest in this game, even if the balance issues are worked out, the cheating/trolling is curtailed, and more players join.

I won't waste time describing the same issues others already have:\nTimed and untimed matches encourage abuse. Trolls either wait until the clock is about to run out before they play, or they leave untimed matches sitting there until the opponent concedes to get rid of it.\nA single mediocre draw basically ends your game because there's no way to catch up once you're behind\nThe interface has obnoxious inconsistencies (i.e. Double-click does very different things in differet screens)\nVery laggy performance, especially in the deck builder\nMany other issues...\nInstead, I'm going to focus on a single point that has grown to end any chance of the game being playable for any incoming player. At this stage, there's no realistic way to compete with players that have been around for months because their decks are loaded with the rarist cards in the game (legendary and heroic). Catching up at this stage would require an investment of several hundred, or even thousands of dollars.\n\nI've played dozens of people, to the point that I see certain names often enough that I know their decks and what to expect; and every card in their deck is wildly more powerful than almost every card I've been able to get in more than a month of play. At this point, I'm pretty sure the only people still active in the game are long-term players. The few new players come in briefly, see how much of a mess it is, and promptly leave.\n\nIt's a complete waste of time to invest in this game, even if the balance issues are worked out, the cheating/trolling is curtailed, and more players join.

The simple ruleset also makes this game great for tcg starters who can grasp the rules very quickly.\nBasically there are 5 lanes and each turn you may play two cards are turn, creatures attack every turn (even in the opponents) and will battle either creatures on the opposing lane or hit the opponent directly. Both players have 100 lifes and your goal is to bring your opponent to 0. Now here comes the clue of the game: There is no resource system like Magic's mana system you just play two cards every turn, but every card has three different levels and cards level as they get played, coming back much stronger later in the game. So you have cards which are good on lvl 1 but might not be good to play because they level badly and there are other cards who do next to nothing on level 1 but might be gigantic later on. The leveling makes for interesting decisions, because you always have to consider if you can allow to level a stronger card or if you want to get ahead on board.\nIf you want to play the game for free you can easily do it, Solforge has a front loaded reward system where you don't need to grind for hours to get your stuff. And you can even draft which is a ton of fun and allows to get many new cards.\nSince Solforge is currently in open beta there are more features to come: A crafting system, set 2 and a single player campaign are all down the line. The game is also available for Iphone and Ipad and will support Android devices on one point.\nI would recommend this game for anyone who loves tcgs, because this is in my honest opinion the best one you can play on your computer (except maybe magic online, but it is a pain to play with it and is ridiculous expensive) but also for anyone else who is interested in this genre, this game is a good starting point for it.\n","February 5, 2014","true","978.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/smashsenpai/recommended/232450/","smashsenpai","Repel | ToS IGN","http://steamcommunity.com/id/smashsenpai/","1 product in account","Early Access Review\n\nPros: Wide card selection, easy to learn, and high skill ceiling.\n\nCons: It takes a LOOOOONG time to get anything done. You must double click on a card to view it's card text, but that takes several seconds to pop up and then some more time just to close it. Before you view a card's text, all you see is the art, power, and life. If it showed even a portion of the text box, then I'd be able to tell at a glance if the card is vanilla or not, but I can't. It also doesn't show you the faction (color) of the card without double clicking on it first - which is absurd. This MUST be sped up and changed into a mouse-over if the game is going to proceed at a reasonable speed.\n\nBrowsing through your card library is very slow. You can either view cards iOS app store style (1 at a time, swiping through hundreds of cards), or in a vertical list (very little information displayed). We need more view options that isn't as extreme as these 2 choices. Viewing card text is a single click, which is different from the main game. Double clicking adds a card to your deck. If you were just trying to read the card text, you'll then have go to a different menu (which is also slow) to remove the unintended card from your deck (and for some reason, the game allows you to add more than max deck size). This could be fixed if you could add cards with a different command, like right click.\n\nIn game timer is ridiculous. You have 20 minutes total to make all your moves, like speed jenga or speed chess. If that runs out, because either player is playing a defensive deck, then you have to start making moves faster. However, once that time gets down to around the 1 minute mark, you get an additional minute to make your moves, but that minute isn't added onto your total time. So if you had 1:05 left, at the beginning of your turn, you would have 2:05. Then if you finished with 1:10 left, your total time is now 0:10. Then for the rest of the game you have roughly 1 minute to make your moves, which is NOT enough with how SLOW it is to play and read cards. Just put a time limit on individual turns, like 180-200 seconds.\n\nThe font size in the game log (which is a text version of what moves each player made) is WAY too small. I'm talking like times new roman size 7 on windows. When I tried this on my android device, the text was indistinguishable from the dust and scratches on my screen protector. Probably font size 1.5 there. ALSO! The game log is hidden away in the menu, so it takes even MORE time to access. Since all spells aren't shown to the opponent as they are played (recycled animations are shown instead, so different spells may share the same animation), I have to rely on the game log to see what was played. The log MUST be more accessible and LEGIBLE if the game continues to animate the way it does now. I'm sure there are more problems with the game log, but I couldn't read any of the text. At the very least, I can make out the highlighted text to see the card that was played.\n\nGreat game with a bunch of potential. Fix these problems and I will gladly return.","September 11, 2014","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Actual choices during the match really seem far more importent, as opposed to just getting lucky with card draw (tho naturally that still occurs).\n\nDownside is that Legendary class cards are VERY strong, and very hard to actually get in any reasonable timeframe, especially if you are lookign for specific ones.  That said, there are match types with no legendaries allowed.","June 19, 2015","true","138.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can make some decent decks with only common and rare cards and get decent daily rewards. There is one thing that really bothers me and I think most f2p players in this game. There is no ranked system to seperate from normal online matches. Why does this bother me? 9 out of 10 players I face in a normal online match have insane full heroic/legendary decks while I only have some heroics and a few legendaries(which I can not make a decent deck from). I maybe win about 2 out of 5 games I play online but for f2p or new players it is really hard to get started.\n\nBut besides that it can be pretty satisfying winning a game against players with a full heroic/legendary deck with only common and rare cards. There is a really big cardpool to make and try a lot of different decks and a lot of different and unique card effects.\n\nI can't say anything about the tournaments because I never did one of those(might try those later).\n\nThe UI is pretty bad but it doesn't bother me that much but please Stone Blade, make a ranked system so newer players can get some fair opponents in online mathes.\n\nI will give this a 7/10(this could've been an 8/10 if there was a fair matchmaking for online matches). I do recommend trying this out even if it is hard to get started. If you like TCG's with lots of variaty in cards, lots of deckbuilding and tweaking, this can be an interesting game for you.","January 16","true","67.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You get one booster pack per day just for logging in, you can earn more by winning games, and there's a single-player campaign mode that - while fairly thin - still provides a good tutorial first and a rather crushing bit of challenge later on.\n\nWill you run up against truly unfair decks online? Oh, hells yes. Will you eventually make crushingly unfair decks of your own? Sure. All in all, it's not a bad F2P - and I define that as "A F2P that you really don't have to spend money to enjoy."\n\nPROS:\n-Interesting gameplay.\n-No need to spend money, though earning cards through winning will take time.\n-Single-player mode intact.\n-Also available on Android\n\nCONS:\n-Some minor balance issues, although some of the most broken cards have been taken care of over time.\n-Repetitive music.\n-Getting your first competitive deck together will certainly take a while.\n\nOverall: 7/10.
