Aside from being a great intro to the RPG genre, the game itself is very immersive. The series has a very interesting storyline and provides the player with numerous challenging quests/puzzles. I've played Aveyond back when the first one was released in 2006(or so), and the Aveyond 3 chapters are equally exceptional.","May 24, 2014","true","2.9"," 39 of 49 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","39","49","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/recommended/278490/","vicrabb","Vic=HKC=","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/","1793 products in account","The previous chapter ended with Heptitus stealing your first quarter key. Mel and her friends must find a way to take it back and after that, to find the rest of the keys around the world. Will they foil the Lord of Twilight's plan to take over the living world? Besides, now that Lydia managed to get a way into the team, will Mel and her reconcile their differences?\n\nAveyond 3 was fragmented in four chapters. This one is the direct sequel of Lord of Twilight and as usual, the story is well-written and full of humor: Galahad and Tej'Imal are still fighting each other as the married couple they are, Edward is still the naive best friend, Lydia is a real sneaky snob, though she's not against helping Mel, Stella is still suffering from amnesia and Mel is still an expert in sarcasm, now amplified with Lydia and her gowns. Also, the game allows you to choose between six characters as Ulf, an Orc, is joining you and is probably the only serious one.\n\nThe game mechanics are still the same, though now, you have a mage in Lydia, with offensive spells as Stella is mainly an healer. Allow me to copy-paste the mechanics from my previous review as nothing changed. You level your team up thanks to combat (and well, even if not used, the characters are also leveling up), unlock spells for the mage and the healer, change their weapons or clothes so that their characteristics can be improved. You have also an inventory with scrolls, food, potions, etc.. to use during a battle (or not) to heal or to help hurting opponents in front of you. Some of them are tough - sometimes, the best is to come back later with a better team.\n\nSome quests needs to be done in order to advance in the story, while they're appearing as being a side-quest just for the money. Others are just bonus. But given the fact that you need money to buy stuff or to fast-travel, any quest is worthy to be done. Besides, when defeating enemies, you can loot them and find also money or items. You have also chests to open or bags to find.\n\nNow that you have a pirate ship to travel, you can finally use the docks and explore the world. The enemies are stronger there. With the compass, you can come back to where your boat is docked. It can be a faster way to travel. I loved Venwood with the elves or should I say that it was my favorite city soundtrack in the game.\n\nAveyond comes also with three difficulties: Easy where you're stronger and where most of the enemies don't spawn again after a defeat (yeah, I'm playing in this difficulty), Normal where every is balanced and Hard where you'll die more frequently - though even in Easy, I've been wiped. Well, if a character dies, you can ressucitate them but if your team is wiped, it's game over and it's up to you to load the auto-save (when entering a new screen) or a save of yours.\n\nNotice that I didn't begin the game with a team at level 0. Indeed, at the end of the first game, you can choose to save your game so that it appears in Gates of Night menu when you're starting a new quest. It means that I got all my money, all my equipment, all my inventory to begin with.\n\nAveyond dates from 2009 and from an earlier version of RPG Maker but the graphisms are still good. Besides, the landscapes are now really varied: volcano, beach, jungle, forest, fairy kingdom, desert,... The soundtrack is really good.\n\nAs I passed 8 hours in the first, I expected the same length for Gates of Night, though apparently, the time was multiplied by two. I know that I spent a lot of time trying to find people for the quests, without forgetting that I managed to get asleep for 20 minutes on my keyboard while playing. But well, Gates of Night is really long.\n\nAveyond 3-2: Gates of Night is an excellent sequel to Lord of Twilight and I don't regret the purchase, so, I can recommend it to anyone trying the RPG genre or that doesn't like to spend minutes on a skill sheet or on anything else.\n\n\n","February 19","true","17.5"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

I feel like this game lacks direction and at times leaves you throwing up your hands tring to remember who wanted what and where that who was in the first place. the quests journal is not terribly helpful and the world map while I think its kind of cute drawn out like a mini pirate map it too is not terribly helpful because it does not indicate where you currently are. you know like the mall map does. ( you are here )  while some of the mini games are a nice diversion the quests are a bit too Fed Ex in that it has you running all over the place. I know it sounds bad but seriously this is one of the best RPG maker type games I played. the story line is solid and the characters are not overly silly or just ruin the story ( hello Jar Jar Binks ) I do think that the classes need more defining roles because you can interchange nearly any char in the game and it does not change much strategy wise the spy need more toys. the mage gets magic at a painfully slow rate and only then if u have a book. healer is fine as is but seriously the character classes need to be more defined. all in all this is an entertaining game for the money I do enjoy it and if this is your thing you could do much worse than this game so give it a try.","November 29, 2014","true","10.2"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","14","20","0","0"

But there's a lot of improvements. In part one, besides the story, there's some side quests and some areas to explore. In part two, the entire world map is available for you to explore, and that alone makes this part twice as large. There's also new side quests and, unlike part one, this game finishes without loose ends. Part one and two are almost separated from part three and four. There's also 2 new party members. The story isn't as rich as in part one, but you can feel that part two is more focused in exploring. But still, i would only recommend getting part one and two on sale, and if you like it then get part three and four.","December 14, 2015","true","15.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
