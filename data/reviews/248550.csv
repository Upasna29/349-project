THIS GAME ONLY SUPPORTS LOCAL CO-OP AND VERSUS MODES.\n\nI'm really not one to write reviews because I believe other people are able to better define why or why you shouldn't buy the game, but because I've burned so many hours into this, I felt I needed to speak about it.\n\nMegabyte Punch is what would happen if Super Smash Brothers met Custom Robo and created a multiplayer campaign.\n\nOverview:\nWhen you load the game you're given a few options: Campaign, Tournament (the 1-player stage fighter) or Versus (the multiplayer stage fighter). You can play the campaign with up to four players, and the screen is split so you can explore on your own without trapping players in a corner (a la Gauntlet style).\n\nCampaign:\nPlaying Campaign allows you to unlock new colors and parts for the game. The game boosts 30 color schemes and 150 parts (some of which are duplicates for different body parts).\n\nYou play through 6 worlds, each having 3 levels and a boss at the end. Each world can take about 15 - 30 minutes, depending on if you're trying to find the colors/parts or just racing for the finish. There are also two bonus levels, one of which is fairly difficult.\n\nOverall, the Campaign is a solid 7/10.  Story is okay, the levels are fun, the bosses are great, but it doesn't have any replay value unless you want to play with friends.\n\nMultiplayer:\nThis is where the game shines. I recommend getting some parts and colors from the campaign, then playing Multiplayer with some friends.\n\nThe game has full X360 controller support, and you can change the controls to best suit you (that said, I've never changed them because they're perfect for this game).\n\nThe first time you play Multiplayer (Campaign or Versus) be prepared for about 5 minutes per player of setup time. The nice thing is you can save your Megac Set to the game, making for a quick load the next time you play together.\n\nOnce you get into Versus mode and everyone is ready, you'll enter the stage select screen. There are 15(?) stages to select, along with 3 custom stages you can create.\n\nThe Multiplayer is exactly like Super Smash Bros with no items: Just you and your abilities trying to knock your opponents off the stage.\n\nThe big downside to Multiplayer is the lack of match customization. You can only play 4-stock, no time limits. While I've never run into any problems with this ruleset, it would be nice to have a time mode, or items.\n\nOverall, Multiplayer receives a 9/10, and is the main pull for this title.  The lack of online Multiplayer prevents me from playing with a few friends, but this game is really meant to be played with people right next to you with everyone yelling at the monitor/TV.\n\nOther/General\nTournament mode is quite the challenge, but allows you to unlock a few secret parts in the game that you can't get through Campaign. There is also the task of tracking down all 30 color schemes and all 150 parts, so there's plenty of exploration to be done, and the game has a lot of replay value.\n\nFinal Verdict\nI recommend this game to anyone who enjoys Super Smash Brothers, Custom Robo, or has friends who enjoy Co-Op Campaigns.  While I did mention the Campaign is lacking a little, it's still an absolute blast with several people, but the main pull will still be the customization and the Versus mode.\n\nI look forward to any future updates or Megabyte Punch 2 (f there are any plans).","October 16, 2014","true","52.5"," 73 of 77 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","73","77","0","0"

I am perhaps a bit biased towards mecha games because I just love mechs in all shapes and sizes but I think most players will get a kick out of customizing their own character. Unlocking many different parts with their special abilities and looks in adventure mode and then playing around with different builds in splitscreen versus matches is a lot of fun. As mentioned in many other reviews there are a lot of similarities to Super Smash Bros. I think Megabyte Punch stands enough on it's own due to it's quirky polygon art style and the addition of character customization.\n\nIt's not a perfect game obviously, it is a bit on the short side (Considering current price: euro 13,99) and could in my opinion greatly benefit from an online multiplayer part to extend replayability. However, as a first in the series and considering I bought this within an indiegala game bundle incl. 8 other games for only 5 euros (roughly $7) I really am positively surprised. My hope is that the developers will create DLC or a sequel with even more parts, levels and more importantly more extensive multiplayer options incl online.\n\nConclusion: Get this game as soon as it is on sale! Current price is a bit steep but this really is a little gem of a game and offers lots of local multiplayer fun.","March 19, 2014","true","3.6"," 34 of 37 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","34","37","0","0"

So it's kind of trading a bit of SSB's gameplay for the whole customization arc, which is pretty fun. The same move can generally be found on a few different parts in different styles and/or equippable to different body zones, which is nice if you want to put together a slightly different skill set or just keep your favorite move without looking like an idiot, which is thoughtful. Gameplay can occasionally be frustrating in much the same way singleplayer SSB can, but the AI isn't usually as insufferable. The colorful lowpoly graphics are fun. The music is pretty decent except that most of the tracks have long, long periods of ambient quietness for some reason. Overall, not at all bad. Could it have been better? Certainly. Is it good? Definitely.","October 16, 2013","true","15.3"," 31 of 34 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","31","34","0","0"

Sometimes, any delay will ruin your experience. This is more in the latter category than the former.\n+ Support: Plug and play with more than just a 360 controller.\n+ Polish: Rumor is during post-production the finest grit sandpaper was taken to the smooth surface of this gem.\n+ Fluid: Level design and encounters are consistent and fun.\n+ Frenetic: You will stay on your toes.\n+ Variety: A plethora of unlocks and enemy types will keep you engaged.\n\nCons:- Input: The game likes to keep player 1 controlling the other characters at startup.\n- Online: If it could be done, at worst it would be a dead mode.\n\nNeutral:± Specials: It can be very frustrating to get a new part and not be able to utilize the attack you want, potentially having to prioritize a swoop or convenient move.\n\n======================================\nIntroduction:Hello and welcome to my review of Megabyte Punch, since everyone ever knows what Smash is, and MBP is a triumphant attempt at bringing SSB to PC, let's just get into it.\n\nGameplay:In Megabyte Punch you are a Megac on a mission with an energy shield, a pelvic thrust to break shields and stun, a jump, a regular attack, double tap to dash, and five special attacks. You utilize these abilities to get through the story and your enemies to beat the game, which starts off basic and easy. As you beat enemies, you collect parts, which can boost your abilities or give you unique attacks. There's a large variety, and enough overlap that you can pick and choose based on aesthetic and still get the bonuses/moves you want.\n\nAs you encounter more enemy and move types in more challenging levels, the game becomes progressively more fun and engaging. The story is sparse but actually relatively decent for its type. Still, for the most part the aim of the game is to beat things up, and I'm here to report to you that it excels at this, being just as fluid and fast as Smash while adding its own innovations, and keeping a great sense of balance with the cooldowns on the various attacks, be they big and satisfying or short and sweet. There are mid-range, long-range, and close-range options, with a roughly 40/60 split between ranged and melee variants. You can stack parts providing defense, offense, jumps, ranged/melee attacks, or more for specialized or fun builds, so the gameplay promotes a lot of individual technical skill while retaining a lot of fun. Basically, I'm telling you to buy it if you for some reason haven't already!\n\nGraphics:The graphics in Megabyte Punch are downright gorgeous. They retain a vibrant blocky style that would be at home in a NES Zelda title but they don't rely on pixels or take any shortcuts to look good. There's a very good spread of variety to the levels and environments, and plenty of skin colors to unlock and you can definitely make some great looking megacs to dish out the beatings with.\n\nAudio:The music and sounds while perhaps not universally appealing are all very high quality. Well produced, sensible, and satisfying.\n\nConclusion:While I still wholeheartedly recommend MBP as a solo experience, if you have even just one friend that you can couch party it up with, I can confidently recommend you buy Megabyte Punch at:\n\nFull price...but it does go on sale and in bundles frequently.\n\n======================================This endorsement approved by The Reviewers' Union,\nproviding better standards for reviews and reviewers.\n======================================","April 10","true","32.0"," 21 of 21 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","21","21","0","4"

Chaining together combos is childsplay, but still gives you that rewarding feeling after you've landed your hits.\n\nThe robot customization is just perfect for a game like this. Your robot comes with a default set of parts that can be substituted later on for better parts with special abilities and statistics linked to them.\n\nAs you adventure through each stage, you're eventually met with a boss who provides for a decent challenge at the very end of each section. Once defeated, you're often met with a prize (a new part) with a special ability that will aid you in the next stage up until the final boss (Haven't gotten there yet).\n\nHonestly, I didn't expect this to be such a blast to play and I'd reccommend it to anyone on the fence about making the purchase.","June 28, 2015","true","38.9"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","20","21","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shredsterseven/recommended/248550/","shredsterseven","Shredster VII","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shredsterseven/","414 products in account","Megabyte Punch comes within inches of being a truly great game. It takes a working formula and overhauls it with loads of customization, while cutting out unneeded mechanics. This creates a fast-paced fighting game with a fun adventure game stacked on top. Unfortunately, the lack of ability to create your own custom matchups as well as the lack of online multiplayer drags the game down to being merely "really good".\n\nThe meat of the game revolves around exploring levels, destroying enemies, and taking their broken parts as your own. The game uses a Super Smash Bros. style damage system, where the more damage a character has, the further an attack will send them flying. Non-boss adversaries can be destroyed by bashing them against a wall at high enough velocities, while bosses are fought in a classic Sumo-wrestling slugfest.\n\nThe game is much more fast-paced than Super Smash Bros. and actively encourages building combos; A skill you'll need to master if you want to defeat bosses or win the tournament. As an aside, smacking an enemy hard enough to send them destructively cratering through the terrain is extremely satisfying.\n\nFallen enemies will drop either currency or one of their body parts, which you can install on your own character. Each part has a different ability attatched to it, ranging from increasing the number of double jumps you have to giving you a chaingun for an arm. You can have drills attatched to all of your limbs, allowing you to tear through destructable blocks with ease... or you can equip a bunch of parts that increase your damage output, turning you into a close-range terror. It's even possible to build a perfect replica of every humanoid character in the game - even the shopkeeper and the final boss!\n\nThe presentation uses chunky 3D models and colorful if not cliche environments - the overrall presentation manages to evoke some level of nostalgia without looking like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ NES game. More people need to figure out that this is possible.\n\nThe soundtrack is similarilly modern-nostalgic, combining the composition of chiptune music with modern synthesizers and drumkits. While I do feel that some of the level themes are a bit too cliche for their own good (looking at you, Ancient Tech Ruins) the overall soundtrack is pretty catchy, and in some cases, pretty hype too.\n\nNow, as with any good game, Megabyte Punch has some serious flaws. Firstly, finding some rare parts doesn't involve "finding" them so much as going through the same level over and over again until you randomly encounter a version of the enemy carrying that part. I must have played through Frostbyte Deep five times before one of the enemies decided to spawn with the Frostbyte Leg part. Additionally, while the game does tell you that certain rare parts can only be won in the tournament, it does not tell you that certain postgame parts can only be found in the shop... the shop which only carries duplicates of parts you already have 99% of the time.\n\nAnother flaw with the game is the predictability of the AI. It's unfair to expect AAA-level brilliance from a game made by two guys, but the fact that I can repeatedly spam the Submachine Gun until the enemy shields, break said shield, and then KO them with a tornado kick without fail is a bit... disappointing. Additionally, the boss opponents become easilly confused when faced with more than one player character, rendering them unable to decide who to attack. And any enemy with a plasma cannon will annoyingly spam projectiles.\n\nAll of these flaws are forgiveable. The game was made by two programmers and one composer, give them a break. However, there is ONE flaw with this game that I absolutely do not understand: there is no online multiplayer in Megabyte Punch. The official reason for this is that neither of the programmers had any prior knowledge of netcode and they didn't want to incorporate a flawed feature, so they left it out entirely instead. As far as co-op adventure mode or random matchmaking goes, this seems like a rational desicion. But can't I at least play peer-to-peer versus mode with a friend? I want to see what kind of character they've built, and I want to see how they fight, but I can't. For a PC exclusive fighting game, this is completely absurd.\n\nDespite the glaring flaws in the game's design, however, I still had a crapload of fun with Megabyte Punch. The game's customization and two singleplayer game modes add a ton of replay value to the game, especially if you like to experiment with building new characters. If you're a fan of Super Smash Bros. style fighting, Cave Story style exploration, and Custom Robo style character building, I seriously suggest you play this game.\n\nOh yeah, and when the wise old robot tells you to seek out Three Flowers, keep in mind that they're stacked vertically. Now go kick some walking robo-heads!","July 12, 2014","true","43.3"," 22 of 26 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","22","26","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/doomsdayforte/recommended/248550/","doomsdayforte","DF","http://steamcommunity.com/id/doomsdayforte/","936 products in account","I got this in The Green Light Bundle's 'Best of' Bundle.  It took around 10 hours to get to the end, no 100%.\n\nI heard the comparisons to Super Smash Bros. and Custom Robo and didn't believe it at first, but it got me interested in the game.  And I'm really glad I picked this up now.\n\nSo you're a super fighting robot, and it's your mission to go beat up other robots in the Levels and beat the boss at the end of the third stage of each Level.  Controls felt pretty tight.  On a controller, left stick moves, you have a button for jump, normal attacks, special attacks, and the parts menu.  You can wall jump, sprint, double jump, and have a variety of normal attacks based on tilting the stick or if you're in the air (no smash attacks here).  But the rest of the fancy stuff comes from parts.\n\nMegabyte Punch is part exploration, part platformer, part fighter, part collectathon.  The basic premise of the game is to find the door in each stage to advance to the next section until you get to the end of the third stage and fight the boss to clear the level.  On your way, you'll fight other custom-made robots both in the field and in arenas that seal themselves off when you enter.  Like Smash, you still have to raise the unseen damage number for your enemies, and like Smash, a particularly hard hit will send them flying.  But if your foe slams into a hard surface, it explodes, leaving behind life-granting Bits or a custom part.  Or if they go into the soft blocks, they'll cut right through them and explode.  And the same applies to you.\n\nBoss battles twist the basic formula and turns it into an itemless match of Smash.  Smack the boss around and get his damage up and then send him into the black killzones around the area a few times.  And of course, try not to burn all your lives in the process, or you'll have to start the entire level over.\n\nI liked exploring, though outside of the forced-fight arenas, you're allowed to rush to the end.  The issue then is finding the right way to go.  The damage you take is permanent until you die and respawn, so rushing may end up being the better option for some.  You can carry a small inventory of extra parts from the robots you destroy and from there you can swap out with what you currently have on, but everything not equipped goes to your inventory at home when you go through any door.  You more or less start each stage with the clothes on your back, but you can break down any spare parts for Bits--64 of which give an extra life, and you start each Level with three no matter what.\n\nI wouldn't say the platforming was necessarily hard, but I went with more jumps and most of the challenge was maneuvering around obstacles with enemies present, or dealing with dangers like damage plates and mines in the arenas.  Each stage is pretty big though, especially if you try to drill through the soft blocks.\n\nParts do a variety of things, like give you passive mobility boosts or extra jumps, or some give you special attacks you assign to Neutral, Up, Down, and Side B.  While there are a lot of parts, there aren't as many unique effects, but you could argue it's partly for aesthetics reasons too.  You can equip to your torso, head, shoulder, left and right arms each, left and right legs each, and hips.  And there are color palettes to collect too, though you can't customize each part's color--it's everything or nothing.  You can save quite a few parts and color loadouts too.\n\nProgression in specials felt a little stagnant, but it was less "ever-powerful moves in later stages" and more "everyone is mostly on the same playing field."  The strongest special is the 25-damage Megabyte Punch, and I had a move that did 18 in the first level, though it was slow coming out.  Every move felt like it had a use, as opposed to 100 moves of which you'd use 10 at best.\n\nOverall, if you enjoyed Adventure Mode/Subspace Emissary in Smash, you'd probably like this game.  It has local 2-4 coop for Adventure, there's Versus, and a Tournament Mode to get rare parts.  No online, but desyncs and lag would hamper enjoyment for a game like this.  Lots of parts, lots of things to beat up, great length for the price.\n\nAnd I had a smile on my face from the first time I spiked one of those little robots through the ground.\n","October 25, 2014","true","11.8"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","9","10","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lordofwatermelons/recommended/248550/","lordofwatermelons","Twitchy Nemesis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lordofwatermelons/","23 products in account","Product received for free\n\nAs someone who's clocked more time into this than I can arguably say many people have, and stands as the only game in my library that I've 100% completed, I'd probably sound just as you'd expect when I say that Megabyte Punch is just good. Just very, very, veryveryvery good. Don't even let the 100% completion, or the 50 hours, be what convinces you. Hell, don't even let my review be what convinces you, either! I'm not exactly an unbiased source of information here!\n(tl;dr at the bottom.)\n\nNow, before anything else, I'll mention off the bat that I got the code for my copy of the game off of a Steam friend; looking back, though, I'd say that I'd have bought this regardless, and maybe some more copies for friends as well. take with that information what you will, as maybe not having paid for it myself's painted my opinion a little.\n\nStory\nMegabyte Punch surprisingly has very interesting plots and subplots as you progress through the game. You and up to 3 friends play as Megacs, a living entity comprised of data, and were created by a mysterious artifact called the Heartcore. Your village, Ventu, is roped into a dangerous game of politics and power struggles, as two different factions both fight over control of the Heartcore. It has some good suspense, and even a couple plot twists, although very brittle ones. In short, I'd say it's a pretty good story overall.\n\nPresentation\nFrom the get-go, the aesthetic of the game looks very sleek. Sharp designs of the parts and enemy models meeting against cubic map design and an impressive background setting makes for a strong showing of what the Unity engine is capable of. Every part looks incredibly distinct, and you can many times outright know an enemy's moveset just by knowing the parts they have equipped.\n\nAnd have I mentioned the soundtrack? Because the soundtrack is amazing. A good mix of mechanical and synthesized sounds, layered over one another, setting the atmosphere of their respective locations in a heartbeat. You know when a battle's taking place, because the music will kick into a high-energy track, getting you pumped and ready to beat down whatever's in your way!\n\nGameplay\nNow, what I'm about to summarize of the gameplay may make you want to buy this immediately: Imagine Super Smash Brothers meets Medabots: fast-paced combat gameplay and the ability to beat the ever-loving crap out of anyone who looks at you funny for their parts, and then adding them to yourself. That's a lot of what the core gameplay is like in a nutshell.\n\nThe tutorial is short, snappy, and gives you the basics of how the game works: You start with a standard layout, and through defeating enemies, you can use their parts to get new abilities and alter your stats on-the-fly. Like Smash, you take damage based on flat values of attacks and different abilities, augmented by yours or the enemy's attack and defense bonuses. Taking too much damage will send you hurtling around; get hit hard enough into a wall or off the map, you lose a life. Lose all your lives, game over. Thankfully, you keep any and all parts collected even if you lose, so there isn't so much a penalty other than restarting the level again.\n\nThere are a total of 6 'levels,' which each consist of 3 stages and 1 boss fight. The stages play out as huge, sprawling maps, with many mooks to fight and collect parts from. Alongside occasional traps, such as bombs, pits, and what I can only describe as 'Repulsion' blocks. Bosses come at the end, and typically consist of a more arena-style map where you fight them (and occasionally others.) Defeating a boss will grant you with their unique part, parts you can't normally find off of regular enemies.\n\nWithin stages, you can also find secrets, including rare parts and color capsules. Color capsules are basically just new pallettes you can use to customize the appearance of your Megac; these, along with any parts you've collected, are all available at your home in Ventu Village.\n\nThere are a total of 150 parts, and few limits to how you can mix them. Did the enemy drop an arm? Head into your inventory and slap it on! Have more abilities than you have slots to equip them? You can change out your active abilities, and which keys they're slotted to, whenever you want! It allows for a lot of deep customization, which expands the more parts you collect from enemies in the world. I really like this, as it incentivizes replaying levels to hunt for parts; an active reward for exploration.\n\nAlong with finding parts, you can buy them with Bits! Bits act as both a currency and a point system in levels. Collecting 64 bits grants you with an extra life for that level, and you can even break parts down into Bits. You can use the Bits to purchase from the shop parts you may be having trouble finding, or can't find through normal means. Don't be afraid to check into it more than once while in Ventu; you never know what the shelves will be carrying!\n\nThe village itself also has its fair share of secrets to discover; some aren't present immediately, but reveal over time as the game progresses. It's worth taking a look around Ventu inbetween levels, as you may find special color capsules. Along with a unique part...the fabled Megabyte Fist.\n\nAlongside the Campaign, you can also play Tournament! This is a 1-player endurance mode where you fight 8 rounds against specialized enemies. One may be heavily armored, making direct attacks useless. Another may be highly evasive, ducking out of range to fire shots. It's a highly-replayable mode, encouraging you to tweak your build between rounds. Placing high rewards Bits, and first place nets you a special part.\n\nAnd finally, there's Battle mode, where you and 3 people can fight against one another. It's fun to see how your friends and you play off of each other's styles, and strategically plan around them while also taking into account you may have 2 other people wanting to take you on as well.\n\nFinale(Spoilers ahead!)\n\nI wanted to give special mention to the final boss of the game, as it is possibly the best curve ball the game has to throw at you. Around the end of the game, the Heartcore has been stolen by the Valk, leaving Ventu Village in a terminal state of duress. Without the Heartcore, Ventu and everyone in it will die off, prompting you to venture out one last time to get it back. The catch? It's in the hands of the Valk Emperor.\n\nThis guy plays for keeps. The Emperor is far harder than any enemy you'll encounter; he fights fast and dirty, prompting you to prepare in advance and to apply all your knowledge of the game thus far. His parts are unique to him, including a special ability that only his chestplate has: Summon Clone, which lets him create an identical copy of himself to fight you with. You'll have to be highly aggressive to put him down.\n\nAnd then it's STILL not over!\n\nThe Emperor's final play comes in the form of harnessing the Heartcore's power to become gigantic! Standing as the largest enemy in the game, he has a massive range of attacks. He can shoot, launch rockets, punch through your shield, punch YOU off the stage, and that's just the first half of the fight! The second half adds a missile barrage that you're forced to evade or deflect back. He's a grueling fight, but defeating him is nothing less than satisfying. Beating him unlocks the credits and his special parts for purchase in the shop.\n\nConclusion (tl;dr)\n\nIn all, the game is absolutely worth the time of any fighting game fanatics. Even if you're not that all into fighting games, the deep exploration and discovering secrets is highly rewarding and a lot of fun. I had a blast completing this game, and I'll probably come back to it a lot; I'm even thinking of starting over again and bringing some friends along! If that's not a good sign that this is worth your money, I don't know what is.","May 13","true","54.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sherwoodmccloud/recommended/248550/","sherwoodmccloud","Sherwood McCloud","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sherwoodmccloud/","47 products in account","As a fan of Super Smash Bros, I found this rather addicting. However, there is quite a number of flaws.\n\nStarting with the gameplay, I'm sure it would suit any serious gamer whether they played Smash Bros. or not. Comparing the game to Smash Bros. doesn't seem like a wise thing to do, but it's hard to resist for most. While this game is significantly more simple, it's probably for the best if you're playing with a keyboard. Gamepads aren't something everyone has, after all. In conclusion, the gameplay is excellent, despite how it had to be keyboard-friendly since a gamepad isn't something everyone like me owns.\n\nCustomization? In some cases, there's not quite much, but in other cases, there's plenty of it. There are different parts you can use as heads, arms, legs, etc. that give you special attacks, while other parts simply raise your stats such as damage, movement speed, armour, and attack speed. However, even though reskins can be acceptable, there are just a little too many bearing the same ability, such as the teleport. It's also really easy to use these abilities to take advantage of how dumb the AI is in some cases, making them considerably overpowered. You can use the sniper arm to repeatedly back an enemy into a wall, dealing quite some damage with each shot. You can also use the slice dash move to dash back and forth across an enemy, knocking them straight into the air and landing back down just in time for you to dash again. There are even a few cheap attacks the enemy can spam at you, the main offenders being the blaster or the drill, which are definitely noticable in the tournament.\n\nWhile we're stepping into the gripes, I'll address my biggest; wasted potential. This game had a chance to become the perfect PC variation of Super Smash Bros, but its severe lack of content is a big glaring issue. The biggest, though; no online multiplayer? Now, I understand that this was made by only 2 people who claim to have no networking knowledge, but come on! A game like this just screams online multiplayer!\n\nSo in conlusion, this game is somewhat worth the price, but I would highly recommend it if you're looking for a fun time-waster that lasts a long time. In fact, it's possibly the best single-player time waster there is. Kind of awkward in some places, but still a great game.","November 26, 2013","true","64.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

Some of the level design is a little obfuscated and makes exploring every nook and cranny pretty time-consuming, but the environments all have their own subtle style, and scripted battles are paced nicely throughout.\n\nIf you're ever played Nintendo's Super Smash Bros. games, you will feel immediately at home with the gamepaly.  The more damage enemies have, the farther and faster they fly when struck. When they hit something hard enough, they explode, at which point you can grab their parts and attach them to your own fighter.\n\nIt's extremely tight and fun to play, and the local multiplayer is awesome.   You can play co-operatively through the story mode, or brawl in Super Smash Bros style arenas, where falling off is the only way to die.  Obviously online play would be a nice bonus, but sadly it isn't supported.\n\nHighly recommended.","October 16, 2013","true","6.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Megabyte Punch is a platforming beat-em-up that gives players a lot of control over how their fighter handles. Both the entire Adventure mode and Versus mode can be played locally with up to 4 players, and players can test their mettle against the AI in Tournament mode.\n\nIn Adventure mode, players travel from their base of operations to 6 different areas and beat up everything in sight. Each area has 3 levels, and each level has plenty of enemies to fight and parts to collect. Once you get the hang of fighting a lot of enemies won't pose a serious threat, but as a whole Adventure mode is well paced and great for players who want to collect everything.\n\nCustomization is where the game really shines. Once you defeat an enemy and collect their scraps, combine the looted parts into a brawling robot that fits your style. Want to get up close and personal? Teleport point blank and slide kick into the enemy. Prefer ranged combat? There's a sniper rifle and a minigun for that. Need defense? Bring a shield and load up on armor. Don't care about fancy moves? Stock up on stat boosters and extra jumps. And if you want to be a real pain, there's always poison attacks and mines. If you want to be both functional and fashionable, several parts grant the same bonuses so your creation will look and feel just right.\n\nWhen you think you've perfected your mechanized marauder, take them to Versus mode and Tournament mode. Up to four players can duke it out in one of the Versus stages, or you can even make your own  custom levels	 [forum.reptile-games.com]. If you don't have anyone around to challenge, take the fight to Tournament mode to demolish computer opponents and collect rare parts.\n\nThe game isn't perfect; there's no online multiplayer, limited versus options, and the Tournament AI can be punishing. While there are a lot of parts, many share the same abilities and can leave you wanting more by the end. The walljumping mechanic is nice, but I can't count the number of times I've accidentally bounced off a wall into a painful death. One big problem is the single save file; if you want to start a new game with your friends, it'll wipe out any progress you've made. You can get around this by going into the root folder for the game and copying the save file and moving it back later, it's just not as easy as having more than one save file in the game.\n\nDespite any imperfections, this game is certainly worth it. Whether you want to track down all 150 parts or tackle some friends in Versus, Megabyte Punch will keep you coming back for more.","June 20, 2014","true","35.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Being a child of three awesome parents (Castlevania, Megaman and Super Smash Bros Meele), it would be near perfect and over the top. But I'll get into that. Let's kick some cyber butts!\n\nThe story is kind of cool, yet really easy to work out. Someone wants your village cyber-core (or whatever) and you need to protect it (or whatever). Meanwhile, after kicking some asses somebody stoles it (or whatever) and it happens to be the most obvious villain in the game. That's the whole plot, no kidding.\n\nControls are good. Of course I'm playing on keyboard, so it's far from perfect, but they are fluent and responsive. The fast paced action, as fast as it could be, doesn't cripple keyboarders, which is also nice.\n\nGameplay is really basic, but fun. You run around, punch some robots in the face, collect parts and occasionally color schemes. The posibilities are of course limited, but you can make a Megac (thats the official name) just whatever you want it to be. As long as it's bipetal humanoid.\n\nGraphics are well done, kind of clunky and polygon, just like in old imagining of late 80's and early 90's about future games. It's nice, old-school, and doesn't give you a feeling, that you need to put something in your eyes (a screwdriver for example).\n\nMusic is in pair with graphics. Kind of clunky yet strangely well made and vigorous. Another job well done.\n\nOkay, now, why it would be great and not is? Well, the game is almost officialy dead. There was no update since forever, because developers, after hoarding cash decided, that they need to make a sequel. Not, that I'm against it, but devs of Terraria for instance can do both. It's kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥-much behaviour in my opinion, but hell, the game is great.\n\nOkay, last word. Buy this game. If you have friends, then play with them either on split screen (kinda) or over IP. It's fun, it's well made and lots of fun. The olny disadvantage would be, it will probably never get updated, but it's a beat em up with SSB style, so whatever.\n\nZawisza out.","July 5, 2014","true","13.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It’s a simple pick up and play video game that will appeal to children and adults alike. The game’s mechanics are also comforting with a Megaman look and Super Smash Bros style of fighting. If there’s one thing Reptile did really well with Megabyte Punch it’s its combat system that keeps the player engaged even with the amount of repetitive enemies encountered in stages. There are however particular enemies that do provide a good level of challenge. Play is also best when using a gamepad as using the keyboard can become difficult.\n\nThe graphic style used by Reptile also works well with the gameplay. The environment compliments the action figure like robots that battle it out and can cause damage to their surroundings. Everything that is presented is clean and aesthetically pleasing with a good choice of color palettes used. Throw in some 8-bit style music and Reptile Games has truly created an indie gem that will appeal to players.\n\nMegabyte Punch is a game that will definitely challenge players. With six levels consisting of three stages and a boss each, on top of further time spent customizing your Megac, Megabyte Punch will give you some bang for your buck. But it doesn’t end there. The developers also expanded gaming options with the Tournament mode that will give the player even more challenges and customizable parts outside of the story mode.\n\nFinal Message\n\nMegabyte punch is an entertaining video game with a simple beat em up style of play. While the game runs well early on, it can become repetitive as your progress through the game. Nonetheless, Reptile Games has delivered a title in 2013 that stands with some of the best indie games of the year.\n\nVideo Review: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yasK_Uf3QE&list=TL8Fme--YE_RvVGyUp1JCVfHWjguD2uk4W\n","January 6, 2014","true","6.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I literally heard nothing about this game untill I found the Steam page for it, watched the video, and bought the game on sale. Was it worth my money? For the most part, I found the game pretty fun. There are three different game modes to play: story mode, tournament, and versus mode. The story takes place in a computer world where the heartcore, the giver of life in your village and world, is stolen by a corrupted empire. You play as a robot fighter, fighting off the empire and saving your village from destruction. The gameplay is very reminiscent of the Super Smash Brothers series, as you have basic attacks as well as powerful attacks meant to knock back enemies, but there's a twist. Enemies in the game are made up of different robot parts that can be dropped upon defeating them. See an enemy with a cannon arm? Beat him up, and if it drops, its yours to equip. Parts range from movement buffs, to extra defense, to special attacks, and it's interesting to come up with different combinations to make your character the way you want. You can even find hidden color capsules to personalize your robot even more! Boss fights are similar to a regular match in SSB, where you rack up damage on your opponent to knock them off the stage. Defeating bosses will give you new parts you only catch a glimpse of from common enemies, which makes it all the more satisfying to use the part back on them. The gameplay, while fun, can get repetetive after a while. most of the enemies are no threat at all, being easily knocked into a bundle and shot off by your power attack or rockets, and some of the platforming can be a bit frustrating at times. The visuals are simplistic, bearing resemblence to polygons and geometric figures, but it's very colorful and charming. Combining this with the great soundtrack creates some interesting themes in the stages and areas of the game. Really, my only main complaint with the game is the multiplayer. Have you always wanted to have SSB-like battles with your friends over the internet on your PC? Well, you'll be severely dissapointed, because this game only has local multiplayer. That means your friends have to come to your house and play the game there. Also, unless you've played the main game for a decent amount of time, you won't have any parts to customize your robot with for multiplayer. Overall, If you like customizable robots and SSB adventure mode, you'll like this game. If you want a good multiplayer game for steam and don't like playing fighting games by yourself, I would skip this game.","January 20, 2014","true","19.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has fluid controls and hits make you feel like you really smacked it. My only farts about it are there are so many parts, but little variety in stats. So all the customizing is more for looks than it is mixing up the abilities. And that last boss...my friend and I have both been working at it and find ourselves struggling to see it worth our time to conquer it. So everything up to that point was definitely fun. Just such a steep curve in difficulty. It's not that it's even that hard, but it takes so long, you mess up and lose, each time feeling less like you want to try again. I wonder if it's worth the win. Or is it like the dang We Love Katamari secret where you spend hours collecting exactly 1,000,000 roses...only for a frickin' stupid looking spinning rose loading icon.\n\nDespite the negative, I would still recommend this game because it looks and plays great. The soundtrack is good too. 6 levels, each with 3 parts plus bosses really felt close to flawless. I really enjoyed the time I spent playing it up till the last boss. If you see it on sale for $5-7 it's definitely worth a purchase. At $14.99 I would have been a bit disappointed.  Then again...thinking back to the old days. Super NES used to sell games up to $80. wtf. And we still bought em, disappointment and all. Man, times have changed.\n\nTo the developer...please update this game with an adjustment to the final boss' difficulty. At least so it levels with the rest of the game. And more variety in part abilities would be nice too. At least something to make certain parts more special than others. Without that, one starts to feel short changed and lose interest in finding all 150. Online battles would be great too.\n\nStill...this game is solid fun.","March 25, 2014","true","24.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you have ever played SSB and felt that you could never find a character that fit welll, now you can make one. The game use a similar control scheme where you have the standard or "A" button attacks and then depending on what parts you equip you can add your special attacks/abilities or "B" Button moves. You can even change which direction you use for the move combo to your own liking. There are plenty of parts to choose from, once you unlocked them of course. The only issue I have is that there is a lack of size cusomiztion, being able to change your character's size would help give the game more of a SSB vibe as that ga,me has heavy to light characters which affect speed and knock out. Despite that, you will have plenty of options to choose from, such as Powerful Uppercuting Fist to legs that boost speed to cores that boost shielding ability to Shoulders that give you extra jumps and the effects can be foud on multiple part types or sometimes on the same part type but in a different look, which is makes the customizing easier both functionally or comsemticly.\n\nThe only concerns are the lack of online multi player and the tournament mode where the CPU players must be made out  of a dense alloy as they can still remain in the battle despite having 300 damage but you little robo will have a hard time staying once it has 100 damage; they also must have been modeled on that one guy who spams the same moves as they love to and will not hesitate to use the same move repeatedly.\n\nPROS:\n\n- Runs Great, no bugs or crashing\n- Lots of variety in Character Customization\n- Adventure Mode is fun with secrets to find and parts to unlock\n- Tournament Mode is a good test of skill (or of how cheap you robo's fighting style is)\n\nCONS:\n\n- Tour. Mode CPU needs to be brought back to Earth (So when I uppercut them at 200 DMG they go flying)\n- Tour. Mode CPU need to be more randomize, fighting the same Bots can be annoying (Looking at you Drill Guy)\n- Lack of on Online Features\n\nConclusion:\n\nWorth the small amount of money if you love any of the above mentioned games.","February 24, 2015","true","43.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Gameplay is fast and smooth, like cutting butter with a warm knife, while early game can be almost a cake walk (as expected), the final levels will force you to play better if you want even a chance to win, but man, does it feel great beating that final boss.\n\nLocal multiplayer may not be everyone's cup of tea in an online focused era, but I would still recommend the game if only for the singleplayer content. Eight battles against AI opponents to win special parts, whose difficulty rivals even that of the final boss, and six levels to explore with six bosses to defeat, and more secret levels.\n\n150 parts are advertised, though there's more like 20ish abilities, this isn't bad as it offers the player a lot of choice to customise their character to have the abilities and looks they want, and 30 color schemes to choose from. I also discovered what I think is a bug with the color selecter. Now normally it paints all your parts, but it doesn't paint ones already in your inventory before the color was chosen, this can be used to combine many different colors and parts to make a truely unique character.\n\nStory is alright, though I don't play games for a story, that's what a book is for. It contains some humor, and references to computer technology.\n\nOverall, I'll rate Megabyte Punch a 10/10, I would gladly play through the adventure again.","June 1","true","19.4"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Mine were as follows: "Oh boy, this game looks like a lot of fun, the single player looks like a good way to introduce players to mechanics in the game, while also allowing you to upgrade and create a more versitle character that fits your style of fighting games, and the multiplayer looks like it plays like Super Smash Bros. Sign me up." And while all this holds true, there's a few glaring flaws the game has. Let's start with the good.\n\nPositives:\n\n-The game's graphics are really colorful and I rather enjoy them. I'm no expert on frame rates, but I can say the game ran smoothly, and I haven't encountered any hickups in frame rates.\n\n-The gameplay is fast and fun, and I can see the multiplayer being a blast if you have more than one controller and have friends willing to play.\n\n-The controls are tight, and responsive, and are customizable for the different move sets you want to perform.\n\n-The single player campaign is also quite fun, having a variety of stages, and the main hub is a lot of fun to explore and find secret color upgrades, that don't do much beyond changing the color variation of your character.\n\nOf course, as fun as the game is, there's a few problems that need to be addressed.\n\nNegatives:\n\n-First off, there's no online multiplayer. I feel like in this day and age, fighting games released via pc's really don't have much of a reason to not use some form of online multiplayer or co-op, especially with the ability for people open ports, meaning the development team doesn't need to pay for server fees. The lack of this means you have to have friends and extra controllers to really enjoy the multiplayer aspect of the game.\n\n-With that being said, the only thing left for you to do is the single player, which can become rather stale after a while. Even though each stage is structurally different, you'll find it monotonous after a while running through and beating up bad guys to get to one boss fight. Also, there's no check points in the worlds, meaning if you lose all your lives half way through a stage, you'll then have to start all over from the beginning of the world.\n\nOverall:\n\nOverall, this game is a lot of fun, but can end up tiring you out after a while. I would suggest picking this game up if you have friends who would like to play it with you, but if you're like me and were expecting an online feature, then I'd say pass, cause the single player campaign isn't enough to hold you over for long, especially for the price tag. (I still recommend it though.)","February 17, 2014","true","5.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/248550/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","I had my eye on this game for a few months now, and when I saw it in a bundle, I decided to try it out. It was a surprisingly good overall, although it has some serious issues that deters a lot from the experience.\n\nMegabyte Punch is an arcad-y brawler with a fairly high focus on customization. The combat is very much alike Super Smash Bros. Brawl, which is nice to see on a pc. Essentially, you go around several levels, with 3 stages each, with a Boss as a final stage. Each level has its own looks and theme to it which is good for variety.\n\nEach time you lose all your lives (which you can get from collecting Bytes, the game's currency), or you finish a level, you get back to the village, the game's "Hub" area.  There, you can go around talking to different Megacs getting a few tips on the game, or go to a store and buy new parts, and then go into another level, which you unlock as you go further into the game.\n\nGraphics.\nAs you can see from the steam screenshots, the game is really great looking! It has a very unique artstyle, and manages to invoke some retro feel while looking very sharp and modern. That's a really nice feature of the game. There's not much else to be said about them. Everything seems to fit pretty well, it's a great 2.5D looking game!\n\nSound.\nAlso, the music is really awesome! Surprisingly so, actually. And music also changes according to the level your in, each fitting the setting as best as possible. There's a level in a desert, with pyramids on the background, and with an oriental sounding track. You get the drill.\nSoundEffects were pretty good as well, giving the combat a good impact after you've done some good damage. More on that further.\n\nCustomization.\nSo, in Megabyte Punch, you control a Megac, with several different parts you can attach to it, each giving a different Stat or Ability, and changing how the character looks. This actually reminded me of Medabots quite a lot, and it was a great throwback to my childhood. That's always a plus!\nThere are 150 parts in total, which you can get through the levels or the Tournament Mode (more on that later). Although there are many parts, some of them have the same effects. Or at least, the same description, since there aren't all that many numerical information about them. That's actually pretty bad, in my opinion. There are parts that simply "increase damage". But there's no actual information about its differences. If the only difference is the look of them, it's kind of pointless to have those in, isn't it?\nAh well, overall, customization wasn't bad, but there is much room for improvement, to be honest.\n\nCombat.\nSo, this is probably one of the most important components of this game. Unfortunately, it does not feel as well and it should, most of the time. The biggest issue I had with it was the knockback. If you're familiar with SSBB's combat, you know that as the opponent gets more and more damaged, the impact rises until he flies into a wall and explodes. Well, it's the same here. BUT, the first hits simply throw the opponent away enough so that it's hard for you to hit him a second time, as a follow up. That leads to Punch-step-punch-step-punch... etc. This makes the combat very sloppy, and not that fluid. It makes it harder to combo moves, and it leads to imense frustration when the opponent is hit, and then attack you right away to the ridiculous knockback. Also, (note that I was playing with a Gamepad), using different abilities is sometimes very clucky, since you have to press a direction to activate an ability, and then quickly press the direction in which you'll you use it. This leads to the player using the wrong abilities all the time, or just wrong directions.\nSo, overall, I wasn't too pleased with the combat, leading to a frustrating experience that could have easily been polished.\n\nTournament Mode.\nThis is essentially a classic SSBB mode, in which you fight other Megacs, or Bosses, individually. It's pretty cool, but it gets old a bit too quickly on your own.\nWhich leads to another big problem. Local Multiplayer Coop only. Sorry, I had to mention it. Since there's no online play, a big part of this game is simply left to dust in a pc game. It's a shame, it could've been a much better game for it.\n\n\nFinally, my biggest problem with the game. This got on my nerves way too much.\nThe checkpoint system. I don't understand why the developers thought this was good at all. Well... it's awful, sorry.\nEverytime you lose your lives, you get back to the Hub Area. But, that area is pretty big, which makes the player walk for a few minutes before getting back to a level. On top of that, if you were on stage 3 when you died, you'll have to go through the first and second stages again. What the ♥♥♥♥?! Why would there be several stages if there are no checkpoint systems? This leads to too much time lost everytime you die and, again, frustration. The only real Checkpoint is before a Boss. Well, at least there was that. But it's definitely NOT enough.\n"Oh, you were just bad at the game". Yeah... Look at Super Meat Boy. A game has to make "dying fun", in a sense. It's alright if one dies, as long a he can get into the game right away and try again. Without having to deal with walking to the level over and over again, and then redo a lot of previously beaten sections. You'll be bored to death before getting to the challenging part. Aaaand that leads to the final Boss.\nThat was really, really awful. First, it starts with a normal Megac fight. Fair enough. It was challenging, but nothing to hard. Once you're done with it (which takes a while), you get 2 lives and advance to a second Boss Fight. I'll not that there is NO CHECKPOINT after this, which means that you ALWAYS have to beat the first stage before moving.\nBut, the second part of the Boss has 4 stages. And the first 2 are essentially the same as the last 2. Which is really dreadful design. This leads to a very long fight, which gets far longer whenever you die, having you go through it over and over again. With the clunky combat system and the awful checkpoint system, this leads to a very bad experience, in my opinion. It's a shame, but this last impression pushed this game down a lot in my consideration.\n\nConclusion.\nIt's unfortunate, the starts starts off stellarly, but then reveals its flaws further into it. It's an overall great game, but its design flaws hurt it a lot, with long levels without checkpoints (which makes you be stuck in the game for longer than you should), and a huge wait time between deaths.\nPlus, no Online Multiplayer.\nStill, it's great going through the levels, it looks and sounds great, and it invokes a great feel from 90s games and TV shows.\nExperimentation with the different parts and combat styles is also pretty good!\nCheers.","January 27, 2014","true","15.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The levels have oodles to see and lots to explode as you revisit things, with numerous valid builds and approaches for any given section of the game, and highly destructable worlds to boot.\n\nThe last boss, however, is a cheap cop-out by comparison - the core mechanic it uses is a very nice mix-up on the usual gameplay in the game, but you gain ZERO benefit from any defensive or protective items against this final boss, and 'homing' effects don't work properly with regard to the core mechanic he introduces, so suddenly all that customization goes out the window. AND the last boss has the abused schtick of at-will wide-area spamming projectiles that makes fighting it feel like flashbacks to Arcana Heart 3's Parace L'Sia.\n\nThis turns an otherwise near-flawless game into a massive let-down, due to just how sharp a slap in the face this sudden turn-around is. So, if you're buying this for single-player? Don't. And if you're buying this for multi-player? It doesn't have any except locally on a single computer. So, sadly, while it's such a well programmed game I simply can't recommend purchasing it to others.","March 13, 2014","false","18.0"," 14 of 30 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","14","30","0","0"

Just because I said that I don't recommend it, doesn't mean the game is bad.\n\nOverall, the game is amazing. I haven't played enough to state everything that is good or bad about it, but the thing is, although the game has interesting mechanics, nice gameplay, graphics and soundtrack, it lacks a really important feature for a brawler: online multiplayer -- I can't recommend this game until it receives that option, and since the developers stated that they won't do that, I won't recommend it, games like this are way more enjoyable when you've someone to play with; local multiplayer isn't enough.

Implementing a crappy online system would've been a black spot on a solid single/local multiplayer game. There is a chance that we will create a sequel to the game.

At first glance, the game appears to be a new Megaman-a-like. However, when you start playing, you immediately feel the problems with this game. While there was potential, it just did not make it.\n\nThe controls are the first thing that you know is wrong with this game. They are clunky and unforgiving. You never know when you will be allowed to perform certain actions, such as a double jump, until you try. By controls, however, I mean the friction and the responsiveness of pressing the buttons. It was the entire feeling of this character who appeared to be fast, but felt like he was trudging through a swamp.\n\nThe enemies were also far more of a nuisance than a threat. Every time I punched one of them, they would fly a few screens away. I don't even know if they did any damage!\n\nBugs were another problem with this game. I somehow managed to punch a character through the entire flooring of the level all the way to to the bottom. As cool as it looked, it turned out that was not actually supposed to happen. Had I not had wings to fly back to the area, I would have been forever screwed. That of course was only one of the bugs I ran across, but hopefully you see my point.\n\nIt was at that point that I decided I just couldn't stomach it any further (about 30 minutes in). I was really hoping that it would get better. I did really like that there were a lot of options to customize your character and there were a lot of really great ideas in there, but the game needs to be finished first. Until then, I would say don't bother.","July 4, 2014","false","0.5"," 4 of 16 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","4","16","0","0"

The worse thing about bad controls is it's really hard to explain so i'll give my best to but it won't be an accurate description: For starters you can only have 3 abilities which you can slot in certain directions for example up, down and left + Right. You then have to be pressing in that direction in order to use the ability so if i had teleport on UP i would press UP + Special how ever if i wanted to teleport to the right i have to pull off an extremely tricky UP + Special into the direction i want to use. If you're a second too late it doesn't work and you often find yourself doing one of the other two abilities you have slotted half of the time and the other half you'll find yourself teleporting up. Why does it have to be like that? Why can't you just have the abilities slotted into different keys then press the key to select the ability then press special to execute it. Then you would be able to do the ability in any direction you wanted but no you can't do it like that because that would make sense!\nTo do a combo attack you have to be stood still and press the attack key how ever when you're running at an enemy and pressing the attack key it does a heavy attack flinging the enemy away from you so you can't get an extra hit and end up doing minimal damage. Now if you run up to an enemy and stop in order to do a combo the enemy will just hit you first and combo you so you don't want to do that because this will get you killed so the battles end up taking way too long because you can't maximize damage or dealing combos without the risk of getting hit yourself.\n\nI don't know if these are issues when using a controller and i highly doubt they are because it feels like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ console port.","September 5, 2014","false","0.6"," 2 of 12 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","2","12","0","0"

This game attempts to somewhat ape Super Smash Bros by having an action platforming game where your robot character can pick up parts to customize it's abilities and move sets. It's a neat idea, but for some reason, the game just feels a bit uninspired. I mean, it has some personality thanks to its art style which is midly charming, but sound assets and music lack any oomph or interest to be memorable. The controls of Super Smash Bros was perfect, especially the shield, throw, and dodge mechanic. Here, you have a shield, but any dodging is reliant on running away or skills that help you move fast. I can't tell if there is enough balance in this game. I played the Fight mode, and the first enemy nearly beat me because it kept landing attacks. The second enemy was slow, and I landed tons of attacks on him, but he placed bomb that hit me and all of a sudden I had a ton of damage compared to him, despite that I've hit him numerious times compared to the less than 10 times he hit me.\n\nI'm sure some players with a lower quality threshold won't mind this game. It isn't terrible or completely incompetent, but it is certainly not enough to entertain me and doesn't come close to the perfection of the series it tries to imitate. Fairy Bloom Freesia does a better (though, very imperfect) job of giving PC players an alternative. The game becomes pretty boring to me quick and while I was pretty good at SSB Melee, I can barely hold a candle when I get in an arena fight, which I feel isn't worth my time investing to since I found quality and entainment the minute I played the Smash Bros games.","January 11, 2014","false","1.3"," 6 of 24 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","6","24","0","0"

The customization/inventory system has a bit of a learning curve, but you'll manage it within the first levels. IMO the only real improvements are of course online multiplayer and the possibility to skip/speed up NPC dialogue. Also: my gamepad won't work with the game.

It does not quite have the sophisticated move sets and balancing of either game, but the combination of the two creates a fairly fun game.\n\nThe adventure/campaign mode is about 6-8 hours long, depending on how much backtracking is done in each level for rare parts and color customization items, and each boss fight is essentially bare bone Super Smash Bros. stages but with some destructable terrain.  The story is simple as well, but considering the genre and style of the game and the fun factor, it can be forgiven.  Connecting a spin kick on an enemy gives a nice satisfying feedback in slow-mo sound and visuals as you watch them fly. The level visuals are nice as your character travels to different regions. It never felt like a chore to play the game.\n\nGiven the strong foundation that this game has built, I hope a sequel would be made that expanded on the combat system through part diversity. There may be many parts but there isn't a wide variety as many share the same abilities.  They may be located in different areas of the character's body, such as double jump attached to the head instead of the shoulder, or are cosmetically different and functionally the same.  Also, the majority of abilities can be found about halfway through the game which makes backtracking for rare parts in later levels to be less rewarding. Considering that many are variations from Super Smash Bros., I wouldn't mind seeing more abilities and ideas borrowed too. For example, the shield mechanism doesn't allow rolling, which I found myself repeatedly trying to do. Basic melee combat is always at a fixed range because there are no melee weapons and parts don't extend attack range. Just adding some of these can be a massive improvement on an already solid game.\n\nOverall though I found Megabyte Punch to be a fun and would definitely help scratch the itch for a bit of Megaman and Supersmash Bros. game on Steam. I would definitely recommend playing with a controller as it feels much better.","February 23, 2015","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Megabyte Punch is a good old beat em up adventure game thats basically a mixure of the Super Smash Bro games and Custom Robo. It has the same fighting element as the Super Smash Bro games like the damage meter. The higher the enemies damage is, the easier it will be to either kill them or laumch them off screen and kill them. However there is no way to heal yourself other than dying. Its also got a Super Mario component to it where if you collect 64 Bits in adventure mode, you get an extra life. As for your character itself this is where the Custom Robo part come in to play. In Custom Robo, you can collect parts that can give you stat boosts or new attacks and abilities. Megabyte Punch does the exact same thing. Each part can either increase your stats or give you a new attack and you can obtain new parts by either winning tournament mode, defeating enemies in adventure mode, or buying them from the shop in adventure mode.. I absolutely LOVE this game and have been dying to get my hands on it ever since I saw Jesse Cox from OMFGcata do a review of it the game way back when it was still on Steam Greenlight. I have spent nearly 40 Hours playing this game.\n\nThe only complaint that I have with the game is that it has local multiplayer instead of online multiplayer. If the creators could add online multiplayer to it so that you can play adventure mode, tournament, and versus with friends online, it would be even better. Also multiplayer is split screen which I'm not a big fan of and you would need some controllers for your Computer.\n\nIts a great game, its definitly worth the $15.00, and I recommend it to everyone.","October 18, 2014","true","70.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The customization options are nearly limitless, and all the special moves re really fun. Blowing up an opponent feels good and there are PLENTY of ways to do that. The amount of paths in each level make it fun to explore for hidden parts of colorizers, as well as making finding the exit a challenge, but not impossible. The art style is perfect for this kind of game and the robotsare very well designed. The tournament mode is fun to kill time and challenge yourself to get to the higher rounds. There is just one little problem that prevents the game from being perfect. There is no online battles. Local gameplay is ok, but getting all your friends crowded around 1 keyboard isnt really that enjoyable. An addition of matchmaking or even just an invite system would make the tournament mode alot more fun and would add alot more replay value. I dont pretend to understand the intricacies of programming a multiplayer system or even programming a game, but that addition alone would make the game 1000x better.

Those robots that blew up for a short amount of time because of their Gameboy games? If you don't or if you need a bit of a refresher: Medabots were robots that were acclaimed for their customizability. Within the games, you were able to change out each arm, each leg, the chest, the head, the hip, and even their power medals. Every piece you changed gave that medabot a different ability, whether it was a passive like increasing their attack power or it was an active like the ability to do a powerslide. You could piece together a tank medabot, with actives and passive that supproted the generally slower and bulkier parts. Or you could make a speedy medabot, with parts that quadrupled its speed, but made it very fragile. Another piece of the game was how you gained parts: by beating your opponent and randomly taking one of the defeated medabots' peices. But if you lost, you lost one of your pieces. It made each battle exciting and very competitive among friends. Now, take all of that, give it updated graphics and stuff it into a platformer and you have Megabyte Punch. Although the game could be a new remake of Medabots in a different genre, it is still a tremendous amount of fun, especially with friends. With that being said, MP (Megabyte Punch) has a few minor flaws that culminate to knock it down from a perfect score. The levels being to feel a bit repetative, even if they are still entertraining enough to keep you going. The bosses are pretty hard (only because they are ungodly spammy), which is weird after extremely easy build-up levels. And the final flaw is something so simply fixed that it pains me to have to bring it up: hit-boxes. While most are okay, some of the moves have really annoying and off hit-boxes, screwing up those perfect and delicious combos that the game allows for. One move that always messes up my juggle combos is the up-basic attack, as the hit-box is only on the side you are facing, making the juggle much harder than it should be.\n\nEven with the minor flaws, this game still stands tall as a monument of customization. It fights like Super Smash Bros with more combos and (unfortunately) more spam. Either way, try this game. If you can convice a few friends to join you in co-op or versus, you'll enjoy it even more.\n\n8.75/10","June 22, 2014","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay is tight, the graphics are colorful, and the music is amazing! Summing the game up, Megabyte Punch is a side-scrolling platform action game where you make a customized robot with parts you find from other robots you kill. The fighting engine is akin to Super Smash Brothers where you use moves to whallop opponent's so hard they either leave the ring or smash into the ceiling or walls so hard that they explode into bits. The game has 6 Stages, each consisting of 3 Large Levels and 1 Boss Level, which unlock as you progress and can revisit at anytime. The level design is just right, being not too open, but not so linear that you won't need to explore to find all of a level's secrets. My only gripe is the ending boss who I had to go to some lengths to beat, but he is far from impossible once you get his patterns down and you have the right build of parts. BUY THIS GAME!

The customization available in this game was one of the things in this game that made me love it, although many parts were very similar to eachother (or the same) in their abilities. Some parts (blunderblaster comes to mind) were risky moves that were satisfying when they hit, others (like the mandibyte leg) were fast abilities that made you feel, well, fast.\n\nThe styles of the levels were interesting, and their music was a bit strange, but fit well. Although the music can sometimes get a little annoying (at least to me), most of the time I enjoyed it. My favourite was probably the final boss' theme. Speaking of the final boss, the difficulty curve was fairly good, but I had a harder time during level 6 than I did with the final boss.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheGoodSirHatter/recommended/248550/","TheGoodSirHatter","The Good Sir Hatter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheGoodSirHatter/","325 products in account","After spending considerable time with this game, finding all the collectables and playing numerous matches with my friends, what I can say is that this game is the reason PC needs more "couch" multiplayer games. This game is an utter delight and truly a hidden gem in the sea of Steam.\n\nThe presentation of the game is stellar. I'm astounded by the level of finese Reptile managed to achieve with the free version of the Unity engine. This game has a bright, colorful aesthetic with really nice looking robot models and an old-school feel to level design that screams "1990's side scroller". The music is wonderful, and it all gels together amazingly.\n\nThe gameplay is nothing to snuff at either. The game is split into two modes of play: the side scrolling stage-based Adventure mode, and the stationary Smash Bros. style Fight mode. Adventure mode feels a lot like Mega Man, where you go between battle rooms defeating enemies and work your way to the end of the stages. There are six levels with three stages per level and a boss fight at the end of each. You defeat enemies by building up damage on them ala Smash Bros, then using a powerful attack to send them flying at killing speed towards a wall. Enemies will often carve deep into walls, giving you a real feeling of impact as their bodies slice through the terrain of the level that is truly satisfying. As you progress, often doors will lock you into a small arena where you need to defeat multiple enemies before proceeding, which also spawns a checkpoint if you die. Along your path, you will find two kinds of collectable. The first thing you get are Bits, which can be collected for an extra life, 64 netting you a 1-up, and after each level Bits can be spent in the store to obtain rare parts. Speaking of which, your other collectables are a plethora of robot parts, each one having different properties you can get by adding them to your robot in real-time. When you pick up a part, you get the option to attach it to your robot immediately as you play through the stage, letting you not only see and apply your own progression, but also giving you an immense amount of autonamy with what upgrades you want to apply. The part system lets you really choose what kind of play-style you want to go for. There are 150 parts to collect total, each giving you a variety of stat boosts and special attacks, so go nuts.\n\nAfter you're done with the Adventure mode, you can play in the Fight mode. The goal in Fight mode is to build up damage on your enemies then send them flying off the stage, like Smash Bros except with the customization of Custom Robo. There are two ways to play in the fight mode, the first being a Versus with 2 to 4 local players (no bots), or in an 8-round 1v1 tournament against a series of 8 bots. The Versus mode is rioutous fun to play with friends, and if you can hook your PC into a TV it can literally be fun for hours. After showing it to my personal friends, I've had testimony that this game is better than Smash Bros. While I don't necessarily agree, the appeal of the multiplayer is apparent. The other mode that can be played in Fight is the Tournament mode. The goal is to defeat 8 consecutive AI opponents, all randomly drawn from a pool of pre-built opponents. You can switch your build in between each round, and it plays much like Brawl's All-Star mode where you must defeat each opponent with only a limited number of lives in order to achieve victory. Placing in the top four nets you bonus Bits to spend in the shop, which is extremely useful for getting some of the rarer parts, and getting first place nets you rare parts.\n\nThis game is truly great, but it definitely has problems. First, customizing your robot can be fairly slow, as you have to page through 15 pages of parts, 10 parts per page, with no decent organization. Given, the parts are arranged into categories by a sort of soft transition, but it would have been nice to see the parts be separated into different scrolling pages based on the part category, to speed up the sorting process. The second major problem that this game has is that there's no way to play free rounds of Fight mode against a number of AI bots. If you want to play alone, all you have is Adventure and Tournament; playing in a 4-player free-for-all requires you to have 3 friends lying about, and there's no online to fill in the gaps. Third, the game's AI can be a little predictable at points. I found it easy to exploit AI behavior in certain ways, such as spamming ranged shots to build damage without having to move whatsoever, and the AI would just walk into the shots instead of trying to shield and jump away from my line of fire. Fourth, it would have been nice to see a little more part variety. I know, there's 150 parts in the game, but many of the parts are simply aesthetic changes. However, the variety is a very minor complaint as there's quite a bit of variety in there and many parts share stat boosts in order to build robots in certain ways, but it just gets under my skin. And finally, farming to get all the parts is a pain, some of the parts seem to have horribly low drop-rates. As a player who's sole goal is to make his multiplayer games completely multiplayer ready by having everything available, this irked me.\n\nAll-in-all, this game is great, I'd recommend it in a heartbeat, and I'm surprised it managed to go under the radar like it did. This game is one that will even make non-gamers entertained, and it's great for parties. If you haven't gotten it, get it now. For all it's small flaws, this game is truly great and will be an excellent addition to your library. Just make sure you get some controllers and friends to truly get the full experience.","February 17, 2014","true","35.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Both modes are extremely fun.\n\nThe combat system works well, and the customisation system mean you can create the character you're most comfortable playing. I do wish there wouldn't be so many redundant parts (basically, several parts share the same attributes but have a different look), but there is already a lot to work with.\n\nI really enjoyed Adventure mode, felt like a platform game from the 90s in a nice and colorful world, and lot of secrets to discover for those who like challenges. The first levels are very easy, but the difficulty ramps up nicely up to the last level that provides a nice challenge, and a great final boss.\n\nA special mention to the soundtrack which is extremely well done.","January 18, 2014","true","13.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheGoodSirHatter/recommended/248550/","TheGoodSirHatter","The Good Sir Hatter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheGoodSirHatter/","325 products in account","After spending considerable time with this game, finding all the collectables and playing numerous matches with my friends, what I can say is that this game is the reason PC needs more "couch" multiplayer games. This game is an utter delight and truly a hidden gem in the sea of Steam.\n\nThe presentation of the game is stellar. I'm astounded by the level of finese Reptile managed to achieve with the free version of the Unity engine. This game has a bright, colorful aesthetic with really nice looking robot models and an old-school feel to level design that screams "1990's side scroller". The music is wonderful, and it all gels together amazingly.\n\nThe gameplay is nothing to snuff at either. The game is split into two modes of play: the side scrolling stage-based Adventure mode, and the stationary Smash Bros. style Fight mode. Adventure mode feels a lot like Mega Man, where you go between battle rooms defeating enemies and work your way to the end of the stages. There are six levels with three stages per level and a boss fight at the end of each. You defeat enemies by building up damage on them ala Smash Bros, then using a powerful attack to send them flying at killing speed towards a wall. Enemies will often carve deep into walls, giving you a real feeling of impact as their bodies slice through the terrain of the level that is truly satisfying. As you progress, often doors will lock you into a small arena where you need to defeat multiple enemies before proceeding, which also spawns a checkpoint if you die. Along your path, you will find two kinds of collectable. The first thing you get are Bits, which can be collected for an extra life, 64 netting you a 1-up, and after each level Bits can be spent in the store to obtain rare parts. Speaking of which, your other collectables are a plethora of robot parts, each one having different properties you can get by adding them to your robot in real-time. When you pick up a part, you get the option to attach it to your robot immediately as you play through the stage, letting you not only see and apply your own progression, but also giving you an immense amount of autonamy with what upgrades you want to apply. The part system lets you really choose what kind of play-style you want to go for. There are 150 parts to collect total, each giving you a variety of stat boosts and special attacks, so go nuts.\n\nAfter you're done with the Adventure mode, you can play in the Fight mode. The goal in Fight mode is to build up damage on your enemies then send them flying off the stage, like Smash Bros except with the customization of Custom Robo. There are two ways to play in the fight mode, the first being a Versus with 2 to 4 local players (no bots), or in an 8-round 1v1 tournament against a series of 8 bots. The Versus mode is rioutous fun to play with friends, and if you can hook your PC into a TV it can literally be fun for hours. After showing it to my personal friends, I've had testimony that this game is better than Smash Bros. While I don't necessarily agree, the appeal of the multiplayer is apparent. The other mode that can be played in Fight is the Tournament mode. The goal is to defeat 8 consecutive AI opponents, all randomly drawn from a pool of pre-built opponents. You can switch your build in between each round, and it plays much like Brawl's All-Star mode where you must defeat each opponent with only a limited number of lives in order to achieve victory. Placing in the top four nets you bonus Bits to spend in the shop, which is extremely useful for getting some of the rarer parts, and getting first place nets you rare parts.\n\nThis game is truly great, but it definitely has problems. First, customizing your robot can be fairly slow, as you have to page through 15 pages of parts, 10 parts per page, with no decent organization. Given, the parts are arranged into categories by a sort of soft transition, but it would have been nice to see the parts be separated into different scrolling pages based on the part category, to speed up the sorting process. The second major problem that this game has is that there's no way to play free rounds of Fight mode against a number of AI bots. If you want to play alone, all you have is Adventure and Tournament; playing in a 4-player free-for-all requires you to have 3 friends lying about, and there's no online to fill in the gaps. Third, the game's AI can be a little predictable at points. I found it easy to exploit AI behavior in certain ways, such as spamming ranged shots to build damage without having to move whatsoever, and the AI would just walk into the shots instead of trying to shield and jump away from my line of fire. Fourth, it would have been nice to see a little more part variety. I know, there's 150 parts in the game, but many of the parts are simply aesthetic changes. However, the variety is a very minor complaint as there's quite a bit of variety in there and many parts share stat boosts in order to build robots in certain ways, but it just gets under my skin. And finally, farming to get all the parts is a pain, some of the parts seem to have horribly low drop-rates. As a player who's sole goal is to make his multiplayer games completely multiplayer ready by having everything available, this irked me.\n\nAll-in-all, this game is great, I'd recommend it in a heartbeat, and I'm surprised it managed to go under the radar like it did. This game is one that will even make non-gamers entertained, and it's great for parties. If you haven't gotten it, get it now. For all it's small flaws, this game is truly great and will be an excellent addition to your library. Just make sure you get some controllers and friends to truly get the full experience.","February 17, 2014","true","35.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Customisation also feels nice in that abilities are often shared between parts, so you have a nice balance between abilities or perks and aesthetic value. Shame about there being no online multiplayer, which will hopefully be rectified soon. Also combat can be a little disorientating and tricky to master when you're combo-ing in the wrong direction. Also, the price tag is a tad steep at the moment, but if it's on sale, do not hesitate!

I can say with no doubt that this is worth every penny. The world is populated by Megacs, a race of robots that can change their parts. Of course you are one of them, and are tasked to protect your village from assorted robot bad-guys. There are six levels with three stages and a boss level apiece. Okay, I've gotten that out of the way.\n\nIt is freaking awesome. You get to dispatch tons of unique enemies that when killed, drop parts (out of many hundreds) that you can use to customize your fighter. There are also secret collectible colour capsules to change your colour scheme; and believe me, the customization is absolutely stunning. And it may just be me, but shooting the crap out of a robot and sending him flying across a room and exploding him against a wall is pretty cool. But the game can sometimes feel lacking in collectibles and stage length, but it may just be the low-poly art style that puts me off.\n\nAside from the main story, there is also a tournament that you can enter and win rare parts; and a local multiplayer versus mode, which can become amazingly fun and intense. This is definitely worth purchasing, but some people might not appreciate some simplified graphics and monotonous mechanics. All in all, the platforming, environment and gameplay feel amazingly fun and solid.\n\n8.5/10","March 1, 2014","true","17.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Those robots that blew up for a short amount of time because of their Gameboy games? If you don't or if you need a bit of a refresher: Medabots were robots that were acclaimed for their customizability. Within the games, you were able to change out each arm, each leg, the chest, the head, the hip, and even their power medals. Every piece you changed gave that medabot a different ability, whether it was a passive like increasing their attack power or it was an active like the ability to do a powerslide. You could piece together a tank medabot, with actives and passive that supproted the generally slower and bulkier parts. Or you could make a speedy medabot, with parts that quadrupled its speed, but made it very fragile. Another piece of the game was how you gained parts: by beating your opponent and randomly taking one of the defeated medabots' peices. But if you lost, you lost one of your pieces. It made each battle exciting and very competitive among friends. Now, take all of that, give it updated graphics and stuff it into a platformer and you have Megabyte Punch. Although the game could be a new remake of Medabots in a different genre, it is still a tremendous amount of fun, especially with friends. With that being said, MP (Megabyte Punch) has a few minor flaws that culminate to knock it down from a perfect score. The levels being to feel a bit repetative, even if they are still entertraining enough to keep you going. The bosses are pretty hard (only because they are ungodly spammy), which is weird after extremely easy build-up levels. And the final flaw is something so simply fixed that it pains me to have to bring it up: hit-boxes. While most are okay, some of the moves have really annoying and off hit-boxes, screwing up those perfect and delicious combos that the game allows for. One move that always messes up my juggle combos is the up-basic attack, as the hit-box is only on the side you are facing, making the juggle much harder than it should be.\n\nEven with the minor flaws, this game still stands tall as a monument of customization. It fights like Super Smash Bros with more combos and (unfortunately) more spam. Either way, try this game. If you can convice a few friends to join you in co-op or versus, you'll enjoy it even more.\n\n8.75/10","June 22, 2014","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But I'll do the devs a solid for a bit and just give them a binary 'yes'.\n\nMegabyte Punch has a lot going for it, as far as indies go. For one, it tries to emulate the fighting style and feel of the ever-so-popular Smash Bros. series of fighting games, and puts in a bit of Custom Robo meets... Mega Man into the mix. While this sounds like a dream come true, where it really fails at is the Smash Bros. part. Before we get to that, let's start with the good.\n\nGood:\n- The graphics are very well done. Nice, bright, but very cool colors, and pretty well done if a bit simplistic robot design.\n- Level Design does it's job well. Damage tiles, secrets, so far so good.\n- Lighthearted kid-like humor in the writing. I wouldn't be afraid to hand this to a niece or nephew.\n- Music is nice.\n\nMeh:\n- Gameplay feels very static and restrained. As far as I can tell every bot has the same default attacks, and what's changed is the secondary (specials in Smash.) moveset. What's also missing from Smash are...well, smash attacks, and rolling. In-game I always try to pull off those two moves, and it just bugs the hell outta me when I can't.\n\nBad:\n- Sound effects. No, seriously, it's annoying enough to be a problem. There is a delay when opening up some of the customization options, and it's very noticable. Same goes for some attacks, and the explosion sound repeats for each object per explosion and it sounds terrible.\n- Local-only multiplayer. It's rare to find someone willing to huddle around a monitor to play some indie game, and I haven't been very lucky.\n\nOther than that, the game is pretty nice. I can't speak for multiplayer, because of said local-only multiplayer, but it's alright to kill an afternoon with or you're just on a coffee break or somethin'. I don't think the game needs a very built computer to play on.\n\nSo, 6.5/10. Great idea, average implementation. If they fix all my gripes, This game would be an 8 or 9 easy. Hopefully we'll see that with a sequel. I'll update this review if I continue and find something else to add.","April 5, 2015","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Of course you do! But have you ever been playing Smash Brothers and wished you were a completely customizable robot? If so, then this is the game for you. Megabyte Punch is essentially Smash Brothers between robots with customization. It's not the most original idea but it is fantastic.\n\nFor the story, you are a simple robot fighter living in a simple village till evil comes along and forces you to take action. You fight through a bunch of levels, each one containing a boss at the end, collecting parts and making money. You get a great feeling when you finally find a new kickass weapon to place on your robot, or a new ability, or an enhancement of an ability you already have. You can change up your head, torso, hip, back, left arm, right arm, left leg, and right leg, Also there are a bunch of color designs to be unlocked throughout the game that can be applied to your robot. The customization is probably this game's strongest feature. You can also complete the story mode with a friend in couch coop or compete against them in arena style matches.\n\nSome minor complaints I would have with the game would be that the robot customization system can take some time to get used to. Also, you have to physically run to each level before starting it up. Being able to just teleport from the town to the level would save some time. These are very minor complaints and do not take away from the game to any serious degree.\n\nOverall, this is a great game at a good price with only minor problems. If you are interested in a fighting/customization/robot game with couch coop then you should definitely give this a try.\n","February 10, 2015","true","15.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I ♥♥♥♥ing loved Megabyte Punch. The boss fights are so intense and fun. The bosses themselves follow the same principle as your own mech customization, so each boss has a completely different moveset. The tournament mode is the same way. You'll be surprised by how you might actually have to build a counter to an enemy three battles into the tournament mode.\n\nThe levels themselves are classic platforming. You don't really need to fight every enemy you encounter, but you'll get trapped in open areas and forced to fight a couple guardians. These battles are awesome; They're like mini Smash Bros. battles with no walls or ceilings for instant KOs.\n\nReptile are definitely building themselves a delicious repertoire here, with Megabyte Punch really shining as the precursor to Lethal League.

In fact, it was described to me as Custom Robo meets Super Smash Brothers. I have not played the former, but I can tell you that Megabyte Punch postively smacks of the latter: Damage to players is calculated as an increasing percentage, and you do not die unless you are launched out of the arena or level: however, the higher your damage percentage, the further you get knocked by attacks, and unlike Smash, you can be exploded if you slam into a solid surface fast enough. Also like Smash, the game is horribly balanced, favoring setups that use cheap, powerful weapons and players with the response time of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hummingbird. Multiplayer is likely a blast for someone who enjoys such, as I did not. However, I found the campaign a mostly enjoyable experience, thanks to MP's excellent music, colorful graphics and simplistic, but eye-grabbing art style. There is considerable depth of character customization. The wall-jump mechanic is a bit odd, however- no actual use of the jump button is involved, you need only push away from the wall if you are contact with it. I've never seen this anywhere else and I found it more awkward then not. However, the game's greatest flaw is by far its difficulty. The campaign starts out easily enough but across a mere six or so levels, quickly ramps up to a ridiculous degree, aggrivated by an archaic lives system in which they only way to acquire more is to gather 64 bits, the game's coins. I was unable to beat the final boss and had grown weary of the game well before that point. I am sure there is someone out there who can and has beaten him. But regardless, there is enough about the game I like to give it a thumbs up, but be warned: non-fighting gamers may want to pass on it completely.","July 31, 2015","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

With the Smash fighting mechanics I easily learned how to play this game. The customizable moves create a unique way of fighting through the campaign with each combination of custom special moves and stats. The customizing mechanics are well built and I found no problem figuring out how everything worked even without a tutorial.\n\nWhile in story mode the friendly NPC's ripped on the RPG genre in a very humorous way. I found myself laughing at what they said as a person familiar with games like The Legend Of Zelda. When I got into the fighting portions of the story I found myself doing lots of circles to find all the loot scattered and hidden around the map. Each level took about an hour to finish. The story itself was very well constructed and written, with a great plot and story arch. though I didn't finish the story I was very happy with what I did get through.\n\nWhile I was fighting the enemies I was exclaiming "HOLY S***!!" because the way to kill enemies is to bash them against the walls and have them explode into and through the walls. One instance where this was very apparent is when I purposefully kept hitting an enemy into a wall to increase his damage percentage to a very high percent, when I pulled my finisher move on him he demolished a huge chunk of wall. This shock factor only really happens when the walls are destructible, and for the second level all the walls were indestructible so the shock factor dissipated.\n\nThe games graphics aren't anything to fancy, they are quite dull in modeling but make up for it in color. The character recoloring was welcome in making the game very colorful, I even made my guy looking like Batman, bat wings and grey color.\n\nThe Tournament mode was a very welcome challenge. I never got past round 5 because the bots are super powerful, compared to story mode. Their damage equaled mine and had every customization that I myself could have. I found myself having as much AA damage as possible and hitting them with ariels to maximize my effectiveness in battle.\n\n~~~~RATINGS~~~~\n\nReplay Value : 7/10\n\nGame time (estimated to completion) / Cost : 25/15 10/10\n\nArtwork: 5/10\n\nStory: 8/10\n\nMechanics: 10/10\n\n~~~~~~~OVERALL RATING~~~~~~~~~~\n\n~~~~ 80/100 ~~~~","March 15, 2015","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you're a completionist you will easily find 40-50 hours trying to get all the parts. (I'm at 34 and still not 100%) It's a highly fun game to play.\n\nThe game plays exactly like Super Smash Bros, but with characters akin to the Custom Robo games. The customization is great, with all sorts of parts with different abilities or effects to mix and match. The story mode is engaging and challenging at the higher levels, with all sorts of hidden places to explore and find rare parts. There are even a few simple puzzles and riddles to follow.\n\nThat said, it could use a few things. Currently, there is no multiplayer, and that doesn't appear to be changing anytime soon. Also, you won't be able to set up interesting battles vs the AI. Aside from the story mode, you can either do tournament mode and fight the AI 1v1 8 times, or you can do battle mode and fight up to 4 players split-screen. There is no option to create a custom game with players vs AI, which is a shame since there are parts of the story mode that are actually 2v2, you and 1 AI vs 2 AI opponents, so the systems are there.\n\nDespite this, I would recommend this game to any Super Smash Bros fans, especially those who also like customization such as that found in Custom Robo or other Mech games. There has been mention of the possibility of a sequel, however there is no word whether or not it's under development or not. Still, this version is worth a buy.","June 12, 2015","true","34.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Although the music can sometimes get a little annoying (at least to me), most of the time I enjoyed it. My favourite was probably the final boss' theme. Speaking of the final boss, the difficulty curve was fairly good, but I had a harder time during level 6 than I did with the final boss.

The gameplay is tight, the graphics are colorful, and the music is amazing! Summing the game up, Megabyte Punch is a side-scrolling platform action game where you make a customized robot with parts you find from other robots you kill. The fighting engine is akin to Super Smash Brothers where you use moves to whallop opponent's so hard they either leave the ring or smash into the ceiling or walls so hard that they explode into bits. The game has 6 Stages, each consisting of 3 Large Levels and 1 Boss Level, which unlock as you progress and can revisit at anytime. The level design is just right, being not too open, but not so linear that you won't need to explore to find all of a level's secrets. My only gripe is the ending boss who I had to go to some lengths to beat, but he is far from impossible once you get his patterns down and you have the right build of parts. BUY THIS GAME!

I am a bit of a button masher but still having fun with it.\n\nCombat is great and once you're used to it you'll definitely enjoy it.\n\nI like the upgrades and bits system. It's so cool. It's primarily a fighting and not shooting. You can equip a gun though but it doesn't do as much damage as melee. So I prefer some jumping/mobility parts and abilities. Level design isn't that great sometimes and having to just walk to boss level door was a bit of annoyance for me.\n\nAnd speaking of bosses... they are good and very satisfying to defeat. Not to mention the parts they drop. There are hidden parts of the levels where you can find good parts and lots of bits.","July 15, 2015","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kennebunkport/recommended/248550/","kennebunkport","Christopher","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kennebunkport/","477 products in account","Megabyte Punch is the love-child of Mega Man and Super Smash Brothers, and does both parents proud.\n\nI bought the game entirely on a whim and I am so glad I did as it has rapidly taken a place among my favorite games of all time. A little bit about where I'm coming from: I'm a 30-something that grew up on side-scrolling platformers like the original Mega Man series for NES as well as couch coop beat-em ups like Streets of Rage.  Very few games can scratch that itch these days, and this game manages to do that with an engaging adventure mode which has you working your way through various open ended stages and an arena mode with some of the most satisfying competitive play you'll find anywhere. Both modes can be played with between 1-4 players so grab your friends, a controller, a beer and be prepared to be entertained.\n\nThe combat is very much like Smash Brothers in that you don't just die after receiving a set amount of damage. Instead, the more damage you take makes it easier for you to be flung further and faster with each hit you take. Take a hit that launches you into a wall hard enough or off the stage and you blow up spectacularly. I cannot stress enough how satisfying it is to roundhouse kick an enemy through a wall and watch him break into bits on the rock behind it. This goes doubly so for launching your friend's character into orbit when they are sitting next to you on the couch and you can observe their reaction in real time!\n\nThe adventure mode's premise is that you are a digital being call a "Megac" born from something of a super computer called the Heartcore to protect your village. You quest through various large stages, each with multiple paths to the finish and a reasonable difficulty curve. Exploration is both highly encouraged and rewarded with goodies being hidden in unorthodox places that the keen observer (or just plain lucky) will find. As you destroy enemies there is a chance that they will drop one of their "parts" similar to how Mega Man can absorb defeated bosses powers but with a much higher degree of customization. As a Megac, you can take those parts and customize yourself on the fly creating various builds you can switch as the need arises. Your Megac is made up of a head, shoulders, core, hips, two arms and two legs. Each one of these can be customized making for characters that play wildly different from eachother. These parts can either buff a particular attribute of your Megac or provide a special ability. Bosses at the end of stages make for good challenges as well as dropping rare parts unique to them.\n\nMultiplayer is an arena affair with all of your custom Megacs squaring off in a variety of floating platforms. All of the combat mechanics are the same, although certain parts become more useful in this setting than the adventure mode. A very skilled player will have no issues using any of the parts, however.\n\nFrom a mechanical standpoint, the first time I booted up the game the controls felt a little "floaty." I realized that the reason for this is the game defaults to using an analog stick for movement which is different from my Mega Man/Smash Brothers muscle memory I have built up over the years by using the d-pad.  Having that much more throw in the control does take some getting used to and I suspect is the reason that some of these reviews say the platforming could use some work. Once you adapt to the difference or change your controls, you are fine.\n\nFor all that is great there are some criticisms I can level at the game. The elephant in the room is a lack of online multiplayer. At the time of development Team Reptile (who would later go on to make Lethal League) made the choice to forego online functionality as they weren't sure they could implement it to the standard the rest of the game was made. I'd love to see them revisit this title and add it now, as they most certainly have the expertise to do so. Also, there is the issue of unlocking parts. If you just buy this game now and sit down with your friends to play, you will have almost no parts to make your Megacs with because they are unlocked via the adventure mode. A "free vs." mode would have solved this issue entirely.\n\nAll in all, I can't recommend this game enough if you are okay with the caveats I have listed above. 9/10\n\n","November 28, 2015","true","14.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is basically poorly done knock-off Smash Bros.

There are seriously 3-5 arms that give the exact same effect, have different names and graphics, for no apparent reason.

If you're a completionist you will easily find 40-50 hours trying to get all the parts. (I'm at 34 and still not 100%) It's a highly fun game to play.\n\nThe game plays exactly like Super Smash Bros, but with characters akin to the Custom Robo games. The customization is great, with all sorts of parts with different abilities or effects to mix and match. The story mode is engaging and challenging at the higher levels, with all sorts of hidden places to explore and find rare parts. There are even a few simple puzzles and riddles to follow.\n\nThat said, it could use a few things. Currently, there is no multiplayer, and that doesn't appear to be changing anytime soon. Also, you won't be able to set up interesting battles vs the AI. Aside from the story mode, you can either do tournament mode and fight the AI 1v1 8 times, or you can do battle mode and fight up to 4 players split-screen. There is no option to create a custom game with players vs AI, which is a shame since there are parts of the story mode that are actually 2v2, you and 1 AI vs 2 AI opponents, so the systems are there.\n\nDespite this, I would recommend this game to any Super Smash Bros fans, especially those who also like customization such as that found in Custom Robo or other Mech games. There has been mention of the possibility of a sequel, however there is no word whether or not it's under development or not. Still, this version is worth a buy.","June 12, 2015","true","34.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The developers seem to realize that the controls are incredibly difficult to use with any degree of precision because it seems that they have designed the levels and the combat AI to take advatage of this.\n\nExamples:\n\nDamage Plate environmental hazards that send you pinballing around the level if you so much as brush against one, placed where you would have to have precise control to get through them without dying or getting bounced back to the start half-dead.  The controls are the type where if you try to turn around you end up sprinting in the opposite direction.\n\nThe combat AI spams quick special attacks and regular attacks like a 6 year old in a fighting game.  Just sitting in the corner spamming ranged attacks so that you can't get to it.  The melee variants aren't any better as the computer doesn't have the controls to contend with and can just jump right behind you and start pummeling you while you're still locked in the delay after an attack.  Not that they need to do that.  Almost any enemy attack seems to cancel out any attack you're in the middle of, even at the point of contact.  You can be in the middle of attempting a combo and start getting annihilated like you were standing still.  I say attemping a combo because every attack in this game has a delay either before or after it's performed, so there really isn't any way to chain a combo.  It's all hit and run tactics, which makes every fight, through every level drag on.","December 25, 2015","false","12.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is basically poorly done knock-off Smash Bros. Normal enemies die by being hit into walls at X velocity or more whilst bosses only die under Smash Bros rules - by being hit hard enough to reach the edge of the map.\n\nThere are 15 pages of inventory pieces for you to equip, they all have the same small handful of effects. There are seriously 3-5 arms that give the exact same effect, have different names and graphics, for no apparent reason. You have no reason to grind, no reason to worry about currency for purchases - because they will be duplicates the first time you come back to them as well, and none of the inventory is actually compelling.\n\nI was lucky, I got this on Humble Bundle.

The gameplay is tight, the graphics are colorful, and the music is amazing! Summing the game up, Megabyte Punch is a side-scrolling platform action game where you make a customized robot with parts you find from other robots you kill. The fighting engine is akin to Super Smash Brothers where you use moves to whallop opponent's so hard they either leave the ring or smash into the ceiling or walls so hard that they explode into bits. The game has 6 Stages, each consisting of 3 Large Levels and 1 Boss Level, which unlock as you progress and can revisit at anytime. The level design is just right, being not too open, but not so linear that you won't need to explore to find all of a level's secrets. My only gripe is the ending boss who I had to go to some lengths to beat, but he is far from impossible once you get his patterns down and you have the right build of parts. BUY THIS GAME! If you like what you heard above, you will NOT be disappointed!","July 19, 2015","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The customization available in this game was one of the things in this game that made me love it, although many parts were very similar to eachother (or the same) in their abilities. Some parts (blunderblaster comes to mind) were risky moves that were satisfying when they hit, others (like the mandibyte leg) were fast abilities that made you feel, well, fast.\n\nThe styles of the levels were interesting, and their music was a bit strange, but fit well. Although the music can sometimes get a little annoying (at least to me), most of the time I enjoyed it. My favourite was probably the final boss' theme. Speaking of the final boss, the difficulty curve was fairly good, but I had a harder time during level 6 than I did with the final boss.

I didn't think that the art design was all that appealing, and I didn't think it would play very nicely. I bought the game along with fifteen other games in a bundle, and I was certain that this would be one of those games that I would spend 15 minutes on and never play again for the rest of my life. Several hours later, at 4:45 in the morning, I found myself still playing this game.\n\nThis game is basically the God-sent answer to fill the Super Smash Brothers hole in every PC gamer's heart. Rather than being a blatant ripoff, however, it embraces the combat that makes the series so fun but then allows you to create your own, unique character with its own fighting style. With more than a hundred parts to customize your robot with, you can make your character truly unique. There is a full, fleshed-out campaign with plot that gives explanation to everything's existence, and the opportunity to find new parts for your robot.\n\nIf I had to complain about anything, that list would be short. Here it is:\nThere is no online capability at all.\nThe tournament mode should at least reward you for trying, to have incentive to keep playing it.\nThere is no "versus" mode with bots.\n\nBut I'm not complaining otherwise. Great game, highly recommended. Extremely recommended if you enjoy local co-op, and have a couple of spare controllers handy.","April 12","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Combat is easy to get into, and the loot system isn't too grindy. I always found myself unlocking multiple new parts every level. I can't tell how long this game can stay fun, but I didn't get bored the entire time I played. It has a fun mix of combat and platforming, and the customization is pretty nice: you can change every part of your body and the colorscheme. I only played singleplayer, but you can play the campaign with up to three others, and there is a versus mode. The only problem I had with the game was the tendency to freeze. The game locked up on me and I had to close, and I couldn't use task manager to close the game. I wasn't able to click on anything on my computer, and the game sounds continued to play. If this happens to you, you have to manually shut down your computer, so be aware of that. As far as price goes, I can't say I would've spent the full $15. I got it on sale for way less, and I am satisfied with my purchase. Overall, this game is entertaining, and I hope the developers look at adding new content in order to keep the game fresh.
