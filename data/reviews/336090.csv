Others in the genre handle a bullet hell scenario much better.\n\nThere are more issues. Some of the text in the dialogue boxes is cut off or appears outside of the box, and as for the display problems: I run a native 6000x1080 and on that revolution the game suffers from the common problem that it is Vert-, meaning the screen is unuseable. Sadly windowed mode will simply use the same resolution, windowed. There doesn't appear to be an option for it so I have to disable Surround to play.\n\nStill, for the  current sale price (-75%) I can recommend it for fans of the genre. It falls short of living up to the full €10 though.","May 6, 2015","true","1.4"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","19","20","0","0"

There is no devastating sound effect that showed you have just killed enemies. (I heard a blast sound but it's fading because the volume of the BGM is highter).\n2. The font size is too small\n3. The HUD display info is also too small\n\nSo yeah, I still recomend it since you can share the fun with your friends (local co-op mode).","October 27, 2015","true","3.7"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","84","16","19","4","0"

Otherwise, it's a fast-paced sh-mup like Raptor where enemies comes from left, right, but mostly up/front.\n\nYour fighter can swap between 'red mode' and 'blue mode'. In red mode, you absorb red bullets and gets damage by blue bullets, and vice versa. Obviously you have to switch based on your tactical situation: sky too crowded? Switch colors to absorb the shot. Remember though, enemy will adapt with you. You can be accompanied by up to 4 drones and depending on which powerup you nabbed you can be joined by wingmen and more. As you fly through debris of enemies you pick up dropped "coins" and whatnot which you can spend on upgrades.\n\nOne thing that sets this game apart somewhat is location-based damage, as the ship can take damage in 4 different locations, and the drones have their own individual life meter.\n\nThere are three different fighters, with different default strengths (heavy defense, heavy offence, average). There are over a dozen upgrade options, and three pilots each with different skill tree (there are only 5 skills each though). One pilot is mostly offense, one's mostly defense, and one's a drone expert.\n\nGame itself is simple. Fight your way through various planets and moons against baddies, enough said. If you finish a particular world (3 levels), you get to play "escape stage" where you are running away from a boss and you use your rear guns against it and the missiles it shoots at you, and if you get away you get a lot of bonus bucks you can use for upgrades.\n\nThe sh-mup is an very old genre, and the "polarity" system had been done before, but the skill tree, pilot, fighter, and upgradeable parts makes the game seem rather fresh. other than the game looks a "little" low-res on a 1680x1050 screen, I see no downside to this game. Sound is average with a proper adrenaline sound-track.\n\nWorth a try if you like the genre.  But read the manual before you start. There is no help within the game that explains the color system.","May 7, 2015","true","8.1"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

You level up pilots and ships flying missions through Ikaruga-style gameplay.  The soundtrack is mostly very solid.  And there's a level editor, something I haven't seen in many shmups but is a welcome additional feature.\n\nWorth a shot.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ferizo/recommended/336090/","ferizo","ASH+Ketchum","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ferizo/","1490 products in account","I don't know if this game is supposed to be an homage to old school shmups because it sure as heck doesn't tell you so.. or anything else which possibly could be of use to the player for that matter. It almost seems like this game tries to bite off more than it can chew, resulting in what feels like a watered down shooter that doesn't excel at anything.\n\nI don't write negative reviews lightly (this being my second). I generally just don't bother with 'mediocre' or lower game but in some cases I do care. So from an almost 3 hour play session (which is more than lenient for this type of game) this is what I got from it.\n\n- Damage Numbers: By default, this setting is enabled which may be 'fun' in the beginning but later on just serves as more crap and distraction on the screen and doesn't really add anything useful whatsoever.\n- RPG Element: I usually enjoy RPG elements in games when it's done right.. but it does absolutely nothing for me here. It feels like a boring linear treadmill which almost seems required to progress which is pretty absurd for a shmup.\n- Color/Absorb/Polarity: A nice mechanic popularized by Ikaruga but falls a bit short here. Players unfamiliar with Ikaruga will either have to stumble upon it, get it from the subtle one-time 'hint' in the game or read it from the achievement you get for switching colors.\n\nTo cut things short, I'll speed it up a bit.. The UI is unpleasant to navigate; in-game HUD is very bland; Hitpoints for the player's ship are localized to separate ship parts/drones which is useless because it's not like you have any real control of it; enemies often seems to have too much HP regardless if you 'specialized' for damage; and the bonus level seems to be bugged unless you're not supposed to move and tank sporadic rockets that sway towards your ship until you die because I can't imagine shooting all of them down whilst also trying to wittle down the 'boss' of it's seemingly infinite HP.\n\nThere's probably more minor grievances that I have with this game but despite of everything I just wrote, I would be okay with this game if it wasn't for the dreadful sound effects. I have never played a shmup that felt less satisfying than this one does. The sound effects are very bland to the point that there's no sense of impact when you shoot or kill an enemy ship.. not only is it unsatisfying to shoot and kill, it makes it somewhat difficult to tell where and when you actually kill an enemy. For a game that revolves around wrecking swarms of enemy ships and crafts, this makes for a very dull and boring experience.\n\nBut that's not all unfortunately because the horribleness of sound effects stretches even further.. Now I am not a rookie at these types of games but in certain levels it throws so much crap at you that I'd be surprised if you can come out of it unscathed. Calling it bullet hell feels degrading towards other actual bullet hell games so I usually like to call it 'bs hell' as that's what it is. In other words, you will sometimes get hit quite a bit. ..and when you're in the middle of taking all of those hits in a bullet infestation, it really.. really doesn't help that taking damage sounds like you're being smacked on the the side by a muppet.. or stung by a swarm of muppets for that matter. Because that's not a sound that makes you think you're in trouble or may be about to die. If it wasn't clear.. by muppet I mean a little puppet that makes a squeeky sound when you squeeze it. ..it's horrible. But on the flipside, after an hour playing listening to it your ears become immune and you'll start thinking that colliding with enemy spaceships only tickles you and you're immortal.. ..well, until you see your ship crashing down that is.\n\nAnd with that, I think I have said enough. Honestly, I do think this game has/had potential but it just seems that it tries too much whilst the most essential parts of the game fall behind unfortunately. One thing I did enjoy was the music.. but for some reason it's random as heck which doesn't distinguish the stages/tilesets from each other and makes each level as forgettable as the last.. which sadly is also true for the game as a whole.\n\nAs a fan of this genre in general, I can not by the life of me recommend this game at it's full asking price. Perhaps the multiplayer/co-op could be fun, but alas like most of these games it's local only. And even then, I would advice just getting it on a sale because there's far better out there for your money's worth.","January 7","false","2.8"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

The RPG elements seemed cool to me and the Ikaruga-like color swapping held some appeal as well.\n\nBut the game is not good. Technically it runs alright but I encountered bugs with it not displaying an icon on my taskbar. The UI is lifeless, the music is horrible (really poor quality on the menus and ingame) and doesn't feel inspired or interesting in any way, the ship customization+player customization+drone customization is done very badly. You don't get any real description of what anything does, and the little bars that gauge offense and defense don't make sense. On the ship selection screen they work one way and on the drone upgrade screen they work in the opposite way.\n\nThe levels are typical for a SCHMUP but your ship+drones take up a ton of the screen. It is really hard to avoid getting hit (which makes the Ikaruga-like color swapping mechanic useful) and things just feel really... unpolished. I think it is safe to say that the whole product feels and plays like a mobile port.\n\nHopefully this sees some major patching but as-is it is not really worth a purchase at 9.99. if you get this 90% off you might feel like you got what you paid for but at full price it feels like a rip-off. Especially since some of the best games on Steam are cheaper (Binding of Isaac, for example).","December 16, 2014","false","0.1"," 30 of 52 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","30","52","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sleaker/recommended/336090/","sleaker","Sleaker","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sleaker/","565 products in account","This is an Ikaruga-like vert-scolling shmup.  You can absorb bullets depending on what color your ship is curretly flipped to.    However Sky Mercs also adds in a bit of class/ship progression, by allowing you to replay missions at different difficulty levels for credits.  You can then purchase ship upgrades.  Your pilot also levels up (5 levels total) and you get to choose a skill at each new level.  Overall the skills and ship upgrades passively make your ship better.  This lets you do better and get further in the missions.  This kind of system is a bit of a deviation from standard shmups that rely a lot more on pure player skill and bullet dodging.\n\nSome things to note:  The game is marginally buggy and still suffers from infrequent crashes, generally this only happens right when I'm launching a mission, and the missions are short enough that it doesn't bother me too much.\nSky Mercs just becomes a grind-fest for levels/credits once you finish the main levels as there are many more ship levels and items to unlock than the game provides progression for.\nYou can play with the mouse or keys, but the mouse is ideal as it provides instant-movement to wherever the cursor is on the screen.\nIt's hard to tell what enemies are vulnerable to, and how to dispatch them quickly.  Sometimes, lack of enemy appearance makes it impossible to chain multiplier bonus due to poor level design.\n\nEnd result: If you like vert-scrolling shmups you might find this enjoyable for a few hours.  Otherwise, if you're new to the genre or want something more polished, I'd suggest sticking with classics like Ikaruga and Raiden.","June 16, 2015","true","6.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I disagree, and will explain why.  First off, it would largely be a generic shmup if not for the polarization / bullet-absorption mechanic a la "Ikaruga" or the latter "eXceed" games.  It's well-implemented here, for a fun and satisfying level of challenge -- and the 'Overloads' take the mechanic to its (super fun) logical conclusion IMO.\n\nAdditionally, the music is absolutely fantastic.  With a nearly album-length soundtrack of original compositions made specifically for THIS game, it sets the mood perfectly and is absolutely perfect for getting into that "Matrix zone" trance and blast some motherf*ckers!!  It's a nice electronic soundtrack that reminds me of classic arcade shmups but with a kind of dubsteppy feeling (but without its by-the-numbers drops, and nothing obnoxious or distracting).  A HUGE thing, just added in one of the most recent updates, is Steam Workshop functionality -- you can make and d/l levels for the game, meaning ENDLESS replayability.  The RPG elements also add a lot of value, and customization to the game -- instead of purely collecting coins for score, you are able to use them for a number of upgrade systems.  NO, it's NOT an RPG... but they said "elements"!  There's a difference.  Lastly, the developers have been GREAT so far -- diligently listening to, working with, and participating in the community; even releasing same-day hot-fixes for the problems we report!\n\nThat brings me to my next point.  Almost every issue people have brought up in the negative reviews has been addressed by the dev team.  This game is great fun, and is getting consistently better.  In an environment where LOTS of games get released horribly broken, you can't really fault a small independent team for having some problems at release.  But..  I really have a lot of faith that one day this game will be VERY close to "perfect".","May 26, 2015","true","3.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

В целом сначала игра заставляет изучить свой корабль и его способности и здесь ключ ко всему - по вам стреляют синими и красными шариками: от них не уворачиватся надо - а переключив корабль в синий или красный режим по нажатию правой кнопки мыши ловить их - заполнив шкалу до предела вы получите перегрузку которая нанесёт урон всем ближайшим врагам и собьёт летящие в вас снаряды (не шарики), всё другое нужно сбивать. С боссами ситуация таже - последний конечно немного помучает вас из-за мини-бага с тормозом при сбивании его ракетного веера и корабль против него нужен тоже прокачанный - но зато его уровень ОЧЕНЬ богат на деньги и опыт, так что фармим и в конце концов он не жилец. Плюс рандом уровни после прохождения и прокачка пилотов без мании - 5 уровень= все способности.\nИз минусов игры - устаревшая графика, но не скажу что она плоха - итак куча проэктов не с такой ретро-графикой (тот же Айзек) и цена - но скидка решает проблему. Так что игра стоит того чтобы в неё поиграть. Баги починили, ачивки работают - берите и расслабляйтесь сколько угодно.\n\nSo we have old time arcade type "destroy all" which reminds old arcades on automata (who remember that times) with lvl up elements. In general game demand you to learn abilities of your ship and here lies key to all gameplay - enemy shhot you with blue and red fire DON'T dodge - switch ship in required mode by right mouse button and catch them when meter is filled you get overload which damage all near enemies and destroy all enemy projectiles, but destroy all other stuff. Bosses have same weakness - last one is hard cause you will got slowbug when destroy it's rocket barrage and you will need good ship - but it's zone is VERY rich to money and exp so farm and eventually it will fall before you. Also plus is random zones after all and lvl up system for pilots - no to whole dat farm - 5 lvl = all abilities.\nGame has minuses  - old type of graphics but today some games also have retro style and have good reputation (Binding of Isaac) and price - but discount solve the problem. So game is worth to buy and play. Bugs are fixed, achievements are working - so buy and enjoy it so much as you can.","May 13, 2015","true","15.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"
