The Steam version fixes this, and has no DLC or microtransactions at all - all the heroes are included in the game, and it doesn't even have the consumables store anymore.\n\nThe Steam version also includes a bunch of the bonus maps/mini-campaigns added in updates to the iOS version after launch, with the promise that the rest are coming soon in a free post-launch update that will also add a new bonus campaign exclusive to the steam version.\n\nMy only small disappointment with the steam version so far is that there's no way (that I can tell) to add a keybind to call the next wave early. There does seem to be some sort of nonfunctional keybind-manager in the game launcher, so hopefully that's something they'll add soon. (UPDATE: This is no longer true - there's now a keybind for this!)\n\nKingdom Rush is, in my opinion, the best TD game out there, and this Steam release is the definitive version. At $7.50 it's a steal (I can't tell you how many hours I've sunk into this game), and I strongly recommend it to anyone who even remotely enjoys TD games.","January 6, 2014","true","11.6"," 815 of 920 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","815","920","0","10"

As far as game mechanics go, it is just another TD game with no real groundbreaking or innovative dynamics.  But something about the art style, the animations, and the soundscape create a nice blend that is undeniably charming.  This should be a welcome addition to any TD fan’s library.\n\nLike in all good TD games, the core gameplay is extremely addictive. Kingdom Rush is well-designed to be challenging, yet not needlessly frustrating.  The level design allows for creativity, but also limits your options enough so it isn’t a total chore trying to figure out what to do.  That said, as you get deep into the game, it can become quite a challenge to 3-star levels; but worst-case scenario you can find guides online to help you out.\n\nThere aren’t really that many towers, in truth.  But there is just enough. And they are all diverse, fun to use, and are all useful at one point or another in the game.  I find many TD games with dozens of towers usually still can be beaten with only the best five, anyway.  Nevertheless, to make up for the relatively low amount of towers: there are twelve hero units each with different abilities.  Trying out the different heroes as you unlock them adds that bit of spicy variety to the game.\n\nI feel it is only fair to point out: you can play the original version of the basic campaign for free on the many flash game websites out there… with microtransactions for some extra “premium” content.  The Steam version comes with all content included in the price, as well as a few extra expansion levels; and of course it comes with the benefit of the “meta-aspects” of any Steam game (Steam achievements, trading cards, screenshots, etc.). You can decide what is an acceptable price for this.\n\nIf you are an advocate of TD games and can pick up Kingdom Rush for a price you are comfortable with, then you absolutely should grab it and give it a go.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","October 6, 2015","true","18.4"," 164 of 180 people (91%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","91","164","180","7","0"

I've played a lot of tower defense games over the years because it's one of my favorite genres (ever since it was invented on Starcraft/Warcraft custom maps), and this is right up there in the top 5 of all time. I first played it a couple months back on Android after it was featured in one of the Humble Bundles, and it is the only game out of that bunch I played for more than an hour or so. I literally would step away from my gaming PC once or twice a day to go lounge around with my phone and play this... It's that good.\n\nA lot of people are concerned about microtransactions in this game because that was the main way they made money from the mobile app, but the new PC version is completely different. You don't have to buy heroes, and the gem store -- which was still intact in the premium version I played on Android despite having all heroes included -- has been removed. So in addition to rebuilding the game with the Unity engine instead of porting the Flash version, they've re-balanced the difficulty of certain levels or challenges that used to be really difficult to complete without consumable power-ups.\n\nDon't be fooled by those complaining about the $10 price tag (or $7.50 currently, at launch). A free, outdated browser version or cheaper mobile app with microtransactions is not in anyway equivalent to the brand new PC version. You could play them as sort of a demo to try out the game and see if you like it, but then you should come back to Steam and buy the best and most complete version there is or will ever be. Ironhide Games has put a lot of work into making the game look good at high resolutions and of course the interface and controls have been updated to support the keyboard & mouse. New content updates are on the way (for free), and they're dedicated to quickly fixing bugs and refining features. I'm happy to support them for their efforts in bringing a great game to the greatest platform, and once you get a taste of this TD, I think you will be, too.","January 6, 2014","true","19.6"," 276 of 337 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","276","337","0","12"

No added features (that I can see from a quick look), the introduction level is exactly the same, the mechanics, everything.\n\nOn the plus side, it runs flawlessly, whereas Flash Games are notorious for frame skipping and overall stuttery performance - after all, Flash was originally more or less a platform for animated advertising, not gaming.\n\nBeing able to have the game run smoothly on fullscreen is very nice.\nStill, 9 Euros. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend it at this price.\n\nThe game itself is a total blast, even challenging, also I just love Tower Defense games, and this is one of the more interesting ones.\n\nSo, it's really up to you to dish out that kind of money for a game you can play for free off Steam.\n\nIn fact, I suggest playing it on Kongregate or any other site that hosts the original version - see it as a complete, windowed Demo, to determine if you are OK with the price.\n\nTL:DR\n9 Euros for a game you can play for free is a joke.\nHowever, the game is just that good, I would gladly pay 5 for the smoother, fullscreen gameplay you get with this Steam version.\nPlay the free version - if it grabs you, you may have found a very, very enjoyable Tower Defense game at "entry level", meaning the mechanics are quite simple to get in to, not too overwhelming for newbies to the genre, while at the same time challenging and interesting.\n\nTorn between my love for TD games, and Kingdom Rush specifically, and the fact that this is more or less the exact same version that is available anywhere for free, I still have to give "Thumbs Up".","November 23, 2014","true","2.9"," 100 of 115 people (87%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","87","100","115","5","4"

The game can get intense and by that I mean am spamming all over the place so I do not leak, my hand spasms and I leak only to start swearing and restart the map! I have even woken up at 4am in the morning to play this game and pick up where I left off.\n\nWhat I like the most about this game is how simple it is yet difficult. What do I mean by that? The basics of building but knowing the best spots and when to upgrade are key points. Position is also another key factor but what also keeps me hooked is the cute and detailed visuals of this game. I can't fully take this game serious when its this cute but neither do I want to continue on to the next map with only 2 stars lol\n\nI would recommend this game for the casual gamer who is looking to pass time. You might lose track of time but that just means you are having fun right? Catch this game on sale for half the price on some sites or just buy it off steam because either way its worth the $10 bucks.

There really isn't much to complain about here other than difficulty, but if you're asking me, it's a total plus. The main campaign maps are great and challenging and most people should be able to get through them, but the true test comes after you've completed them. The bonus content is phenomenal. There's more to winning than just sticking towers on the map. You must strategize, realize what types of enemies are coming from where and place your defenses accordingly - and sometimes, that isn't even enough.

I will add a TL;DR at the end.\n\nGameplay\nKingdom Rush has 26 levels (well 78 if you count Iron and Heroics level variations), 68 different enemy types, 4 different types of towers with 2 specializations each, and contains 12 different heroes that will be unlocked as the campaign is completed. As you select each level you can read the description telling you the story of Kingdom Kush.\n\nThis game requires you to be smart with tower and hero placement alike unless you wish to be overwhelmed by the waves of enemies. You get to choose between 3 different difficulty levels to casually play or make every single movement and purchase count. The heroes are very well varied along with the towers and their specializations. Most likely to get a feel for the game it would be encouraged to go and play the flash version (much more limited but will show you the general game mechanic).\n\nGraphics/Sounds\nPersonally I love the artstyle of the Kingdom Rush franchise and it was a major contributor to making me first try it when it was first released. The art throughout the game on everything is very well done.\n\nThe music is a bit adventurous, fitting with the game quite nicely. The sounds of towers when they upgrade specializations is a personal favourite with the little phrases heard.\n\nPros/Cons\nPros\n\n+ Beautiful Artstyle\n+ Very Strategical (later on)\n+ Tower variations, enemy variations, and hero variations\n+ Replayability\n\nCons\n\n- Weird glitch I found where when exiting you run into a screen with just KR banners everywhere\n- Hero reliance in certain areas (This is not for all people but for some being a problem)\n\nFinal Thoughts\nMy time on steam is a lie, for I have also beaten Kingdom Rush on mobile and flash and still enjoyed it massively with beating it on steam again. Definitely a game I would say has to be tried if you like tower defense games. A personal favourite and I can't wait for the next in the series to hit Steam!!\n\nTL;DR\nAn amazing game that should be at least tried by anybody who likes tower defense games. A good amount of quality content and an amazing artstyle cam easily make this recommendable. To make sure this game is for you there exists a much more limited version on Kongregate (flash version) which can be used to grasp the general direction of the game before you decide if you would like the full and luscious package.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","May 31","true","31.0"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","17","18","0","1"

There is a nice variety of tower upgrades and the enemies change up often enough to keep things interesting.  Maps, tower placement, varied paths, rally points, and the characteristics special to different types of towers and units give the player the opportunity to outwit the enemy with tactics rather than just by overwhelming enemies with sheer power.\n\nUnlike the mobile versions, the Steam port has no microtransactions. All the heroes and upgrades are unlocked as you progress through the campaign. It also looks like the developer releases new content and campaigns here every few months, which in addition to the multiple challenge modes on each map gives a huge amount of gameplay. Also, finding the easter eggs is a lot of fun, and it's clear from those and the achievements that someone's got a sense of humor.\n\nThis game wasn't even on my radar before I saw half my friends list pick it up during the summer sale, and I'm so glad I jumped on the bandwagon and grabbed it too.\n\nNow if I could just walk around without humming the music in my head...FREEDOM!","June 29, 2014","true","11.0"," 23 of 31 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","23","31","0","4"

Be it games that follow the classic "watch your towers destroy a ton of enemies"-formula, like the Defense Grid series or Super Sanctum TD, while others tried to get the player more involved, like Orcs Must Die and it's Tower Defense/Third Person Shooter Hybrid gameplay or the Sanctum series that mixed TD with First Person Shooter and an emphasis on Coop.\nKingdom Rush is your classic Tower Defense game, where you watch the landscape from above, place your towers, upgrade them and hopefully put them on spots so all the evil monsters don't reach the Exit.\n\nThe game is set in a Fantasy Kingdom (so expect anything from Spiders to Gnomes to Ogres and Knights) as enemies) that is presented in a cute, comic art style and features a lot of humor with tons of references to movies like Army of Darkness (the mages in their tower quote „Klaatu Barada Nikto“) and during fights there are little text bubbles with words like "Pow", basically taken straight from 1966 Batman series. It's charming and thankfully not overdone.\n\nOn your journey, that leads you through forest areas and snow landscapes, you get coins by beating the missions which you can invest to upgrade the Towers, the Knights and your Spells. Unlike other games in the genre, Kingdom Rush is a bit limited in it's towers. You only get 4: The Archer Tower, the Barracks, the Magic Tower and the Artillery but it's enough and you can not only upgrade those up to Level 3 but also turn them into specialised towers. For example the Archer Tower can later on changed into a Musketeer Garrison or the Ranger Hideout, both of them have their advantages and disadvantages, so there is a learning curve in this game ot find out how the upgrades are and what works best in each mission.\nNext to that are the spells. These can be activated and then have a cooldown. One is the reinforcements which spawns 2 pretty weak fighters but the cooldown is short and the other is Rain of Fire which, after you selected the target area, sends down a couple meteors.\nAnd the last thing at your disposal for defense are the Heroes. You unlock them one by one by playing the Campaign and they are different in their type (like a Paladin, an Archer or Thor) and their abilities. You can send them around the map but they're best used right at the exit to kill any enemy that might gotten through your defense lines.\n\nThe game is fun and as expected, thanks to all the upgradable towers and the Heroes highly addicitive. The only criticism i can bring is the missing endless mode which is something that should be here since it's a standard game mode in Tower Defense and the music is a bit on the boring side, it's not bad but it doesn't stand out either.\n\nAll in all i just can highly recommend this game to every fan of the genre.","October 22, 2015","true","19.9"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

I don't say that because 'free is always better,'  no, I mean when the game was free it was engineered in subtle, but noticably different ways then this version for the PC.  I see all these glittering reviews, claiming this is the best TD evar.  Really?  Which version where these people playing?  The free version they've played to death, or the PC version that has a load of problems?\n\nI've played the free version ( the one that had locked premium content ) on PC, and it's the superior version.  Why?\n\nOne : Hero units.  The game needed to be rebalanced for the hero units, and they added mechanics that honestly, weren't needed.  The free version was engineered in a way that you -didn't need hero units to play the game -AND- win-  I could beat the game without a hero in the orgininal, now I need to.  Got some issues there, because the enemies are buffed up to make up for the heroes simply existing.\nNot only that, but the melee heroes are pointless.  Utterly, and completely, pointless.  If you didn't swap out to a ranged type hero when the flying units started showing up, then the exploding demon type enemies will have pointed out how useless they are.   And, on top of that, the ranged heroes have a plethora of abilities that are just synergize better with the towers : Abilities that slow, waylay, or simply stop an enemy for the towers to wittle down.\n\nTwo : Complete reliance on acing levels to have the necesary upgrades to succede later in the game.  Now, it's no big secret that beating level one means you can play level two.  Here, though, you -need- to ace level one, so that you can have the upgrades that will make the game 'easier' later on.  If you simply beat each level, say getting one or two stars a pop, the game is significantly ( and un-neccesarily ) more difficult later on.  Because that makes sense, right?   And in some cases, you need to do the challenges to get more stars to... you guessed it... have the neccesary upgrades to have a better chance of beating the game.  So what's the magic solution?  Repeatitive game play forcing the player to redo earlier missions over and over again in the hope of acing the level so that you get the upgrade points you -NEED- by the end of the game.\n\nThree : Problems with upgrades.  Specifically, if I try to do a challenge level, it takes upgrades away.  Towers cost full price, or don't have the buffs you spent so much time earning.  Why is that?  Isn't the challenge hard enough already?  'No hero.'  Okay, get that.  'No barracks, no hero.'  Okay... I'd... kind  of like to have the buffs I earned.  And honestly, I don't know if the upgrades even matter in the long run.  Do the top tier upgrades even function?  It'd be nice if there was an indicator that the top tier 'chance for double damage' arrow talent was working, an exclamation point over an enemies head if they take double damage would be nice.  'Spiked Armor?'  Does it even work?  I can't even tell!\n\nFour : What I'd like to call 'The Korean Problem.' Now, you all know the meme 'Koreans play video games better.'  This game falls prey to this, as a in the last third of the game ( and the bonus content ) are incredibly difficult, requiring precise tower placement, upgrade, and unit movement.  In fact, I have no clue how in the heck you beat the swamp level.  The boss wave is ludricrous!  How is swarming the lanes with enormous amounts of enemies supposed to be 'challenging?'  This just tells me there's -one- way to place and upgrade the towers in many of these levels.  -One-  How is that supposed to be 'fun?'    Any answer that revolves around 'look it up online'  means the game is an utter failure.  I've played far better TD's that offered challenging experiences -and- allowed for more freedom in tower placement.\n\nBottom line, this game isn't worth 10 dollars.  It isn't even worth 5 dollars.  I could play the game for free, and have far more fun, and not need the heroes or bonus content.  I feel ripped off.  And if you bought this game on Steam you've been ripped off too.\n\n\nOh.  And PS ~\n\nFor anyone that wants to leave a comment about the review, please spare me the subjective stand point of how much you loved the game.  Subjective means 'opinion' and everyone's got one.  Objective statements, on the other hand, are not opinionated in anyway.  If you want to leave a comment, then do so, but at least try to have a better leg to stand on then 'oh, poor you, you couldn't beat it?  you must have been stupid'  Because that's a great way to start a conversation right?","January 16, 2014","false","14.9"," 198 of 349 people (57%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","57","198","349","7","15"

The grapihcs have a style all their own that seperates it from the rest, and the lines, voice acting, and personality give this game vast character to rival mainstream games. Gameplay is as sleek as it comes, due to 3 years in development before moving to steam through the greenlight program. I can and have spent hours before completing the whole game for every star and achievement, and I look forward to doing it again. I cannot fully describe the quality this game brings to the tower defence genere, but I can recommned that it must be at least tried on the online version at least before a full purchase, the full game comes through steam of course and has many more bonus levels that the online doesn't have, plus full hero capatibility and the tech/upgrade tree.

While the Protector series of tower defense games remains my favorite, Kingdom Rush is one of the highest quality games in the genre you can find. It remains a classic of the genre much like GemCraft and even the Bloons series because more than anything else, it emphasizes fun and strategy.\n\nKingdom Rush is highly colorful and has dashes of humor, and is an absolute joy to play. You will make your way through a light-hearted campaign, collecting stars from levels (awarded based on how well you do in each level) to unlock upgrades. There are way more stars available to collect here than you will need, keeping frustration low if you cannot ace a particular level due to the fact that you can simply collect stars from other levels. Some levels are very easy or fairly simple, while others are a challenge and can have you repeating them using different strategies until you finally surpass them.\n\nTowers have multiple upgrade paths that add to the strategy of the map depending on the routes you choose. You can also bring heros along on the regular campaign missions out of your pick of twelve (unlockable through the campaign) that can move freely on the map and can move throughout the waves to where she/he is needed. After beating the campaign, you gain access to a few more maps that you can play. It also deserves mentioning that after beating each campaign level, you can try out two different modes of play on that level to earn additional stars (these modes are more challenging and have different rules).\n\nMy only complaint about the game is that it is so short. Depending on your skill level, difficulty level, and whether or not you are interested in the additional modes, you can beat the campaign in a number of hours (it took me a little less than ten). Because Kingdom Rush is currently $9.99 full price, I think this still makes it a good deal dollar-per-hour-of-gameplay wise, as I have not beaten all the levels with the additional modes selected. Completionists can expect to get dozens of hours out of the game, and the replay value here is sky high. After beating the game, it remains fun and diverse enough to warrant additional playthroughs down the line. Unfortunately, Kingdom Rush is just so fantastic and fun, that regardless of how much content it offered, it may never have felt like "enough." I suppose that's a good problem to have.\n\nFor tower defense fans like myself who don't agree that tower defense is overdone and will play any game in the genre, this game is one of the best. For those who aren't normally fans of the genre, this is one of the few that you will most likely enjoy. Kingdom Rush is one of the pinnacles of the tower defense genre and I would recommend it to all fans of casual strategy games.","April 5","true","16.5"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","11","11","0","4"

I have already finished the game at 100%, 43hrs of fun, totally worth full price: 9.5/10 ¡Awesome!\n\nIn KR you'll manage only 4 type of towers, but these towers have very good upgrades, so you'll have to decide which upgrade is better for your situation in-game, by the way, you can sell the towers but you get a penalty receiving less money. Here a little explanation of the towers without upgrades just with his regular properties:\n\nMagic tower: slow shooter, mid damage, some enemies can have magic armor; However those enemies would be weak against other towers due they don't have regular armor.\n\nArches tower: really fast shooter, low damage, a bad option if your enemies has regular armor.\n\nExplosives tower: slow shooter, massive-group damage, enemies who has regular armor present more resistence.\n\nSoldiers tower: this tower works like a wall due his purpose is to hold enemies in middle of the tower's fire. The tower will bring 3 soldiers to the ground to fight hand-to-hand against the opponents.\nAlso you'll have the opportunity to select a hero (my favorite is Thor), the hero can run around all the map, he is very important to give a better resistence against stronger enemies or bosses. At the beginning of the map the hero is level 1, so, you need to put him in fight to level up (max level 10), each level he will earn more health, damage and special movements/attacks. I would resume 3 types of heros:\n\nShooter hero, great for long distance but very weak against face-to-face fights.\n\nSome heros can only fight hand-to-hand, these ones are my favorites because it works like a wall vs big guys.\n\nThere is some balanced heros that can shoot and have a decent resistence in ground fight.\nTo complete, you are not going to be just like an observer waiting for money to get towers upgrades and moving your hero, also as player you will have 2 attacks; in the first one you can put 2 extra soldiers in the ground perfect to fight and to slow down enemies in middle of tower's fire, get reset very fast every certain time. The second is a meteorite attack that works like bombs, really slow to reset however perfect for emergencies.\n\nThe first levels are kind easy for the obvious reason to you have to learn how does work and you need to upgrade your properties step by step.  But after that, especially the extra levels of the main campaing are amazing, very challenging. With that said you'll not only have extra levels, also you will get two extra challenges in every single map including the extra levels. So, be prepare to reset some maps or challenges like 5-10 times.\n\nThe enemies? Don't worry about it, you'll face like 70 (maybe more?) different types of enemies.\n\nRegularly I don't like games with cartoon graphics-animations, but I decided to give it a try because it was already in my steam library, honestly I do not remember how I got this videogame but I think it was some of those $1 purchase just for the steam trading cards. I'm here to say if you don't like this kind of graphics, you should forget that and just give it a try. I'm a tower defense lover and this little videogame it's really really cool and easily worth the full price. 43hrs of fun.\n\nThe only down side in my opinion, and that's why I gave 9.5/10 rate and no 10/10, is that you have to put the towers in pre-designed locations. I would like to resolve for myself the extra little puzzle of find the best locations.\n\n9.5/10. ¡Awesome!","May 19","true","43.8"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

You can go through the game again or a particular level again with all of your upgrades in tow so while it maybe consider cheating in some small aspect, honestly it will make the level less frustrating and more fun to enjoy.\n\n\nRecommend!","February 21, 2015","true","13.5"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","10","10","0","0"

On first sight, I wasn't sure I liked the tiny sprites, but I soon started to love them. A lot of screen-space is given over to inert scenery, which seems wasteful, but I think it is down to the origins of the game on mobile phones and tablets. You need plenty of space when you're poking your finger at a tiny screen. I can vouch for this, having now played 'Kingdom Rush: Frontiers' on my phone. Fortunately, there is no 'pay to win' in the Steam version of Kingdom Rush.\n\nThe game is tongue-in-cheek fantasy, with all the cliches you'd expect. The hero characters include a mine-planting dwarf, an overweight king on a sedan chair who throws food and drink, an ice queen, and a gnome riding a pair of robotic legs with buzz-saw arms.\n\nJust because it looks cartoony, don't think this game is a push-over. Even on casual, beyond the first third of the game, the levels are quite challenging and require you to adopt an appropriate strategy. Your tower building exploits are enhanced by upgrades that you earn, which can be freely redistributed. You also get to choose which hero to use on each level, which can make the difference between a successful outcome and abject failure. Another key skill is calling in waves of enemies early, for which you are rewarded with a few coins towards your building costs and a reduced spell cool-down.\n\nOverall, this game is very good fun and full of humorous characters.

It has charming, cartoony graphics and the addictive gameplay we've come to know from games as Defense Grid and Pixeljunk Monsters. It isn't a big game, the main game exists of 'only' 12 levels, but there are several bonus levels to be unlocked for those that can't get enough of it. These bonus levels are actually quite tough, let me tell you. I had to retry them multiple times and still wasn't able to finish any of them.\n\nAnyway, there are also heroes to be unlocked and, thankfully, these are all very different from each other. Switching between them makes the levels less repetitive and makes them more fresh, even though nothing has changed. The hero can make the difference between victory and defeat and is a must if you want to finish the levels without making any mistake.\n\nOf course, using your buildings wisely and upgrading them as you go is just as important. The tower upgrades are done in a fun and exciting way; upgrading eventually allows you to make a choice between one of two towers. So, for example, an artillery tower can be upgraded to a tesla tower or a missile tower. After that you can start upgrading the skills of these towers, so you can upgrade it to have a bigger blast radius, things like that. Very well done.\n\nKingdom Rush wouldn't be a proper tower defense game if it didn't have boss fights and luckily for us, there are several bosses to be slain during the game. They're usually slow enough to kill them before they enter the base, except for maybe the last boss, which I won't spoil here.\n\nAdditionally, the game has a few fun easter eggs/achievements that can be found by clicking on random things like a fish in the sea. It has no use or anything, but it's cute nevertheless.\n\nI think I've told you pretty much everything there is to tell about Kingdom Rush by now. Kingdom Rush is a brilliant game that needs all of our support. Like, right now. Go get it !\n\n[Rating: 87/100]","January 19, 2014","true","11.2"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","2"

Well let's start by saying Kingdom Rush is genuinely one of the most addictive, fun and somewhat challenging Tower defense games around. At first glance the cartoony visuals, vibrant music and set place building positions give off a casual vibe.  Whilst the original campaign is not all that challenging and seems more like a warm up! The real test comes in the excellent after campaign missions. As well as expanding on the universe and adding some back story the after campaign missions provide new enemies, boss fights and new level layouts. These new missions provide a lot more challengethan the standard campaign and thats where the game really starts to shine. Careless tower placement can cause even the most expensive set up to fail which will see the hordes of enemies running right through you.\n\nIn short Kingdsom Rush provides an excellent alernative to the likes of Pixeljunk Monsters. It may not be the deepest Tower Defense game on the market but in terms of addictveness it's hard not to place this game near the top.","July 2, 2014","true","55.8"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

Difficulty level can be adjusted\n\nThe Bad:\n- Very short campaign, I'd personally prefer a longer campaign and fewer side missions\n- No real tactical control over towers compared to Defender's Quest\n- Cannot view enemy/tower documentation while playing\n\nKingdom Rush is a tablet ported tower defense game set in a medieval high fantasy world. Like most tower defense games you are given a puzzle-like map stage and have to build towers along the enemy's predefined path in an attempt to obstruct said enemy as they pass through.\n\nOverall it's a good looking game with a fair sense of progression; as you play stages you are awarded stars which allow you to unlock new perks which upgrade the performance of just about every aspect of your defenses. Kingdoms Rush also allows you to pick from a pool of heroes, each with different statics and abilities to utilize in each stage. Some stages will necessitate a ranged hero, in others a melee hero is optimal. Who you choose for what stage can impact the overall difficulty of the level.\n\nIn my opinion all these variables add to the overall strategy of the game but I feel that additional depth is needed. The game lacks a certain finesse that I've seen in other tower defense games; notably the ability to tell each tower which type of enemy units to target. Maybe I want my mage to target only the strongest enemies and leave the weak units for my archers. Maybe I want my soldiers to spread out so as to block as much of the path as possible instead of all ganging up on one enemy while all the other enemies walk on by just as happy as you please. Maybe I'd like my artillery to target the enemy units nearest their spawn point for better collateral damage instead of always targeting that one loner way up front. Well in Kingdom Rush you can't, you are left at the mercy of the AI which has caused me to restart stages more often than I'd like to admit.\n\nThe campaign story is no Shakespeare but it gets the job done.... until it ends when you are 33% done with the game. Heck, I figured I must have at least another half dozen or more stages to go yet when the credits started rolling. Apparently the remainder 66% of the game tasks you with individual stages which are hard (in contrast to the campaign stages).\n\nFor some perspective: it took me one try on all but the final stage of the campaign to get through those stages with at least one star. Stages following the campaign require repeated playthroughs just to get that one star and often stages are large enough to last a good half hour. It's a very time consuming trial and error process during which your interest in the game continually ebbs due to a lack of passive progression even through failure.\n\nAnother facet I bemoaned is the lack of accessible documentation while in-game. When on the campaign map you can access a bevy of useful information about different enemies/towers in the game and what their stats are but it's only accessible from the campaign map, nowhere else, especially not during a stage when such information can really come in handy.\n\nOverall I enjoyed this game - polished graphics and linear story are just long enough for you to grab your Steam trading cards and scram. Some players may appreciate the brutal challenge later levels present but there are those of us who play causally and I, for one, am delighted the devs added a difficulty setting post release.","June 7, 2014","true","9.4"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","1"

Fieldrunners? Sanctum? Yup.) that is essentually a brutal, strategic behemoth of a game wrapped in a pretty package, so don't be fooled by its cartoony visuals and somewhat "kiddy" approach to fantasy. Much like Reus, it may look fairly simple at first, but gradually increases in complexity as you progress, making you pull at your hair in frustration as you suffer a loss, all thanks to that one teeny mistake where you conjure a fire rain on the wrong goblin and everything goes to hell from there. Wow, the irony.\n\nIf you're still not sure what exactly you're paying for, try it out for free here[armorgames.com] (I played the bejeezus out of it on armorgames.com). The reason why it's priced at 7 bucks here is due to the fact that the game was originally littered with microtransactions, but here you get everything already unlocked in a single package, including extra features, heroes, campaigns and what have you, all at glorious 1080p. Also pretty, pretty artwork, which is always a big plus.\n\nAll in all, an excellent boredom buster and a great addition to your TD collection, if you're a commited Tower Defense nut like me.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/guudjah/recommended/246420/","guudjah","Arth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/guudjah/","193 products in account","Like many others of its kind, Kingdom Rush is a td to its very core. There are not many tricks or gimmicks presented throughout the game, beyond building your towers, seeing how your solution pans out and readjusting said plan. The games progression comes in several forms. There are passive skills, tower unlocks, hero unlocks, new enemies, new armour types and more lanes. Pretty standard fare overall. At its bare bones, this game is both functional and enjoyable.  Though it comes with flaws. I should preface this by saying that this game is a td, balance and design are key to an enjoyable experience for the player.\n\nAs you progress through the game, you'll get a new tower type or hero that will assist you on the current map, and will carry over to the next. With a level that is designed to be tackled with a specific tower or hero, this can conflict with the out of level passive trees. Each tree has a power curve that can potentially ruin or improve your experience. If you don't know what the level is you're facing, you can enter with entirely the wrong tree for the task at hand. If the game presented on the level selection screen information as to what the player both unlocks and will face, there would be no arbitrary difficulty added.\n\nThe passive tree's are not made equal. Some tree's add exhorbitantly more damage than others in all situations. The militia tree is particularly strong compared to its counterparts and comes with no real flaws or weaknesses. Without this tree being at max level the game can feel a little harder than it needs to be, increasing to downright impossible on some levels.\n\nTowers as well have balancing and design problems. Some towers are just functionally better than others for all situations once unlocked. One comparison in particular is the difference between barbarians and paladins. Barbarians are meant to deal large amounts of damage in return for being very easy to kill. Instead their paladin counterparts take twice as much damage, deal more damage as a result and have a reliable AoE. The ranger tower for example does more damage per second in an area of effect than its counterpart the musket tower which albeit has a different design path. Intended to assassinate larger targets, instead it will frequently shoot fodder instead.\n\nBeing unable to control towers, to make them do what you intended them to do can be frustrating as well. Far too often the ranger tower will apply its poison on the same unit multiple times before switching, or paladins will completely ignore enemies a few feet away. This leads to an unnecessary frustrating experience as the game requires more precision and planning in later stages.\n\nHeros as well are not cut from the same cloth. Some heros skills are just not helpful. Why would you wish to lock one enemy down for an extended period when you can cc several at a time or outright assassinate one or more enemies. The majority of heros are just plain weaker compared to the exceptional few who excel at the roles provided for them.\n\nWhile these problems exist the game is still fun once you find what works. The game really kicks off when you beat the main campaign that presents a challenge and requires creative thinking.\n\nBosses are always a very tough and tense experience. There is a real threat of losing the level, as they all have mechanics that you will have to account for on the fly. Bosses never seem unfair as well. Tough but enjoyable all around. Enemies are in the same vein as well. They interact with each other and your mazes in enjoyable and challenging ways.\n\nWhile there are flaws to the game that detract to your ability to control, or experiment within it I would still recommend this game. There are not only few td's, but even fewer are done as well. I enjoyed myself throughout, I suggest taking a relaxed or mellow stance while playing this game.","March 12, 2014","true","14.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The pixel graphics in fantasy style is consistently well drawn and uses Middle Earth-like maps up to optics in WarCraft style, the usual genre clichés.\n\nYou are told to hold all sorts of fantasy scum from reaching a certain point. The bad guys are coming in waves and groping along predefined paths. You provide them with classic towers in four variants like infantry, archers, mages and artillery. The building sites are also predefined, sometimes they are distributed quite sparse on the level. For destroying enemies the cash register is ringing, the money will naturally be put back into new buildings or upgrades.\n\nThat sounds not very exciting at first. And truely it is not, especially for TD-veterans. The gameplay is well known, but by the initially very low difficulty the excitement kept within narrow limits. But before you can turn away bored, Kingdom Rush puts on continuously. The developers have a whole bunch of little details that incorporate fresh ideas and additional game elements. It just exudes tons of charm, impresses with lots of funny ideas and loving details. In the second half it becomes  quite a hard nut to crack, so it will become interesting for TD-veterans, too.\n\n","June 27, 2014","true","46.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Easy to learn, fun to play, goofy little animations, and lots of humor -- the dwarves that man the Tesla generators are especially hilarious ("Toasty!").  Towers are upgradable with lots of cool options.  The only thing that's weird about this game is its difficulty curve.  There are three difficulty settings: casual, normal, and hard.  I played the entire campaign on normal and got 3 stars on most of the missions without too much difficulty.  However, once you beat the normal campaign it unlocks a bunch of bonus missions...and this is where the difficulty suddenly ramps up.  I couldn't beat most of these on "normal".  On "casual" some of them are still insanely hard, while others are totally managable.  Other than that, it's a great game.  It only cost me a few bucks and it's given me 19 hours of fun already.

If you're unsure about paying $10 ($9.99) for a game, try it free online in a web browser.  The money you spend on steam gives you access to a much better engine (rather than playing on flash).  The game runs smoother.  In addition, you have access to heroes and Ironhide Game Studio (the publisher/developer) has reported the expansion content will come at no additional costs once completed.\n\nAs others have said, I first played this game on a tablet.  I'm not a fan of microtransactions.  It upset me to see awesome content (like heroes) which I had to pay to use.  This has all been fixed in the steam version.  People might argue well what's the difference between micro transactions and buying a game?  Either way you are still paying money.  The difference is one group of people doesn't have an advantage over others (granted not an issue in a single player game) and I know how much I'm paying up front.  Microtransactions can add up real quick and before you know it, you've spent more than the $10 it costs to buy the game on steam.

Also they even change the level art, so that it's clear that the battle is happening after your previous battle on the level, which is nice.\n\nAs for negative comments\n-I feel the tesla tower is a bit disproportionally powerful, leading to less freedom in tower selection than seems appropriate (I doubt there's any level that couldnt be beaten simply by focussing on tesla towers (money allowing) - this is not true of other towers)\n-There's a bug with the credit scroll speed once you've beated the first part of the game.","January 11, 2014","true","33.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Heroic and iron levels are nice addition, but too much hard early.\n\nDLC missions are terrible because they are not any more classic TD levels - you have to micromanage your hero too much and use meteors as much as you can.

It is an extremely unique and fun TD game, easy to understand and play, and got me hooked for the entire day (on the flash version), wanting to complete it. So I bought it immediately once I noticed it is now on Steam :)\n\nImprovements from the flash version:\n-More variety of musics\n-Full Screen\n-More levels\n\nCons:\n-Could really do with tooltips. People who never played the flash version probably need to click the buttons to find out what they do\n-Rally points / hero controlling are still left clicks. This is no longer a flash game, it is a full game by itself now, and so they should become right clicks, to make things easier\n-No hotkey for sending next wave\n-You can't view the encyclopedia while you're playing. Isn't that when you need it most?\n-The tower AI isn't that smart. For example, it likes to cast Death Ray (one-hit KO skill with a long cooldown) on a small mob instead of a miniboss who is wrecking havoc\n\nRating: 9.5/10","January 6, 2014","true","33.3"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

It's really intuitive and easy to learn but hard to master.\n\nWith a mix of towers, upgrades, skills and a hero you face hoards of enemies trying too take down the kingdom you need to protect. After finishing the campaign a few extra levels become available to test out your skills and encounter new enemies. You can also try to replay stages with restrictions to gain extra stars and you use for upgrading skills.\n\nI really love the game because of the art style.

The graphics are simple yet beautiful and the music is top-notch. The voices are cliche in the very best of ways, filling the game with referential humor. (If you didn't at least smile the first time you heard the dwarves shout "Yippi-Ki-Yay", check your pulse because you are probably dead.)\n\nI can not wait wait for more content from Ironhide.\n\nOne downside though; since getting this on Steam, I no longer enjoy the phone versions as much- I would much rather play on the pc than the phone. (Hint, hint - Not so subtle way of begging Ironhide for a Frontiers release on Steam.)\n\nTo the TD initiate, KR may seem very difficult on certain stages. Just remember there is a huge component of strategy involved and some stages may take a few playthroughs to figure out the optimal placement of towers and heroes.","February 16, 2014","true","69.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ravenize/recommended/246420/","ravenize","Ravenize > *","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ravenize/","338 products in account","Kingdom Rush is an unexpected gem for me. As a port of a mobile tower defense game I didn't have high hopes, but it exceeded my expectations. The sound and graphics are smooth and appropriate and work well together.\n\nThere really isn't that much new or original here. They didn't really rock the genre. But it is extremely well-executed. And there's even a bit of story thrown in if you're willing to read the descriptions of each level, which shows some extra thought and care that went in to constructing the game world.\n\nThat said it's not without problems. The first is just that there are some glitches that pop up. Most are related to achievements (perhaps because they didn't exist in the mobile version?) but there are a few game breaking ones. At one point enemies just stopped coming for me. I walked away and came back a few minutes later and they still weren't there. The game wasn't frozen - I could still interact with it, the enemies just never came, and therefore I had no choice but to restart the entire level.\n\nAnd the game sorely needs a fast-forward or speed up button. If you're doing really well and planned things out then enemies can seem aganozingly slow and waiting for them becomes annoying. As this sort of feature is pretty standard within the genre I'm honestly surprised that it's nowhere to be found in Kingdom Rush.\n\nAlso the difficulty in some of the DLC levels is simply far too high. Most of the normal levels felt challenging while fair, but a couple of the last DLC levels got very frustrating and made me feel stuck. It's never a good feeling to work for a long time on a level and have no progress to show for it.\n\nThe RPG elements and some of the quirky towers and sound bites are definitely pluses. Along with the different hero choices and large replayability offered by needing to complete levels multiple times, I'd definitely recommend it if you like a simple version of a polished tower defense game.","March 10, 2015","true","29.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The core experience is familiar – waves of enemies follow a pre-set path, and must be taken out by towers players purchase and place.\n\nThe twist is that players can place "Barracks" towers that send footmen onto the field that will battle and slow down enemy creeps. By placing enemy-blocking barracks next to high-powered towers, players can turn the tide in their favor.\n\nAlthough Kingdom Rush only contains four base tower types, each can be upgraded down two separate paths, and can then be customized even further with special abilities. This gives players a surprising amount of versatility, and pays off for those that plan ahead. For example, the mage tower upgrades into the armor-weakening Sorcerer or the enemy-teleporting Arcane. The former is useful at the beginning of the enemy's path, the latter at the very end.\n\nKingdom Rush is one of the best tower defense experiences I've had. Each stage is perfectly balanced to present a very stiff challenge while never feeling unfair. Packs of smaller enemies slip by you? Use more artillery. Flying enemies trip you up? Next time try more archers. It's a game that teaches you how to win, one level at a time\n\nIt certainly helps that the entire thing looks and sounds fantastic. The detailed and stylish cartoony visuals set a distinct "fantasy-comedy" tone, reinforced by the game's sparse but spot-on voice acting. Every tower spouts one-liners when upgraded, leading to plenty of opportunities for sly pop-culture references.\n\nKingdom Rush is an instant classic and is guaranteed to turn up on “best of” lists. Anyone remotely interested in either tower defense or strategy should consider it a most-own. Gamers that think they don’t enjoy the genre should give Kingdom Rush a shot anyway – it might just win you over.","January 13, 2014","true","13.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As a port of a mobile tower defense game I didn't have high hopes, but it exceeded my expectations. The sound and graphics are smooth and appropriate and work well together.\n\nThere really isn't that much new or original here. They didn't really rock the genre. But it is extremely well-executed. And there's even a bit of story thrown in if you're willing to read the descriptions of each level, which shows some extra thought and care that went in to constructing the game world.\n\nThat said it's not without problems. The first is just that there are some glitches that pop up. Most are related to achievements (perhaps because they didn't exist in the mobile version?) but there are a few game breaking ones. At one point enemies just stopped coming for me. I walked away and came back a few minutes later and they still weren't there. The game wasn't frozen - I could still interact with it, the enemies just never came, and therefore I had no choice but to restart the entire level.\n\nAnd the game sorely needs a fast-forward or speed up button. If you're doing really well and planned things out then enemies can seem aganozingly slow and waiting for them becomes annoying. As this sort of feature is pretty standard within the genre I'm honestly surprised that it's nowhere to be found in Kingdom Rush.\n\nAlso the difficulty in some of the DLC levels is simply far too high. Most of the normal levels felt challenging while fair, but a couple of the last DLC levels got very frustrating and made me feel stuck. It's never a good feeling to work for a long time on a level and have no progress to show for it.\n\nThe RPG elements and some of the quirky towers and sound bites are definitely pluses. Along with the different hero choices and large replayability offered by needing to complete levels multiple times, I'd definitely recommend it if you like a simple version of a polished tower defense game.","March 10, 2015","true","29.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The graphics are simple yet beautiful and the music is top-notch. The voices are cliche in the very best of ways, filling the game with referential humor. (If you didn't at least smile the first time you heard the dwarves shout "Yippi-Ki-Yay", check your pulse because you are probably dead.)\n\nI can not wait wait for more content from Ironhide.\n\nOne downside though; since getting this on Steam, I no longer enjoy the phone versions as much- I would much rather play on the pc than the phone. (Hint, hint - Not so subtle way of begging Ironhide for a Frontiers release on Steam.)\n\nTo the TD initiate, KR may seem very difficult on certain stages. Just remember there is a huge component of strategy involved and some stages may take a few playthroughs to figure out the optimal placement of towers and heroes.","February 16, 2014","true","69.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game is tough as nails, but it's so rewarding once you get it down.\n\nThis game is also available as a mobile app, and I would certainly recommend that version of the game over this one. The mobile app received more love from the developers, and has two extra DLC sets -- Frontiers and Origins. They load the game up with a few new tower upgrades, interesting new levels, new enemies, and new heroes. The desktop version of this game, for some reason, never got these updates and is vastly behind in the amount of content. It's unlikely that they'll add it. The biggest benefit to the desktop version of this game is that you don't need to pay for heroes, whereas the mobile apps have a pretty strong paywall on some of the heroes they offer.\n\nThat being said, I still enjoy the desktop version of this game very much. It's nice to play it with a mouse and a large screen, which makes your reaction times faster and doesn't have you hunched over your phone/tablet.\n\nGreat game!

It is highly addictive, cannot stop playing. There are 26 levels, 3 difficulty settings, 4 basic towers with many upgrades, some special towers. You can choose one hero to help you on battlefield. Heroes are different in look and ability. Game looks and feels great. You need very short time to learn how to play. Basically you deploy your towers and keep enemy to reach your end line. One tower spawns soldiers so that is a nice touch also. Battlegrounds are nice, enemies come in large variety. For your effort you get 1,2 or 3 stars and then buy upgrades. No downside to this game, highly recommended.\n\nEdit: I just beat the game on casual setting. It took me 50 hours of gameplay to earn all 130 stars (5 on 26 levels).

Everything about it is done in an inoffensive, pleasant way. It may not be the most groundbreaking or genre-bending tower defense game. It doesn't have a lot of depth and there's not a gruelling amount of difficulty, although some stages can still be quite challening requiring multiple strategies until you find the right one. Cartoonish visuals are complemented by its clean presentation. The achievements and unlockables keep the game fresh for far longer than I expected.

They have limited strategic depth and they feel like you're doing the same thing over and over. Yet, Kingdom Rush offers a lot more than that. With 8 different towers, some of which are completely new to the genre, heroes, interesting bosses, challenging levels, all make you play a tower defense game for 30+ hours. You can't find anyone on the internet that can say Kingdom Rush is not fun.\n\nHowever this is an expanded version of a game that was already available on Armor games (flash), IOS and Android.\n\nThe flash version is basicly free with some content unlockable with money (and some not existing), and mobile versions are $0.66, again with content unlockable content with money (but all the content exists in this version).\n\nI wrote this before on the forums, I can paste here as well. Here are the differences of the Steam version from flash and mobile versions:\n\n* The graphics (map and battle) are enhanced compared to other versions. There are a few minor control additions.\n* There are no micro transaction in the steam version. Meaning, there's nothing you can buy in-game even if you want to.\n* Not all content is unlocked from day 1. You unlock everything by playing through.There's no other way in the steam version.\n* In the Steam version, there are stuff that are not present on the Armor games version. The same stuff is present on the mobile version but is subject to extra money - which sums up to way higher than $10. So if you want to play with stuff (some heroes and some extra levels) not present, mobile or flash versions will be cheaper for you. If you want all the stuff in, Steam version will be cheaper for you.\n* In the Steam version, when you finish the 12 level main campaign, you unlock 2 x 2 level mini-campaigns + 3 other solo levels. Most of these levels contan unique bosses.\n* Buyers of the Steam version are also promised one more 2 level mini campaign, another solo level, a new full campaign with unknown number of new levels, new towers, 3 new heroes for FREE. These are labeled as coming soon.\n* Kingdom Rush Frontiers is not included in the Steam version, neither is promised for free. It will probably be either a paid expansion or a standalone game if it ever gets released on Steam.","January 11, 2014","true","40.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

If you have not and you are looking at Kingdom Rush as your first foray in to the tower defense genre, you should buy this game and I will give a short, very basic run down of tower defense games for newcomers. Essentially, TD games boil down to this; build towers (your defenses) to stop the increasingly difficult waves of enemies reaching your base. You will start each level with a set amount of lives and 1 live is equal to 1 enemy making it through all of your defenses and reaching your base.  In Kingdom Rush you are able to build a variety of different towers from archer towers, wizard towers, cannon's and a barracks.  All of these towers can be upgraded, for example a Wizard Tower can be upgraded to have spells which teleport enemies further back down the path to give you some more time to deal damage.\n\nThe art style is great and it compliments the game very well, In my opinion.\n\nThe audio is nice and at times it can be pretty funny.  Hearing your soldiers from the Barracks yelling "Freedom!" or your Wizard Tower shouting "Might and Magic!" adds something to the game.\n\nAll of the content is unlocked within this one purchase and there is no microtransactions to be seen here.  All heroes are unlocked by simply playing through the campaign.\n\nOn the main game screen, a new area with new levels will be added in eventually.  However, this has apparently been there for months and no update has appeared as of yet.\n\nThis game is easy to learn but it can be extremely difficult to master.  The difficulty can ramp up fairly quickly, so make sure to pay attention to what the earlier levels teach you about your towers.\n\nI highly recommend this game, one of the best TD games there is.","July 3, 2014","true","22.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It doesn't have enormous replay value but there are 20+ maps, each with three playmodes and three difficulty settings. Story is your standard fantasy fare but delivered successfully with tongue-in-cheek humor. Pop culture references work most of the time and add to the cheerful atmosphere.\n\nWhile simple at its core, the gameplay does have some depth to it with four different basic tower types that can be upgraded multiple times with a branching upgrade path and unlockable special abilities. As you progress through the main story you get your hands on more and more heroes. Only one is active per level which let me to replay some of the easier maps just to get a feel for the different heroes and their skills.\n\nOverall a very enjoyable gaming experience.","November 3, 2015","true","26.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You control a hero that can level up during missions. You have talent trees to boost different towers and abilities with free re-specs. The towers are unique in that they can upgrade to different paths and you can choose which tower abilities to upgrade. The difficulty is definitely hard as you go through, but very much satisfying once beat a level. Well done incentive system to play the challenges in order to unlock stars, the currency for the talent trees. I really wish the sequel Frontiers will come to Steam soon.

It looks like something cooked up by Dan Paladin from The Behemoth, the genius' behind games such as Alien Hominid, Castle Crashers and Battle Block Theater. If Dan didn't  have anything to do with the art for this game, then he should be getting some royalties.\n\nGreat game, easy enough campaign with some added challenge modes to each map to cater to the hard core TD players. It's really not just your average TD, it has soul.\n\nIt's a lot of fun watching things happen in this game where as most TD games are boring but the variety of animation is astouding... There's lots of things happening and lots of tricks the enemy units can pull on you, sometimes there's more to them than meets the eye... like transformers, except not as Robosexual.\n\nIt has some MOBA / Warcraft III elements in it with the way hero's work, they're essentially on auto mode but you can move them around the map like a mobile tower. They all have strengths and weaknesses and some are better for certain maps than others so it's fun to experiment.\n\nThe meat and potato's comes with the variety of tower structures. There are only four towers in the game but they can evolve in to two different types each, for a total of 8 towers all with very different abilities that are fun to synergize together.\n\nThe music is great, the campaign is a decent size and will keep you busy for a while... there are also extra missions and hero's that unlock after the campaign is over so the fun doesn't stop there.\n\nIt was a great buy for 7.50.\n\nI hear a lot of people complaining the game can be played for free on kongregate or purchased for a dollar on android devices but the game is a lot more polished on steam, I compared them myself. You can't really complain when the original game had microtransactions and if you wanted all the extra content it would cost you over 10 dollars.\n\nOn steam all the content is unlocked through progression... although there looks to be an expansion pack in the works as it's clearly stated on the level selection screen that some new area is "coming soon".","January 8, 2014","true","27.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","3","5","2","0"

Now for the negatives. If anyone else can think of more negatives I will add them, as issues are resolved I will take them off the listing.\n\n1) The game does not have a send next wave hotkey yet, this is quite annoying especially when you are trying to get those few extra seconds to cooldown your meteor strike.\n2) Game still does not have cooldown timers for reinforcements and meteor strike within a seconds counter, you have to guess at how much longer.\n3) Heroes do not gain and keep levels (some may like them loosing it every time I do not)\n4) Their is no way that I know of to preview the skills of the heroes before taking them into battle, I should be able to see how much actual life, dmg, shielding, and such that they have instead of once again having to guess.\n5) Some heroes are still subpar (mainly the melee heroes) they need some love.\n6) You can not access achievements, encyclopedia during battle, I personally don't remember all the weaknesses to the enemies.\n7) The vetern mode has been taken out of this version of the game, I know some people maybe happy about this, but if I have to replay a lvl I did once before I usually want to do it in vet mode for that last star I missed the time before.\n8) Encylopdia does not have the ability to roll over a skill for one of your towers and see what it does.\n9) Hugely limited on the button commands, I do have a keyboard and 2 mouse buttons please give more hotkeys and possibly a use for the right mouse button or at least make it so I can customize the controls, would be awesome if I could do everything with my mouse.\n10) No benefit from having bought the game on other devices, would be nice if the devs would have given us more of a discount for being loyal customers, many people have bought this game on multiple platforms. Least give us a bonus level or two or something with game launch.","January 7, 2014","true","32.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I began playing back when it was a simple flash game. When Ironhide expanded to the IOS platform the game became even more incredible. The strategy and fun cartoon graphics make this game very enjoyable. Ironhide is doing an amazing job at continuing to update and add levels to both Kingdom Rush and Frontiers. While the PC version is missing the item store, I am glad that all the heroes are free and there are no microtransactions required. I can't wait for the Curse of Blackbrun update and I know Ironhide will continue to update and tweak this game until it is perfect. My one complaint is that there is no Steam Cloud function, but hopefully that will change.\n\nThanks Ironhide!","January 8, 2014","true","63.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Easy to pick up on and learn. Build towers and command your hero and troops for added defense, which adds a new level of game play. Your upgrades aren't permament so you can change them out on different levels where you will need to use cannons or mage tower.\n\nThe only downside I have with this game, is that it randomly crashes, or bugs out. One time I killed the boss, but you have to click on him to finish him off. I did click, but he didn't die... his animation was stuck on "click boss".","January 7, 2014","true","11.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

A MUST HAVE for any tower defense geek.\n\nYes it can be played for free on Armor Games and other sites but the free version does not come with all content. You can play it there though to play like the 'demo version' of the game before you decide to buy it here.\n\nPositives:\n- Good graphics. They scaled or remade them properly!\n- Actually requires you to think about what towers you will be placing and where you place your defenders.\n- Hero's & bosses.\n- Upgrades (we all love upgrades through game-progress).\n- Allows you to start waves early.\n\nNegatives (at the time of writing, which is shortly after they released is on steam):\n- Lots of bugs including levels where the bosses get stuck or become unkillable. On some computers it doesn't even seem to be playable at all.\n- In my opinion the controls are horrible. As if they ported it on a really cheap budget. Especially regarding the 'mouse-focus' and bugs related to that.\n- No co-up.\n- Early levels can be a bit boring if you are an experienced gamer. There is no way to speed up the game (unless you have the speed-bug) other than starting waves early.","January 8, 2014","true","9.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Each towers and even its upgrades are essential to your road to victory. Game progresses with the challenge increasing in a balanced curve. The units and towers are clear cut and precise that you can instantly recognize them with great ease.\n\nThe only missing point from my rating is that the hero progress resets after each level.

For the price of $10, Kingdom Rush is possibly the best non-sale deal on Steam. The game is flawlessly fun and entertaining, and the content of the game is enough to pack probably 20 hours of solid enjoyment out of before you start to feel a bit bored. Mathematically speaking, thats about $0.50 per hour of active entertainment, a good deal by any measure. The game itself is good for closer to 40 hours from my estimate.\n\nOh, and the part that sells the game most for me: Absolutely amazing developers. No really, these guys are amazing. They update the game occassionally with free campaigns and other goodies to extend the games value.\n\nIn my book, that alone deserves support. Hats off to them.

This is a great Tower Defense style game that has all the usual elements you'd expect, such as upgradable "towers." Sure, there's only four different kinds, but they all serve the traditional TD roles, and you have some choices in how to upgrade them as well through the gold you earn in battle and the stars you earn from beating levels. The gameplay itself can be a bit difficult, especially as you progress to later levels, but it is never unfairly challenging in my opinion. The cartoony art style may or may not be likeable, depending on personal tastes, but the graphics are certainly done well. Plenty of content here for people to enjoy given the cost of the game.\n\nNow that we've established that the game is a good tower defense game, there's ultimately the question of which platform to buy it on. There's always the free version that (I think) is still available on Kongregate, but it is a simpler, older version of this game that most likely will not be updated anymore. There's also the iOS/Android(?) versions that cost $1.99/$3.99 or something around there for the base game. If you just want to just play the game, both of those versions are probably "good enough" versions for the casual gamer.\n\nHowever, this Steam version does have some goodies that, personally, made it a buy for me. There are the promised extra levels and heroes, which are coming soon, and that's certainly nice, especially since they won't be available on other platforms. All the heroes that cost money in the mobile versions are also available for "free" (well, you have to buy the game obviously) here, which saves quite a bit of money (buying all the heroes on iOS costs well over $20, for example). Even though the graphics are technically not any different, they do run at 60 fps, as long as you have a decent enough computer.\n\nWhat if you already own the mobile versions? Is this new version worth getting? Again, the promised extra content might be nice, though its obviously not completely clear how good it will be. I would personally suggest that you try the Kongregate version first or the iOS version when on sale so that you get an idea of how much you like the game. If you like those versions, I would suggest getting it on Steam, as it will eventually have new content that you might enjoy as long as you like the rest of the game.\n\nTo bring this long review to an end, Kingdom Rush is a fantastic game. The only decision you really have to make is which platform to get it for. If you are short on money or just want to dip your toes in casually, so to speak, the Kongregate and iOS versions offer a good enough experience for you. If however, you want the complete (eventually) experience or just want to support the developers, get the Steam version. Either way, play the game!","January 8, 2014","true","1.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Great, colorful graphics and animation, high polish!\n\nLets see about those towers! 4 towers, 3 upgrades each and 2 "Ultimate" upgrade choices for each tower. And every Ultimate tower has at least 2 abilities that you can purchase! To give an example: the Archer tower shoots rapidly at land or air targets and has a good range. Every upgrade increases range and damage and upon reaching Ultimate level you can choose to turn it into a Ranger tower or a Sharpshooter tower! The Ranger tower has Roots  that can AoE stun and damage many enemies around it and Poison Arrows that deal a potent DoT to whatever they hit. The Sharpshooter tower has the longest range in the game and gets Headshot that deals massive damage or outright 1-hit KOs an enemy and Shrapnel Blast that deals massive AoE damage.\n\nThats just the Archer tower! The other 3 tower types all have their upgrades and 2 Ultimate tower choices!\n\nNow, we also have to talk about the Barracks towers. Kingdom Rush was pretty much the pioneer of the barracks type towers in which actual squads of soldiers will come out of them and stand on the creep paths. These soldiers will then block/stop enemies from moving while they do battle! You can, in an area, choose where the squads will gather to protect certain parts of the path! The soldiers have their own hitpoints, damage and once upgarded to their Ultimate forms they can gain all sorts of special attacks and defensive abilities!\n\nThe enemies are also increadibly varied and Kingdrom Rush sports some of the most interesting enemy types out there. Seriously, they send a new type of enemy at you on almost EVERY single level. Every 5 or so levels you'll get a boss battle and ooooh boy some of them are pretty intense.\n\nYou also get special Heroes that you unlock as you progress through the campaign and they each have at least 2 special abilites. For example Alera Windrunner summons a tanky sabrecat and has a multishot ability that fires 4-5 arrows at groups of enemies. Heroes can level up to 10 in every battle and will do more damage and power up their abilites. You can freely move them about the battlefield to help out where its most needed!\n\nWhew, well, don't want to make this much longer so I'll just say that if you like TD games you really can't go wrong with Kingdom Rush unless you absolutely have to have tower mazing - of which their is none in Kingdom Rush. The Steam version comes with all DLC unlocked and will be strongly supported by the devs with new content and goodies!","January 7, 2014","true","22.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Played it almost to completion then. Kingdom Rush is the best tower defense game out there. It has beautiful graphics, nice music and sound effects, an intuitive UI and more than enough content to justify the pricetag. Many complain that the game is available for free as a flash game on certain websites. This version has alot more content than the free version and buying here supports the developers that deserve your money. My only complaint is that two more have released and they havent found their way on to Steam. Hey Ironhide, show us some love too. If you are worried that the game just doesnt have enough depth to hold your attention very long, consider this. There are loads of levels, lots of unlockable heroes, a skill tree with tons of skills and more. The game was also updated recently with more heroes and another campaign. There really is no negative I can level against this game.

It will take you multiple hours for you to finish and some hard time progressing at higher diff which is worth it.

It was a fantasy tower defence game and it started out as a Flash game and later on it camed to app and to Steam. Steam is a little bit better than Flash because it had more levels and towers were fixed. The game had memorable enemies, memorable towers, good Music, allot of refences (like Bombardiers said Hail To The King Baby) and also had Landskapes that fit well with fantasy. The Villian Vez´nan is a stereotypical villian but i still loved him, i mean he doesnt do anything and sends his enemies but my good his a fan Of Many Villians and Dark side users. His the icon of the entire Kingdom Rush Series and had many appearances in other video games like ToToTemple. You can also get steam cards wich has only 5 cards to make a stamp. Big bertha is my favorite tower not because it has Rockets and looks better than tesla its because it wrecked the entire enemies and i use tesla when dealing with Hordes of enemies but most of the time you need to use Tesla.\n\nPros\n+Good level design\n+Good music\n+Memorable enemies\n+Steam Cards\n+Towers are great\n+Even More Memorable Villian Vez´nan\n+Good graphics\n+Funny\n+You can fully complete the entire Achievements\n\nCons\n-Heroes (the only best heroes out there are Oni, Hacksaw and Elonora)\n-Some towers are overpowered like Sorcerers and Tesla\n-Some towers are least used like Big Bertha and Musketeers\n-Early levels music is pretty bland\n\nThats all to say but ill have to say Its actualy my opinion the best tower defence game of all time and later on theres gonna be a sequel.

Easy to learn, tought to master, like chess. This game is polished to a shine, and balanced to perfection. Being a big fan of Tower Defense games, balance is always an issue for me. Not so here. Everything has been carefully weighed and priced (via gold to buy towers) to make it seem tough but fair. The early levels teach you everything, and it slowly escelates into an all-out rage-war that will leave you screaming and hitting the "try again" button because you were so close to winning that time. Its addictive, has a steady (though unforgiving near the end) learning curve, and the boss characters that show up are just amazing. Its packed with easter eggs (perhaps a few too many, each tower has recognizable lines and there are things hidden on EVERY map), good dialogue and excellent voice acting. You even unlock more levels when the campaign is over. Worth every penny of my mere $10 that I had to pay to get it. Two thumbs WAY way up, this is a buy!\n\n\n\nEDIT (After Finishing the Game)\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\nSo, having finally finished 100% of the game, gotten all the achievements and such, I have to lean back and philosophize for a bit. So, what is the general thought when it comes to this game as a whole? I wonder why barracks just become useless over time. That's 1/4 of the game right there. I wonder how much work went into balancing such a wonderful game, and how many hours got devoted to making it just so, because it shows and I love it. I still like to gush over the Citedal, Fungal Forest and the Rotten woods-- those are my favorite levels by far.\n\nMy favorite hero is Thor, though to beat some of the harder levels you simply have to change heroes. Which makes sense, I think.\n\nI got over 40hrs of solid entertainment out of this, and it is certainly worth ever penny I paid for it. A gold standard of the genre.","January 26, 2014","true","57.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Also played Kingdom Rush 2 on my smartphone, very impressed that I have yet to experience any lag. Then, played KR2 on Kongregate. Seeing that KR has been released on Steam, I would support them because they have yet to disappoint me. Though, to unlock more heroes and other bonuses, you had to pay through microtransactions. This game here on steam eliminates all of that.\n\nArt style is nice, sprite animation is great & seamless, and the colors are easy on the eyes. For $7.50 w/ a -25% discount, it's a steal. I'd still pay the full amount for the content and hours I've placed in the game.","January 7, 2014","true","5.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I don't recall if the browser version has heroes or not, but this does which makes me like the Steam version more and they're already unlocked so you don't have to spend more $. It looks like they're adding more heroes and levels later on, so I'm looking forward to that.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Reih/recommended/246420/","Reih","Lillieah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Reih/","193 products in account","What can I say about this game other than its fantastic. The version created for steam trumps the iOS version by far, with no additional costs for heroes, premium content or microtransactions, if you're a TD type of person or ever thought you wanted to give it a try, the Steam version of Kingdom Rush is for you.\n\nLet me begin on the first day I was introduced to the flash version of this game I ended up being hooked. It was so easy to get into, gave me hours of entertainment and laughs and even some aggrivation whilst trying to figure out how to complete each level with 3 stars. By the time I had finished the original campaign mode of the 12 levels, I couldn't believe that a game such as this one, with the graphics, gameplay, voice acting, music score and overall enjoyability, was free! I felt like it should've been worth something!\n\nWhich is what happened with the iOS version. However... I'm not a fan of purchasing a game only to have a ton of microtransactions needed for the full experience. Premium content wasn't included, no heroes etc. That wasn't a good way to go about it in my books at least. Left much to be desired...\n\nThat is why the day it released on steam I had no reservations or hesitation on buying it and diving right back into it. Now it included all the premuim content and all the heroes and has a promise of more to come ontop of that!\n\nThe Steam version's gameplay is smooth and enjoyable. I only had one hiccough on an Iron Challenge level with a certain enemy getting stuck on the edge of the map for a few attempts. The issue eventually resolved itself, but Iron Hide has been very good about providing bug fixes to this game in a timely matter so I expect that'll be fixed over soon.\n\nThe graphics for this game are fantastic! Each level has its own attention to detail, the NPC's and enemy's movements are smooth and while some might argue the cartoonish animation is childish and unappealing, I beg to differ! I absolutely love it!\n\nThe sound in this game is amazing! The music in this game is simply stellar. It brings the right amount of emotion to each level. When I hear the boss music que up, I always felt my pulse quicken and the sense of urgency rise as if I needed to pump up my offense and defense and quickly! Any game thats able to do that with a simple musical score is worth your time to look at. Not to mention the voice acting! I nearly died the first day I upgraded my Dwarven artillery to the Big Bertha, added a rocket only to hear "Yippie Kai-yay mother *BEEP"! I remember going out of my way to upgrade my dwarven towers just to be able to hear that one line over and over. And still to this day I get a giggle out of it.\n\nI just finished this game 100% now on all levels and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. I had hours, hours of enjoyment! And I will definitely play it again and again, not just because I want to see how I could complete each level with different strategies, but because it is simply fun!\n\nSo granted there are some bugs with the game so far, the purchase price of 10 bucks is so worth it! I mean, there are so many people who are willing to throw 50 bucks or more out the window for games that are absolute garbage and here you have the chance to get a great game with high replay value for 10 bucks! It has great graphics, great music, great acting... you can't get much better than that!","January 11, 2014","true","88.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Each level in this game takes about 15 - 20 minutes to complete (assuming you make it to the end!), making it perfect for the casual gamer whos not afraid of a bit of strategy. I was pleasantly supprised with the added bonus levels which are awarded to you after you beat the main campaign. These extra levels, have a considerable higher difficulty, which really get you planning out your builds, and aniticipating whats to come in the next wave. There are also 2 extra challenge modes for each level, which really do add to the replayability to them. I really like this game, (and most well done tower defence games) which is why I bought it during its release sale at $7.50. Even at sale price, the amount does seem a little high for this game, but, for me, it was worth it. For those who are not as TD and strategy savvy as I, I'm sure there will be a better price on this game in the future. I think $5 is fully justified for this game.","January 9, 2014","true","45.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I don't recall if the browser version has heroes or not, but this does which makes me like the Steam version more and they're already unlocked so you don't have to spend more $. It looks like they're adding more heroes and levels later on, so I'm looking forward to that. Replay value is high IMO since after you beat the levels, there are 2 other challenging modes to try.\n\nI'm not much of a fan of the TD genre, but I highly recommend this.","January 9, 2014","true","73.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Reih/recommended/246420/","Reih","Lillieah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Reih/","193 products in account","What can I say about this game other than its fantastic. The version created for steam trumps the iOS version by far, with no additional costs for heroes, premium content or microtransactions, if you're a TD type of person or ever thought you wanted to give it a try, the Steam version of Kingdom Rush is for you.\n\nLet me begin on the first day I was introduced to the flash version of this game I ended up being hooked. It was so easy to get into, gave me hours of entertainment and laughs and even some aggrivation whilst trying to figure out how to complete each level with 3 stars. By the time I had finished the original campaign mode of the 12 levels, I couldn't believe that a game such as this one, with the graphics, gameplay, voice acting, music score and overall enjoyability, was free! I felt like it should've been worth something!\n\nWhich is what happened with the iOS version. However... I'm not a fan of purchasing a game only to have a ton of microtransactions needed for the full experience. Premium content wasn't included, no heroes etc. That wasn't a good way to go about it in my books at least. Left much to be desired...\n\nThat is why the day it released on steam I had no reservations or hesitation on buying it and diving right back into it. Now it included all the premuim content and all the heroes and has a promise of more to come ontop of that!\n\nThe Steam version's gameplay is smooth and enjoyable. I only had one hiccough on an Iron Challenge level with a certain enemy getting stuck on the edge of the map for a few attempts. The issue eventually resolved itself, but Iron Hide has been very good about providing bug fixes to this game in a timely matter so I expect that'll be fixed over soon.\n\nThe graphics for this game are fantastic! Each level has its own attention to detail, the NPC's and enemy's movements are smooth and while some might argue the cartoonish animation is childish and unappealing, I beg to differ! I absolutely love it!\n\nThe sound in this game is amazing! The music in this game is simply stellar. It brings the right amount of emotion to each level. When I hear the boss music que up, I always felt my pulse quicken and the sense of urgency rise as if I needed to pump up my offense and defense and quickly! Any game thats able to do that with a simple musical score is worth your time to look at. Not to mention the voice acting! I nearly died the first day I upgraded my Dwarven artillery to the Big Bertha, added a rocket only to hear "Yippie Kai-yay mother *BEEP"! I remember going out of my way to upgrade my dwarven towers just to be able to hear that one line over and over. And still to this day I get a giggle out of it.\n\nI just finished this game 100% now on all levels and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. I had hours, hours of enjoyment! And I will definitely play it again and again, not just because I want to see how I could complete each level with different strategies, but because it is simply fun!\n\nSo granted there are some bugs with the game so far, the purchase price of 10 bucks is so worth it! I mean, there are so many people who are willing to throw 50 bucks or more out the window for games that are absolute garbage and here you have the chance to get a great game with high replay value for 10 bucks! It has great graphics, great music, great acting... you can't get much better than that!","January 11, 2014","true","88.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

These talents buff either your towers, reinforcements, or spells.\n\nThis game has good graphics for being a mobile port, easy controls, a nice UI, excellent replayability, and most importantly it's tons of fun.

Hopefully it'll be improved with the next few updates.\n\nUniquely cartoonish art style with bright colors, intense but untiring music, and all those lines and quotes always keep you entertained in its easy, funny way.

Turns out I haven't played such luxurious one since Gem TD as well. Art is cartoony and very cute. Also, unexpectedly rich for an indie game. Large amount of monsters, locations, heroes, towers, tower upgrades. You always have something new to notice and look at. From the big picture view, design is standard with expected TD patters, nothing new. However, developers gave huge focus to design details that make you fall in love with the game. You will start to notice them right away and uncover much more through the campaign. This is what makes the game so amazing. Funny voice responses of heroes full of various references to games, movies, etc. Map easter eggs to discover and interact with (sheeps, windmills, ...). Gameplay is very smooth and well designed. You can play it casually, enjoying your time, or like a pro, thinking of crisp timings and deep strategies. Simply put, playing this game will give you a great satisfaction from many different views whoever you are. I just can't recommend this gem from Ironhide Game Studio enough.\n\nAbout drawbacks, there are few I would like to mention: First, the waypoints and reactions of melee tower soldiers... I am quite experienced in Blizzard strategy games and these melee units are completely unituitive for someone like me. At the same time I believe they made it intentionally this awkward to keep balance and give space to more try-hard players. Second, I feel like every level requires a certain strategy which you have to uncover and successfully use, experimenting different builds usually ends up in a failure. Last, there is no level editor. I understand this game came from its web/mobile predecessor, but giving space to talented and passionate players might yield so many interesting levels and patterns I would love to see and understand.","August 6, 2014","true","12.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatsnotmywallet/recommended/246420/","thatsnotmywallet","ramenking13","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatsnotmywallet/","5 products in account","I played Kingdom Rush for free at Armor Games years ago, and was immediately addicted. I blew through the whole thing within the span of a couple of days. I was browsing around Steam when I found this here, and asked myself, "Why would anyone buy this? Don't they know it's free at Armor Games?"\n\nWell, I did some reading, and supposedly they added some content and some DLC, so I went ahead and bought it. After all, even if the extra content was bogus, it was still an amazing game worth paying for, and I definitely wanted to support these guys. I was pleasantly surprised with how gracefully the game aged. They applied a fresh coat of HD paint to the game, and added Heroes, whom you pick up along the way.\n\nHeroes aren't just a gimmick either- they add to the game in a way that the game actually really benifits from. You select one before your battle, and you can guide your hero around the battlefield wherever they're needed most, which gives you more to do than just sit there and watch your towers work. In fact, I completely forgot about the reinforcements button after the addition of Heroes.\n\nAs my favorite Tower-Defense title, let me tell you that if you played it for free at Armor Games, it's still entirely worth the buy, especially right now since it's marked down by 25%. Great work Iron Hide. I'm completely happy with my purchase, and I encourage anyone who's looking for a charming but challenging Tower Defense game to give this one a whirl.","January 7, 2014","true","12.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The art, the sound, the gameplay, the style, all of it just works so perfectly that you forget that you have been playing this game for three hours and you need to go do something productive. I played through this game three times now, once on iPad, once on Nexus 7, and once on iPhone, and it still remains fun. It has the style of PvZ with the variety of other TD games like Bloons and Fieldrunners. I highly reccomend this for anyone who likes Tower Defense games.

And finally I'm more than happy to see its successul conversion from the original flash version which was only around 20MB's large.\n\nAlthough there are certain minor imperfections(such as removing in-battle encyclopedia and some controlling incovniences), the game yet has(again) blown me away. Hopefully it'll be improved with the next few updates.\n\nUniquely cartoonish art style with bright colors, intense but untiring music, and all those lines and quotes always keep you entertained in its easy, funny way. Not to mention the stratigic battles and the hilarious animations!\n\nIf you are a fan of TD games and haven't tried Kingdom Rush -- you are really missing out. You are so guaranteed that you will love it.\nAnd even if you are not really into TD games, you may as well try out this PC version of the over 49 million times of play and 9.7/10 scored little game.\n\nThanks.

Turns out I haven't played such luxurious one since Gem TD as well. Art is cartoony and very cute. Also, unexpectedly rich for an indie game. Large amount of monsters, locations, heroes, towers, tower upgrades. You always have something new to notice and look at. From the big picture view, design is standard with expected TD patters, nothing new. However, developers gave huge focus to design details that make you fall in love with the game. You will start to notice them right away and uncover much more through the campaign. This is what makes the game so amazing. Funny voice responses of heroes full of various references to games, movies, etc. Map easter eggs to discover and interact with (sheeps, windmills, ...). Gameplay is very smooth and well designed. You can play it casually, enjoying your time, or like a pro, thinking of crisp timings and deep strategies. Simply put, playing this game will give you a great satisfaction from many different views whoever you are. I just can't recommend this gem from Ironhide Game Studio enough.\n\nAbout drawbacks, there are few I would like to mention: First, the waypoints and reactions of melee tower soldiers... I am quite experienced in Blizzard strategy games and these melee units are completely unituitive for someone like me. At the same time I believe they made it intentionally this awkward to keep balance and give space to more try-hard players. Second, I feel like every level requires a certain strategy which you have to uncover and successfully use, experimenting different builds usually ends up in a failure. Last, there is no level editor. I understand this game came from its web/mobile predecessor, but giving space to talented and passionate players might yield so many interesting levels and patterns I would love to see and understand.","August 6, 2014","true","12.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Until this changes, I simply cannot reccommend buying a game from a company that continues to profit off a player base that it will not make games for (they turned to the mobile market instead).\n\nOriginal review:\n\nLet's put everything out in front of us.  This game is free online.  What isn't online though?  Extra heroes, extra levels, and this game right at your fingertips.  I loved playing this online.  It was and is a fun game.  I've never unistalled it to make way for new games, nor have I ever regretted the purchase.\n\nThis game was worth the buy.  It has interesting levels which all can be beat in different ways.  It's a tower defense game with a twist; there is one lane and an extremely diverse amount of units.  The game weans you into the difficult levels as well.  Little by little it allows you to unlock all the towers, all the heroes, all the enemies, etc.  Each level also has an "Iron Challenge" (build any towers with one continuous wave of enemies), and a "Heroic Challenge" (one continuous wave of enemies while not being able to build certain towers).  Basically, this game can be as easy or strategic as you want it to be.\n\nSo why Kingdom Rush?  Because of the choice of towers.  You have Arrow towers (which do basic damage as a medium speed), Mage towers (which bypass armor, do better damage, but not as quick), Bomb towers (which do basic damage in an area with a slow speed), and Soldier barracks (three melee units strum out to stop enemies in their paths and fight them head on).  Each tower upgrades twice.\n\nHowever, it doesn't stop there.  Each tower also has two different third upgrades to go into.  The Archer towers become either Forest Elves (shoot super fast and have poison attacks and can strangle enemies in place with vines) or Gun Towers (slow but extremely powerful and far reaching snipers that can take down most minions in one shot).\n\nThe Mage towers become towers of Support (slows enemies, spawns golems to fight for you, or turns enemies into literal sheep) or towers of Death (transports enemies back in line or can insta-kill enemies with extremely powerful magic beams).\n\nBomb towers turn into Rocket Launchers (can do mass aoe damage, spawns homing rockets, and secondary multiple missile shells) or Electric Turbines (can chain lightning enemies, do aoe attacks from the base of the turbine).\n\nAnd Soldiers can eventually upgrade into Holy Knights (which can do smites and heal themselves) or Barbarians (which can eventually dual wield axes and become ranged throwers as well).\n\nBuy this game.  No ragrets.","February 3","false","21.2"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","2"

It's a very classic tower defense game built with touch screen interface in mind: this means it is a very limited interactive game. You just click like an housewife on the already defined towers spawn points and chose the kind of tower you want to deploy. Basically that's all about it's gameplay, excluding some abilities that you have the chance to use every bunch of seconds just clicking on the point you want to fire them. All the new units unlock is automatic and you have just the chance to select wich branch of towers you want to upgrade first (either in the skill three and during the monster waves). The heroes are just the same: you get them automatically while the game progresses and you click on them in order to move'em towards the spot you want them to help defending.  It doesn't mean the game isn't funny or even challenging, but that, in my opinion , limited interactive games like this are best suited for touchscreens and that there, in that very market segment they should remain. At this price tag, Revenge of the Titans, Defender's Quest or Anomaly IMO are much better choices for some PC tower defence pleasure.","January 9, 2014","false","1.5"," 6 of 17 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","6","17","0","0"

Some try to be visually fun, some think they need to add something to the genre and some feel like a simple flash games.  Replace "some" with "this game" and you've got a grammatically difficult sentence that is accurate none the less.\n\nThe flash game references is a little unfair, as this game really does have solid visuals and quality execution, but at the same time it seems that there's nothing it gained from being a standalone game apart from the ability to charge people for it.\n\nKingdom Rush is fixed position tower defense with the addition of a "hero" that can roam around the battle field (at your direction) and activated abilities to throw down some temporary defenses or a fireball from the heavens.  Progressing is had during the rounds by upgrading your towers and your hero leveling up (levels that only persist for each game) 'causing him/her to do more damage and have a greater amount of hitpoints.  Progression out of game is served by spending stars (1, 2, or 3 stars are given for successful completion of a level, based on how well you did) to increase the strength of towers or powers.\n\nIn total, there are about twenty levels with your typical late-game unlocks for harder mobs or sudden death (single life) runs in that level.  Level design has your typical duel entry, duel exit, splits, joins, bypasses that you've seen in other fixed map tower defense games.\n\nKingdom Rush is unexcitingly typical tower defense.  It may sate that occasional tower defense game, and while it may be a fun play on a tablet, that'd only if you compare it to the poor quality of the tower defense in the Android and iOS ecosystems.  I'd call this a buy at $3.  It's well drawn, but simple.  Level designs lack inspiration.

Unfortunately, this is the exact same version that you can play for free on android/ios or on various game websites. Don't get this game on Steam, go play it somewhere else, there is no added value here (unless achievements and trading cards are worth $10 to you). At least I got it as part of a bundle so I didn't have to pay full price for it. This is the reason I'm not recommending it, not because the game itself is necessarily that bad but more because this version is a grossly overpriced mobile port, not a real PC game.\n\nAs for the game itself, despite being one of the better tower defense games, it still has some issues. The biggest one being that this game frequently degenerates into a mad click-fest which I don't particularly like, for me I like tower defense games that give you some time to think and plan things out between waves and that give more flexibility in terms of tower placement. This game limits you to existing tower plots on the map, severely limiting what you can do with your towers.\nThese issues aren't even really inherent to a mobile game, bloons tower defense does a much better job in terms of tower variety, placement flexibility and planning between waves (even if the enemy types are boring).\n\nStill, this game is a fun little time waster, but if you want a great PC tower defense game, go look at Orcs Must Die or Sanctum.

Going from hero selection to structure (or vice versa) is equally frustrating. It definitely does NOT have smooth controls. I am curious how such an oversight skipped testing. Did the developers not play the game? Also, the hero and footman AI are pretty bad. Your unit can be standing right next to an enemy creep and he won't attack simply because it is not on the same horizontal plane, even though they're pretty much touching. In short, this is a decent game that could have been great. It has some rather big flaws that makes the game a bit frustrating.

It is an interesting, unique take on tower defense with lots of fun to be had. However I can't recommend this to anyone for a lot of reasons.\n\nFirst of all it's a mobile game that was ported to PC and it was ported very poorly. It is riddled with a lot of little bugs that hurt your ability to play the game on PC. One example is the poisoned arrows upgrade for ranger towers should always prioritize non-poisoned targets over poisoned ones, and should also prioritize targets that CAN be poisoned over targets that are immune. Well, they don't in the PC version. This bug has existed since release and was never fixed. It changes your strategy for dealing with some things because on the mobile version when it's working perfectly the poison upgrade makes the tower shoot necromancers only, ignoring the skeleton swarms around them, to kill them off so they stop summoning more. In the buggy, broken PC version they shoot skeletons and the skeletons are immune to poison altogether.\n\nSecond, it is unsupported. It will never have any of it's bugs fixed, it will never have any additional content added. The developers used this as a one-time cash grab and now they have washed their hands of steam altogether. The mobile version has an endless mode where you can just go wave after wave until you're defeated and let you try to get on the leaderboard for having the best strategy. PC version didn't deserve this feature in any form. Very disappointing since it's the most fun part of the game on mobile after you "finish" it.\n\nThird, you can play this game for free in flash online on many different websites. The flash version has 3 of the heroes in this version, but allows you to purchase additional heroes for money. However these additional heroes are entirely not needed, the ones you are given for free are more than enough to complete the game on the hardest difficulty in every mode. This version only has about 7 or 8 levels that the completely free version doesn't have, and again, you can purchase those bonus levels if you desire.\n\nDespite playing the flash version, when I saw this on steam I bought it up quickly because I loved the game and thought I was buying something worth buying. But after the fact I found out they won't be fixing any of the bugs, they won't be adding endless feature, and they're also not adding the newer kingdom rush games to steam or PC at all, and lost all faith in the company and am sorry to have given them a single cent of my money. But it won't happen again.\n\nSo to summarize, everything enjoyable about the game you can play for free online, buying it here only gets you bugs and problems and less features.","March 29, 2015","false","117.2"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","0"

It's not that bad, but not good, either. The purpose is served well enough. Won't rag on this.\n\nSound 9/10\n\nThe sounds are terrific, and fit everything very well. They also add to the game's visual style. The voices probably steal the show on this game, though. They're corny, over-acted sometimes, but always funny, distinct, and fun. KR also has comedic references to other media including Portal, Half-Life, Star Wars, Die Hard, the Bible, and many others. The sound is KR's pride with the exception of the music. While entertaining, there's about 3 tracks that last 30s long and are set to loop. It just could have been a bit better.\n\nGraphics 10/10\n\nThe graphics too are wonderful, colorful, and stylish. Visually the game isn't too flashy, which is good because it clears up visual clutter. With so many things moving on screen at once, the visuals organize everything to give the player what they need to see. Enemies are fun and recognizable. KR's visuals are spot-on. Bull's-eye.\n\nGameplay 10/10\n\nWith the barrage of tower defense games out there, it's easy to get weary of the grind. KR however, brings much, much needed personality and freshness that this crowded genre so direly needed. You place towers that are immune to enemies, and auto-attack the enemies. Placing a barracks trains 3 infantry to stop up to 3 passing enemies allowing your damage towers to wittle them down. The infantry can die, though, and have a respawn time. Some enemies have armor and are weak to magic, while others have magic resistance and low armor. Towers can be upgraded for more damage, alternate attack styles, and different personalities from the crew. It all works wonderfully and the game gets REALLY challenging fast. It works so well, KR is a high standard on how tower defense games should be made. It's that good.\n\nThe Verdict\n\n"Everything's so good, so why do you not recommend it?" Good question: the only con is the game is waaaay too short. Once you get half-decent at it, you will BLAST your way through the campaign (and most side missions) in about an hour. The game has high quality, but is far, far too short for recommending at $9.99. If it had an acceptable length, it'd be 10/10 but KR's final score is 7/10. It's a great game that you can beat in one afternoon. Just go to the above listed sites and play it for free. Or if you find that it's on sale for $5, you can go for it.","January 10, 2014","false","3.9"," 63 of 137 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","63","137","0","18"

This is a non working executable. First time (after years and more than a houndred steam apps) of having something not work for me in steam.\n\nTLDR: Tried everything, including official support, no response from their team. Payed $10 to have nothing. Absolutely nothing.\n\nStarting configuration menu is invisible. Can press enter to play, but the game crashes upon loading the first level. Tried reinstalling video drivers, windows redistributables, verifying integrity of game cache.\nWas lured by pretty videos, but can not recommend an unstable game. What's happening 6 months after steam release (and an expansion after)? They require you to send crash logs, because they think content > stability. Way to go, ironhide.\n\nBesides all the steps detailed, after more than a week and instructions in the forum sticky, still no response from their tech support.\n\nEdit: Many months have passed and still no response, though the game works now. Game is about 3/5, with customer support 0/5.","July 21, 2014","false","8.9"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

I love TD and strategy games.\n\nThis game is like babies first TD. It has 4 possible towers and all the positions for tower placements are made for you.\n\nThere is an archer tower which fires fast but does light damage, mage tower which pirces armor units, siege towers which do aoe splash, and barracks which produce units to block creeps.\n\nThere is no slow towers so you have to rely on barracks to block creeps so your other towers can do something. Barracks only spawn 3 units so if there are more than 3 creeps coming then they will walk on by. The siege towers are useless because of the lack of slow. There is no point in aoe in this game. The mage towers are also lacking since they are much slower than the archers and armored units are few and far between. The strategy is reduced to spaming archer towers and barracks. Pretty boring.\n\nIt does have hero units ala some Warcraft 3 td maps but you bearly control it. You tell it where to stand and it does everything else on its own.\n\nYou have 2 hero powers. One to spawn 2 units and the other to summon a small firestorm. Both of these powers quickly become useless unless you upgrade them. However, upgrading them means you arent upgrading your towers which makes it stupid.\n\nThe story is nothing to talk about. Its toled through about 2 sentences before every mission. Throw away.\n\nAll in all this TD is extremly basic and really shows its mobile origin. If you love TDs you might be ok picking it up on sale for a buck but otherwise leave it be.","September 24, 2014","false","3.2"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

It doesn't hold a candle to Defense Grid though. Having the ability in a TD game to rewind a few waves WITHOUT having to go back to the start is a crucial feature, and Kingdom rush doesn't have it.

Over 5 hours of playing until I tried the same sorry arsed level 15 times. Ridiculously hard. Maybe if you do things in exactly the right order of placing, upgrading, and selecting the right hero then you could beat it. maybe. Not fun enough to try all the combinations though so I'll move along. Setting difficulty to easy is not an option.\n\nI am changing my review to not recommended. I lowered difficulty to casual and it is still extremely difficult. There are just so many enemies that you get overrun. Some come out of unmarked areas with nearly no mount points for defense buildings. Breakdown:\n\nGraphics: Great for this type of game, no complaint\nSound:  Good for this type of game, not much on sound anyway\nMechanics: Things work well, do not appear to be any bugs or issues\nLevel Design: Overall pretty good, but unmarked areas that spawn unexpected mobs is a big NO\nBuildings: Good mix of abilities, being limited on where you can place a building is terrible\nHeroes: Somewhat helpful but too much babysitting that distracts from elsewhere\nMiscellaneous: Absolutely aggravating is having to click 2-3 times on a 'disabled' building\n\nIt could be an excellent game if a few points above were addressed, but there is something irritating having to try 10 to 20 times to beat a level to advance. Add in the clicking crap and building placement limitations and I really can't recommend it. However if you get it for around $5 it is fun for awhile.\n\nMarginal 5/10 and thumbs down","October 8, 2015","false","21.8"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

They've taken the microtransactions out of the original game(Frontiers still has them) and the ability to earn the gems as you play to get useful items to make the harder levels more manageable is nice.  Something on top to earn even if you don't perfect a level.  The PC version not only lacks these(I can't imagine trying some of the endgame bonus levels on hard without at least one extra gold bag to start me off with or an ice wand), but it also has frankly unacceptable load times, with the average for me being 45 seconds or so.  Which is ridiculous for a glorified flash game/mobile game on a pretty strong PC.  Being able to hotkey reinforcements and such is a plus, but it doesn't outweigh the handiness of the touchscreen.  I made it a bit over halfway through the campaign before deciding the PC version's not my thing.\n\nGet the mobile version.  IOS or Android, either one is fantastic.

If however you can get it for £1.99 or less then I would recomend it.\n\nSadly with the steam version they missed a trick,it lacks replayability due to the lack of any kind of scoreboard. Dueing missions you get 1 to 3 stars based on performance and thats it, the only replayability is to get 3 stars in each mission, I just wish they had something like in defence grid with a score based on time / unspent gold / lives remaining etc etc or something simlar to give reason to reply the game.\n\nWith 3 stars up for grabs each level with a max obtainable of 120 thats 40 levels and in 80 ish minuites i've completed 10  and thats with some afk time.\n\nThe level deigns / layouts are good, the towers while they may seem limited in variety have intresting upgrades that completely change what they do, so why it may seem there are only 4 different towers theres more like 16.\n\nI'm not going to go into any more depth about the game as it is avail for free to play and within 30 mins play you will get to see most of which is on offer and if you like it and its cheap then buy it for the trading cards and chevos on steam.\n\nIt is a good game but based on the fact its short, lacks replayability and is avail to play free as a browser game I can not reccomend this game to buy at its current asking place.\n\nIf you want some free tower defence goodness checkout cursed treasure, gem craft and desktop tower defence.

They've changed a lot of things, specifically the heroes are pretty different. The heroes in the version are all different, and you cant actually upgrade them. You just choose one and position it around the map. This kind of change was carried over to all parts of the game I feel. Most in-game tower upgrades are ineffectual, as are the out-of-game upgrades you spend points to unlock. I never felt like anything I did made my game any different from anyone elses. This would would have been fine if thats the kind of experience they were aiming for, but based on its predessor, and how many different methods they have the potential to allow customization in, it seems more like a badly executed RPG system, not a well balanced even-playing field kind of thing.","January 6, 2014","false","2.1"," 32 of 91 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","32","91","0","0"

Many developers have tried to come into the space and capture the experience but Ironhide Game Studios has set the bar to epic with Kingdom Rush.\n\nI have purchased this game for iPhone, iPad and for the PC and have done a full play through almost 4 times (once for each platform, twice on the iPad).  The PC version sports a few differences that are worth mentioning if you already have played through on the iOS.\n\nPC differences of note:\n1) There is no more collecting crystals during in-game play for purchasing "extras" for use during levels.  On the PC you have what you are able to do during the level and that is it.\n2) There is no difficultly settings to play with.  On IOS there is Normal and Hard mode; PC allows no selection.\n3) On PC you have open access to all of the heroes; no need to purchase them as you did on the IOS versions.\n\nIf you are a fan of any Tower Defense games and would like to explore the genre a bit more, Kingdom Rush is a very easy recommendation and carries with it quite a bit of replayability.

I didn't think much of Kingdom Rush at first, because the graphics and first 5 missions made it look like a generic mobile tower defense albeit with some interesting mechanics.  However, when I got to around mission 10, I couldn't just hobble together some defenses based on my favorite tower.  I had to actually think, "Okay, based on the mission description, what is the best combination of defenses?"\n\nDespite having most of the research points earned from previous missions, it took me almost 8 attempts to beat that mission.  It wasn't due to unfair difficulty, or personal ham-handedness.  Every attempt was me throwing together all sorts of combinations of research, towers, heroes, and progression in one strategy after another until I found a strategy that worked, and it worked WELL.  It was extremely satisfying too, because even though the strategy was refined through practice, the level was STILL challenging.  A perfect clear requires a perfect strategy, and perfect management of the map, and despite getting a 2/3 star rating it was...hectic.  There were few moments where I could simply watch the battle unfold, because there were constantly things I could be doing, whether it was reevaluating my hero/soldier placement, using abilities based on enemy type and movements, or examining my defenses to allocate funds.\n\nAll in all, this game is easy to learn, hard to master.  On the surface, the mechanics are fun and simple, but if you dig deeper, you'll find that the developers have balanced every defense you have with an enemy type.  No one tower is a "go-to", and situations can change in the blink of an eye if you aren't careful.  I may not be much for TD games, but I highly recommend this if you like macro-managing strategy games but don't feel like playing a huge one like Sins of a Solar empire for example.","January 10, 2015","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's a lengthy campaign and different challenges to help with replay value. It has been out on mobile devices since a couple of years ago. Having completed it on mobile, there's not much motivation to replay it again except to enjoy it on a bigger screen. It is also nicer to look at with the updated UI and graphics. Kudos to Ironhide Game Studio for still supporting the game with FREE content updates even after it's release 3 years ago, more content are coming in the future. All in-app transactions have been completely removed and contents can be unlocked just by playing the game, so the price is justifiable.\n\n8/10","April 23, 2014","true","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You build towers in preset locations using money, which you get by killing enemies. While battling, you upgrade said towers again using money. After every succesful battle you are awarded up to three stars each mission, which you use to unlock perks for your towers and these perks are well thought out, offering many gamechanging mechanics and -ofcourse- more damage.\n\nAll towers are equally useful: magic for strong/armored enemies, bombs for crowds, archers for small & fast enemies, soldiers for stoping & gathering enemies. You also have 2 special powers which have a cooldown and can be used indefinately (1.inserting 2  soldiers anywhere you want and 2. meteor shower). By the way, special powers get perks too.\n\nAnd then there are "heroes", which are directly controled by the player, have special powers and suit many different playstyles (strong melee, weak magic, ranged, teleporting among others). Between heroes, special powers and the fact that you can demolish your own towers (and get a little refund) to build a different towers in their place, you will never feel powerless or blame the game.\n\nMake no mistake though, the game becomes gradually challenging. You won't be needing lightning reflexes, but you'll have to learn by trial and error sometimes. If you are easily frustrated, there's always the "casual" difficulty setting.\n\nAs for longevity, this game is a completionist's dream. Beat the main campaign and you still have 2 challenges for each mission (which restrict what types of units and level of upgrades you can use - for me these were even more fun than the main mission!) and a couple random missions poping up all over the map. I haven't completed everything yet, but i'd say you're getting at least 20 hours of fun.\n\nWell worth the price.","January 31, 2015","true","14.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This title will addict you. It will also likely run smooth and provide you with many hours of exciting gameplay. I've been playing TD games since Warcraft 3 mods, so here's my lowdown:\n\nPros-\nOne of the smoothest running, most balanced TD games I have ever played.\nUnlike "pathing" TDs, these enemies are pre-pathed and don't wind sprint everywhere.\nGraphics are awesomely cartoony, but not super cheeey either.\nMusic and sounds are perfect, with no nerve grinding even after 3 hrs straight.\nIf there are faults or bugs, I can't see them. No crashes. No trouble running the program.\nNo annoying collectables in game (ie. coins, powerups, etc.).\nOne of the few games that is aptly priced.\n\nCons-\nCould use the ability to more precisely control the heroes.\nThe way your minions work with proximity is a pain sometimes. Enemies right next to them are not noticed.\nSometimes controlled pathing is fun.\nNot enough Pandas and Honey Badgers.\n\nOverall-\nA super suprisingly glorious entry into the realm of epic TD gaming. Its worth the 10$ asking price and is a super value at nearly any price lower on sale. Unlike some of the half slapped together garbage thats being spewed into the market right now, Kingdom Rush is a pleasant reprieve from high dollar underwhelming AAA hype, lame duck poorly conceived Indie titles, that both satifies that deep down desire as a gamer to feel you've spent your money wisely, and hands newbies an impressive and viable entry point into the genre.

It has enough new features (like the core of your defense being a soldier spawning tower) and is quality enough to stand out of the pack, in both the tower defense genre and "free" browser games.   Liking tower defense games is obviously a pre-requisite, but it's also simple enough to be a great point of entry.\nWhy buy this version?  If you loathe freetoplay games in any incarnation as much as I do, here's the way to play without any of it.  Everything you'd pay extra for in the browser and mobile versions is all here for the entry price.  That's about it, but the core game is good enough that this game would definately be worth a purchase, all things being equal.\nHonestly, I'd reccomend going to the kongregate site, trying this out for a while, and if you enjoy it, wait for a steam sale and pick this up.  Hopefully there have been enough sales to persuade Ironhide to release full versions of the sequels.","November 23, 2014","true","16.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This title will addict you. It will also likely run smooth and provide you with many hours of exciting gameplay. I've been playing TD games since Warcraft 3 mods, so here's my lowdown:\n\nPros-\nOne of the smoothest running, most balanced TD games I have ever played.\nUnlike "pathing" TDs, these enemies are pre-pathed and don't wind sprint everywhere.\nGraphics are awesomely cartoony, but not super cheeey either.\nMusic and sounds are perfect, with no nerve grinding even after 3 hrs straight.\nIf there are faults or bugs, I can't see them. No crashes. No trouble running the program.\nNo annoying collectables in game (ie. coins, powerups, etc.).\nOne of the few games that is aptly priced.\n\nCons-\nCould use the ability to more precisely control the heroes.\nThe way your minions work with proximity is a pain sometimes. Enemies right next to them are not noticed.\nSometimes controlled pathing is fun.\nNot enough Pandas and Honey Badgers.\n\nOverall-\nA super suprisingly glorious entry into the realm of epic TD gaming. Its worth the 10$ asking price and is a super value at nearly any price lower on sale. Unlike some of the half slapped together garbage thats being spewed into the market right now, Kingdom Rush is a pleasant reprieve from high dollar underwhelming AAA hype, lame duck poorly conceived Indie titles, that both satifies that deep down desire as a gamer to feel you've spent your money wisely, and hands newbies an impressive and viable entry point into the genre.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ViperZeroOne/recommended/246420/","ViperZeroOne","ViperZeroOne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ViperZeroOne/","274 products in account","Kingdom Rush is, without a doubt, the second best classic-style Tower Defense game out there. The first being the Defense Grid series, of course. That said, if you own Defense Grid (or not) you deserve to give Kingdom Rush a chance anyway.\n\nStarting out as a portable game on iOS and Android, I half expected the PC version to just be a cheap port. Oh man was I wrong! Graphics are subtly improved, while not loosing their style. The map view is way better on the PC version. The difficulty has been upped, to force you to plan better. Even mouse effects have been added when you're casting your "fireball" and "reinforce" skills. The game actually feels as if it was made for the PC, and that's how game ports should be!\n\nThe graphics for Kingdom Rush are different and unique. You'll absolutely love them. The tower upgrades are also VERY well done, with each upgrade changing both the look of the "tower" and the "units" it supports. While not really that dissimilar from the portable version, it does make viewing the game on 24+ inch screens a delightful experience.\n\nGamev play is the biggest surprise here, because this isn't any ordinary tower defense game. There's also a bit of RTS involved. For example, when you put down a "soldier" tower (which spawns 3 soldiers) you can set a relay flag within the radius of the tower's influence. This allows you to put many towers in close proximity, rallying them at the same spot to form an army, or have your tower in the vicinity of multiple paths so you can adjust your raly deployments to whichever path needs it at the time. Yes, there is often more than one route to the "map exit" you have to protect, sometimes even multiple exits... You also get a hero, and unlock new heroes as you continue. You'll have to decide which hero you need for a specific level, as they all have different skills.\n\nThis game also has a very hefty "skill tree" that can mean the difference between life and death. To unlock these bonuses you have to collect stars. Each level has a capability of providing you with 3 stars and you lose stars based on how many enemies make it past your defenses. This will bring you to, regularly, have to go back and clean up earlier levels. Some will argue that this is a bad thing. I argue that it's actually a good thing. First, when you take on those earlier levels again you do so with your upgrades intact, which makes them easy. Second, it allows you to take a break from not being able to beat your current level, so you don't consider "rage quitting". Third, it allows you to gain more stars so you can unlock more abilities and then decimate that level you were just getting ticked off at. Proper leveling can really make a difference on the game's overall difficulty.\n\nThe music for the game is pretty repetitive, with each level having virtually the same music to it. That said, it doesn't get annoying in the least. It's pretty much background sound, as the weapon clashing, arrow flinging, magic casting, and bomb exploding takes center stage in the audio department. Sound is very well handled, and I like the fact that there is a bit of voice added to the characters as well.\n\nI was going to give Kingdom Rush a 9/10, but I think I need to up the scale because I feel it's more like 99/100. Why did it lose a point? Well, I felt sometimes you didn't get enough money from kills to have the upgrades you needed to defeat the level. You're constantly going, "Dammit if I could have only upgraded that tower once more I would have stopped that last guy!" That said, it's all part of the challenge, and this game is a challenge.\n\nIf you like classic Tower Defense games, this is one you have to own. It will frustrate the hell out of you, it will bring you a lot of satisfaction, and It's well worth the $10.\n\n\n\n\n* My review is based on my 30+ years of gaming experience, my vast experience with other games like this one, and my experiences with this game on both Android and PC.  Constructive criticism is encouraged, however if your comment is based solely on the fact you can’t beat this game then I suggest you move along as you won’t find sympathy here.","July 19, 2014","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When I saw there was a full game on Steam for a low price? I immediately bought it and now I'm halfway through it! I was no fan of tower defenses (literal towers and lanes, not Plants vs Zombies, please) until I tried Ironhide Studio's Kingdom Rush!! If you want REAL tower defense, get THIS game. It is full of content, full of  different characters and towers to try out, placement, upgrades and strategy actually COUNT in this game. It IS simple, but it won't baby you and you won't need babying but it DOES have reasonable challenges. Get this game!! And try the game on ArmorGames, it is significantly different than this game here somehow, but I have no complaints.\n\nHOWEVER, and I don't know if only I'm the one experiencing it, but the Steam version of Kingdom Rush has its...bugs. On the technical side sometimes out-of-stage music plays alongside the in-stage music, and if I didn't pause and unpause the game, the introduction of a new tower I just unlocked won't show up and I cannot continue the game as the stage is unclickable.\n\nIt sometime also has some visual bugs. There's random imagery fidgeting around the top right of the map selection screen. And somehow every time I quit to the main menu, it either has loads of Kingdom Rush logos splashed across a screen of black or just a black screen (the buttons of the main menu can still be clicked though, but of course I don't know which is which.)\n\nThese happen sometimes and not all of the times. I'll reinstall for the 3rd time later, so I am not sure if I am just tad unlucky on getting corrupted files, or it is really a bug. With all that said, KUDOS to Ironhide Game Studio.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ViperZeroOne/recommended/246420/","ViperZeroOne","ViperZeroOne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ViperZeroOne/","274 products in account","Kingdom Rush is, without a doubt, the second best classic-style Tower Defense game out there. The first being the Defense Grid series, of course. That said, if you own Defense Grid (or not) you deserve to give Kingdom Rush a chance anyway.\n\nStarting out as a portable game on iOS and Android, I half expected the PC version to just be a cheap port. Oh man was I wrong! Graphics are subtly improved, while not loosing their style. The map view is way better on the PC version. The difficulty has been upped, to force you to plan better. Even mouse effects have been added when you're casting your "fireball" and "reinforce" skills. The game actually feels as if it was made for the PC, and that's how game ports should be!\n\nThe graphics for Kingdom Rush are different and unique. You'll absolutely love them. The tower upgrades are also VERY well done, with each upgrade changing both the look of the "tower" and the "units" it supports. While not really that dissimilar from the portable version, it does make viewing the game on 24+ inch screens a delightful experience.\n\nGamev play is the biggest surprise here, because this isn't any ordinary tower defense game. There's also a bit of RTS involved. For example, when you put down a "soldier" tower (which spawns 3 soldiers) you can set a relay flag within the radius of the tower's influence. This allows you to put many towers in close proximity, rallying them at the same spot to form an army, or have your tower in the vicinity of multiple paths so you can adjust your raly deployments to whichever path needs it at the time. Yes, there is often more than one route to the "map exit" you have to protect, sometimes even multiple exits... You also get a hero, and unlock new heroes as you continue. You'll have to decide which hero you need for a specific level, as they all have different skills.\n\nThis game also has a very hefty "skill tree" that can mean the difference between life and death. To unlock these bonuses you have to collect stars. Each level has a capability of providing you with 3 stars and you lose stars based on how many enemies make it past your defenses. This will bring you to, regularly, have to go back and clean up earlier levels. Some will argue that this is a bad thing. I argue that it's actually a good thing. First, when you take on those earlier levels again you do so with your upgrades intact, which makes them easy. Second, it allows you to take a break from not being able to beat your current level, so you don't consider "rage quitting". Third, it allows you to gain more stars so you can unlock more abilities and then decimate that level you were just getting ticked off at. Proper leveling can really make a difference on the game's overall difficulty.\n\nThe music for the game is pretty repetitive, with each level having virtually the same music to it. That said, it doesn't get annoying in the least. It's pretty much background sound, as the weapon clashing, arrow flinging, magic casting, and bomb exploding takes center stage in the audio department. Sound is very well handled, and I like the fact that there is a bit of voice added to the characters as well.\n\nI was going to give Kingdom Rush a 9/10, but I think I need to up the scale because I feel it's more like 99/100. Why did it lose a point? Well, I felt sometimes you didn't get enough money from kills to have the upgrades you needed to defeat the level. You're constantly going, "Dammit if I could have only upgraded that tower once more I would have stopped that last guy!" That said, it's all part of the challenge, and this game is a challenge.\n\nIf you like classic Tower Defense games, this is one you have to own. It will frustrate the hell out of you, it will bring you a lot of satisfaction, and It's well worth the $10.\n\n\n\n\n* My review is based on my 30+ years of gaming experience, my vast experience with other games like this one, and my experiences with this game on both Android and PC.  Constructive criticism is encouraged, however if your comment is based solely on the fact you can’t beat this game then I suggest you move along as you won’t find sympathy here.","July 19, 2014","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When I saw there was a full game on Steam for a low price? I immediately bought it and now I'm halfway through it! I was no fan of tower defenses (literal towers and lanes, not Plants vs Zombies, please) until I tried Ironhide Studio's Kingdom Rush!! If you want REAL tower defense, get THIS game. It is full of content, full of  different characters and towers to try out, placement, upgrades and strategy actually COUNT in this game. It IS simple, but it won't baby you and you won't need babying but it DOES have reasonable challenges. Get this game!! And try the game on ArmorGames, it is significantly different than this game here somehow, but I have no complaints.\n\nHOWEVER, and I don't know if only I'm the one experiencing it, but the Steam version of Kingdom Rush has its...bugs. On the technical side sometimes out-of-stage music plays alongside the in-stage music, and if I didn't pause and unpause the game, the introduction of a new tower I just unlocked won't show up and I cannot continue the game as the stage is unclickable.\n\nIt sometime also has some visual bugs. There's random imagery fidgeting around the top right of the map selection screen. And somehow every time I quit to the main menu, it either has loads of Kingdom Rush logos splashed across a screen of black or just a black screen (the buttons of the main menu can still be clicked though, but of course I don't know which is which.)\n\nThese happen sometimes and not all of the times. I'll reinstall for the 3rd time later, so I am not sure if I am just tad unlucky on getting corrupted files, or it is really a bug. With all that said, KUDOS to Ironhide Game Studio.

I've played some and most bored me very quicky. Kingdom Rush is different. It's challenging enough so it keeps you playing, but not frustrating or cheap difficulty. It also looks and sounds very nice and just has a very pleasing aesthetics. Try the flash version, and if you like it, I'd recommend either the steam or the mobile version, the bonus maps are well worth the price.","July 2, 2014","true","44.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I wont bore you with the gameplay but basically you use three keys to play the game and you then die in lava. But you then get to upgrade and then try again. Then die in lava. But then upgrade some more and try again and get even further than last time and then you die in lava. Then you upgrade and you try again etc...\nI intended to only spend half an hour playing this game before hitting the hay. I looked at the time 30mins later only to find that TWO HOURS had passed!\nAny game that can make you lose your track of time because you are enjoying it gets a great big thumbs up from me! Highly Recommended little game.\nJust make sure to keep an eye on the clock. Its so easy to say "one more try..."","June 20, 2014","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
