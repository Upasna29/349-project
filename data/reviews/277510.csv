The graphics are charming and cute, although I wouldn't say it's as good as Pixar (don't know what crack pipe that guy was smoking who said that.)\n\nYou play as a firefly (duh) who flys around collecting his babies throughout the level and the objective is to get them to the ending unharmed. In order to complete each stage you don't have to save them all, just as many as each stage says you have to, but if you want to earn a medal then you have to save them all (earning medals unlocks achievements.)\n\nThere are three medals in each stage. Earn one for collecting all the coins in each stage, another for saving all the firefly babies and another for completing each stage in a set amount of time. If you want this game to be challenging then you're going to want to collect the medals. Otherwise you'll breeze through this game (maybe not if you're a young kid or you just really suck at these type of games.) It's pretty short with only three worlds with 10 levels and a boss battle in each. I'm already at world 2-4 and that's with going back to collect all the medals. If I didn't care about that I'd probably already be near the end.\n\nBut I like I said: Fun. Addictive. Cute.\n\nAnd it's for all ages!","May 16, 2014","true","5.8"," 35 of 41 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","35","41","0","0"

The kind of game you play while on the toilet.  It is clearly a bad port of a tablet/phone app and wasn't optimized at all for PC.  The input tab on the start "screen" claims to have WASD support but trying to press WASD in the game does nothing (arrow keys too).  You have to click to tell where you want the character to go.  I'd be okay with it if it was click-and-hold to move the character.  But this game requires a click for every little bit.  According to Steam, I've only played for five minutes.  I'm tolerant of most control schemes as long as I can use the keyboard, but the control scheme is clearly not PC-oriented and the keyboard controls are not functional at all.  Don't waste your time or money - there are better games out there.","January 3, 2015","false","0.1"," 29 of 35 people (83%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","83","29","35","6","0"

Clearly a mobile/touchscreen game, and controls on keyboard and mouse suck. Using a controller works, although things like clicking on hint flowers and using the flower to finish the level don't work with it, so you still have to use mouse there, which is a clear mistake, but not a big one. The controller works quite well, except for landing, which is finnicky and unnecessarily hard to do. There is really no story. The levels start to seem somewhat repetitive, as in every single one you rescue fireflies and have to have them follow you to the end. A few different enemies come on every 5-10 levels or so, but that's about it, as you don't get any new powers or abilities. You just dodge, throw the same seeds, and knock rocks on to block water. There are some boss fights which are welcome and change things up, but that's about it. The game is pretty short too. It wasn't a bad platformer-esque game, but leaves no lasting impression. 7/10.","June 27, 2015","true","5.2"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

The slightly embarrassing answer - though only VERY slightly, I gotta say (I'm pretty shameless) - is that I also have something of a penchant for "cute" and "child-like" things (hence why Among The Sleep is one of my favourite games of recent years...its cute and not-so-cuddly, all in one).  Now USUALLY these "child-like" things will also be a tad on the spooky and/or violent side of things - Limbo and Little Inferno spring to mind as other personal faves - and therefore have a kind of cross-over, however tenuous, with my more usual tastes.  And extremist though I may be, I think I may have actually crossed a bit of a personal line with the game I'm currently reviewing...which is to say...I think that Shiny The Firefly may be just a tad TOO light-hearted and child-like for Yours Truly to handle, even on the most whimsical of days.  You want "cute"?  This game has it in spades.  Chuck a "sickeningly" in front of that word, and we're getting even closer to the truth.  In fact, I'm starting to harbour the vaguest of suspicions that Shiny The Firefly may NOT actually be aimed at 40 year-old man-children such as myself, but rather...inconceivable as this may sound...may even be squarely and solely aimed at KIDS...and I don't even mean "big kids" like myself.  I mean, y'know..."kid" kids.  Ones under ten years of age, let's say.\n\nAll of which might be well and good if I actually HAD any kids of my own, or even nieces or nephews or something, but considering I have none of the above I possibly have no excuse to have ever bought this game, much less to be playing it ALL BY MYSELF.  Don't get me wrong...this game is actually pretty good.  A tad too pedantic at times where the controls are concerned - it's perhaps more suited to a tablet and a touch-screen interface than it is to PC and mouse - but certainly by-and-largely "competent".  Nothing much wrong with it, basically.  Except that IT'S ABOUT A MALE FIREFLY WHO HAS TO GO AROUND "COLLECTING" HIS BABIES.  Is the Universe trying to send me a message here?  Have I somehow failed in my God-given task of reproducing my worthless self, and now I have to be digitally derided for my sins?!  How did I even end up with a game called Shiny The Freaking Firefly in my Steam library?!?  Oh, waitaminute...that's right...I probably bought it real cheap in a sale, just out of curiosity, and to further my admittedly paltry ambition of edumacating myself in as wide a variety of gaming styles as possible.  Well, let's consider it a success then...I have now, officially, played a game just a tad too painfully "cute" for my stomach to bear.  Damn you, Shiny, you loveable rascal, you!\n\nVerdict: 6/10 (if you're over 30) or 8/10 (if you're under 10).","October 13, 2014","true","1.3"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","65","11","17","6","0"

It started off very simple, and which made me think, "wow, this would be a great game to keep kids busy on a low spec laptop or something."\n\nIt was cute, simple, and a decent way to waste time. Went to prepare a review for my YouTube channel to recommend this as a free to play game for folks with kids. That's when reality hit.\n\nThis wasn't a free game. THIS GAME IS 10 ♥♥♥♥ING DOLLARS. 10 ♥♥♥♥ING DOLLARS. one more time in case you missed something. This game cost 10 ♥♥♥♥ING DOLLARS. Are you serious?\n\nI thought god this can't be right. There's no way it cost that much on ios. $1.99 ios.......really.....♥♥♥♥ing really? So no. no. Not for $9.99. never ever ever for that price. and honestly, not even for $1.99. I'm not interested and could not ever recommend this game to anyone.\n\nTL;DR For more than one american dollar, this game is over priced (in my personal opinion). Apparently, i received this game in a hot random key bundle some time back for pocket change, downloaded it for a rainy day, forgot about it until recently, and didn't realize the full retail price was as absurd as it was.\n\nIf this were free.
