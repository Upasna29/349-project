I have enjoyed text-based adventures in the past, and I hoped that this would be a fun way to role-play as my own created hero. Right off the bat, the game doesn't really do anything to explain how it works, or what you are suppose to be doing. So with little direction, I created my character and am offered to perform one of ten actions for the "turn". The first action I saw was "go on patrol" (or something similar), so  I went ahead and tried it. I saw nothing. So I tried it again. Still nothing to respond to. So I went and used the training option for a few rounds to build up more points to spend on stats/traits/powers for my character. Then I noticed a button to track down villains. So I spent TEN TURNS trying to track down a single opponent at level 1. Finally, I managed to find them and start a battle. Unfortunately, this is where it got even more confusing. The game battles are determined by "seeds" which seem to be the total offensive 'rolls' of the attacker pitted against the total defensive rolls of the one being attacked. If you score high enough offensively, you hit; or vice versa for the defending hero/villain. There are several things that affect rolls such as traits, positioning, move accuracy, stats, and various other factors. But the problem here is that I honestly have yet to figure out what dictates a hit, or a dodge, or a reduced impact, or anything else. It seems to cryptic. One time I actually managed to roll a 421 defensively against a roll of 24 from the attacker, and I still got hit for full damage. It simply doesn't make sense to me.\n\nNow all of this could simply be chalked up to me simply not understanding the game fully, but there is NO EXCUSE for my next experience. I made a new character just to test patrols, and gave him balanced stats. I ran him on patrol over 150 times and never found ANYTHING. My character went depressed from lack of motivation from doing nothing, and that results in a gameover. That was when I decided to quit before I hit two hours so that I could refund the game. Its just poorly done.\n\nPro's\n-------\n-You can create a custom hero from a large selection of portraits and move-types\n\n-Seemed to run fine\n\nCon's\n-------\n-Confusing layout\n-Unrealisticly low chance of discovering crimes (at least during the early phase of the game)\n-Poor explainations of core game mechanics\n-Sloppy combat text descriptions - It just seems as if it presumes to much.\n\n(I have removed the no audio Con. In all fairness, BGM or Clicker audio is not required by any means for a text-based game to be enjoyable)\n\n_____\n\nUpdate: Take this review with a grain of salt, honestly. I jumped in and purchased the game having been a moderate fan of text games (The Dark Room on IOS, for example), and I was even more motivated by my love for comicbook fiction. After reading some feedback I do realize now that perhaps I would have had a more enjoyable experience had I started a hero at a higher tier so that I could handle and possibly even encounter more villains. But I am sure that the limitations put in place by the lower-ranked hero system are not intentional as it seems to negate any sort of drive to start from the bottom and work your way up; whats a good comic without an origin story?","December 9, 2015","false","1.5"," 203 of 232 people (88%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","88","203","232","10","9"

I should note that you will absolutely hate this game if you don't enjoy pen and paper games, or are expecting a world you can actually see, instead of read about. If on the other hand you don't mind a lot of reading (and I mean a lot of reading), and you don't mind having to guess at how elements of the game world work, then you can have a lot of fun with this.\n\nAlso, don't go patrolling for your first few turns, there's a gauge on your sheet which says how much criminal activity there is, random patrols don't do so well when there aren't people to patrol for, and you can help with civilian projects/hunt for people instead.","December 9, 2015","true","1.8"," 84 of 103 people (82%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","82","84","103","4","2"

When you start out you have 2 options grab an existing character or struggle with your own to make an emotionally stable character before they have a breakdown. If you do happen to make one either by exploiting the flaws in the system or pure luck then you are stuck grinding away for any progress. This isn't really even a game but a design your own hero concept on computer without any of the flaws resolved.\n\nLearning the game is a chore for most people as there is no manual or tutorial so while it looks like there is a lot of content but there really isn't. This is more of a fan made concept world for people who wish to play out their fantasies with their favorite superheroes.\n\nCannot recommend it as there are much better games out there and while they might not give as many customization options at least they work like a sim or another type of game should.\n\nShould you want to create your own world it is possible through this program unlike the others but the system of making heroes doesn't work well. You will end up spending much more time in the editor than actual gameplay and sooner or later just jumping into premade character to mess around for a bit. In order for this to be a good game they will need to overhaul the system to make it more enjoyable or at least put options in to make it more live fast die young rather than breaking people's will to be a superhero.","December 12, 2015","false","14.4"," 41 of 49 people (84%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","84","41","49","3","3"

I guess I like it, so here's a review!\n\nAnyone remember Romance of the Three Kingdoms VIII?  That's 8 for you youngsters.  You make a character during the China's war filled Han Dynasty and proceed to do whatever.  Join a lord and fight battles, be a bandit, go farming, wander the lands learning crap, or take over territory to call your own.  Whatever you do, everyone else does their own thing.  Wars can start and end without you being involved in any way.  You're a single fish in a big pond.\n\nThat's what I like about this game.  You're a lone super hero in a world full of heroes and villains.  It does practically everything RTK8 does (only without flashy graphics and no sound) and has an awesome hero creation system.  Whoever your favorite hero is, you can make them in this game.  Any combination of powers you can think of can be done.  Think Wolverine would be cool if he could fly and travel through time?  Do it in this game.  What about Batman if he read minds and can split in to 8 other Batmans (Batmen)?  This game can do it.\n\nThe game also includes an editor.  You can edit your own hero whenever you like.  I'd suggest moderation when doing that.  Don't max out everything you can.  That'll take away the fun and leave nothing to spend your points upgrading.  I mostly have used it to add relationships.  It's a tad annoying when you can't find someone you are searching for within 30 searches.  Adding a relationship saves time and prevents rage.  Unless you like to rage, then by all means have at it.","February 10","true","113.4"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","84","21","25","3","0"

Unfotunately, that's all that it has at this point.  While this is one of the most customizable games I have seen in a long while, customization on its own is hardly enough to carry the title.  The lack of any kind of documenation or tutorial leaves users to flounder about (usually maddingly as one gets defeated right off the bat).  The lack of goals (other than simply leveling up) also is a little bit of a let down.\n\nFinally, I am NOT against text-based games (I'm olde enough to have thoroughly enjoyed Zork...when it was released), this game does not use the text to actually carry the game forward.  With a lack of story, with a lack of goals, and with a lack of direction, the user is left scratching his/her head trying to figure out "what is all of this for?"\n\nWhile I see potential, the lack of goals and the complete lack of instruction leave this game a little cold for me.","December 20, 2015","false","5.4"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

I've spent hundreds of hours on each of them. I don't understand the point of Comic Book Hero: The Greatest Cape though.\n\nYou fight villains and level up your hero but you rarely capture or kill the bad guys. If you do capture them, they go to prison and break out after a while. If you kill them, your world gets depopulated, which is a bad thing. The leveling is very slow and feels like a grind, and other heroes around me rarely seem to level up either.\n\nI enjoy the relationship system but it seems like I have to do social meetings over and over again to get the slightest bonuses. Even when I become a close ally of someone, not much seems to change in the game. Same when I become an enemy of a villain. None of it seems to go anywhere.\n\nUnlike Ryland's good games, the world around you doesn't seem to change much, no matter what you do. Without that, I don't know what the purpose of playing is.\n\nEDIT: As a test, I played as Captain Awesome, one of the strongest heroes on the game and deliberately lost to a low level villain called Marquess. Awesome is level ten, Marquess is level three. I lost to him four times. He didn't level up once. I can only assume that villains don't level up at all, and NPC heroes don't either. So the world is completely static. This feels like a completely lifeless game.","February 26","false","3.1"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","13","13","2","0"

I decided to purchase this game despite the negative reviews because I enjoy pen-and-paper RPGs and I enjoy text-based adventures.  This game feels at best unpolished and at worst unfinished.  There are a number of diamonds in the rough, but in my opinion the game is severely hobbled by the expectations that are set and a lack of gameplay that feels like it suits your hero.  I would like to share the "high points" of my hours-long playthrough so I can show you what I mean.\n\nFirst of all, there are four options, Roleplay (in which you take one of the pre-existing heroes and "roleplay" as him or her,) "Clone" (in which you take one of the pre-existing heroes and play him or her as you like,) "Background" (in which you choose one of a nice variety of backgrounds,) or Custom (in which you build your hero from the ground up.)\n\nI chose background and got a fire-user, which I didn't really want so I decided to reroll the character ... only to find that the origin you take gives you pretty much the same hero each time, no input on powers you want or even any reason for you to have those powers.  It doesn't randomly generate (unless I somehow managed to get the same powers three times in a row.)  So then I start looking through the poor 3d portraits they supply with their game (some in clear violation of copyright); ironically, several of the established heroes have multiple color schemes ... but the portraits intended for the player-created character use only one color set per model.  See a hero/heroine you like but the colors are all wrong for a fire-wielder?  Too bad.\n\nSo finally, I get my character and I start, and it gives a choice of cities.  It doesn't really explain why you should choose one over another, and it doesn't seem to matter given my experience, except in encounter frequency (maybe.)  The city tailor-made for mutants doesn't seem to have any particular benefit or penalize mutants, or so it seems.  Now, since I've read previous reviews, I know I probably don't want to patrol, so I search for a villain I think I can take.  I find her, and also find she has two accomplices.  Naturally, I don't stand a chance, and the weird combat system certainly doesn't help at all.  A sticking point: my character has the power of flight.  No defensive benefit, even against a villain whose attacks are clearly melee-based (at one point, he used a press-slam on me while I was flying.  The move described involves lifting an opponent over  your head and letting them drop to the ground.  I am a flyer who was in flight when this move hits.  How am I damaged again?) but you do get extra damage when you get hit, from falling out of the sky.  It doesn't seem to matter if you do ranged or melee attacks (except in regards to the stat your target defends with) and you should never taunt alone (because any benefit you get is instantly and wholly negated if you get hit) even if you are a wisecracker.  After my ignominious defeat, I lost half of my Hero Points, which, starting with 5000 means half of that is far more than I ever received for winning, doing training, or community service following.\n\nOK, so now I have to wait several turns to recover from this terrible beating, so then I decide I should find an ally and waste another five or so turns trying to chase anyone down.  I finally come into contact with a low-powered heroine and as I develop a relationship with her (choosing 'professional' rather than social,) somehow, my secret identity is revealed to the world and, guess what, if your identity is ever known, I don't see any way to fix that.  So several fights after which every villain escapes, I still can't afford to improve my abilites and my morale keeps dropping.  At this point, I declare this character hopeless because no amount of patrol, searching or anything really ever finds me a villain, just when my super friend who exposed my ID to the world invites me on patrol do we ever see anyone (oh, and if you make a super friend and they lose, expect them to drop off the face of the Earth for many turns while they recover.)\n\nSo I decide to do a custom hero, and try to make a Speedster ... only on normal mode, just having the Speedster perk is over double my starting points.  I don't see a lot of disadvantages that would make sense so this character is aborted before I start.\n\nFinally, I decide to try a character from the future and for powers I get ... a laser gun.  That's it.  The future is a laser gun.\n\nThis game suffers from an extreme lack of balancing in my opinion, in terms of it doesn't balance action with the seemingly unending string of searching, patrolling, et cetera without ever adding up to finding anything to do while your hero continues to spiral down down down into depression.  I think the game has incredible potential, but needs significant improvements to every single aspect, from encounter distribution to interactivity, to interface to art assets.  For $20, there are a LOT of better games out there.","February 22","false","3.5"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

The concept is very interesting - the central idea is that you are the creator of a comic book hero and you manage its day to day actions which in turn make him/her stronger and as he/she succeed in the missions you hit the target audience and you "evolve" your character to new "volumes" of its hq, which in turn, alongside other metaobjectives, give you more experience points to  spend on abilities or perks.\n\nThe problem is that the good idea never goes far from it, just a good idea. The implementation is relatively simple, the game is little more than an excell sheet with some pictures. The powers you can choose from are interesting but they lack significant effects on the game. For instance, you can have a heat "impact" power and a cold "impact" power, and the only real difference is when you are facing a foe which has resistance or weakness to those elements.\n\nThe mais features of the game wear out quickly. Soon you will notice you will be essentially locken in a loop of patrols, recover and generic interactions with the other characters. Since the game doesnt have a plot, not even as an optional scenario, it is just a constant repetition of the same actions. It is fun for some hours, but after you do essentially the same thing for the "n"th time, you just go look for somehting else to entretain you with.\n\nA blend between this game proposal and an action oriented such as Freedom Force would be phenomenal though.","January 7","false","14.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

And then Rogue ends up beating everyone including the hulk due to stealing their powers..\n\nIts a open, non-handholding sandbox game in a world where every hero lives their own lives and has own story.\nEach hero performs daily actions: patrolling city, working, resting, dating.. yes.\nVillians plot and steal in addition.

You may also have designed your hero wrong with non-useful abilities and powers for its current area and end up having a bad game.

However it is very fun if you like text based sims.\n\nbasically this game is about, you the player, being a comic writer not a hero.  you are writing your heros story as you play the game.  choices will arise that will affect many things from powers gained or penalties incurred, or even death.  its broken into volumes (levels - described as popularity among readers from 1-10) and chapters (major encounters like battles, death, etc.)\n\nthere are 4 ways to start with a hero.  use one that is premade, choose a backstory and have one generated, clone one from the list, or create a custom hero altogether.  i chose the latter myself.\n\nyour skills, powers, and attributes are minimal if this is your chosen path.  you can build your hero up from there but it will take time.  if you are looking for a more powerful hero id choose another route.  i kind of liked it.  felt like the birth of a hero and you get to guide him along his story from the very start.\n\nits broken into turns that dont always equate to a chapter as chapters are only major occurences.  you search for baddies or friendlies, visit your friends and allies, patrol, train, etc. etc.  these choices will mold your story step by step.\n\nsome of the choices dont always result into anything meaningful however.  for example, patrolling doesnt always result in finding a struggle and searching for other NPCs often times result in an uneventful turn.  this is probably the only major downside imo.  between each turn you get a run down of what other heros and vilians are doing so if you string together a few of these uneventful encounters you find your self clicking through the sea of notifications at times.  not a huge issue, but can get frustrating.\n\ncombat take a bit of getting used to.  once you understand it though it can be fun, and frustrating at times.  its not a perfect system but it does the job.  it will create nailbiting fights, but will also create some pretty boring or hairpulling ones as well.  again not perfect, but it does the job.\n\nbeing text based, the graphics wont excite anyone.  the writing is ok, but wont blow your mind by any means.  i have yet to complete a story so not sure if there is some kind of epic journal somewhere yet, but i dont really expect one.  in fact, i hope i can take my hero on for some time as i have found myself connected to hero in a short time.\n\nthere is a great editor in the game and some nice mods floating around as are with most games made by Grey Dog.  if you are the creative type, this is probably a good choice for you if you wish to create your own universe of supers.\n\nif you like these type of games, then you will enjoy this one.  Grey Dog creates some fun games and this one does as well.  for the price is was worth it to me, but i can see why some wont feel the same way.  these games arent for everyone.\n\ntldr:  fun game if you like text based sims.  lots of options and great editor + mods.  wont blow your mind, but shouldnt dissappoint if these games are your thing.","December 12, 2015","true","18.2"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","4","8","0","0"

Comic Book Hero: The Greatest Cape was released on Steam on December 9th, 2015 by Developer Grey Dog Software and Publisher Viva Media.\n\n(NOTE: This game was reviewed using a key provided by the Developer and/or Publisher)\n\nVideo Review:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/wimLi5iP9Xs\n\nThe "Too Long, Didn't Watch" Review:\n\nFUN! Fully customizable. Just lacks solid Visuals and Sounds.\n4/5. $20 may be a bit steep, but the replayability is there.\n\nThe "Meat & Potatoes" Review:\n\nWow! This is almost a completely customizable Choose Your Own Adventure (once you get the feel for it). You can have a pre-made Hero, make your own Hero, be an Anti-Hero-type Hero. Go Solo, be part of a team. Roam around different places. Patrol, level up, rest. The life of a hero. This was a lot more fun than I expected. These are the types of games, along with what SimProse does, that I really seem to enjoy. You combine a great thing like this and just a touch of your own imagination, and you have a great personalized game experience waiting for you. A big hit for fans of Management sims, CYOA's, Visual Novels and the like. If you want action or good graphics, it may be best to look elsewhere. Also, if it frustrates you to not have your hand held, you may not want to join in the fun here. You need to be willing to feel around the game a bit. This is more along the lines of an OOTP-type experience. You build the world and the players and the interactions. You use your imagination and blend it with the gameplay. The visuals, sounds, etc. are of less importance in a game like this. As is, I REALLY enjoy this game. BIG thumbs up. SOLID effort. Short on graphics and sound, big on fun, customization and replayability. Oh my, the customization!! The price is a touch steep, but not by much (if any). Solid. 4/5. I am hooked....just not sure there's an actual endgame (or if that even matters?)\n\nHappy Gaming!!!","December 14, 2015","true","4.3"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","1"

The question is how, did you get your super powers? Were you summoned from the dead by an inexplicable source?  Were you born mutant with some strange powers?  Or you tripped on an object while on a walk in the bush and landed on an Alien Artefact which gave you unforeseen powers?  Or none of that….?  Nah, who needs super powers when you are an expert in martial arts and super-fast!\n\nComic Book Hero: The Greatest Cape is a text-based adventure / management /simulation genre of game where you play a Superhero who fights crimes. At the start of the game you will have to choose what mode you would like to play. There are 4 modes in total – Role Play (choose an existing Superhero and play as him/her) – Back Story (choose a Superhero with his/her origins and powers but create your own name) – Clone (you have the powers and abilities of the hero you selected but you do not share relationships or teams they have) - Custom (you customize your Superhero from scratch). If it is your first attempt in this genre, I would recommend selecting the mode Back Story to start with. Also, you will have to select what type of difficulty you like to play on, from easy to hard. Easy you will get 10,000 hero points to start with instead of 2,500 if you decide to go the hard way.\n\nThe game is setup as turn-based. Each turn you decide what you would like to do; patrol the street to find out if there is any strange activity going on - Track an enemy – Search for a Superhero to form friendship – Train your hero – Recuperate (after a mighty battle is a good Idea) and more. Always have a good look at your Superhero state of mind and make sure he/she is not getting depressed.\n\nThe combat system is an aspect that I had a bit of trouble understanding at the start, but as you play it, you will get the hang of it. However, it will feel a bit random at times. It will cost you energy each time you use choose an attack. If your energy is too low but you have Hero points up your sleeve, you can use them to boost your energy back up, but it will cost you a fair wack. Otherwise miss a turn, it will help to regenerate your energy (not much but it will help).  At the end of the battle, you will get Hero points if you are victorious but you will share the points with the people who you fought with. Win the fight by yourself and all points will be yours!\n\nWith the Hero points, you will be able to buy new powers or upgrade your Superhero attributes.\nPositive:\n~~~~~~\n-	Stacks of Superheroes to choose from\n-	Plenty of powers to add to your character\n-	Editor available\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n-	Combat system a bit random at times\n-	No sounds\n-	No Achievements / trading cards\n\nIf you don’t mind text-based adventure games / management sims, this is an interesting game and worth having a look at.\n\n7/10\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes. Any opinions expressed are entirely my own!\n\nMORE THE_CPT_FROGGY REVIEWS HERE\n\nFOLLOW THE CPT FROGGY CURATOR PAGE HERE","January 16","true","6.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

And boy does it need improvements.\n\nEDIT 2: After several hours of play, I have found out that this game is half done. Many things are missing and some were just not thought by the deisgners. On top of that the designer says that this game is dead and won't be improved since it is "old". SO DON'T BUY! ESPECIALLY AT 20$! try 5$ maybe.\n\nEDIT: BAD SIM. A RANDOM NIGHTMARE. EVERYTHING IS SUPER RANDOM and improving your character only increases the randomness of everything. Stay away from this sim until is it fixed. ALSO, this feels like a BETA and should be flagged as BETA too.\n\n\nGood sim. I really like it. There are numerous things already in this release and there is a lot of room to add more stuff. Adding new powers would be nice... but more importantly, the ability to add new powers and attributes.\n\nThere should be a little more info in combat to explain results (like "your hero is affected by a slowing power").\n\nI bought it as soon as I saw it. I already like and own Total Extreme Warfar 2010 of the same designer, and I think he had a good idea to make a super hero sim.\n\nPublic appearance should improve you popularity by a tiny bit, especially when you are unknown or obscure. Already popular hero are expected to make public appearances once in a while, so not doing so would reduce their popularity a little bit.\n\nMany features are nice in the sim even if I would have added one or two more, the sim is fun to play.\n\nBuy it, worth 5$. :)","December 11, 2015","false","127.5"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","6","12","0","4"

Slowly working my up from an obscure hero to a certified legend was exciting! As I increased in strength so did the level of villains I took on, when I got strong enough to take on the biggest baddies and pull out victories against them I literally talked ♥♥♥♥ to my computer screen roleplaying as the hero, gloating over my superiority.\n\n\nForming relationships with other heroes was just as interesting as taking on the villains. Apparently the better your relationship the more likely the hero is to show up for a battle you're about to take part in but I honestly can't say that with certainty. It's still enjoyable to build your relationships with other heroes as eventually you gain the ability to form super teams like the Avengers or the Justice League, you can name them whatever you want and have up to 20 members on a team. You also have the ability to form multiple teams.\n\nAs of this moment I'm still enjoying the game immensely and my goal is to get every hero/antihero/wilcard in the game to join one of my teams. A silly goal but this game encourages imagination from the player, visualizing how the fights go down and the various shennanigans your character gets up to is most of the fun!\n\nAlso since this game is quite difficult for newcomers, I'd like to point out the Editor! It's at the top with all the other options like New Game Load Game etc and once you're in the game with your hero/anti-hero you have the ability to edit your characters everything! It's a fun and easy way to make a godlike character and mess around to get the hang of the game and powers. Have fun!\n\n\n(If we could get the ability to mod this....OOOOOOOOOOOOO)","December 15, 2015","true","28.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Sure, there is a steep learning curve at the beginning, and to understand many of the things you see you kind of have to just poke around the game for a while, but overall it is very similar to a single player pen and paper RPG.  Biggest thing this game could use is a nice little tutorial, because it does assume you are going to play as an established hero to start.  I believe most people will probably be like me and jump straight into the custom hero, and that makes the game kinds hard to start.  Still working out how the social and romance aspects work, but overall I give this a 4 out of 5 stars.","February 3","true","197.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Other than that, the game's a grindfest (something I don't mind as long as the grind doesn't feel tedious,) and also a tool to create your own universes and fill them with heroes and villains. Sure, the creative process takes time, but once you're done getting the right pictures, stats and powers, and crafting the world to your liking, you could play any character of that universe - or try your luck as a "nobody" hero who's just starting out.\n\nOne other point that may be seen as a flaw is that NPC heroes/villains don't level up/down as the player does, but this may be a good thing - Since balancing the number of heroes and villains is hard, and villains are more often than not in the losing end of a battle, then the game could end up being a world populated by invincible heroes beating up weaksauce villains.\n\nI know some will say that the whole "psychological profile" part of the game is broken and impossible to play with, but that is not true. Game mechanics take some time to figure out, but once you do, you'll be going up in the heroic ranks easily, and be able to keep your hero's social/mental state outside the "you lose" zone. True, sometimes a bad choice can screw you over but no death is permanent in the game (at least for the player - NPCs can and will die a lot if you set deaths to be frequent) and if your character is not cutting it, then you could always try a different approach, or use the in-game editor to fix your character up. Yes, it's still cheating if it's a single-player game, but the important part of that equation is "single player game."\n\nThis game is a game that will give countless hours of fun if you are into the kind of games it is, doesn't come in small pieces you have to buy separately, and has a built-in editor. Too bad I won't be able to play the villains I create.","April 5","true","11.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's little to no instruction on how to play the game and it can get repetitive in the beginning until the real game starts.  Also, the lack of any real conflict between the villains and heroes makes it seem empty a bit.  Finally, the fact that it is unfinished and won't be getting any more updates is frustrating.\n\nDespite it all, I still enjoyed this game.  Maybe it's because I'm a huge superhero fan and willing to overlook it's glaring faults or maybe I'm just touched in the head.  Don't care; had fun.  Especially once I learned how to make my own heroes/villains/worlds/time periods.  That's when the game really opens up, if you're the type that's into that sort of thing.\n\nStill, I'd buy it on sale...","May 30","true","351.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The amount of customization avaliable is absolutely insane and the text based combat isn't a bother at all (for me at least). However, this game is not without some serious drawbacks, so be wary if you purchase it. For starters there is absolutely no hand holding whatsoever and the lack of a tutorial can obviously be frusturating as many things aren't very clear, but once you start understanding the mechanics of the game it becomes much more fun. My biggest quarrel is with the resolution. I hate how you can't alter it with ease! I would love a way for me to make the game adjustable to multiple different resolutions and a fullscreen mode. This review may seem to contain a lot more negativity than positive information in the review, but I still would definitely give this game a positive review because of it's amazing potential and cool content that already exists! (I would wait for a sale like I did because in the current state I don't think this is a twenty dollar game, but it easily could be with a proper tutorial and if given some attention to the resolution issues)","June 5","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
