I think a part of me always roots for obscure underdogs and amateurs looking for big breaks -- I'm that kind of person too. I'm inclined to give those people a shot like I would want others to.\n\nSo this a puzzle adventure game for kids, it'll give an adult about an hour of enjoyment. The draw is admittedly, not the gameplay, but the cute artwork and innocent storyline. It opens up with a surprisingly well-rendered intro with some pretty good character modeling. It's a cute story about a kid who gets trapped in some magical world, and befriends a sphinx. They go on adventures in different parts of the world. The sphinx character is absolutely cute, I can't imagine any kid not being charmed by it. Much of the other character art really is very nice and clean. I like that the game has themes about assertiveness and sticking up for oneself, not just about being nice. If I was a parent I wouldn't have any issues with the themes.\n\nThe puzzles themselves unfortunately lack good implementation. A lot of the issues could be solved by using a grid, the pixel-based movement (if that's the word for it) is really more than you need and makes things feel a little janky. There are only five puzzles, and only one of them is what I'd consider a real "puzzle". It's where you rearrange centipede-like creatures to build a bridge, and it would be very interesting had the developers spent some time refining it. It is especially disappointing because I was initially reminded of puzzle adventure games my childhood, like Logical Journey of Zoombinis or Island of Dr. Quandry, and Escape from Puzzlegate isn't really even comparable. In a game for kids, things need to be a lot more user friendly.\n\nBut, this is $2, and that's important. Had Escape from Puzzlegate been $10, I would have thumbed it down without blinking. But it is very cute, $2 worth of cute in fact, so I'm happy with the time I've spent with it. A modest suggestion to the developer. If:\n\na) The puzzles were redone on a grid.\nb) The puzzles were made more user friendly.\nc) There was some level of replayability.\n\nthen Escape from Puzzlegate would be an absolute no-brainer. You clearly have the art skills, I would just love to see solid implementation.","October 18, 2015","true","1.0"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","1"

I mean.... very bad.\nThe music is mediocre.\nThe controls are whatever.\n\nBug wise? This game has them.\n\nWhen I put it into full screen, everytime I had to participate in a mini game, the game reverted to windowed on its own and then when I finished that segment, it would revert to full screen. When I was wandering around on a quest to find items, the screens wouldn't load properly and I'd get the same screen I had before, only now with invisible walls and the spawn point of an item would be inside a wall.\n\nThat combined with the lack of clear controls, the awful graphics and the mediocre story, I would recommend steering clear.\n\nHowever the game does work... mostly....\n\n3/10 - Steer Clear","May 7","false","4.2"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/erbkaiser/recommended/404810/","erbkaiser","Erbkaiser ♔","http://steamcommunity.com/id/erbkaiser/","4509 products in account","Very cute visual novel / puzzle game hybrid intended for kids up to 10 years old, or parents to play with them. The game has a simple story told through VN mechanics, but to proceed you must solve a few puzzles. The puzzles are nicely varied, they range from just moving the character over a static screen to find 'hidden' items to logic puzzles.\nThe game has several difficulty options, but I haven't tried to find out what this changes. Easy difficulty was enough of a challenge for the 'kid tester' I played with.\n\nThe story is told through anime-style graphics, most characters having one static sprite and one react sprite. The dialogue is not voiced, but there are short 'gasp' sound effects where appropriate.\n\nIf you're an adult looking for a challenge, skip this. But if you've got a young child and you want to share your hobby with them, this is an excellent entry. Especially given the low price point I can recommend this.","January 9","true","5.7"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

She is a real sweetheart and makes amazing games with the Renpy engine!\n\nPuzzlegate, at first glance, may not turn a lot of heads. If you take a closer look, however, you'll find that the game has more than one challenging puzzle if you don't pay close attention. The difficulty is nicely balanced, the art is colorful and cheerful, and you'll grow to love each and every character! Aside from a few overworld bugs, this game is definetely worth your time and I highly reccommend giving Escape from Puzzlegate a try!","October 14, 2015","true","1.1"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","10","14","0","1"

It's a VN with intermittent minigames/puzzles dispersed throughout. Even with a much much lower standard for gameplay, I just cannot recommend this game. The UI is pretty bad, the graphics are very subpar, and certain portions of the game are so poorly designed, it is very unintuitive on how to proceed. Small annoyances also litter the game, from discontinous movement & character look direction, a random crash and abrupt window resizing during minigames to name a few.\n\n==== Score ====At least the game didn't take too long to beat. Since there aren't too many child friendly games out there on Steam, just beware that if you buy this game, only expect your child to enjoy it.\n\nBad\n- 4/10","January 15","false","0.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's cute. But it has a major flaw: there are very few actual puzzles in this game, despite the title.\n\nThere are four areas to visit. In each area, there is a key that makes opening the door easier. The first has an extremely simple side-scroller level; the second has an extremely simple find-the-obvious-object section; the third has an extremely simple maze section. The kicker is that the fourth area, one of the few parts of the game that actually has a puzzle-ish feel to it, has controls that are way more complicated than it needs to be. So there's three easy non-puzzles and one annoyingly complicated "puzzle", which not what I would expect from the title, especially if it's for children.\n\nThe "puzzlegate" itself is a simple sliding blocks puzzle with a time limit. Collecting more keys increases the time limit. It is possible to beat the door without collecting a single key and without ever meeting your cute little brown Sphinx companion. However, the dialogue afterwards still assumes that you're friends with the Sphinx character.  Stuff like this shows that the developer didn't really flesh out the design enough.\n\nThe game's cute though.","March 2","false","4.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The characters talk for way too long at the start and the first puzzle comes up which you dont have enough time to beat.  Got bored right away. Eventually you come to some cavern thing and it gives you a list of how to play but I had no idea what was going on...   This came free with a bundle pack I picked up.  If you really like figureing out puzzle boards go for it but this is not really something I can recommend.","December 21, 2015","false","0.2"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"
