He peered at me with his glowing yellow eyes, echoing greed across the craven cavern. Or rather, I was cravenly, for I had been presented to Satan himself. But I held fast, knowing these might be my last words I may ever speak again.\n\n"Let's make a deal, you son of a ♥♥♥♥♥."\n\nThe devil smirked, for he had made a million handshakes over a million deals, and this one would be no different. Men had cowardly traded their souls for greed, power, women. What would be the predictable request of this one?\n\n"Speak."\n\nI gulped, for gulping was quite the only appropriate response. Hesitantly, I returned fire.\n\n"Half Life 3. You give me Half Life 3, and I give you my soul."\n\nThe lord of hellfire stroked his mangled beard. A proposition so ridiculous, there was certainly a string attached loosely, but a string Satan himself wanted to attach.\n\n"Too easy. Your soul? Please. I have billions upon billions."\n\nI recoiled, then fired back.\n\n"Then what do you have in mind?\n\nSatan once again gave his beard a tug, deep in thought. He carefully perused his mind for ideas, then rested upon one only he could conjure up. A nightmare so nightmarish that a nightmare would never hold a candle.\n\n"You will get your Half Life. I will promise that. But you will do something for me."\n\n"... Yes. Yes, what do you want?"\n\n"You will play a game that few play, a jewel lost in the desert of Steam. You will make a pilgrimage. You will play Pajama Sam. You will be afraid of the dark that shrouds the outside, you will quiver and hide in terror."\n\nI stumbled backwards, jumbling and fumbling, I could not comprehend his request. It was that of a villain, a villain who could be none other than the demon who guards the gates of Hell.\n\n"Very well, and if I don't?"\n\n"I will take your soul at this very moment, and that will be the end of it. You will never see Gordon Freeman wield a crowbar ever again."\n\n"So what, I just play this stupid game and get Half Life 3?"\n\nThe devil smirked, for tricks and turns were his finely tuned speciality.\n\n"No, it is not the mere act of playing, but the act of dedication, of concentration, of disassociated delusion."\n\nI put my foot forward, taking part no more in his babbling.\n\n"Enough riddles, demon. Explain what I must do."\n\nA long pause seperated the two for what could have been an entire eternity.\n\n"One thousand hours. You will play Pajama Sam for a thousand hours."\n\nI think he wanted to break me. I knew he wanted to break me. But I had come this far, and I would not be beat.\n\n"It's a deal,"\n\nThe fallen angel adopted an expression of absolute shock.\n\n"Excuse me?"\n\nI firmly restated my position.\n\n"It's a deal, you son of a ♥♥♥♥♥. I will put in my time. I will conquer this game again, and again, and again, a thousand agains until the time count brings you to your knees."\n\n"You're a fool."\n\n"No. You see, I'm not afraid. I won't hide."\n\n"You won't hide?"\n\n"Not when it's dark outside."","November 23, 2014","true","999.0"," 486 of 514 people (95%) found this review helpful 307 people found this review funny","95","486","514","307","42"

As a little kid, I never realized how spooky this game was until now. Darkness is probably the best boss battle I've seen, but be warned, do not play this game alone in the dark. You must have good observation skills to locate all of Sam's socks and you also make new friends along the way like Otto the boat who has a negative outlook on life and a cool accent. Try not to rage when the purple dancing couch doesn't get off your mask though. Not only is this game a spooky and fun past time, but I also learned about gysers and physics. Pajama Sam weighs less than 3 rocks so we needed 3 rocks in the opposite basket to lift Sam in his basket to get us into the house that Darkness lives in. I'm confident in physics now thanks to this game! From learning strategies like getting a slab of wood with a rope to mining gold in a much more fun way than Minecraft, this is a fun game to play, despite how scary it gets at times. 12/10 would play again.","April 18, 2014","true","3.3"," 35 of 38 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","35","38","0","1"

I could go as far to say that I could honestly hear this music playing in a Queen album, and I have said such things.\nThe art in this masterpiece was truly before it's time, with backgrounds and sprites so elegantly drawn, you could mistake them for levels in a PS4 game, and it would have to be a superb PS4 game.\n\nI honestly cannot say a single bad thing about this game, it is the portrait of perfection, just as all the other brilliant works of Humongous Entertainment, though, this one takes the cake. Pajama Sam is without a doubt, the most atmospheric, challenging, hilarious, thrilling experience you will ever face in life, you will see the face of your first-born child sleeping in your arms, and you will think "Man, I should be playing Pajama Sam right now".\nI highly suggest playing this game late in your life, because once you finish this, you will have felt every single level of every single emotion ever existed and more, nothing will ever satisfy your new-found standards after playing this love-child of beauty and genius.\n\nBuy this game.\n10/10\nBetter than The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.","May 2, 2014","true","3.2"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","21","22","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/recommended/283960/","vicrabb","Vic=HKC=","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/","1793 products in account","Sam is a little boy fan of a super-hero. However, tonight, it's the first time he'll sleep without the light. He really wants to do it but he's afraid of Darkness, a evil enemy. So, he turns into Pajama Sam, a super-hero and is resolved to capture his nemesis so that he can sleep without fear....\n\nPajama Sam: No Need to Hide When It's Dark Outside is a game aimed at children: it's a point-&-click adventure, with minigames in it, though they're not all needed to advance. The story can also speak for the little ones: it's showing Sam willing to sleep without light and getting over his fears. Kids can relate to him.\n\nBut to manage to do so, Sam is living an extraordinary adventure: he looses his flashlight, lunchbox and mask because trees are stealing them and before confronting Darkness, he needs to find them and retrieve them. Sam will have to show for example to Otto the boat that wood is floating, to oil the wheels of the wagon, etc..\n\nWhat I realized is that the game is random: indeed, you have each time two possible locations for the items and so, a different solution for them (for example, the mask was with the carrot, I had to free the carrots in the fridge to get it - however, the mask would have been in the dance room, I would have made an invisibility potion). And I also liked the fact that you can choose your path in the mine. It means that you can find new locations, useful or not depending the "storyline" thrown at you. And as you're also in a quest to retrieve all socks in the game, some of them are there - be quick to click on them as Sam will not stop at them.\n\nThere is a minigame where you need to answer questions. And while one of them is tied to Darkness's domain, the others are about culture. However, I don't know if knowing how much fuel does a space shuttle need is pertinent. It's something very specific. Other questions were more general like the artist having paint Mona Lisa or the dinosaurs. There are also a Tic-Tac-Toe with crackers and cheese, a Snake-like game, a music room where you can hear several tunes, a laboratory where you can make many potions, ...\n\nWhile I found the gameplay nice, Pajama Sam is also a testimony of its era: the '90. Indeed, in educational games or in children games, you tend to throw a lot of information. Big Thinkers, from the same developers/publishers, if you remember my review, were also full of items you can click and look at a special animation. Many easter eggs are also included: you can find Freddi Fish and Luther, Putt-Putt and Pep, characters from the same house.\n\nAnother thing is a testimony of the '90: the graphics themselves. However, contrary to Big Thinkers, Pajama Sam seems to have less aged. The soundtrack is also good.\n\nThe good surprise was the fact that the game is in French (and support other languages). It means that children will not need adults to translate or help them understand a foreign word. While the adults are still needed for anything else, it's a burden in less for them, particulary if they're not fluent at all with English.\n\nBut there is a little problem too: the inventory is showing itself by putting the cursor at the bottom of the screen. It's how you can find the menu too. There is no main menu, no tutorial about the keys to use, etc.. I had to search in a forum how to save, after having to exit the game and come back later - no progress was saved. I don't know if I was expecting it to be saved as in Big Thinkers but the lack of a profile was my first clue to that. So if you need to save and load, press S and L. It's apparently something related to the system used so that the game can run on recent machines.\n\nPajama Sam is really a good little moment for both children and adults. It may also be an help to get over fears. If I look into the second title, it's about thunders, so, I suppose that Pajama Sam was conceived to help children understand that some of their fears can be conquered. Anyway, if you search for a good children games, Pajama Sam should be considered to be in your list.","June 2","true","1.9"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

My solution to this was pulling the covers over my head and sleeping with the lights on, but I suppose I didn't have a surreal world living in my closet like Pajama Sam so I couldn't very well head out and attempt to capture darkness in my lunchbox.\n\nPajama Sam: No Need to Hide When It's Dark Outside is the blanket garbed, flashlight wielding protagonist's debut and one of the few Humongous games I never got a chance to play as a kid. And that's a bit of a shame as it might possibly be the best written, most logical and entertaining series the studio put out in their edutainment boom.\n\nCharacters are lively and over the top, with clever writing and a lighthearted sense of humor that makes them delightful to interact with. The twisting art is somewhere between a haunted house and an Escher painting and still looks fantastic even with the original low resolution, clearly distinguishing between items you can pickup and packing a lot of charming little touches into almost every nook and cranny.\n\nThis certainly isn't the most challenging (or possessing any challenge whatsoever for that matter), but its simple puzzles are no less fun to solve and helping Sam and his friends overcome their feels is all kinds of heartwarming. Perhaps I'm simply biased toward all of Humongous's catalog, even those I never played, but whatever the case the hour or so I spent with NNtHWIDO (oof, that's some acronym) was a rather surprisingly entertaining bit of breezy adventure gaming, and I'm now eager to see what Sam's future endeavors have to offer.","January 3, 2015","true","1.4"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","13","19","2","0"

The plot is based on a comic that the main character, Pajama Sam, reads. He is on a mission to venture into his closet and defeat darkness so he won't have to be afraid of the dark anymore. You mainly click around to go to different screens and explore. You can talk to other characters, pick up items, and click on various parts of the environments as well for reactions or clues. And key locations of items are changed between playthroughs, giving it a few different ways to play. There's a lot of voicework in the game, with many characters having multiple dialogues for continued clicks. There's also a good amound of music and lots of sound effects to help go along with the colorful, cartoon style. You'll need to use a bit of problem solving for getting items and figuring out where to use them. There are even a few minigames to try out. Plus, there's a side quest for the more adventurous players to try and collect 10 pairs of socks. The socks are hidden throughout the game so you'll have 20 to try and spot as you search the screens of the game. It's a nice little touch for some extra challenge. Oh, and some of the humor is actually pretty good.\n\nHowever, there are problems with this game. While there are many things to click on in any given location, a majority of them are simply there as goofy asides. There are typically a variety of different reactions for each item, but all they do is distract you from the main game. They don't really add much atmosphere, instead generally being there to keep kids entertained. It makes sense, sure, but it's not really something I'd call good game design, regardless of the target audience. There are even a few parts that don't have any real point to them, depending on which random set of circumstances the game gives you on your playthrough. Sometimes areas will have things to interact with but no reason to do so. Not that the extra bits aren't nice for a little more world there, or possibly an area to house a sock or two, but they don't feel necessary enough to include without looking at it as padding just a little bit. There also doesn't seem to be much reason to get all the socks. Not that there NEEDS to be a reward, and possibly there is as I missed a few, but it seems like the game just ends and doesn't really give you much incentive to go get them other than just wanting to do it for yourself.\n\nOverall, it's a surprisingly solid game. I just randomly won it in a giveaway and figured it was going to be some lame kids' game. It actually isn't too bad. It could do more, do some things better, and be more challenging... but I understand its for kids that would probably spend more time figuring it out as it is. I didn't grow up with this game. I'm not blinded by nostalgia. I just thought it was genuinely a nice little experience. My only gripe is that it costs 7 bucks. That's a bit steep for this game, unless you're actually getting it for a kid. If you're getting it to check it out and you're not a kid, especially considering it's on Steam, then you're better off waiting for a sale to get it for only a few bucks. I wouldn't say it's worth full price, but if you're curious, it IS worth checking out. Pajama Sam: No Need to Hide When It's Dark Outside gets a 6 out of 10 for being an older game for kids that has held up over the years, even without the nostalgia.","April 22, 2015","true","2.0"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

The level design is unique and creative, the puzzles are simple but no hand holding and it may be a children's game, but it's really easy to get into and find yourself smiling with glee when you finally figure it all out and finish the game.

The content is humorous, the world is filled to brim with imagination, and the story will certainly entertain.\n\nThat aside, the only difference I noticed in this version compared to the CD release was the addition of subtitles. I think the subtitles were added because the audio is unusually poor for the dialogue, but it's certainly still understandable (though the subtitles are poorly implemented). It has a bit of a static background to it. You can also pause the game entirely with the Spacebar.\n\nThat aside, this game is perfect for the nostalgia factor, or for a young child.","April 18, 2014","true","4.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

This game is a point and click game set in an intriguing enviroment. You can interect with most of the enviroment, even the things that are not needed to complete the game. An interesting feature is that the game will change a little the next time you play it. The changes are not huge though but enough to have you play the game multiple times. An example of one of the changes is being able to acess a room that was blocked off before. In this way you will be given new puzzles that were not present in the previous playthough. It is things like this that make this game great. The game isn't super long but its replay value makes up for it. The story is good enough albeit peculiar, Sam is scared of the dark and tries to capture it. I really enjoyed the ending but I don't want to spoil it for you. The game is great for all ages(especially kids) and I highly recommend it.","April 14","true","37.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

This game can change your life, your lifestyle, your friends and even more! If even a terrorist plays this game, he might will be thinking: "Holy Allah! It was lied to me to fear darkness! Thank you Pajama Sam! *Boom.*\nI thought that the darkness would violate me at night, but with this game, i fought against this fear! I've beaten it, just because it black (Just American Style!)\n\nBut now to be serious: I pooped in my pants. It was scarier than Slender, or even more than Amnesia!\nAfter all, after playing this game and beating the fear to darkness, i sadly was not able to find all socks! I was in rage! Over 9000 people died, after all i screamed "RAHHHHHHHHHHH!" with a poop-laser coming out of my nose. It was a huge mess! Might it was not my fault, but this game even can make you traumatized of everything you did in your life. I don't know.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty funny compared to Grand Theft Auto 5.  The characterdesign of The Last of Us is nothing compared to the character "Otto the Boat"! I love you Otto. #BrosB5Hoes (because 5 is higher than 4.)\n\nThe graphics of this game is pretty fascinating! Even Leonardo Da Vinci's art is nothing compared to the draw-style of this amazing game.\n\nGot to love the 480x640 Resolution and the 30 Frames-Per-Second. That's so Next-Gen!\n\n\n\n[Please do not take this Review seriously. It is just meant for a joke, and i don't want to make any racist jokes, or what so ever. All in one, i can prefer this game... It is funny to play with friends. Doesn't take long to accomplish and has a nice gag in it.

And funny seeing as how this kid is a fan of some comic book hero who goes around fighting crime, in his pajamas. As story wise, it's the classic, overcoming your fear of the darkness story. Sam, or Pajama Sam as he calls himself, travels to the Land of Darkness only to loose his stuff that he needs to fight Darkness. Now he needs to find them with the help of a western minecart named The King and a peter lory sounding boat named Auto. It was fun going back to this, everything is how I remembered. I only had one problem where I clicked on somthing and the animation wouldn't stop and I was stuck so I had to reset, too bad there ain't no save feature but then again it's a short game. So yeah, I was happy in seeing this game on Steam and was able to re-live part of my childhood, clicking on almost everything to make weird stuff happen, collecting socks, solving puzzles and of course a good ol fashion game of Cheese and Crackers.","February 14, 2015","true","3.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Just like I remember it, the game is an excellent point-and-click adventure, one that you can play over and over thanks to the main 3 items randomly changing locations. I always loved this feature, because every time you start anew, you have to solve different puzzles to beat the game, rewarding each replay with variety. Sure, I hold this game on the nostalgic pedestal a bit, but not without good reason.\nNow about the Steam version: I'm a bit disappointed. I've ran my original copy in the Scumm engine before and reached the same performance differences here: voice dialogue loads faster then normal, so characters talking in cutscenes sound like they don't take a break to breathe and just go into the next sentence. Here and there I see animations changed or cut out altogether, particularly during the intro dialogue with King where he says "Loop-de-Loops" and his face doesn't move. The game is still fully playable, but these emulation problems still got to me. It would be unreasonable to recommend getting an original copy and seeing for yourself, as this game was designed for Windows '95 and the like; the game would most certainly not work without a virtual machine. Even still, if you remember this game, played it or not, this purchase it still worth it.","October 31, 2015","true","0.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

I never had the chance to play this game as a kid, but I would of loved it had I actually did. The game was made by Humongous Entertainment, a company known for their educational/family oriented computer games. The plot is simple: a boy named Sam is afraid about sleeping in his own room with the lights out but instead of fearing it, he decides to overcome his fear by "defeating" Darkness as "Pajama Sam". He travels to his closet when he "visits" Closet Land to find Darkness. The characters are very lively and there's never a dull moment within the game. Plus Sam is voiced by the talented Pamela Adlon(Dewey from Quack Pack, Lucky from 101 Dalmations TV series, Ket from Kiki's Delivery Service, & Jue and Manabu from Animatrix). The Closet Land is a cross between The lands of Living Island, Oz, & Wonderland where anything can come to life just by clicking on it. There's also some mini games that will keep you busy for a few hours. Overrall Pajama Sam is a wonderful game for any kid to play as well as those who are young at heart.","March 23, 2015","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

He is trying to conquer his fear of darkness and defeat the physical representation of him with his special flashlight and lunchbox, but trees steal them almost as soon as you enter the closet. You must find your lunchbox and flashlight, help a boat conquer his fear of water, help a minecart get unrusted, collect as many sockas as you can, and play some cheese and crackers along the way.\n\nThis game also changes up its world a lot in each playthrough, objects may be in different places and different problems may need to be solved, making for great replay value.\n\nClick on everything you can for bizarre things to happen...\n\nNote:\nthis game is relatively low in difficulty as it is designed for those of young age, so don't be so surprised if you find yourslef finishing this game very quickly.","April 24, 2014","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

I never had the chance to play this game as a kid, but I would of loved it had I actually did. The game was made by Humongous Entertainment, a company known for their educational/family oriented computer games. The plot is simple: a boy named Sam is afraid about sleeping in his own room with the lights out but instead of fearing it, he decides to overcome his fear by "defeating" Darkness as "Pajama Sam". He travels to his closet when he "visits" Closet Land to find Darkness. The characters are very lively and there's never a dull moment within the game. Plus Sam is voiced by the talented Pamela Adlon(Dewey from Quack Pack, Lucky from 101 Dalmations TV series, Ket from Kiki's Delivery Service, & Jue and Manabu from Animatrix). The Closet Land is a cross between The lands of Living Island, Oz, & Wonderland where anything can come to life just by clicking on it. There's also some mini games that will keep you busy for a few hours. Overrall Pajama Sam is a wonderful game for any kid to play as well as those who are young at heart.","March 23, 2015","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This point-and-click adventure is filled to the brim with things to point and click at, putting all other PC games to shame with their comparitively low levels of point-and-click content. Naturally, I can't talk about this game without bringing up its incredible story: the amount of effort Humongous Entertainment put into this story, starring a happy-go-lucky child confronting his deepest fears, should be enough to earn the company a Nobel Prize in literature. With its brilliant cast of characters - including an anarchist carrot, pseudo-intellectual trees and a boat who doesn't understand his true purpose in life - this game is sure to contain at least one character that any player can relate to. With its combination of unique storytelling, complex gameplay and mature themes, I can say with conviction that no gamer's life is complete if they haven't played this first installment in the Pajama Sam series.\n\nAnd if that isn't enough to convince you, let me just summarize my previous statements with this: 10/10 WOULD PLAY AGAIN.","June 19, 2015","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sharuun/recommended/283960/","sharuun","No More Please","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sharuun/","205 products in account","People who have seen me tear games like Borderlands and Republic Commando to shreds (games with larger fanbases), might be expecting me to do the same to a much smaller game that no one really remembers, but as far as personality, good game design, and storytelling go- Pajama Sam is one of the better examples out there.\n\nI know what you're thinking. "Dude? For real? You're favorite games are The Last of Us and Spec Ops: The Line! Those games are INTENSE! And you're suggesting a kid's educational game from the 90's belongs up at the top of the list with some of the greatest games ever?"\n\nIn my opinion? Yeah.\n\nSee, Pajama Sam was a game DESIGNED for kids, but the developers had enough mind to add enough humor that only adults would get. I'm not saying there are any sex jokes, and there aren't, but there are plenty of jokes that I know would go over most kids' heads. The game is also much more maturely designed. Of all of the Humongous Games, you mainly are told specifically what to do (Spy Fox, Freddi Fish), or you meet completely foolish characters that tell you what they need but are more than capable of getting the job done themselves (Putt Putt). But Pajama Sam did something different... it plays with empathy. Think about it. You run into situations, and mainly Sam reacts to the situation or you- the player- does. Otto can't go out on the river, just as he can't move along the land since he's a boat. The King can't move because he's rusted to the track. For the few seconds you speak with each character, you feel sorry for their problems (mainly Otto's stupidity) and solve them yourself.\n\nThe game also does incredibly well with it's design. The artwork is beautiful to look at, and the way each frame is shot to emphasize different perspectives and imply you can move in different directions makes the game very clear and concise. It's not like some point-and-click games where you stumbled across a door fifteen times and didn't notice it till you looked up the FAQ on the game. And, yes, the game is simple. It is easy. But, like I once told my ex, it doesn't have to be hard to be good. The voice acting is decent. as are all the sound effects, and the music is very ambient and creates a lively atmosphere.\n\nThe game revolves around a large puzzle for one of your three lost items, and each item has two randomly-selected puzzles that can be mixed and matched any which was, creating a lot of different "games" for you to play through. Of course, I got each different puzzle for the missing items after playing three times. But with this, and the 20 missing socks you can find, Pajama Sam could take up roughly 2-3 hours for you to play in its entirety, where you can take 40 minutes of your day to sit down and relax to the Land of Darkness.\n\nPajama Sam may not look like much, but of all the old point-and-click games I've played as a child, this one certainly has a lot more substance to it. There were the second and third official ones (we don't talk about the fourth), but the first one really got a strong identity for the character of Pajama Sam and his world of imagination. It's no masterpiece, and I'll never try to sell it like it is, but it is really, really, really good. It's a lot better than a lot of games I've played out there. Granted, it may not be for everyone, but it still is worth checking out for anyone looking for a very unique video game.","November 9, 2015","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you want to relive some of the Humongus games again for nostalgia reasons, I would recommed it starting with this one.","November 1, 2015","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sharuun/recommended/283960/","sharuun","No More Please","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sharuun/","205 products in account","People who have seen me tear games like Borderlands and Republic Commando to shreds (games with larger fanbases), might be expecting me to do the same to a much smaller game that no one really remembers, but as far as personality, good game design, and storytelling go- Pajama Sam is one of the better examples out there.\n\nI know what you're thinking. "Dude? For real? You're favorite games are The Last of Us and Spec Ops: The Line! Those games are INTENSE! And you're suggesting a kid's educational game from the 90's belongs up at the top of the list with some of the greatest games ever?"\n\nIn my opinion? Yeah.\n\nSee, Pajama Sam was a game DESIGNED for kids, but the developers had enough mind to add enough humor that only adults would get. I'm not saying there are any sex jokes, and there aren't, but there are plenty of jokes that I know would go over most kids' heads. The game is also much more maturely designed. Of all of the Humongous Games, you mainly are told specifically what to do (Spy Fox, Freddi Fish), or you meet completely foolish characters that tell you what they need but are more than capable of getting the job done themselves (Putt Putt). But Pajama Sam did something different... it plays with empathy. Think about it. You run into situations, and mainly Sam reacts to the situation or you- the player- does. Otto can't go out on the river, just as he can't move along the land since he's a boat. The King can't move because he's rusted to the track. For the few seconds you speak with each character, you feel sorry for their problems (mainly Otto's stupidity) and solve them yourself.\n\nThe game also does incredibly well with it's design. The artwork is beautiful to look at, and the way each frame is shot to emphasize different perspectives and imply you can move in different directions makes the game very clear and concise. It's not like some point-and-click games where you stumbled across a door fifteen times and didn't notice it till you looked up the FAQ on the game. And, yes, the game is simple. It is easy. But, like I once told my ex, it doesn't have to be hard to be good. The voice acting is decent. as are all the sound effects, and the music is very ambient and creates a lively atmosphere.\n\nThe game revolves around a large puzzle for one of your three lost items, and each item has two randomly-selected puzzles that can be mixed and matched any which was, creating a lot of different "games" for you to play through. Of course, I got each different puzzle for the missing items after playing three times. But with this, and the 20 missing socks you can find, Pajama Sam could take up roughly 2-3 hours for you to play in its entirety, where you can take 40 minutes of your day to sit down and relax to the Land of Darkness.\n\nPajama Sam may not look like much, but of all the old point-and-click games I've played as a child, this one certainly has a lot more substance to it. There were the second and third official ones (we don't talk about the fourth), but the first one really got a strong identity for the character of Pajama Sam and his world of imagination. It's no masterpiece, and I'll never try to sell it like it is, but it is really, really, really good. It's a lot better than a lot of games I've played out there. Granted, it may not be for everyone, but it still is worth checking out for anyone looking for a very unique video game.","November 9, 2015","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheRealCumCannon420/recommended/283960/","TheRealCumCannon420","snakeskin hot-pants","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheRealCumCannon420/","22 products in account","Story: One of the most well known aspects of Pajama Sam is it's story; it is simply unorthodox, as it does the process of not feeding all of the story the viewer; it drip-feeds it, giving the viewer only half the story, or sometimes giving scenes without any context. For some games, this would be a disaster waiting to happen, but in the case of Pajama Sam, this is done almost consistently masterfully, holding back information on such subjects such as the location of the flashlight or what color an orange is. Many have critisized the holding of frames later in the series, but taken into the context of the fact they were running out of money to make the game, is is understandable.\n\nFor many fans, their major criticism of the game is the handling of the ending, which many consider far too 'out there' and simply crap. I too, am not a huge fan of the ending, but taking the ending to the game, inside the context of the 'true' ending sequel, Pajama Sam 3: You are what you Eat from your Head to your Feet, the ending can make a lot more sense, and thus I enjoy it far, far more. To stop me from ranting on for ages, Pajama Sam's story is a master stroke in writing, one which has been a hard feat to replicate.\n\nArt and Sound: I was introduced to Pajama Sam through the in-progress tetraology of games, The Rebuild of Pajama Sam; due to this, I became used to the cutting edge graphics employed for the higher-budget games. And to be honest, yes, the original game's art is beginning to show it's age 20 years on; however, this does not detract from the series in any major capcity, as the art compliments the anime extremely well.\n\nThe sound is also fantastic, and a very high-point for the show. Excellent music is employed to showcase the chaos of finding your lost socks, and for darker moments such as the internal struggles of the main cast of the game. Some of Beethoven's music is featured later in the series, which coupled with the emotional impact of the scene, produces one of the most excellent scenes in video game history.\n\nCharacters: By a massive leap, the highlight of the series. Pajama Sam features in it's story the struggles of the main characters, to devastatingly wonderful effect. Weak, timid, daddy-issues Sam, to powerful, arrogant, egotistical Mom, to the quiet, mysterious Boat, and the brooding, apparently agnostical Darkness, Pajama Sam develes into the mind and motivations of these characters, showcasing exactly what makes them tick, and this is what gives us some of gaming's most regonisable and wonderful characters.\n\nI am certain entire essays have been written on why certain charcters tick, and that's another reason so many of these characters are so wonderful. Fans are so devoted to their favorite characters (personally I am partial to Mom and Boat), and this creates a wonderful feeling when learning about these characters and then discussing this with other fans. Generally, Pajama Sam employs some of the most human characters in games, showing us that the heroes of gaming aren't always strong, both mentally and physically, or not even in control of their lives.\n\nIn closing, Pajama Sam is one of the strongest games ever produced. It employs powerful characters, a deep, deep story, and art that has only just began to show it's age. What makes the show's longevity even more powerful is that even now on sites such as PJSamGeeks people are still analysing this series, trying to know everything about it. I hope Pajama Sam will live on in the hearts of it's fans, who'll continue to appreciate it's deep, metaphorical story. I hope that Pajama Sam will always remain an game that will be treasured, for all the ages.\n","April 8","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"
