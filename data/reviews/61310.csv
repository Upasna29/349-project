A fractal is a diamond of 7 tiles / cubes / gems / whatever. 2 on the left, 2 on the right, 3 in the center. How do you arrange them? You simply click an empty space on the grid or the border of the level. When you click that empty space, the spaces around it push out with whatever color gem you have next in your cue. Let's say green gem in your cue you will push out in all directions shifting all the gems in all directions 1 space over. Like pushing lines in 6 directions. You only get a certain amount of 'pushes' per level. To beat a level you need to get X amount of points. When you make a fractal, other gems appear in the level, which may lead to a chain of fractals or mess you up. Sometimes you need to think 2 or 3 moves ahead and when different colored gems get involved you need to make sure one move doesn't mess up something else you've been planning.\n\n1\n\nThe campaign won't take more than a few hours, but I can see there being replay value in the way that Tetris is replayable. While the score isn't a big focus of the game, it still gets your brain going. There's no pressure or time limit, its soothing. The puzzle mode has several continuous puzzles.\n\nEventually the game throws different kinds of tiles your way. If those special tiles are in your fractals, you will get their bonuses. Things like adding more tiles to your cue, exploding all connected tiles of the same color, pushing tiles apart from the fractal and so on. It adds a needed level of depth.\n\nLuckily there are two other modes, arcade and puzzle. Puzzle mode has you completing objectives such as making a triple fractal in X number of pushes or clearing all of the diamonds. It is a nice diversion, but hardly the meat of the game. The arcade is more of a time attack to get as many fractals in a limited amount of time. There are time tiles that will add to the clock when they're in a fractal.\n\nFractal feels like its more suited for relaxing with a touch screen and mobile devices rather than for people sitting in a chair at a computer. Its still an engaging and relaxing game for a while.","January 20, 2014","true","5.6"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","24","26","0","0"

You're simply expected to guess what they do!?  You shouldn't have to ask in the forums to find-out how a game works!?\n\nThe career mode seems designed to teach you how to play (once you figure out the power-ups) and it works upto a point, but by Level 23/24 it's descended into a horrible potluck mess of a thing. Level 24 is, imo, impossible 99% of the time - you need a very lucky layout to be able to clear it (23 isn't much better)\n\nThe game is also missing some basic features such as the ability to adjust music/sfx levels and any sort of online highscoring - this seems odd in an otherwise polished product when schoolboy designed games have this stuff?\n\nIt's all a bit disappointing really - I struggle to recommend it but I emphasise the the game at the core is a fine puzzle, it's just let down by a feeling of being half-baked and abandoned.","November 12, 2015","false","3.8"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","18","22","0","0"

Some are ridiculously easy and some are not only pretty hard, but also depend on luck - because your starting field is randomized in campaign mode, you can get everything from a 60 points head start to an unsolvable mess.\n\nThe graphical presentation is nice, but doesn't go beyong functional, really. Same goes for the Sound.\n\nThe game modes are fairly diverse, though the campaign is rather "puzzle"-y, safe for the previoulsly mentioned randomness - which can be really annoying and warrents constant restarts. The puzzles are pretty good and serve as the only "sort-of" tutorial, because a really detailed introdution is missing. The arcade mode is boiled down to frantic clicking, which becomes a bit more strategic with practice.\n\nAll in all this is a nice puzzler, with some rather annoying problems. If you're looking for a small game to play in between other things to do, this fits the bill. But it is no game to sit back and relax, because it will annoy you from time to time.\n\nRating: Only just recommendable.","December 11, 2013","true","4.6"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","10","10","2","0"

Splice single handedly made me realize that I don’t dislike puzzle games, I just can’t stand how bland and uninspired they have become.\nIt kind of saddens me to see fractal return to the mundane. The game is gorgeous, don’t get me wrong, but pushing around hexagons to make bigger hexagons and clear a board is not exactly a game changing mechanic. After only the first few levels of the “campaign” and a couple puzzle levels I was bored and back to my cynical opinions of puzzle games.\nCipher Prime is awesome and they have some great talent on their team but they gotta keep taking the risks; Fractal was a safe game and it shows in it’s stale gameplay.","March 5, 2015","false","0.5"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

Played much more than it's simple design should warrant for.\n\nAnnoying in the beginning as you can't quite get into the flow of making blooms. (fill up blobs of 7 to make a 'block' which make them dissapear). Also just when the game starts to feel stale they introduce bombs, lightning and suddenly you start getting chains.\n\nCampaign game is nice as it introduces new elements slowly.

It runs excellently in full HD resolution on the highest graphics settings despite my machine's very limited processing and graphics memory. In addition to the sheer quality, unique little doodles on each campaign level add a little something extra.\n\nUnfortunately, these doodles tend to be the extent of the in-game instructionals. If you're like me, and prefer to learn to play a game by playing it instead of reading through a manual, it will take you some time to get acquainted with the mechanics. The addition of late-game mechanics hinders game progress, as I tended to die (and be forced to restart the level at a low point value, or replay the campaign from the beginning) several times before grasping the intricacies of utilizing new powerups.\n\nAlso disappointing was the soundtrack: the game devs heavily push the soundtrack on the store page, insisting that it's ever-changing depending on how well you play. This simply isn't the case. It's the same soundtrack every single time, with slight changes in tempo if you really start to suck.\n\nHowever, the addictive gameplay mechanics more than make up for Fratal's failings.

No, the game isn't that hard to figure out, but ask me what the power-ups do and I honestly couldn't tell you. Most of the times I just try to connect them with the other tiles, obviously, and it triggers several combos. It usually takes several tries to finish a level. A tutorial is A MUST.\nAnother thing that bothered me is that if I notice things aren't going my way, I normally ike to retry a level. There's no button for this. There's only a pause button. So in the end I have to click up to 20-30 times in order to restart a level. This definitely needs to be implemented.\nAlso, the text is a bit blurry, even on extremely high quality. If the developer can fix it, it will look smashing. I like the slowmotion endings, they look really cool.\nNow, would I recommend this game ? Yes and no. If none of my complaints is fixed, then no.

For my personal taste, it was too simplistic.  The game itself is not difficult to grasp, but becomes complex quickly.  Basically, you have to "push" a row of tiles over a grid in order to create "fractals" which are worth points.  Once you earn a certain number of points you can progress to a new grid where you will have to make more fractal combos/larger fractals in order to get enough points.  It's a neat idea for a puzzle game, but if you're looking for something bright and engaging, this may not be the puzzler for you.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kiyura/recommended/61310/","kiyura","kiyura","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kiyura/","305 products in account","I really wanted to like this game but it is really just not that engaging. It strikes a really odd blend between a fast-paced arcade puzzle game and a deeper mind game, but not in a fun or satisfying way at all.\n\nThe first few levels set you up with easy, single-color "puzzles" that are a thin excuse to blast away some pieces into beautiful, Tony Hawk-like combos. So far so good! I'm getting ready for the game to ramp up into a big cluster♥♥♥♥ of hard but super explosive and rewarding action.\n\nNope. You get through about a handful of levels before it quickly fizzles into a large and very tedious puzzler. I will admit that it is intricate - perhaps I simply lack the tens of hours of investment needed to really enjoy the game - but all it really was to me was a big turnoff. The patterns are simply too large and convoluted to make sense of intuitively, very early in the game, and having to deal with different colors that interfere with each other makes every single move a punishment. The tantalizing but undelivered promise of explodey-comboey arcade action only makes it more frustrating.\n\nDon't expect this game to be what it appears to be from previews but if you enjoy very intricate games like Sudoku, Kakuro, maybe Go, and you don't mind spending quite a while to either pore over a single puzzle or learn all the pattern-matching you'd need to play this game somewhat fast, go for it.","January 4","false","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/notsue/recommended/61310/","notsue","I'm Not Sue","http://steamcommunity.com/id/notsue/","465 products in account","This game is alright, but it's got a -serious- case of "trying too hard to be cool."\n\nThe game basically has you using hex-based block matching to score points, with the 'campaign' as tutorial-become-challenge mode of sorts.  I'm not the best at hex matching, and that's alright, the game is fine anyway, but the stylization in the messages you get for making matches of various sizes are just really silly.  How is a certain pattern of hex-matching 'Old School!'?  Why does the game tell me to 'Do that again!' when I match some small cluster that was in no way creative or highscoring?  If seeing 'AAAaaaAAaaAAaAAAaaa!!!" flash across my screen is supposed to make the player feel accomplished... well... you get the picture.  These messages come seemingly unscaled to the level of match made, and thus lack context in addition to being eye-rolling.\n\nThere's a few UI bugs, otherwise fine.  No multiplayer mode, which is unfortunate and hurts replayability.","April 19, 2012","false","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
