The game would benefit if it was just a pure top down 2D game instead of using its ugly 3D isometric view.\n\nOtherwise for 2 quarters might be worth looking into if the base gameplay sounds at all appealing to you.","March 16, 2015","true","0.1"," 38 of 43 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","38","43","0","1"

This game wasmade back when 640x480 was still a thing and 3D was cool (and it would have been ugly even then); today, anyone would whip this up in 2D in Flash and make it actually playable and enjoyable and nice to look at.\nIn the big lottery that is the bargain bin, this game's a dud. Don't waste your money.","November 26, 2014","false","0.3"," 37 of 50 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","37","50","2","0"

No.\n\nThe options are lacking, the controls cannot be redefined ingame, and the whole package feels like something put together in the 90s (including a restriction to a limited number of 4:3 resolutions). There are other $5 games that literally give you more.\n\nHowever, a purchase when on sale may not be a bad idea. The central premise (what if pacman was a wizard/priest/whatever?) does result in some interesting gameplay past the boring early levels. In fact, the game outright challenged my skillz:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxw63MuEfG8\n\nFor a look at the early levels and a different opinion, here's Jim Sterling's take:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0BoYt6Kzl8","September 22, 2014","true","0.6"," 26 of 53 people (49%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","49","26","53","0","0"
