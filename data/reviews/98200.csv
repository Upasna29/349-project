The rules are really basic, but since the whole game is about predicting opponent's moves, and you can never, never know for sure what another human being is thinking, and that's why it shines in multiplayer more than anything else, even though it has a lenghty and worthy campaign.\nMultiplayer is really versatile too, since you can just leave your turn and play another match (or even another game altogether) while you wait your opponent's; you can even set the game to send you an email when a new turn is awaiting you.\nAlso, is worth nothing that replay of your matches are automatically saved on the servers, and you can watch even other's really easily; and there's an amazing little option that uploads your matches to your YouTube channel.\nGraphics are really simple, but they do their job, and the soundtrack is astonishing good.\n\nJust try the demo and complete the tutorial, you'll get an idea if this is or not a game for you, you could be surprised.","November 25, 2013","true","264.8"," 121 of 159 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","121","159","0","0"

The game is not for anyone - that can be said about any game out there. But in this case what I mean is that unlike other games where you just rush and kill everything in sight, in Frozen Synapse you must take a slower and more tactical approach. You are in command of a squad of soldiers, each equipped with different weapons, from shotguns through sniper rifles all the way to rocket launchers. The game has a good tutorial which can make a person understand the basic and more advanced tactics - from the standard take cover tactics to the more advanced search and destroy where each member of the squad covers the blind spot of the other and thus advance in their search for the enemies. Afterwards people can chose whether they want to advance to the campaign, practice against the computer in skirmish matches or go online against other people around the world. This is a game which would be more suited to the gamers which favor brains and strategy over the standard gamers which know only how to react and rely on reflexes while gaming ...

I bought a multipack ages ago, and remember eyeing it with great interest before release. Finally got around to playing it, and being turn based, it can suck the hours away.\n\nOne of the major hooks is that you can simulate the actions you think the enemy will take before you complete your turn. This allows you test a bunch of potential outcomes in advance, and it ratches the tension up tenfold.\n\nThere are loads of features built into the client: a chat service (communicate with your opponents without needing Friends list functionality), piles of multiplayer modes, a built in IRC client so you can discuss strategies or find new opponents... There's play-by-email functionality, hotseat (aka pass the keyboard) multiplayer, full coop for the campaign, and I don't think I've even mentioned the DLC yet!\n\nAdd all that goodness on top of one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard and a cyberpunk inflected premise and story, and you've got a winner.

In game matches, each player is given several soldiers and has to complete a certain objective, like getting to a certain location or killling the enemy's units.  Players then give orders to their units to try to outmaneuver their opponent.  Every plan can be tested ahead of time and will always play out the same way; there is no luck or randomness in the combat.  After both players confirm their moves, soldiers on both sides will execute their commands.  The entire game is about predicting the moves of your opponents and trying to counter them.  It also has great music and a pretty good single player campaign (although the multiplayer is much more enjoyable IMO).

Its simplicity.\n\nFrozen Synapse takes the turn-based strategy game genre to an extreme level of meticulousness. This is saying something in a genre that already resembles something like chess with more rules.\n\nI am a long-time fan of turn-based strategy games, with the X-Com iterations holding a special place in my heart (well just the first two and the remake actually), so I am no stranger to intricate control over characters and exhaustive planning for each turn. However, there are two questions that must be answered in the affirmative for any TBS game to be considered "good":\nFirst, are the controls efficient?\nSecond, is the game fun?\n\nUnfortunately, Frozen Synapse fails on both accounts. The painstaking level of control over every minute movement of your troops is maddening and superfluous. You are the most anal-retentive military commander in all of history, and while the game provides a reasonable explanation for it, your troops are apparently mindless drones. Simply adding more controls over every little movement does not make a TBS game superior to others. Extraneous controls weaken a strategy game's enjoyability by obstructing its very purpose: strategy. Very often, you will find yourself losing rounds/games because you forgot to set a drone to look in a specific direction or to duck at the right moment, or walk quickly/slowly. Not because you didn't realize that those moves were necessary, no, because you FORGOT. There are so many options to set for each individual unit, that you can easily spend an hour just setting up a SINGLE TURN. I am not exaggerating, the multiplayer gives opponents a week to post their turn! This kind of burdening complexity removes the players ability to strategize and gives advantage to the player who is most able to memorize details. Strategy is about out-thinking your opponent's moves and countering them, or recovering from a weaker position with superior tactics, NOT micro-managing the user-interface.\n\nSo is it fun? Well, Frozen Synapse insists on you monitoring every sniffle and cough your troops make, so the majority of the time playing this game is spent staring at a screen of unmoving drones and identical walls, running simulation after simulation to determine the highest likely method of success. It would be just as fun to compare tax audits to determine which IRS agent was the most efficient!\n\nSpeaking of identical walls, the graphical quality of this game is terrible. I have never before claimed to need high quality graphics in a game, in fact in many ways the fight for ever greater graphics is ruining the industry, but if ever there was a game that needed better graphical design: this is it. The neon colors that honestly looked cool in the trailers and screencaps are horrendous to look at after only ten hours or so of gameplay. Every character looks the same, every wall is identical, you are a robot commander of a robot army killing other robots for no reason whatsoever.\n\nSome of the positive reviews said the game was "easy to get into, but hard to master," and this is an outright lie. This game is hard to get into and hard to master. I will say it again: strategy games require simple controls so the only thing between you and victory is your tactics. Not fun.","August 18, 2014","false","2.8"," 106 of 171 people (62%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","62","106","171","6","38"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/98200/","atratzu","Atratzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/","180 products in account","-Quick Review-\nFrozen Synapse is a turn based strategy game where you utilize several different types of units to execute a variety of commands. Combat mechanics are based on: Direction, movement, cover, and weapon speed.\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory:  I have yet to figure out what type of creature I am… in the campaign mode, I’m under the impression that I’m an artificial intelligence named “Tactics”, whoever had the bright idea of making me an AI apparently need to be shot in the foot, because I proceeded to fail the next ten attempts at the campaign.\nThe campaign has a total of 55 missions, this game’s appeal is in its competitive aspect, think of this game as a “modern” chess game, although the objectives can be changed from simply “capture the king” to, capture the flag, team elimination, etc.\n\nGame Play: There are five basic units in the game: Machine Gun, Shotgun, Sniper, Grenade Launcher, and Rocket Launcher. Each have different abilities, for example the shot gunner can run fast and does is the fastest at weapon draw, while the Sniper is slow to shoot, but can shoot from almost across the whole map and moves very slowly.\nAs you get into the game the different units make more sense and you start to learn how to implement them accordingly. I practiced against the computer on campaign… which admittedly felt like bashing my face against a brick wall, but eventually strategies started to stick.\n\nAchievements: There are 16 achievements for this game, one of those achievements requires beating a player named “bin” who is apparently no longer playing… Ergo, this achievement is broken in my book. The rest of the achievements are very straight forward and require either winning a game mode, or doing something specific in the game.\nThe two hardest achievements are probably “get to level 100” and “Beat the campaign”. Hardest might be the wrong term though, maybe “the most time consuming”? Regardless, there is a fair amount of activity in this game if you’re going after achievements.\n\nPrice: Frozen Synapse commonly goes on steam sales, so that is when I would suggest purchasing the game, at the time that I’m writing this review the game is actually 88% off for the next 43 hours. At the standard price of $24.99 that’s probably too high of a price for a strategy game like Frozen Synapse for most people, you can easily pump 20-40 hours into the game… again; if you already know you like strategy games and enjoy learning new ones.\n\nConclusion: Again to recap: the story/campaign wasn’t particularly intersecting for me, the game play is very precise (a requirement for strategy games), achievements are “meh”, the price is high unless on sale.\nI’ve enjoyed playing this game, I would suggest it to people who *already know* they like strategy games. When you first jump into this game it’s definitely daunting to comprehend what’s going on. The game itself tries to help with a lack luster tutorial, but in the end it doesn’t prepare you for the cruel reality of “campaign”. (Unless you happen to be a young strategic genius, who in that case, go back to your business classes and leave my review alone.)","January 11, 2015","true","14.8"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","18","21","4","0"

This is like a top-down hybrid of Counterstrike and Chess. Looks pretty good too, and the soundtrack fits the experience really nicely. The controls could use some streamlining, perhaps, and the game would work well with controller support. My only real criticism of the game is that some people take a really long time to make their moves, although the upside is that you can have a bunch of active games at once and jump between them as your turn comes up. Definitely recommend this one to competitive gamers and tacticians looking for a game they can pick and and put down at their leisure.","April 26, 2014","true","28.3"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","16","21","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/savv/recommended/98200/","savv","Savv","http://steamcommunity.com/id/savv/","130 products in account","I love it when a plan comes together, and Frozen Synapse is my favourite turn-based game.\n\nIt’s similar to ground operations of X-COM, for example, but in a purer, simpler form. There’s no base management, inventory, RPG elements. All units of the same type have identical stats. And, unlike X-COM, RNG does not make much of an impact on outcomes of firefights, if any. The typical ‘chance to hit’ mechanic is replaced with ‘time to hit’. If enemy unit is in cover, your unit will need more time to hit him; if enemy units runs into your stationary unit, your unit will shoot first because he had a bonus to this timer, and the enemy had a penalty for running. Thus, if you can predict what your opponent is about to do, you can be 100% sure what will happen when they encounter one of your units. If.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=188303206\nThe best thing about this game is the ability to plot your opponent’s expected moves and run a simulation that will show what will happen if you do this, and they do that. You can run as many iterations of this as you like before submitting a turn.\n\nIn multiplayer FS becomes a game of psychology, misdirection, bluffs and double bluffs. You have to be able to make accurate predictions, but also behave unpredictably, be stealthy, feed misleading information to your foe. And make plans that account for every eventuality.\n\nThe maps are random and asymmetrical, but scoring takes this into account. Plus, you can use premade symmetrical maps or make your own. You can even play a flat version of cs_office if you’re so inclined.\n\nThere’s a long single player campaign with interesting missions and a cyberpunk-themed story. You can play it in coop, too. And it’s fairly hard. Only 0.6% of players have completed the campaign according to Steam achievement stats. But  two of the missions at the end are somewhat glitchy and many people may have quit just because of these.\n\nDownsides: I’m not too fond of the graphics. 3D perspective makes it hard to see whether you have line of sight sometimes, I would prefer to have a flat 2D mode. Thankfully, there’s a line of sight tool that works like a ruler. There’s no offline chat in multiplayer, which is disappointing for a game you can play via e-mail.\n\nRed DLC adds shield units (really cool) and the ability to host coop games and play single-player campaign with a friend, among other things. You can use the new features in multiplayer even if your opponent/partner doesn’t have the DLC. So I’d get the Complete Pack while it’s on −88% sale.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=184591910","January 10, 2015","true","88.5"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

There is no grand strategy here.  Just you and your (usually) outgunned squad of clones trying to take out the other guys in meticulously planned five-second turns.\n\nYou are Tactics, an incorporeal AI lifeform that specializes in one thing: enemy neutralization.  You work for a rebel faction trying to topple the megacorporation that has overtaken the cyberpunk city of Markov Geist.  The “how” of that is up to the characters in the story.  You are just there to take orders and fight their battles.  In each level you will take charge of a set of nameless robots made of meat, and use them to take out the enemy squadron, defend a VIP, or inflitrate a certain room.  Each “vatform” you can control has a certain weapon, and this will define your approach.  Shotgunners move quickly and fire quicker, but they have a short range.  Keep them out of sight until the last second when moving in for the kill.  Snipers take precious seconds to line up shots, but can instantly kill a unit they see from across the map.  Rockets move aggonizingly slowly, but blowing up walls can kill anything behind them, or open up surprise sneak-attack routes for your other units.\n\nIf this sounds like a lot to keep track of, it really isn’t.  Because you don’t control all of this in real time.  Instead, a level plays out as a series of five-second turns, where you are given all the time you need to plan the next five seconds.  You can even guess your enemies’ moves, and simulate the results until you’re sure you have every possible scenario covered.  The key thing to remember is that outcomes are never random.  Units behind cover will always kill those in the open.  A moving unit that has to stop and aim will always die to one standing still.  A shotgunner will always kill a sniper when he pops out around a corner in close range.  Knowing how to best situate your units to maximize your chances of winning encounters is critical to success.  Each turn is only five seconds, but you will spend minutes carefully plotting and checking angles.  Hitting that “Prime” button is so stressful, and there’s no going back once you commit.\n\nThe color palette is incredibly simple: the scenery is blue, your units are green, enemies are red, and target civilans are yellow.  This is how an AI who specializes in tactical combat would see the world, and it is all you need really need.  Everything else is superflous and unnecessary to the task at hand.  The level description might be a corporate lobby, but all you see is a bunch of pillars and a few hallways.  This works incredibly well to keep you occupied and focused on the action instead of the secenery.  The only graphical flourish in the game occurs when an enemy dies.  Blood will spurt everywhere and leave a bright red pool around the body for the rest of the level.  This is handy for showing you exactly where your precious unit died, and reminding you of your mistake.\n\nThe soundtrack is an electronic futuristic collection of tracks, and it is perfect music for getting lost in thought, focussing intently on your units’ every move.  The announcer calling out “Enemy Neutralized” is euphoric.  When she says “Unit Down” though, it is equally frustrating and demoralizing, because it almost always could have been prevented if you’d have throught through the situation better beforehand.\nFrozen Synapse is unforgiving at the best of times.  There is no difficulty setting, no way to make it easier.  Either you play by its rules and take advantage of the systems, learning to anticipate the most likely moves your opponent will make, or you will fail over and over again.  Progress through the campaign is often slow.  You’ll need razor-sharp focus to make it through even the middle levels where your units are heavily outmanned.  There are video tutorials, but nothing makes up for simply playing the game and mastering its quirks, one mistake at a time.\n\nThe single-player campaign is quite long; almost 30 hours worth, and the cyberpunk story is engrossing.  Mastering these systems is difficult, yet rewarding.  Turning tactical strategy into almost a puzzle game, this is a game that has a wide range of appeal.","December 13, 2015","true","25.0"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

Frozen Synapse is a true example of raw strategy and squad based tactics with an excellent soundtrack to boot.  You and your opponent is given a handful of units and a number of turns to take each other out or complete the objective.  The strategy comes from the planning phase in which you can give detailed orders to each of your units and even give simulated orders to your opponent's units to see what the possible outcome of your actions could be before accepting your turns.  Basically, it's almost like chess with guns, allowing you to take your time and really think your actions though.  It's a very deep, strategic experience for those who would rather not abandon strategy due to the pressure of hastily building up your unit spam to be more overwhelming than your opponent's, then ♥♥♥♥♥ about the Terran being overpowered.","January 4, 2012","true","19.0"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","7","8","2","1"

I couldn't have been more wrong.  My friend gifted me his bonus copy, and I have been playing it nonstop since.  It seems like a sort of real time/turn based hybrid and can seem very intimidating at first, but at its core it really is just a turn based game that rewards careful planning.  You give your soldiers orders that they then carry out over the course of a 5 second round, and you have a chance to revise the orders each round.\n\nThe controls seem complicated when you first start as well, but they are actually both remarkably simple and surprisingly powerful - you can give incredibly intricate orders to your troops with only a few clicks and drags.  The asynchronys multiplayer lets you take pretty much all the time you need for your turn, and lets you juggle multiple games if your opponent does the same.\n\nThe soundtrack is pretty killer, too.

With door kickers and all the others, this game well before, its take on the approach is much different than the games that have come out since, involving PVP in many different modes, and actually fantastic campaign, and enough depth to be sure that whenever you lose a guy you know it was your fault.\n\nWhat is it? Besides worth your time,  Synapse is what came to fruition when you take old school rainbow six on a top down format. Instead of relying on your aim, and some modest planning, it relies purely on your mind and ability to place soldiers in positions that will end in your win, or at least a stalemate.\n\nDepending on the game mode and otherwise, you typically start with 4 or 5 units, of varying classes, that all specialize in something different on one side of randomly generated maps, scattered across your designated field. You objective depending on the game mode can vary from exterminate all enemy forces while preserving as many of yours for a higher score, to securing or assasinating a hostage controlled by another human (and yes the online community is still very much alive, and with newbloods as well) to a whole sloo of other modes that I can't be bothered to describe.\n\nGameplay is what I can generalize for you, the core mechanics revolve around a system of "turns". Each turn is 5 seconds long consisting of you controlling these units by telling them what to do literally down to telling them to wait in a position for 2.4 seconds, do a quick 180, move forward two inches and then set up shop for an ambush. At the beginning of every turn and until you commit the turn you can constantly reposition not only your soliders, but the enemies, in an effort to play out what you think is likely for them to do. You can run through a turn 1000 times if you want to, setting your soldiers down differently, preparing for different enemy strategies, attempting to place soliders you may have seen a few turns ago somewhere else, accounting for every single detail, until you commit, and watch how that specific turn pans out.\n\nThe beauty of this lies in the execution of the UI, and controls. This game will live and die on your ability to access and utilize use these commands. And I'm only delighted to say that the devs delivered 10 fold on this area, easily one of the most accessible yet complex games I've played, and it all lies in the fact that you get to choose just how meticulous you are.  The formula for this goes only as far down the rabbit hole as you are willing to take it, choose your oppenent based on how much time you plan on putting into a specific game, you choose to utilize the controls whenever you need them or if you need them, or give rudimentary orders that still get the job done for most.\n\nTo end this prematurely, I've enjoyed this game to a degree I feel I don't experience more than a few times a year, I always can come back for something fresh, something new with the generated maps, and varitions on game modes. I've been wanting to write this review for quite a while just to get out suppport for a creation that I believe goes over most of my fellow gamers heads due to the graphical quality or seemingly innaccessible concept.

The plan of the other squad is executed simultaneously, and if you guessed correctly what your enemy was going to do, you'll see your soldiers shoot the enemies down. The turn-based mechanics and the need for anticipation of enemy moves actually kind of remind me of chess. The game features several game modes and a "dark" and "light" variant of each. In the dark versions you only see the enemies that your soldiers would really see, whereas in the light versions you will always see all the soldiers on the map. In the multiplayer mode you can play, for example, just one turn a day and plan each turn for half an hour, or you can finish a game in half an hour if your opponent happens to be online simultaneously.

Yes? Then this is the game for you.\n\nFrozen Synapse is an absolute wonderful tactical battlefield commander game. You are able to control several of your soldiers on a randomly generated map against either a human or AI player and lead them, showing whether they should duck or stand up, engage or continue on sight, time their actions, etc., all in hopes to out-think your opponent and guess what they will do. You are given planning phases which, although they may be lengthy, give you the chance to test every possible scenerio to your liking, giving you the ultimate think session of your life every turn.\n\nFrozen Synapse also has great co-op in it's expansion pack, which gives you the same tactical fun with a friend. I highly recommend you get it - it's called Red Mode, or something like that. Another great feature this game has is the ability to play multiple games at a time. You get popup invites from other people, which you can either accept or deny, into their games, which allows you to play however many games you want to play over any period of time you like, which leads to the bad parts  about this game.\n\nI'm not going to lie, this game isn't perfect. There's no punishing system for abandoning games, which happens a little too often with bad mannered players who don't want to finish a losing game. Not only that, but It does have two or more glitches (you can plan to move your soldier through a wall, but the game says that you can't do that, and an extra move when trying to walk beside a wall, really nothing that major or game-breaking) which can annoy you a little, but it won't consistantly happen to you.\n\nMy final verdict for Frozen Synapse is this - if you are a fan of thinking games, especially chess, GET THIS GAME IMMEDIATELY. If you are not, wait for a sale, because you very well might enjoy this game for it's easy-to-understand, but hard-to-master mechanics.

It's turn-based so you have plenty of time to plan your moves, like move, run, kneel, aim at, and so on. Once you commit, you'll likely curse as yourself for moving the wrong way, or pat yourself in the back for having anticipated your opponent and set a trap for him. You start with just rifleman and shotgunner, but later you get snipers, RPGer, grenadier, and more.

The game's still the same, shoot the other dudes before they shoot you, but skill is irrelevant and here only the best strategy will win out. Knowing where to move and predicting your opponents intentions, just as you would in any FPS, will lead you to victory.\n\nThe best thing about the game is realising that all these past experiences are immediately transferable, and finding that the interface is razor sharp, intuitive and allows you to devise tactics in exacting detail each turn.\n\nJust remember to slice that pie.","February 27, 2012","true","15.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The visuals have a cool VR aesthetic and the game uses impressive procedurally-generated maps.\n\nThere are no lifebars and no damage in Frozen Synapse, only alive and dead.  The battle system is deterministic and skill-based, movement speed and a couple other factors deciding which player makes the faster killshot.  The rules behind the killshot timer are simple, but the game never details its combat mechanics (the tutorial is a brief how-to), so new players should read the wiki to gain a better understanding.\n\nI barely played the single-player campaign as this game is all about multiplayer.  There are a number of different game modes, including a football analog where you bid on how far your squad can gain a foothold, and a mode where your team must capture and return more resources than the opposing force.\n\nMy favorite by far is Secure mode.  Each player proposes a defensive zone, and then the player proposing the largest area defends it from the other player's attack.  Secure is such an elegant blend of strategy, risk and objective it almost deserves its own game.  The procedural setup leads to wildly different plans.","May 15, 2014","true","33.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The campaign is a well scripted, addictive and interesting experience, but what shines the most is the extremely intuitive online play. Each online match is played in steps: The planning phase, and the action phase, and with the proper player - you could play a step a day, as you can pick up said match over the course of a week, rather then log in, play, quit - lose the game, etc. Unfortunately, online is relatively dead, although you can always find the rare match to test your skill. The visuals are mediocre, but fitting for the type of game it is. The OST is absolutely fantastic, and is well worth the purchase!

I highly recommend this game to anyone who thinks there isn't a hard stratergy out there anymore.\n\nFirstly, This game is just awesome and I do agree with some of my friends that this game it is hard for new players. I enjoy this game although I haven't tried Multiplayer mode I heard its balanced but I don't know how it works so I can't really talk about it expect it requires a lot of stratergy.\n\nSecondly, There are 5(6) different classes now I put (6) in because there is a hidden class:\n- Machine Gunner. (Rapid fire - Multi burst fire)\n- Shotgun. (V shaped attack cone - Medium fire rate - Short range.)\n- Sniper Rifle. (1.75-2 second aim time - Long range)\n- Rocket Launcher. (Large AoE hit radius - Can blow walls and windows up - Infinite range - try not to shoot while crouched and behind a window)\n- Granades. (Medium range - 1 shot per round)\n- Finally the hidden class of Riot Shield.(to access this class you get 1 per granader you own.(I think that's how it works) (Stops any non explosive bullets as long as he is set up and facing the fire - Has no weapondary).\n\nGameplay:\nThis game has a couple of different game modes such as:\n- Elimination (Kill all enemies and win)\n- Protect an area (Normally you have to protect an area for about 6-7 turns and you win)\n- Extraction (An AI moves towards the exit zone with 2 useless guards and you win.)\nAll game modes have a turn based time limit of 1-50 turns.\n- Normally quick games.","November 27, 2015","true","7.0"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","7","13","0","0"

The play-by-mail style multi-player is great, and I wish more games could have it as a feature. There are few things as satisfying as seeing the word OUTCOME, followed by several seconds of your little green men putting their red counterparts down in a blaze of turn-based glory.

I bought the DLC for this game. The concept for this game is great and the writing is trash but I don't care. I made several false starts at learning this game, and I'm pretty sure I finally did, but the single player has an escort mission that involves an unrealistically bad area defense against way too many opponents, and it's like the third mission. It involves specialized units, which kill the game. Shotguns can't engage anything beyond about 20 feet even if you order them to. They don't miss, they just don't fire. At the same time, an enemy shotgun on the run will beat a readied assault rifle at close range, which basically means that by the rules I can't defend with the units the scenario gave me. There are no difficulty levels to adjust this.\n\nBUY the soundtrack and not this game. You probably got it as part of a humble bundle, which is maybe what it deserved.\n\nUPDATE: This game is addictive, though. While I was writing the review, I thought, oh, but what if I move my shotguns into base to fight the enemy shotguns and use my rifle to cover my flank? That shouldn't work, because of how far away they start my shotgun unit, but it's worth trying! And it turns out that no, an unready AI shotgun beats an already-aimed player shotgun.","April 28, 2014","false","3.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The first feature advertised on the sales screen. The option to create a coop game didn't even exist in the menu system.

They were going for sarcastic AI insulting the player for being bad at the game but the humor really didn't play that well.\n* They made me create an account specifically for the game. I don't want any more logins or accounts, please just let me authenticate through Steam.\n* VS mode was extremely unbalanced.

If I lose a few matches and my ego is bruised, I will always return eventually.\n\nAt the beginning of every turn, both players (or the player and the AI) have the opportunity to meticulously plan every potential movement each of their units will perform under every possible circumstance. When both players are ready, they submit their plans and watch the battle unfold.\n\nTo win, you must learn to anticipate your enemy's movements. Seasoned players think differently from new players. Players behave differently than the AI. And sometimes, if you work at it long enough, you can craft a turn that will counter nearly every move the enemy could make. I think of it like building a machine: You start by simulating worst case scenarios and you fine tune it until your units are prepared for everything from the enemy's most plausible moves to strategies that didn't even occur to you.\n\nIt's a game that rewards patience and contemplation.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/anterk/recommended/98200/","anterk","Anterk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/anterk/","730 products in account","Frozen Synapse is an unforgiving turn-based strategic experience. Every turn, you must plan your moves or face almost certain death at the hands of your enemies.\n\nStory missions hand you control of a small present squad. Every member of the squad can die from a single hit. Units are differentiated by the weapons they carry: shotguns, assualt rifles, sniper rifles, or rocket launchers. Shotguns dominate close-range, sniper-rifles dominate long range, and assualt rifles are useful at any range but will lose if too far from a sniper or too close to a shotgunner. Rocket-launchers will blow away walls and enemies, but must be set up in the right direction.\n\nAs in Chess, the simplistic nature underlying the game leads to surprising complexity in motion. Every turn, you must try and forsee what your opponent will do. Once you've planned your moves to the best of your ability, you submit your choices and wait for the game to work everything out. Waiting is the only downside to this game, as you will be forced to wait for surprisingly lengthy periods while everything gets worked out, and it can be frustrating to wait so long only to see all your units die at the start of the next turn. Nevertheless, the feeling of gratification when things go right is worth the experience. I highly recommend this game.\nGameplay:\nhttp://youtu.be/ovm9m_nMJbk","July 16, 2014","true","6.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/anterk/recommended/98200/","anterk","Anterk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/anterk/","730 products in account","Frozen Synapse is an unforgiving turn-based strategic experience. Every turn, you must plan your moves or face almost certain death at the hands of your enemies.\n\nStory missions hand you control of a small present squad. Every member of the squad can die from a single hit. Units are differentiated by the weapons they carry: shotguns, assualt rifles, sniper rifles, or rocket launchers. Shotguns dominate close-range, sniper-rifles dominate long range, and assualt rifles are useful at any range but will lose if too far from a sniper or too close to a shotgunner. Rocket-launchers will blow away walls and enemies, but must be set up in the right direction.\n\nAs in Chess, the simplistic nature underlying the game leads to surprising complexity in motion. Every turn, you must try and forsee what your opponent will do. Once you've planned your moves to the best of your ability, you submit your choices and wait for the game to work everything out. Waiting is the only downside to this game, as you will be forced to wait for surprisingly lengthy periods while everything gets worked out, and it can be frustrating to wait so long only to see all your units die at the start of the next turn. Nevertheless, the feeling of gratification when things go right is worth the experience.

The tactical control of your units and the ability to test out scenarios with the enemy units at the same time as you try to counter your opponent is just perfect.  The units are balanced well and the additional Red DLC with those units also provide an even deeper level of strategy in the game (along with it's own campaign as well).  The controls are mainly all done via mouse and are really easy to pick up, the tutorial is straight forward and explains everything very well.  You learn tactics and the various strengths and weaknesses of each unit as you play and advance through campaign or online matches.\n\n\nThe campaign is huge and difficult, the ai will destroy you if you do not try to counter it in your own moves, and the sheer number of levels in the campaign make this totally worth any price it is set at, definitely worth full price and then some.  The missions you play are beautifully made and the story is intrigueing and thought provoking, keeping you guessing and wanting to play more and more.  The levels are randomly generated every time you start a new mission or fail the one you are on, adding to the difficulty and replayability, though you will probably take a serious amount of time to beat the huge campaign.  The various game modes are integrated into the campaign as different mission scenarios, like basically killing everyone, defending a position or key person, infiltrating a base and assassinating a key person, etc. etc.\n\nThe soundtrack is also great for transitions between different situations, in-between levels and on the menu screen.  I would buy it again just for the soundtrack alone, I think it is that good.\n\nThe online is still just as active as it was on day one when I bought it, with just as many people and game modes being played.  The huge number of online game modes that you can play online are also available in skirmish offline for practice against the ai, and help you to better understand the different game modes that you will come to play online.\n\nWhile there is the secondary account for loggin in, you just enter it once and it keeps all of your online stats and games synced so you can login from anywhere and keep playing, not intrusive or painful like origin or other third party drm's.  The account you use is tied to your steam name so you just click login when you start the game and it literally only takes one extra second to do.\n\nHas a replay feature after finishing an online match or campaign mission that allows you to upload directly to youtube, after logging in through their menu, and share your amazing victories or glorious defeats with the world, or just save for reviewing strategy later, whatever suits your fancy.\n\n*     The only problem I have is that sometimes when I try to set chains of commands for a particular unit using the timeline aspect (I don't remember the exact name for the button) it can be difficult to get orders to work in the sequence I want them to, but I then just try out scenarios before making my moves final anyway and it usually does not cause a problem.","June 20, 2014","true","25.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I have owned it for about eight months or so, and logging on and starting a bunch of games and keeping up with them over time is a joy. This game challenges the turn-based strategy caveat in regards to multiplayer which is simply the fact that turns take a long time to plan and execute. Players and their opponents take their turns simultaneously, once the 'planning phase' has been finished by both players. Then, the outcome is played, and further turns are played as necessary. Fortunately, with so many games on the run, you are always in some kind of action. By the time you've finished your seventh new game, your very first opponent has probably submitted his turn, and switching between these games is easy, albeit nowhere near seamless... there are short loading sequences. Endless strategy fun!\n\nAlso, Frozen Synapse isn't exactly the prettiest game ever.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DraxTheDestroyer/recommended/98200/","DraxTheDestroyer","DoctorSpectrum","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DraxTheDestroyer/","264 products in account","Between countless Fire Emblem games, some tabletop roleplaying, and a recent campaign of XCOM: Enemy Unknown, I've come to enjoy turn-based strategy. There's something very satisfying about using your brain to look at the situation, and by taking careful risks, use each and every single one of your units to make a satisfying move which puts you further towards winning the game.\n\nThat was what I was hoping for when I bought Frozen Synapse - a nice, fun, turn-based strategy which lets me plan carefully in order to win. Personally, I was almost crossing my fingers for an XCOM/Fire Emblem rip-off, since to me, they represent the core ideas and mechanics of turn-based strategy and more of that sort of gameplay couldn't be a bad thing.\n\nUnfortunately, what I found instead was a boring, drab game where the "strategy" comes down to "have you guessed what your opponents were going to do?" Sure, that's an essential part of most strategy games, but usually you get help, like showing where your opponents can move, or knowing how much damage they'll do so you'll know which units can survive a fight with them. Instead, in Frozen Synapse, you choose which actions you want your units to take, press the button to end your turn, and then your opponents make all of their moves at the same time.\n\nWhilst this doesn't sound like a bad thing, it means that you can spend time setting up your units, planning for your opponents to do something, only for them to bypass that method completely and catch you by surprise, all because you didn't have the precognition to see into the future and realise that they could do that. Sure, you could try and plan for all outcomes, but that means using more units and therefore cutting off your options elsewhere. Essentially, gameplay boils down to you crossing your fingers that the enemy walks in front of your units and dies before they notice your units.\n\nOn top of all that, the controls are confusing as all hell and very unintuitive. There's a tutorial, but it rushes by pretty quickly and being given step-by-step instructions is much different to having to think ahead and choose and work out what to do in a real level. I should say something about the graphics and story too, but really, what is there to say? The graphics are ugly, uninspired, and boring, and the story is a bunch of cyberpunk technobabble which made my eyes immediately glaze over because it was so boring.\n\nNormally, I try and finish games to the end because I want to get my money's worth, but this is the first time in a very long while that I've simply quit and said "No." I tried to get into the game and give it a good go, but as I struggled to predict the enemies' paths for the umpteenth time, I recalled that in video games, players should be interested within five to fifteen minutes. Well, I gave the game nearly an hour of my time, and as far as I'm concerned, I shouldn't have gone further than fifteen minutes.\n\nOverall, I would not recommend Frozen Synapse. This is not the type of turn-based strategy I enjoy, and whilst it's certainly a nice try and something different, there's a reason that turn-by-turn strategy has remained dominant in many games - for example, chess - for so long: because it works and it's fun, unlike Frozen Synapse.","February 10, 2015","false","1.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The most interesting part is planning out both your moves and predicting your enemy's moves, playing it out, and optimizing your turn based on your available information and predictions. LoS and cover can be frustrating with you occasionally you being shot before you can shoot the enemy without explanation from the game. Single player is pretty generic and multiplayer is a bit empty. I assume most people set up their own matches between friends because I get the feeling this is one of those games that a dozen hardcore people play publicly just to stomp people online.\n\nThis could be a great tactical play-by-email game between friends but I wouldn't recommend it unless your friends get it or you buy multiple copies for some.

Really it looks like it's trying to justify charging 23 bucks for a single sale.\n\nAside from all other critical thoughts I also had the displeasure of graphical and gameplay bugs in the first 2 hours of simple campaign play.\n\nThe game is paradoxical in almost every aspect:\n\nIt is a turn based game,\nyet ultimately actions are done timebased.\n\nIt puts very little effort in the story telling,\nyet it drowns the player in expositional dossiers, conversations and monologues. Luckily you can skip them all.\nYou need to micromanage and possibly run simulations of every nanosecond,\nyet the choices you can make are very simple and gameplay lacks any depth.\n\nMachine gunners are the "bread and butter" unit you control very precisely,\nyet their aim is so horrendous that engagements outside of shotgun range feel completely luckbased.\n\nWaist high objects give cover,\nyet standing on the corner of a wall does not give sideways cover.\n\nStanding behind waist-high cover is an advantage,\nyet ducking(so you fit below waist-high cover) has no effect aside from hiding behind cover.\n\n\n\n\nI mentioned gameplay lacking depth, let me go into more detail on that.\nYour mindless drones have no inventory and never need to reload. You can not change weaponry, the drones you use or how they are distributed on the map at the start of a singleplayer mission.\nThe options available are wait, move, aim, duck, ignore all enemies, ignore a specific enemy and prioritze a specific enemy and reversals of these commands.\nThat's it.\nIf your guys are in ♥♥♥♥ positions, your enemy has to make a mistake. Your drones can not have more than object in their hands. So unless that object is a grenade thrower or rocket launcher, the only feasible "strategies" are\n1. to be in a good position and aim, motionless, at the correct angle.\n2. move, preferrably without line of sight, to a better position and do 1.\n3. exploit positioning mistakes of the stupid AI and shoot them in the back. If even possible. If not possible, do 1.\n\nIf a drone is standing still and an opposed drone comes around the corner, both having the same weapon, equal cover and given all appropriate commands(aim at that direction, focus specific enemy), then the drone that stood still will always win.\nThere is no time to outmaneuver the enemy drone with your own drone in a single turn, either. Rewarding inaction with 100% chance to win an encounter is atrocious game design.\n\nThe graphical bug I encountered seceral times was hatched green neon lines connecting my selected units with my other units for no apparent reason\n\nThe gameplay bug I encountered after a particularly long processing time for the first turn, including 2 prompts to kill the program, because it didnt respond.\nIt changed a unit of mine from a sniper to a machine gunner. While no other downsides, it was an annoyance.\n\n\nThe music was nice, I guess.\n\n\nIn summary, a shallow and unresponsive tactical game that requires huge amounts of micromanaging miniscule movements.\nIt feels like playing counterstrike without grenades from the top down perspective, which is entirely the wrong perspective for that kind of gameplay and also lacks grenades.\n\nWould not recommend.","December 16, 2014","false","5.5"," 9 of 21 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","9","21","0","4"

I thought the combat would be more like X-Com but while similar, it’s different in a bad way. It is still technically turn-based, but instead of each unit getting an individual turn, your whole team has a turn and you assign them moves & tasks, which all get carried out at the same time. The enemy units move all together at the same time your units do, which results in wasted turns & frustration.\n\nLet’s say you want to move one unit, who is exposed, behind some cover. You want another unit to camp behind cover & shoot a bad guy as he moves. You have to instruct both of them on what you want them to do, then basically push the “play” button and watch events unfold.\n\nUnfortunately, an enemy unit moves into firing range of the guy you told to move into cover. You couldn’t anticipate the enemy would move there, so your guy keeps stupidly running forward as you watch helplessly while the enemy blows him away. Meanwhile, your other unit jumps into a perfect firing position right at the start of the turn, just like you told him. Unfortunately, that other enemy unit went a different way than you thought he was going and basically gets a free movement turn while your guy idiotically sits in one place the entire time. Events like this are commonplace.\n\nMaybe it gets better. Maybe I wasn’t doing it right. All I can tell you is that I didn’t enjoy the hour of Frozen Synapse I played. I’ve thought about going back and giving it another shot but then realize I’d have to sit through the entire tutorial again because I don’t remember any of the controls. I have zero desire to do that.","January 24, 2014","false","1.0"," 8 of 19 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","8","19","0","0"

The map and unit placements are randomly generated, and much like Solitare, the deck is often stacked against you in such a manner as to make it impossible to win no matter what you do. Losing units at the start of the first turn before they are able to act is commonplace. Furthermore, the units themselves often inexplicably fail to do what they are ordered. Rockets and grenades are often launched at trajectories different from what was input, while some units simply don't engage an enemy directly in front of them (and yes, "Engage on Sight" was selected). I have also had instances where a unit glitched against a wall and became stuck in place as cannon fodder. The tutorial was largely useless; I learned more through trial and error in a few randomly-generated skirmishes.\n\nAll-in-all, I really want to like Frozen Synapse, but the frustration from bad spawns and glitches outweighs any enjoyment in the end.","December 31, 2014","false","7.9"," 7 of 17 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","7","17","0","0"

I watched YouTube videos and read lots of reviews and was painted a different picture of the game than what I actually ended up with.  It was constantly called a "top-down Counter-Strike" but it was more like those Rainbow Six games-top-down.  The tutorial doesn't do a great job of familiarizing the player with all of the game's features, which I think takes away from the long term success of this title as a multiplayer game.  After spending so much time working out the perfect plan to own your adversary and watching it play out in a matter of seconds then seeing that plan fall apart before those seconds are even over I didn't have much motivation to experiment.\n\nThe multiplayer part of the game can be played somewhat at your leisure by opting to receive e-mail notifications when the enemy has taken their turn, but it's far from an exciting game that will keep you engaged.

To be fair, I only tried the campaign (ignore the completely confusing story) but I imagine this gets much more worse when playing against humans: you plan your move, coordinate your people, only to see them obliterated in the outcome phase because the AI did something completely different than you expected. I think the game would be much more accessible if you would get a hint or trajectory of what enemy characters are probably doing. Overall, the combat system suffers the same problem as Jagged Alliance: Back in Action, sometimes you have to position characters pixel-accurate to have them shoot around a corner or through a window.

You have to tell each unit EVERY SINGLE TINY THING that they must do or else they will just end up getting killed trying to do a simple thing. Even with only 2 or 3 units this ends up taking a ridiculously LONG amount of time which is no fun at all. Then you can click next turn and watch how your perfect plan ends up getting ruined when the enemy ends up moving all their units.

This phase takes way too long and makes you want to play the game less and less. Then you watch it play out. If 2 soldiers from different teams come in contact they will shoot at each other. That is the most fun thing about this game. Yeah...thats it really, and its not even that fun. You just see them shoot at each other and then one of them dies.

In truth, it comes down to a rock, paper, scissors blend of wits and guesswork.\n\nFrozen Synapse is actually rather well-balanced. The variety of weapons, random placement of objects, and high amount of control over your actions add a lot to consider when taking your turn. But once you learn the rules, the game actually ends up very shallow. The simultaneous, locked-in turns limit the player to faking out his opponent rather than actually creating a strategy to suit the environment and adapting it to his opponent’s actions. In this way, the game is less about using tactics and more about being cheeky. Strategy, i.e. a plan of attack, is still important, but that is more about getting used to the game’s meta than actually developing tactical prowess.\n\nFrozen Synapse is very stylish - it has a very entertaining sense of humor in its dialogue and narration, and the music is well-composed and nice to listen to, but the gameplay itself falls pretty flat. I do not recommend this game at all.","September 25, 2014","false","2.2"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

BUT it doesnt seem to play out as smooth as I had hoped. Such as every move you make which can be just a few seconds long a turn comes a loading screen each time. So you see more loading screens than actually game play. Not good start. Second at the end of the battle when you want to reply the whole thing, it play it by turns, so you cant watch it as one video of the whole thing.

It's bound to be slow because of the turn based nature, but add on the amount of time it takes to compute a turn (a surprisingly long time!), and .. it's a bit boring.\n\nNow factor in that where your team are randomly plopped on the map basically defines if you will win or not. Bad placement? Then you dont really stand a chance. Woo game of skill.\n\nOh and the weapon types don't feel balanced either. Shotguns being basically useless unless you can get close to someone without being shot. See "placement" above.\n\nSoooo .. it's slow, even more slow than a usual turn based game, feels random and unbalanced. Yet gets some really good reviews.

I was told by several people that it is "Rainbow six planing mode the game" this couldnt be further from the thruth and that has nothing to do with the cyberpunk setting.\nThe setting is actually really nice and the charecters are entertaining. There are however several big gameplay problems.\n\n1.The mission start. You always get a group of several soldiers. You can not place them in starting zones, which is fine. The problem is instead they are placed randomly around the map. Add to this that the enemies are placed at random as well and what you get is an unbalanceable game. You will play one mission that is just not possible and when you restart the very same mission it will be unbelievably easy because by chance the soldiers were placed in your favour.\n\n2.The weapons. RPGs and grenadelaunchers are a lot of fun. The Shotgun is believeable to even though its a bit shortranged. Apart from that the weapons are a mess. First of all there is a "Machinegun" yet soldiers cant lie down. So they spray at each other from about 20 meters till one hits the other. The enviroments are all about 50m x 50m why not implement a Machinepistol instead? Next up the Sniper. Yeah tiny enviromens + a sniperrifle how is this ♥♥♥♥ supposed to work? Why not a rifleman instead with an assault rifle?\n\n3.Hit prediction. You have the option the precalculate your next move. The only downside is you have to guess yourself what the enemy will do. The AI is utter rubish so you will have to make a few wild guesses, but even when you guess right and everything plans out like you wanted it to .... you are still going  to loose at least one soldier. Why? Because that guy you shot in the back in the calculation before he has time to turn around will in reality be a lot quicker than your guy turn around and shoot him, for no logical reason. It makes the whole precalculate option pretty pointless.","January 4, 2014","false","7.8"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

It's bound to be slow because of the turn based nature, but add on the amount of time it takes to compute a turn (a surprisingly long time!), and .. it's a bit boring.\n\nNow factor in that where your team are randomly plopped on the map basically defines if you will win or not. Bad placement? Then you dont really stand a chance. Woo game of skill.\n\nOh and the weapon types don't feel balanced either. Shotguns being basically useless unless you can get close to someone without being shot. See "placement" above.\n\nSoooo .. it's slow, even more slow than a usual turn based game, feels random and unbalanced. Yet gets some really good reviews. I get the feeling a lot of reviewers just play a game for 20 mins, and then write a nice review so they get more free games sent to them, coz this one's a bit crap.","June 25, 2014","false","12.7"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

The turn based strategy is reasonably fun against NPCs and the campaign mode has a good story, but PvP seems limited in creativity and feels like playing a chess game except you have to make your next 5-10 moves without seeing your opponents reactions. Also...on mac OSX...WHY CAN'T I TAB OUT from fullscreen...seriously developers...its not hard...literally all my other games work just fine.\n\n5/10","June 28, 2014","false","2.6"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

I was wrong. Now, the concept seems great, but just too poorly excecuted for me to like it.\n1. AI- Well, 1 shot can kill a man, but unfortunately, sometimes when I give orders to my characters, and press to see them, they don't do it. All i can say is thank god for the planning phase, or else the mission would be over before i could say "WHAT THE ****?!" Your friendly AI, the people you control, take like 3 seconds to fire, keep in mind most turns only last like 5 seconds, this gives you around 2 seconds to move a guy.\n2. Graphics- So-so, is all i can say, only about 2 death animations when a dude is shot, and most of the detail obviosly went into the pictures of characters, and that isn't saying much.\n3. Story- Don't even bother, try to understand, your brain will disolve, but not before giving you the finger as it turns to mush.\n4 -Gameplay- Oh boy, is this difficult. NO DIFFICULTY SETTING, except for the type of AI in instant skirmish (suicidal, old etc)\n1 shot=1 kill regardless. You can get hit from the other side of the room with a single shotgun pellet and still die. Yeah programmers, Health bars would be nice seeing as your dumb squad fail to shoot unless they get a bullet in the face. Also, what the game does not tell you is that once you press "PRIME", enemies will move, which completely buggers any plan you made. All you can do is hope they do not turn around when your guy is ready to shoot them. Trust me, most of the time they walk off, see one of my guys about to kill another Enyo:Nomad or whatever the **** they're called, and boom, you're dead. No buts, just dead *heavy "yells DED, not big suprise"*. Why could we not see where enemies go in the form of waypoints, fewer of these waypoints or where they face the harder the difficulty, where a DIFFICULTY SETTING WOULD BE NICE.\n5. Soundtrack- Best part about the game, not Portal 2 level, but still good.\n6. Humor- Only in achivement names bub, otherwise, you need to only play the tutorial for a sarcastic remark.\nOverall, unless it's on sale for around £3 (about 5 dollars if you're American) I'd stay away. For £18.99, I could just go save up about £2 more and buy BOTH Portal games or Half Life/ hl2, so if they think they can charge more for this game alone. I don't think this is right.\nHowever, if you are still here and not up in arms either at the game or at me, THIS IS MY OPINION. Personally, I don't like this game, but if you do, that's fine. I just want to warn people about the problems I have with this game.\nOn that note, goodbye, I am off the play some (in my opinion) better games.","April 20, 2014","false","1.5"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

It pretty much leads to safe gameplay and trying to catch the other guy making mistakes.\n\nThe game has a very lengthy tutorial but has so many damn mechanics and buttons its like sitting through a college class just to learn it all which, in the end, turned me off from the game. If this hasn't stopped you from buying this game, please, do yourself a favor and look up the game on youtube for actual GAMEPLAY.

"Strategy? Turn taking? Sounds boring.", right? Wrong. This game is actually quite a thrill! When it's your turn, you can issue orders like sprint, walk with weapon ready to fire, crouch behind cover, no engagement, and a many others. You can also move your opponents units to predict how they will move. When you think you're happy, you can hit a "test" button to see how it works out then either keep tweeking or commit to your orders. The replay makes every win rewarding. I can't finish campaign, though. Invisible rocket troops isn't my idea of "tactics" or "challenge". The A.I. can be a bit too psychic as well. This makes for a needlessly-impossible combo. It loses points for forcing you to buy 2 copies, making this too expensive for what you get. If FS is on sale, definately try it out.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lizard_Face/recommended/98200/","Lizard_Face","Pengy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lizard_Face/","90 products in account","Frozen Synapse is a turn based squad tactics game set in a confuseing scify distopiea utopiea where digimon have guns.  The game has a terrible habit of not telling you things you think you should probably know like that units cannot shoot while ducking behind cover, shotguns not being able to engage hostiles that are more than a rooms width away, and what the hell a "check" command is.  other than that the game just seems flat out unpolished with poor AI.  Sometimes units will try to engage an enemy with their gun clipping through the corner of a wall.  He will then empty his gun into the wall he was hideing behind until he is killed by the enemy he was apparently engageing because your guy was still half exposed.  Sometimes your shotgun unit will just stand infront of an enemy and recive a load of lead to his face because no one told you he wont even ATTEMPT to shoot people that are litteraly only farther than a small rooms width away. this is very confuseing because shotgun projectiles seem to travel the entire map with no problem.  Units also cannot climb through windows or over low obstacles, leaving very little real tactics you can actually employ while entering a building.  The game is also all on one plane, meaning that you cannot climb onto roofs or down into ditches, basements, ECT.  Making all the maps just feel the same...  The asthetic of the game is simple computery blue wireframe untextured simulation which Is alright for this type of game I suppose, but the world just feels empty with no doors to breach or any furniture at all in the buildings.  Yes I know that you are fighting in the digital world net thing, but I would think that doors would be a nice thing to have in any building.  The gameplay seems solid at first until you realize how shallow it is with the whole lack of doors thing going on along with the lack of being able to climb through windows.  On the story side of things, you get mountains and mountains of text and exposition with what I would guess would be a gripping story.  But with SO MUCH UNEXPLAINED JARGON in the lore and no voice acting whatsoever... it all just becomes skippable seeing that you wont be able to understand half the things the characters are talking about anyway.

Best tactical turn based game, can also be played with e-mail. This game is acts as if you have soldier chess like pieces you must move around the board destroying the other soldiers. As with every gun(ak45, shot guns, rocket launcher, etc..) it has it's mechanics and range, you can duck, ignore, wait and aim, shoot one guy ignore the other and run away from danger all while enjoying the amazing game sound track. The first days I found myself immersed into the abyss of soothing blue with green vs red thinking and modulating strategic outcomes of my turns. You can be both very sneaky and clean cut or go out blazing gunz in the air firing any way you choose, you will find yourself thinking you must come out on top. It's as addicting to play as it is to win so get your thinking caps on and feel your way through the ton of scenarios in the campaign or get hooked up online with more than one person and play multiplayer, you decide. ~it is also available on tablets 3$ and a great game to play/music while on the road.","June 13, 2014","true","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game can be played online and offline, against the AI in skirmish mode or in a campaign as well as against other players from around the world. It can be nailbiting while you watch the outcome and realize all your awesome and unbeatable planning goes down the toilet as your opponent does exactly what you didn't think of. And on the other hand, the feeling is great when you watch your plan unfold and you stomp the opponent into the ground. But the best thing is, if things go awry and you lose, you always know it had nothing to do with luck but all with the mistakes you did. It is a bit like chess where you have to plan your moves into the future and adapt to the strategies of your opponent.\n\nThe units you (can) use range from machinegunners, to shotguns, rocket launcher and grenades to snipers and riot shilds. There are also differnt types of scenarios such as rescue hostages, secure a specific area or just plain extermination to name only a few.\n\nThe most important thing about this game is that you cannot just rush in and shoot blindly. You have to use a tactical approach and plan your moves carefully. Your units don't have many hitpoints as in classical shooters. One hit and they are dead biomass. Buildings and covers can be destroyed by rockets. So depending on the units there might be not a save spot to just sit and wait.\n\nAnother nice aspect of this game is, that you don't need to be permanently online. You can plan your moves offline. And soon as the turn result is there, you get notified of it and can prepare the next turn. So even for casual players who don't have much time, this is a good game to spend a few minutes for your turn and upload it.\n\nI really hope this game gets more attention as it surly deserves it. The grafics in Tron style and the nice soundtrack are really catchy. Very nice is also, that when you buy a game, you also get a second one to send to a friend.\n\nSo would i recommend the game? Yes, definitely!","December 6, 2014","true","13.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The plot is fun, although there's isn't much of it. The characters are done well and quite funny. You plan out your turns ahead of time and so have to predict what your opponent will do (which is quite gratifying when you get it right, but depressing when you're wrong). Multiplayer is a lot of fun, but it has a bit of a learning curve. The one thing it’s lacking is a level editor, but perhaps we’ll see that in an expansion, if they plan on making another expansion. But that aside, I highly recommend this to anyone who likes strategy games.","March 23, 2013","true","59.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Frozen synapse is an amazing game if you enjoy turn-based tactical gameplay. I am a big chess fan and I feel like Frozen Synapse is the closest feeling I can get to a more modern version of chess. The gameplay is very intuitive so you will pick up on commands and tactics very quickly. If you are not a fan of the multiplayer, the single player campaign (somewhat challenging for newbies) and soundtrack to this game are good enough reasons to pick up this title especially if you can steal this game on sale. The challenges that this game faces, however, is the community is still small and the amount of time per turn each game can feel like it takes a while. I counter this by constantly playing games vs. people who are currently in game and not AFK and also by playing multiple games at a time. This is also a good title for those who want to just log in maybe a couple of times a day and make their turn for a few/all their games. Even though this game isn't without its challenges, I highly recommend picking up this game (it comes with two copies so give one to a friend) and be sure to challenge me in game! Overall, I'd give this game a solid 9/10.","March 5, 2013","true","35.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It came highly recommended, though, and I personally woudl say that I do not regret buying it. There's something very satisfying about this tactical strategy shooter: setting up a plan of attack, viewing its potential outcome and reviewing every single step of the attack process. When you see a well-planned attack go off perfectly with pinpoint precision, you come away feeling like a god.\n\nThere's only one downside: there's no steam cloud backup of your data. This is one game that really needs it, especially with Steam's potential plans to make its games available on Tablets. With data backed up onto the cloud, you'd be able to play at home or on the go without much hassle. This is not possible.","June 22, 2014","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The layout of the game is two players in direct opposition each  control a squad of soldiers in a highly abstracted environment. Play is turn-based planning phases which may be played asynchronously (like play-by-email) or live, alternating with 5-second execution phases where both squads' plans are executed simultaneously.\n\nDuring the planning phase players assign orders to their units, each given a specific non-interchangeable weapon that determines how they fight and how quick they are, to move, crouch, wait, aim, and focus on a target area or enemy. Most of the time in-round is spent jockeying for cover; given enough time to aim, soldiers always have perfect aim so cover is mandatory. The game then becomes a mind game of luring the enemy into overextending and having a soldier in the right place and time. Cover blocks line-of-sight, so running from wall to wall breaks a shooter's focus; crouching behind cover makes your soldier invincible.","June 28, 2012","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But it's so good. Frozen Synapse is an odd blend of turn based strategy and squad tactics. Turns don't play out like in Civ5 for example, they play out in 5 second intervals. Both you and the enemy will act out the moves you both planned whenever the end turn button is pressed.\n\nThe way the multiplayer works means games can be both casually played one round a day over the course of a week or you can become a full on fanatic of the game if you wanted. The soundtrack is also one of the best I have ever heard. Very ambient, but in a good way. It suits the setting and atmosphere of the game really really well, the setting being very cyberpunkish and is done very well.\n\nOverall I would give it a big recommendation.

I got it for free in the Great Gift Pile during the 2011 holiday sale (thanks, Valve!), and must say I was pleasantly surprised by how much fun it is.\n\nI've barely touched the campaign, mostly because "Instant skirmish" is fun enough.\nThere's a room with around 3-6 enemies and a squad of friendly soldiers you can map out the paths for and set their stance/aiming/targeting options. Once you've done this, you click the "prime" button, and your sequence of moves plays out at the same time as the AI's. The process repeats until everyone on one team is dead. Simple, right?\n\nThe key phrase for Frozen Synapse is "just one more game". The skirmishes are nice and short, and the gameplay is simple and addictive. Be prepared to start playing one morning, then quit playing and find that the authorities have declared you legally dead.\n\nOverall, a solid strategy game and a great time-waster.

The game can feel very frustrating and random unless you learn a bit more about how the battle outcomes are decided -- there are no random elements at all -- and once they become clear, you can really sink your teeth into it.\n\nGood points: A real sense of accomplishment when you predict the enemy's movements and squad wipe them with a shotgunner. Music. Multiplayer is fun and can be played asynchronously over many days. Missions constantly introduce new objectives, and the last few missions are remarkable! Though the levels are similar, it maintains the feeling of experiencing something new each level, whether that be through new weapons, unique unit matchups, or clever objecties.\n\nBad points: A few missions stick out as being really surprisingly hard.

The reality has become divided into the real world, controlled by humans, and the shape, something like a second reality that can be accessed through the widespread wireless network that has been established over the years. It's home of so called shapeforms which I won't explain in detail.\nThe setting is somewhat similar to that of the Shadowrun Universe (Cyberpunk).\n\nGameplay:\nAs there are so many other reviewers out there who already explained the gameplay in detail, I will just sum up my impressions. The game easy to learn but hard as f*** to master. You are given a small tutorial which explains the basic commands and teaches you how to chain them and plan your turn. Then you're on your own to figure out what to do with that information. I suggest playing the campaign a little before jumping into multiplayer.\nThe mechanics are fair although sometimes frustrating since who kills who depends on a list of factors you have to be aware of and at times they are not that easy to assess.\nBut that's what makes this game great. It really forces you to THINK about what to do next!\n\nThe graphics speak for themselves. Simple yet stylish. You get a good overview of the map and there are no irrelevant objects. If you can see it, it has a function -> Good guys, bad guys, cover, walls. That's it.\n\nSumming up I did not regret paying 7€ for this. If you also want to play Coop, buy the Red DLC. Only one of the Coop-Players needs it for coop to work which I think is really well done!","June 23, 2014","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The design appears simple, but there's so much depth to the strategy that it becomes both addicting and hugely tense in short order. Anticipating enemy movements, adapting to contingencies, and determining the best way to use the forces at your disposal make the gameplay immensely rewarding. The simultaneous turn resolution throws in further decision-making concerns and makes strategy development that much more dynamic and exciting. The soundtrack is phenomenal, as well, and really helps to enhance the cyberpunk world you inhabit. Snippets of the text dialogue could use some touching up, but information is communicated well and characterizations are done competently.\n\nFrozen Synapse is everything I want from a tactical game, in the sense of both gameplay and presentation.

Multiplayer is a lot of fun, but it has a bit of a learning curve. The one thing it’s lacking is a level editor, but perhaps we’ll see that in an expansion, if they plan on making another expansion.

Frozen synapse is an amazing game if you enjoy turn-based tactical gameplay. I am a big chess fan and I feel like Frozen Synapse is the closest feeling I can get to a more modern version of chess. The gameplay is very intuitive so you will pick up on commands and tactics very quickly. If you are not a fan of the multiplayer, the single player campaign (somewhat challenging for newbies) and soundtrack to this game are good enough reasons to pick up this title especially if you can steal this game on sale. The challenges that this game faces, however, is the community is still small and the amount of time per turn each game can feel like it takes a while. I counter this by constantly playing games vs. people who are currently in game and not AFK and also by playing multiple games at a time. This is also a good title for those who want to just log in maybe a couple of times a day and make their turn for a few/all their games. Even though this game isn't without its challenges, I highly recommend picking up this game (it comes with two copies so give one to a friend) and be sure to challenge me in game!

As of this review I'm at 6 wins and 0 losses... let me tell you, even with delayed input, these games are freaking intense.

You can adjust your men's viewing angle as they walk, toggle ducking, ignore enemies to sprint beyond firing range and a few other tactical options. Your squads get a variety of typical weapons, RPGs, assault rifles, shotguns and sniper rifles are all standard fare and behave more or less as expected. Terrain is reduced to walls and half-walls used for ducking behind for cover. Terrain can also be further reduced with the explosions of rockets! This game is remarkably interesting, although its multiplayer network is strange and offputting. Still, I recommend it.

Oh nvm, back to the recommendation.\nI'll try to keep it as short as possible.\nWell where to start? Imagine a virtual chess mixed with Rainbow Six.\nIt's a 1 vs 1 skirmish most of the time, but the are other modes too.\nEvery player is assigned different units with different strenghts and weaknesses, the map is randomized and can be played with fog of war or without.\nThe game is very easy to learn, the interface does a great job, you can crouch, aim + walk, run without trying to engage, engage as soon as you see someone, ignore a specific enemy or just hide behind a window, all with simple commands/clicks.\nNevertheless, it's a bit harder to master, to create good strategies and beat your opponent in a battle of warfare wits.\nThere are no random numbers, no evasion or dice involved, everything is calculated perfectly (this is because these are not human soldiers, they are different entities explained by the story), even if it the graphics show you that the soldier is shooting randomly and seems to hit with only one of the random bullets, in reality, that's just a visual effect, there are specific rules when the "killshot" is issued.\nMultiplayer is very nice, with friends or strangers, you can play your game like you would normally do, everyone doing their turn, or you can log out, your friend can do his turn, send it to server, and then you can continue the game when he's offline, for example. This allows you to play even two or more games simultaneously, jumping from one to another.\nLast thing is, the electric music is very soothing.\nIf you like brewing strategies with a little group of soldiers, this is for you, don't miss it, you can even invite me to a game ^_^ .","July 31, 2013","true","34.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I bought it years ago when it was in the humble bundle and I seem to always keep coming back to it.\n\nIf I could describe it I would say the turns are simultaneous but at the same time asynchronous. Basically you place your moves for your units and hit the calculate outcome button.  Once your opponent has done the same, the computer calculates what the outcome was with those programmed actions.   Makes for a very interesting guessing match of what the opponent will do.  Since it's asynchronous you can carry a game on over a week or finish it in one sitting.  Or like most, have 6 or so games going on at any one time.

While their weapons differ, their move sets remain largely the same.\n\nIn turn based fashion, each round is spent instructing individual units where, when, and how to move, aim, and shoot. Only by tactically queuing up their actions is victory achievable. This complex but rewarding gameplay mechanic will likely drive casual players away.\n\nOnce instructions are given, the player enters the "Prime" phase where his and his opponent's squads execute their given tasks.\n\nMode7's masterpiece is unlike anything I've ever played.

You can adjust your men's viewing angle as they walk, toggle ducking, ignore enemies to sprint beyond firing range and a few other tactical options. Your squads get a variety of typical weapons, RPGs, assault rifles, shotguns and sniper rifles are all standard fare and behave more or less as expected. Terrain is reduced to walls and half-walls used for ducking behind for cover. Terrain can also be further reduced with the explosions of rockets! This game is remarkably interesting, although its multiplayer network is strange and offputting. Still, I recommend it.

Oh nvm, back to the recommendation.\nI'll try to keep it as short as possible.\nWell where to start? Imagine a virtual chess mixed with Rainbow Six.\nIt's a 1 vs 1 skirmish most of the time, but the are other modes too.\nEvery player is assigned different units with different strenghts and weaknesses, the map is randomized and can be played with fog of war or without.\nThe game is very easy to learn, the interface does a great job, you can crouch, aim + walk, run without trying to engage, engage as soon as you see someone, ignore a specific enemy or just hide behind a window, all with simple commands/clicks.\nNevertheless, it's a bit harder to master, to create good strategies and beat your opponent in a battle of warfare wits.\nThere are no random numbers, no evasion or dice involved, everything is calculated perfectly (this is because these are not human soldiers, they are different entities explained by the story), even if it the graphics show you that the soldier is shooting randomly and seems to hit with only one of the random bullets, in reality, that's just a visual effect, there are specific rules when the "killshot" is issued.\nMultiplayer is very nice, with friends or strangers, you can play your game like you would normally do, everyone doing their turn, or you can log out, your friend can do his turn, send it to server, and then you can continue the game when he's offline, for example. This allows you to play even two or more games simultaneously, jumping from one to another.\nLast thing is, the electric music is very soothing.\nIf you like brewing strategies with a little group of soldiers, this is for you, don't miss it, you can even invite me to a game ^_^ .","July 31, 2013","true","34.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The tactical gameplay for SP is pretty superb providing you with tons of different scenarios, and when you opt to replay a mission, the map is always re-generated.\n\nMultiplayer is kind of iffy where you are unable to deny a challenge (game) proposed by another player, however, if you have a friend or two to play this with, the game can get very interesting.

The kicker here is that you can simulate your enemies actions based on their last position, giving them commands to simulate what would happen if they moved here, aiming this way, etc. There are no random variables... you win or lose by your own foresight, or lack thereof. As of this review I'm at 6 wins and 0 losses... let me tell you, even with delayed input, these games are freaking intense. I can spend anywhere from 5 minutes to an hour inputing commands for the next 5 seconds, depending on how many possible variables I want to calculate. When it all happens, it's lightning quick and amazing... I recommend watching the below video:\nhttp://youtu.be/9jJrUY27O0Y\n\nAfter seeing that video, I bought the game with soundtrack.

However, I figure a lot of players probably put a bit more emphasis on graphics, and that's the demographic that will be quickly turned off by this otherwise sharp tactical combat game.\n\nPersonally, I wish there was more to the game as in a higher level of gameplay, micromanagment, agent personalization. But then I feel it was designed as a quick, cut to the chase kind of game. And that's in some ways agreeable.\nIt has catchy music, nice speed of play, and the painfully sparse textures do offer great clarity of the map layout. No bad clipping or shrubs to ruin a move. You know exactly what is passable and what is not.\n\nThe bad parts were it lacking a higher level of gameplay, or unit customization in storymode. And Id have liked to see a bit more polish on it asthetically, but I'm a boardgame lover myself and I get that vibe from it, so I enjoy it without the creators spending thousands on maps and texture work.\n\nI hope to see the engine put to use in a game with intensive out of combat micromanagement and a gripping story!","April 22, 2014","true","157.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The catch is you can usually take as long as you like for your turn, but since it only takes 1 shot to kill a unit there's always intensity about deciding on actions.\n\n\n\nPlay the demo, planning is a little fiddly but once you get the hang of controls and mechanics you'll apperciate how deep the game really is. Price may be a bit demanding though, at $25, but I can honestly say this is very much worth buying.\n\nI'd wait for it to go on sale, but defintely try the demo asap.\n\n\n\nAnd yes there is multiplayer, singleplayer is great too.","July 27, 2012","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
