"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrLolkins/recommended/341940/","MrLolkins","MrLolkins","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrLolkins/","932 products in account","Lets just be perfectly clear. I'm not scoring the game based on the nature of the content or the controversy surrounding the violence, but the quality of the product as it is.\n\nHatred is a iso-top down twin stick shooter where you kill people. There's no reason, there's no plot. The game never claims to have one other than "I want to kill people"\n\nGameplay itself consists of objectives that ammount to "Kill people" "Kill people in this area" "Move to another area" You shoot people, you dodge gunfire, you blow stuff up, If this sounds quite shallow and boring of a description, it's because that's what this game is.\n\nIt's closest comparison is to something like Hotline Miami. Wherein which the gameplay is fast paced, using lots of weapons feel fun, the gameplay rewards creativity, combos, experimenting etc. Hatred lacks all of that. It's purely just kill with guns, grenades, and kicking.\n\nNothing feels really rewarding. But then maybe that's the point. This character doesn't seem to gain pleasure from killing, the killing doesn't have a meaning, it's something you just have to -do- In the same vein that the character itself thinks that it's all it has to do in life.\n\nIt might just be me, but while senseless slaughter seems to have a charm with things like Hotline Miami, Postal, Manhunt etc. Those games all had a depth to them that was beyond the killing. a points/style system, a plot and narrative.  They had a reason, or if not at least that, the characters (Mostly Postal Dude in this example) At least had some personality, some redeeming factor, a bit of charm and wit. Manhunt's protagonist was in a "Kill or be killed" situation forced not of his own will. Hotline Miami had an interesting twist of psychosis, revenge, crime and corruption.  Hatred's protagonist (Or antagonist depending on your viewpoint) Lacks any of that.\n\nI understand the game or character never claims to make some large point of why he's senselessly killing, I don't think the devs created the game with any sort of deeper analysis in mind for the game or events in it. If you were really pushing for it, you could argue that "The game shows that not all killings have reason, that some people are just driven to murder with no cause or explanation behind them, that it's the real horror of the human condition that these things can just happen with without meaning or purpose. That this is a true horror game, a man with a gun and nothing to lose." But I honestly don't think that any sort of philosophy was considered when it came to this game. There's nothing to empathise or connect with the character, no real insight into his mind other than he's an emo hellbent on being edgy. He just falls flat as any kind of interesting, it just makes him boring.\n\nIf the whole rewarding factor of this game is that you get to let off some stress by violently killing people all around you? There are honestly better games out there for it.  Controversy aside, there is no real reason to pick up this game, maybe in a sale, but not for the asking price it has currently.\n\nEven with the controversy, if you're buying the game to see some extreme violence or over the top murders? Again, other games have done this better. It's a generic shoot to the face, throat slit etc.\n\nGraphics are passable. The destructable environments are a nice touch but again feel shallow in their execution. It's again just a matter of style over substance. Don't expect anything along the veins of Battlefield 4's destuctive mechanics to blow up a wall and then ambush a group, because chances are they'll just die from the grenade regardless.\n\nEdit - Due to people asking. Some more details - There's not too many guns from what I've seen so far, even then beyond the flamethrower it mostly consists of standard SMGs, an M4, a pistol, and a shotgun. The controls are pretty poor, no way as refined and tight as Hotline Miami, Driving controls are a joke. Playing this on a controller just feels wrong but even with mouse and keyboard it's not too much smoother.\n\nGraphics options are... There. Nothing spectacular. While other people have been complaining about crashing and issues I've personally had none so far. As for any other options. There's an "Are you drunk" mode, which does... something, apparently. I've yet to figure out what precisely as the gameplay and graphics were exactly the same.\n\nOverall it comes down to the main gripe I have with the game. It's pointless. There's no real gain for doing anything, there's no reason to be creative.  There's no hidden areas, no secrets, no collectables, nothing else worth doing. Sure the "Execute to regain health" mechanic means you might find yourself having to take a risk-reward look at a firefight. "If I go out there, i could execute him to get some health back, but get shot by the others" But honestly. This one little unique gameplay mechanic doesn't really hold up the game enough to play it for.\n\nThe game's being sold on controversy and in that regard it doesn't even deserve the credit it's getting. While I completely support the fact that games of all natures, themes, topics and extremes should be allowed to be made regardless of subject matter's level to offend, (the whole fact being, if you don't like the content, don't play the game.) The game itself should at least still be fun or interesting to play. If you're only buying this game just because you think it'll be fun to mindlessly kill people, vent off some anger for yourself in a cathartic senseless fashion? Other games do it better. Hatred itself isn't -good-. And that's what's important.\n\nAnd to the person in the comments section comparing my comments here about Hatred's plot and gameplay to "Doom". 1. Doom actually did have some plot, It wasn't exactly Shindler's List but it was still there. Doom was fun, Doom was varied, had good level design, had lots of different weapons, enemies, boss fights etc. This doesn't. You quickly get bored of shooting the same few bland models over and over.\n\n-Spoilers.. you know, if you actually care about this game being spoiled. Hint, they're not much-\n\n\nThe only mildly interesting changes in any sort of experience I've had so far, is using a swat car with a mounted turret (Driving around a claustrophobic train yard where you can barely drive it anyway, not helped by the poor driving controls) And. Wait for it - Pressing a button on a control panel that makes a train blow up... Woopie.\n\nThat's literally the only variations to the main gameplay I've seen so far. Both of these being optional to do.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTL;DR : Boring gameplay, 0 Plot. Boring character. Not even that violent compared to other titles. The game isn't worth playing just for the controversy alone. It's not bad because it's violent, it's bad because it's crap.","June 1, 2015","false","2.9"," 2,657 of 3,534 people (75%) found this review helpful 116 people found this review funny","75","657","3","116","123"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/341940/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","HatredDeveloper: Destructive Creations\nPublisher: Destructive Creations\n\nNote: A key for this game was provided by the developer for the purpose of writing an unbiased informative review. No other compensation was given.\n\nIntroduction\n==========\nHatred certainly got some attention back when it was first revealed on Steam. A lone man decides he wants to kill as many innocent people as possible in any way he can because he is sick and tired of humanity. Oh yeah, I can see how it got a little...controversial. Let's keep in mind that it's just a GAME and take a closer look at it.\n\nGameplay\n==========\nAt it's core, Hatred is a twin-stick shooter. Your left stick moves the Antagonist (let's just call him Guy), and the right stick aim's Guy's weaponry. Guy can carry many different guns and 3 different grenades. It's your mission to use these tools as best you can and kill anything that moves. Simple, but the controls are a bit challening to master. Aiming can sometimes a pose a challenge as well. Once innocents hear gunshots, they start panicing and running away, presenting you with constantly moving targets. If you get their health down low enough to where they are suffering, you can perform an execution, which sometimes zooms in onto Guy and shows you in great detail how he kills this person. Sometimes it's by slitting their throat, or by shooting them in the forehead. Either way, it's extremly graphic, and some people might find them a bit disturbing. Performing an execution is literally the only way to regain lost health, so try to do these finishers when you are running low.\n\nGuy can also hijack cars off the street and drive them around. Again, the controls for the game make this a challenge, but it's useful for getting to your different objectives. Speaking of objectives, these include crashing parties, or mowing down an entire police station full of cops. Clearing these objectives unlocks that location as a respawn point. When you finally die, you are able to respawn at that location, but beware! You have a limited number of respawns until the game is over completely.\n\nEach map is pretty large and full of people to kill. You can freely enter any homes or buildings you stumble across, and kill anyone inside. If the doors are locked, you can kick them down. Lots of houses have explosive containers inside, which explode violently when shot. This is pretty helpful in clearing rooms indoors, especially at parties! The most annoying thing about this game is as you kill more and more people, police will start to swarm to your location and try to take you down, very similarly to GTA. At first they are very manageable and easy to kill, but as more show up you can quickly find yourself overwhelmed.\n\nThere are 2 playable modes: Story Mode, and Survival Mode. They are both exactly what they sound like. On the main menu you get to choose between the two, as well as if you want to take a short tutorial first (this is recommended).\n\nGraphics\n==========\nThe entire game is a mix of black and white hues, with only blood to offset things. Blood is plentiful as you kill people, so you will be seeing a lot of it. It even splashes up onto the screen. While the overall effect is really nice, it gets just a tad old to look at after a few hours. Explosions look really nice, especially when you get a few people caught in it, with the resulting splash of blood painting the surroundings in thick crimson hues.\n\nThe opening cutscene is well done, and looks very detailed, but it shares the same black and white tones as the rest of the game. It's a nice theme for the game, as it is very dark and violent, so it makes sense.\n\nSound and Music\n==========\nThe music is pretty standard, but what shines here are the sound effects and voice overs. Gunshots and bodies hitting the ground sound great (can't believe I just said that o.O), and he majority of the time you are going to hear police sirens and people screaming for their lives as they run in terror.\n\nLots of obscenities are heard as people flee, as well as the sound of their blood splashing onto the ground as they are gunned down. Nice touches, although a bit morbid. It fits the game's theme pretty well though.\n\nPerformance\n==========\nHatred runs surprisingly well, although sometimes loading takes a bit. It's very obvious when you first boot up the game, as the game doesn't even show up after hitting Play until at least 2 minutes later, whereas most games boot up instantly or after a few seconds. I got 60 FPS at all times, and experienced no crashes, stuttering, or framerate drops...even when causing massive explosions resulting in showers of blood.\n\nThe game played very well with my Logitech F310 controller. I didn't even try the keyboard. The controls take a little getting used to, but once you get it it's not a big issue and actually compliment the game pretty well.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n==========\nDecent as a game, even if the concept is a bit questionable. Good for several hours of fun mowing down 'enemies'. It's not a very deep or complex game...Just don't take it seriously and you'll find some enjoyment in it as you play. It can be pretty difficult as you go along, but it's worth giving a try just to see what all the fuss was about.\n\nGameplay Demo\n==========\nhttps://youtu.be/QhkGffW4ny0\n\nNerd House Verdict:\n==========\nRecommended\nIf you liked this review or found it helpful, please consider rating it up.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BlueStinger/recommended/341940/","BlueStinger","BlueStinger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BlueStinger/","1953 products in account","Hatred is basically a modern version of the original Postal. It's incredibly violent, gory, and contains the worse bad language i've seen, or rather heard, in any game to date. It certainly warrants it's adult rating and isn't something you'd want your kids to play.\nYou play as a guy who's gone 'Postal' going through each level dealing death and destruction with a variety of weapons. There's a few side missions you can do on the way such as chasing down a politician, derailing a train and wiping out a coffee shop full of 'hipsters'. It plays pretty well, though i recommend keyboard and mouse as i found using a controller just isn't accurate enough. Visually it's very nice, it's well animated with some nicely detailed backdrops and some really great fire and explosion effects. The sound is also good, with a moody soundtrack that's not too distracting and some meaty gunfire and explosions. There's also some nice little touches like clips from Rambo and Matrix played on tv screens throughout and the credits gave me a laugh.\n\nWhat i did like is the challenge. Early on it's fairly easy with just Cops to deal with but the latter stages, when the Army turn up, are a real challenge. Infact the last two levels took me multiple tries and that was on 'easy' difficulty! It requires a little planning ahead as running in guns blazing will get you killed in no time.\nMy only real complaint is that because of the isometric viewpoint it's fairly easy to get stuck behind walls, trees, fences and the like, but it's something you get used to after a while.\n\nAll in all i enjoyed it. And if you're a fan of Postal or infact any top down shooter i'm sure you'd enjoy Hatred. Especially as it's so challenging.\n\nI recommend it.\n\n","July 26, 2015","true","15.9"," 187 of 234 people (80%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","80","187","234","11","4"

Hell, it even starts identically with the protagonist standing outside his house before you open fire on civilians. From there you run around an open map going to marked locations (killing civilians and cops/SWAT along the way) such as shops/malls/hotels/bars/etc., kill more NPCs then go somewhere for the level to end. Afterwards, you do the same thing in a different level. If you find a car with its doors open you can hijack it and drive around running over people, but they're a pain in the ♥♥♥ to control and not worth the bother outside the hilarity factor of crashing them through walls - that's another good thing, there's plenty of destructible environments in the game, with walls and furniture falling apart and crumbling completely if explosions happen nearby or you crash objects through them.\nThe biggest problem with the game is the same one most games of its genre have: the isometric perspective makes combat a pain since you don't know exactly where your shots will land or if they will go over certain objects, the black and white colour filter makes it even more disorienting to move around and doesn't help matters.\n\nSince its announcement, there's been a ton of drama surrounding this game due to its concept and some of the developers being affiliated to neo-Nazi Polish groups. Playing it, you'd be hard-pressed to find any overt racism, misogyny or what have you (though there's a snarky Feminist achievement) since you kill all types of people.\nIf you're buying this just to get back at people who anger you on the internet I'd suggest you reconsider, you're part of the group that the developers are baiting and counting on to buy this game since it's nothing special. But it's your money, so do whatever.\n\nI bought this expecting a game similar to Postal and that's exactly what I got, but in the end I'm not sure if I'd recommend it to anyone unless, of course, you also liked the original Postal. It's a dumb, trashy game that happens to have pretty graphics. Despite being a few hours long you'll have seen everything the gameplay has to offer in less than half hour. Get it when it's u$15 or less during a sale if you're really curious about it.","June 2, 2015","false","6.2"," 621 of 875 people (71%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","71","621","875","20","10"

Because, every aspect of this twin-stick shooter is dull, repetitive, frustratingly difficult at the later levels.  Oh and the game is 4 hours...  Giving how little this game offers, there's absoultely no reason to replay it once the credits starts rolling.  Hatred tries to go for dark/edgy story and it ends up being pointless and very comical.  In fact, the game tries to make the main character feel very important, but given how stereotypical his character is.  He ends up being so unlikable throughout this boring genocidal rampage.  His lines are so cringeworthy that I almost feel sick from hearing it.\n\nThe levels are extremly repetitive, as you go out shoot and kill many civiains in order to advance to the next area and do it again.  You do sometimes have different objectives that isn't invold in killing, but getting to one place and then you go kill more people...  That's pretty much what Hatred is.  The game suprisingly have fantastic controls and thats the only good part about this game.  The destruction is also nice, but not as impressive like in Battlefield: Bad Company 2!  The shooting itself is ok and the enemy AI is decent at best.  Not much to say a whole lot thou.\n\nOh right, Hatred also has the worst checkpoint system ever and it adds nothing but problems to the game.  Those checkpoints gives you continues as you do repetitive side task by doing exact same thing that you do throughout the whole game. (KILLING PEOPLE!!!)  Once you earned it, you better make sure you don't die that often, because this game gets ridiciously hard very late in the game.  If you die you will respawn back to the first checkpoint.  Sadly, the game does a very poor job on this, as you will mostly respawn back to the first place you earned it at or sometimes the respawns can get you killed or worse, getting stuck!  Make one fatal mistake and it will cost you a continue, lose all those continues and its game over and you'll have to start all over at the beginning of the god damn level.\n\nOverall, its a poor game and a waste of value!  There's no multiplayer for that matter and a lack of bonus extras.  I don't know why this got so much attention, its a painfully average game with almost nothing new brought to the table.  Do yourself a favor: go spend your money on The Witcher III, than playing this game!","June 2, 2015","false","5.8"," 425 of 621 people (68%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","68","425","621","15","0"

This game, while having the possibility of being unique and interesting, ends up with a character you don't care about, wonky controls, and a mild bout of motion sickness.\n\nWhile the art style is interesting and offers up what would look appealing in still screenshots, the bottom line is that without color, it becomes very difficult to discern who is what against backgrounds. "Where am I standing?" is a common question as it isn't always in the middle of the screen. "What is shooting me?" The dark uniformed officer's clothes blend well with the natural ground and even worse, they see farther than you can typically.\n\nThe executions are.. disturbing but only because htey're strangely disconnected in such a way that they don't really make you want to cringe.

( They look at you through walls and start shooting holes through solid concrete walls to target you ); they need a slight modification so when someone comes into their field-of-view they have a slight delay ( hesitation based on target recognition to determine friend-foe ) before firing, or not..\n- The "toggle" Objectives button isn't a toggle despite trying different keys ( such as caps lock, tab, etc.. )\n- In addition to the objectives "toggle" switch not working, when you hold a button down to keep the results up ( also so you can see where your character is ) it turns itself off when entering / exiting vehicles among other circumstances.\n- The player character is easy to lose; the camera system isn't intuitive.\n- The camera system is absolutely is disgusting. It moves more to the top-right than bottom-left making it hard to aim ( while enemies can shoot at you when you can't see them meaning you end up needing to use the compass to line up the shots ) and it's easy for the crosshair to get lost in the effects ( because the crosshair is one color which doesn't negate on like-colors ).\n- Driving is sluggish and non-responsive - also armored vehicles seem to blow up when side paneling is shot.\n- Buildings don't seem to collapse after destroying all supports.\n- Vehicle lighting can't be changed.. ie what the ai leaves you with is what you get.\n- You can't drive 99% of vehicles; the doors have to be open to drive them ( ie cop cars, armored, etc but civilian cars are off limits )\n\nIf these would be fixed, it'd be an entertaining game.\n\nSome positives:\n- Everything is essentially destructable.. Buildings, trees, poles, etc..\n- Decent weapon balance for a flat-plane shooter ( ie assume all shots are body / center-mass shots ) with some targets taking more shots to take down based on armor and range.\n- Vehicle damage looks nice from what small bit I could see; it looked like the pole indented the hood as it should but these may be pre-fabbed and unimpressive ( stuck it in pros to give benefit of the doubt for the limited time viewing the game )\n\n\nIt's worth a look if you get it on sale. I was able to find it on Indie for $1.99 in a bundle of 6 or so games.","November 19, 2015","false","4.9"," 64 of 78 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","64","78","0","2"

People were calling it trash before it was even released and many were asking for it to be banned (so much for living in a free society). After it was released, even MORE people were complaining about how it was "disgusting" and that anyone who played the game was "a psycopath" or just "an edgey neckbeard". The discussion boards of Hatred were/are filled with trolls who try and smear the reputation of Destructive Creations by calling them con artists who made the game seem more violent than it turned out to be and purposely tried to garnish negative attention (even though it was the gaming/local media who made a big deal of the game's violence). The trolls also harass anyone who likes the game and get away with it because the moderators apparently dislike the game as well (I got banned for telling someone to play a "My Little Pony" game if they didn't like Hatred-I was banned for "flaming"-mods =Bronies).  To me, it almost seems like many of the trolls have a more sinister agenda behind their trolling, but I digress. The game itself does have some issues; it isn't perfect by any means, but I feel like the developers are working diligently to address the problems/concerns of the community.\n\nPROS:\n+The atmosphere of the game is spot on.\n+The audio really adds to the darkness, with pedestrians screaming and pleading for their lives; all set to a dark, atmospheric soundtrack.\n+Destruction in Hatred is unlike any game I've played to date.\n+A lot of attention to detail in every level of the game.\n+Bodies and blood stay the way you left them (and don't seem to affect performance).\n+My god the explosions are epic. I often shoot propane/gas tanks just to watch the explosions.\n+For an isometric shooter, the controls are nice and easy to pick up (despite what others say)\n+The Devs are pumping out updates quickly and fixing the problems this game has. They seem to really care about thier game.\n+Hatred isn't easy by any means. The different difficulty levels add replayability.\n+One day in the near future, it will have a workshop, which will add to the longevity of the game.\n\nCONS:\n-Many machines/gpu's have trouble running this game smoothly.\n-Even on high-end rigs like my own, framerates WILL drop, which is never good. (I stay around 50-60 for the most part)\n-Minor glitches (which are being worked on)\n-The game itself is very short and there isn't much of a backstory (this horse is still being beaten on the discussion board).\n-Sometimes the NPCs are pants-on-head ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n-There aren't too many guns, but there isn't necessarily a LACK of guns either. Could be more.\n\nOverall, I am pleased with the way this game has turned out. I never expected a deep story or a meaningful ending. Many people have been asking/getting refunds because the game is so short, but I don't understand why they are wanting refunds. Almost the entire game was uploaded to YouTube before it was even out. If they would have done their research, maybe they could have realized that the game was not for them (I'm sure I'll get a ton of thumbs down for saying this, but it needs to be said). This game ISN'T for everyone. I suggest watching YouTube walkthroughs before purchasing.\n\nVerdict: 7.5/10","June 17, 2015","true","45.1"," 175 of 259 people (68%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","68","175","259","20","0"

People have called it everything from a political statement to absolute proof of the degeneration of society. While there were a few cinematic executions that I found pretty cringe-worthy, most of the game is spent too far in the sky to discern much of the destruction happening down in the isometric hellscape that “The Antagonist” is intent on creating. Hatred certainly has its strong points, such as destructible environments. However, it also falls short on basic things like dialogue. Some lines are so cheese-covered that I’m going to need some nachos before finishing this review. The variety of objectives is lackluster, but if you go into Hatred with the idea that it really is just a brainless isometric shooter, it can easily work its charm on you. Is it worth the massive amount of hype? Let’s take a deeper look at Hatred.\n\nThe first thing you will notice as you burst into the streets will probably be the smooth gunplay, followed closely by the fact that AI civilians are extremely stupid. As you fire your assault rifle many will flee, some will cower, and a few will run directly towards the barrel of your weapon. This is a bit of a positive note, since the only way to recover health is to execute the injured, and the police are extremely determined to end your killing spree. As you advance through the game you will take down local cops, SWAT teams, and the army. There are only five weapons and three grenades to pick from unfortunately, and this along with lack of enemy variety hurts the replayability. I’d love to face down a tank with an RPG, but it never happened. Antagonist, I am disappoint. Hatred does have its fair share of clipping and optimization problems. The plot and execution are far from being innovative. The Antagonist is the antithesis of likeable or believable, but somehow even with its blemishes, underneath is a wonderfully built game.\n\nThe monochrome aesthetic is extremely effective here. Red and blue are the only real colors, which keeps Hatred from feeling too real. This might be a negative for some, for me it’s a definite positive. Sounds are extremely realistic, from firing a gun to pleas for mercy. The lines for The Antagonist are cheesy, but delivered well. There’s not a lot a voice actor can do with a script like this one. The game is extremely difficult even on normal mode, you get a respawn for completing side-objectives. While these do help a ton, if you die during the level’s main objective, you will be forced to start the entire level over. I enjoy the level design a whole lot, and if you don’t like something in the level, you can simply blow most of it up! Grenading your way through the side of a building and opening fire on anyone inside is extremely gratifying.\n\nI won’t attempt to take the supposed moral high-ground, as I play games with a similar amount of violence almost daily. Hotline Miami, Grand Theft Auto, Postal… Hell, even the fatalities in Mortal Kombat are far more gory than anything this game offers. If you feel bad about shooting civilians, let the police shoot you without reason (and they will) so you can feel justified. The only reason this game was awarded an AO rating and effectually ostracized from console gamers is simply due to lack of corporate ties, and maybe some marketing that was a bit too good. I don’t hesitate to say that Hatred doesn’t live up to the hype, but that doesn’t make it a bad game by any means. Firefights are a lot of fun, especially when you keep shooting the door jamb and expanding the hole. Overall Hatred is worth a look for anyone who enjoys isometric shooters and a touch of gore. Big thanks to Destructive Creations for the review copy, I hope you guys will continue to get under the skin of the mainstream gaming industry for a long time to come.\n\nGameplay:\n\nControls- 6/10\nFun Factor- 8/10\nDifficulty- 10/10\nReplayability- 6/10\nInnovation- 3/10\n\nAesthetic:\n\nGraphics- 10/10\nMusic- 7/10\nSound FX- 10/10\nStory/Lore- 3/10\nLevel Design- 8/10\n\nFinal Score: 71/100 for aesthetic, difficulty, and edge. So much edge.\n\nSummary: Pretty and brutal isometric shooter, based around “The Antagonist”, who decides to create his solution to overpopulation.\nVerdict: Destructible environments, well-designed gunplay, and brutal difficulty make this game an above-average pick.\n\nText/photo review: http://www.indiegamebundles.com/review-hatred/\nFull "Let's Review" video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBcILXi2AOs","June 5, 2015","true","3.1"," 97 of 143 people (68%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","68","97","143","9","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/niro-hcmx/recommended/341940/","niro-hcmx","Niro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/niro-hcmx/","392 products in account","Pretty Mediocre Top Down Shooter\n\nYou play as Not Important, a man on a mission to kill everyone for no known reason. I'm not going to hold "story" against this game because it's pretty clear it's not a story driven game. I will however point out that it's impossible to take this game seriously, and it feels like that's what they were going for. The fact that this is rated AO is an embarrassment to the ESRB. You're supposed to rate games on content, not the amount of political heat they draw.\n\nThe graphics are alright, but the game needs to find a better balance between "grungy" and "visible". You'll have a lot of trouble on some levels even navigating around the level at all. The game does have an art style, if "trying too hard: grunge edition" is an art style. Still, it does succeed somewhat at capturing the feel the game is going for. Occasionally walls won't render. That's the biggest graphical glitch I've come across so far.\n\nThe sound is alright. Decent quality. Not Important sounds like an emo grungy Xavier Renegade Angel. 3d sound glitches are plentiful, leading to the occasional random ear-bursting gunshot. You have a repertoire of about... 10 one liners from executions and that's it. Overall the sound is... okay.\n\nThe gameplay is also okay. It's a standard top-down shooter. Healing mechanics can get frustrating, especially when you're facing down a wave of 60 cops and you need health. You have to execute to gain health which requires being right next to someone, so these stand-offs usually end up in you either dying if you come closer for health, or dying because you can't heal. Damned if you do, damned if you don't. Add onto that that there is no guaranteed execution and it can get really frustrating really fast, with you hoping that the game's Random Death Generator will be merciful enough to not insta-kill the guy you just punted with F, a maneuver the game's loading screens lead you to believe is a reliable method of lining up an execution.\n\nNot Important really should have spent some time at the shooting range before going on his shooting rampage, because he can't aim for ♥♥♥♥. You'll spend a lot of time frustrated at how much you don't hit ♥♥♥♥ you're aiming at. The aiming system either rarely compensates for height difference, or doesn't at all. I never caught it doing so for the two hours I played. Granted, the level designs usually render this mostly a non-issue, but for the rare case it's another point of extreme frustration. Not Important really should have also hit the gym, because he can't throw for ♥♥♥♥ either. Grenades almost always make it about 60% of the way to your crosshair. Where they go when you throw them is also almost impossible to predict. I gave up on my strategy of throwing them through doorways to soften the resistance before I entered a room the third time in a row Not Important threw the grenade right into the doorframe and blew himself up.\n\nRespawn tokens are a pain in the ♥♥♥. You don't recover the respawn tokens you had at the start of a level upon restarting the level. This basically ensures that the level will only get harder if you lose at it. Another ingredient for our recipe of annoying, frustrating time. Cop and SWAT cars are OP as all ♥♥♥♥. They will swoop in and run you over before you have any time to react, and every time a car hits you, it's a one hit kill. They will not wait for you to finish an execution either, I executed someone to find myself already run over by a SWAT car by the time the execution scene was done happening.\n\nOverall, Hatred isn't really a bad game, but it's not a good game either. It's also not a game I'd actually recommend for $20.","June 3, 2015","false","2.0"," 217 of 356 people (61%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","61","217","356","21","3"

Of course no one cares that you can do the same in GTA series, but who cares. It looked like a psychopath simulator. And it looked quite fun, a different game, where you can release all your hate and just kill everyone. But it turned out to be an awful game.\nMostly you shoot not civilians but police, SWAT and soldiers. You're a one man army which is not very fun. You must fight your way through to a nuclear plant, guess the super hard password and...well you know what. It would be fun to kill civilians, plan your killings in similar way as in Hitman games, only your would be killing as many innocent people as possible. You could choose a weapon - deadly gas, guns, bomb etc. Hatred: a terrorist simulator.\nBut let me explain why this game sucks. The AI is non existent. The AI is so bad it wants to kill itself as fast as possible. The people basically run into you, around you, but not from you. They're all screaming "please don't kill me" which is the opposite of their actions. So you're just running, killing people, the police/SWAT/army shows, you kill them and move on to the next level. It's just boring.\nGame runs at 20fps on GTX970 and crashes often. Do i need to say more?\nOften the game looks too dark, you barely can see your targets. Anyway if you'll wait they will run into you screaming sooner or later. Controls are awful too. The mouse cursor just floats around because the game runs at 20fps.\nIt can be fun for an hour or so, but not more.

After all the main character is a genocidal maniac bent on murdering hundreds of innocent people, however despite this grisly and sinister concept, Hatred does nothing to make you guilty of the atrocities you find yourself committing. The supposed shock value is simply not present here, while playing Hatred I felt no remorse and no guilt for killing all these innocent people, and that is not because I’m a horrible person, there are many games which managed to produce an emotional response from myself and many other players, however Hatred is not one of those games. You will care about as much about the civilians in Hatred as those roaming the streets of GTA 5s Los Santos or Saints Rows Steel port. These people have no names, no backstory, no personality. They are nothing but pixels on a computer monitor, and no matter if you kill, 10, 100, 1000 of them, the emotional response will be about the same as if you were instead shooting zombies.\n\nYou will not care at all, and more to the point from the moment you start playing, you will find it simply impossible to take Hatred seriously. The games main character is perhaps the most obnoxious and ludicrous antagonist I have ever played in a video game. He doesn’t feel like an introverted and mentally disturbed spree killer, instead he is much more akin to a James Bond villain. That is if a James Bond villain was written by a twelve year old. Indeed his dialogue is so utterly absurd and his constant one-liners so cheesy and ridiculous, that instead of feeling shocked by this guys psyche I found myself bursting into laughter on multiple occasions.\n\nBut I digress. Hatred was never intended to be a deep look at the physiology and mental condition of spree killers, and none of what I previously mentioned would at all matter if only Hatred was a fun video game, which it saddens me to say, it is not. At its core, Hatred is a fairly mediocre top down twin stick shooter. It’s gunplay is unexceptional at best and utterly frustrating at worst. Far too often the clumsy movement combined with the lack of a cover system means that often you will have no idea where you’re being shot from or indeed if you can hit a certain enemy that might or might not be behind a piece of cover. This issue is made even worse by the fact that Hatreds levels have no checkpoints, and should you die you will be forced to restart the entire level. The only way to get around that is to earn so called “respawn tokens” which do exactly what it says on the tin and can be obtained by completing certain side objectives, of which there are about two or three in each level. But perhaps the worst crime committed by Hatred, is being a boring video game.\n\nSome games are short but sweet, others are long and monotonous, however Hatred manages to combine the worst of both worlds, and even if you can pull yourself through the often frustrating combat, even then Hatred will become boring and repetitive long before the credits roll. Most of the levels here work in exactly the same way, the main character arrives in a certain area, after which you have to kill a certain number of people and then proceed to the next level. Rinse and repeat. There is practically zero gameplay variation on offer here and therefore the game gets repetitive extremely quickly. The same goes for the executions, which you will be doing a lot considering they are literally the only way to regenerate your health. Fortunately there is an option to skip the cutscenes which these executions trigger, because just like almost everything else it this game, they get old extremely fast. Any novelty that Hatred might have expires very quickly, which frankly is utterly unforgivable considering that the game itself is not very long at all. It personally took me a mere three hours to complete Hatred, and that is including doing just about all the side objectives in each level, so if you really wanted to rush this thing I could see someone completing the game in around 2 hours, but chances are you will probably get bored before you get there. Destructive Creations wants $20 or £15 for this game, and even if it was any good, which it clearly is not, I still highly doubt that many people would want to pay that amount for 2-3 hours of gameplay.\n\nThe only redeeming factor here are the games visuals. The almost exclusively black and white colour palette, combined with some nice film grain effects make for an aesthetically pleasing experience. Hatred also utilises Unreal Engine 4 and Nvidia’s Physics technology to bring a great deal of destructible terrain. Grenades destroy walls and send out flying particles, cars can drive through buildings and bullets tear up walls and architecture. Its truly impressive stuff, unfortunately it’s stuck in the middle of an otherwise un-exiting and outright boring game. But Hatreds problems don’t end there. For one things it’s terribly optimised, and at 1080p I saw the game constantly dropping below 60 frames per second on a very powerful dual GPU setup. The game crashed on me twice, I experienced an array of audio bugs throughout my play trough and the enemy AI is just simply awful. They either blindly rush your position, usually one by one, or simply stand around doing absolutely nothing.\n\nOn almost every single level, Hatred is frankly an underwhelming failure of a game. It, rather understandably fails to live up to all the hype that people have built up around it before it’s lunch, it fails to present itself as a piece of meaningful satire and most of all it fails to be an enjoyable  video game. It’s short, repetitive and looses any sense of novelty within the first hour of playtime. It will not inspire any spree killers and it won’t turn gamers into sadistic lunatics with a thirst for innocent blood. But you probably already knew that. Instead Hatred commits the greatest crime a video game can commit, at the end of the day, it is simply boring.","June 7, 2015","false","3.4"," 201 of 336 people (60%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","60","201","336","15","2"

That is certainly offensive to people but it's not why this game gets a negative review.  The problem with this game is not it's shocking content, it's with it's shocking lack of fun.

Despite all the negativity surrounding it, how 'tasteless' it seemed, and by god, the controversy... I just wanted to see how it fared as a game by its own merits.\n\nAfter playing through it, I can say that it was not worth the money, even if you can get past the awkward, probably disturbing themes to some. But even that wasn't all that disturbing. Death and murder comes so frequently, with so little consequence, reason, or realism that it's barely even worth mentioning.\n\nThe Antagonist's dialogue is amazingly terrible, and I'm torn as to whether or not it was done as a parody. Some of the lines are just so stupid that it's hard to imagine it being taken seriously, but.. who knows.\n\nThe game runs pretty terribly, usually hovering from 38-45fps on a GTX770, with some settings turned down even. It dipped as low as 20fps in a few parts, and frankly, the game's graphics don't justify it at all. The destruction of the environments was impressive at times, admittedly, but it was usually then that the framerate tanked the hardest.\n\nThe game is very short, it took about 3 hours to beat.. probably less if you're not terrible at the game like I was. It's extended through an archaic 'respawn point' system, where you earn a respawn by completing side objectives (kill more people or blow something up, that's about it), and each time you die, you'll spend a point to come back.\n\nIf you run out of points, you're put back at the start of the stage. This wouldn't be so bad if the way you recover health was by executing people.. and to do that, you need to shoot someone, or kick someone, enough that they fall down, but aren't quite dead. Then you execute them by pressing 'Q', an animation plays, and you recover some health.\n\nWith how difficult the final 2 stages can get, you'll find yourself dying and having to restart repeatedly. It makes the entire thing frustrating, I was just hoping that it would finally be over. Finally being after 2 and a half hours of game time. That's not a good sign.\n\nIf you're a fan of gore or excessive violence.. play something else instead.","June 1, 2015","false","3.5"," 187 of 314 people (60%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","60","187","314","5","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/341940/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2816 products in account","Hatred is a top down shooter game developed and published by Destructive Creations. The game was famously removed from the Steam Greenlight page due to the extremely violent content, but was later brought back with an apology from Gabe Newell.  The game was fully released in June 2015.\n\nThe game got a lot of bad press before its release again due to its supposed highly graphically violent content. There were calls for the game to be banned from Steam and banned from streaming services such as Twitch.tv.  After the release of the game, it turned out that it was not as bad as first though. Whilst the game does have dark tones which could be off putting to some but that is the case with a lot of video games nowadays.\n\nGame play in Hatred is fairly simple. Taking on the characteristics as other top down shooters, where you move around with WASD, shooting and aiming is done with the mouse. The tutorial is fairly informative, and does a good job at easing you into the hair raising gun scenes that you will be heading into. The missions in Hatred all have very clear and simple goals. Kill a certain amount of innocent civilians and also survive against the waves of cops and military personal that will be thrown at you. The early missions are very easy, you only have to kill a small amount of people, and the armed targets which you come up against are just regular cops, but as you progress through the game, you soon start infiltrating fully guarded army bases and nuclear power plants, as you can imagine these are all fairly heavily guarded, and you have to deal with a near constant stream of bad guys. Whilst you have a pretty large health pool, the only way in which you can regenerate your health is by executing someone who is trying to escape you; this replenishes your health to max. There is a good amount of guns to be found in Hatred too; from regular pistols, right up to rocket launchers, you can only carry three weapons at a time though.\n\nHatred has a very unique looking graphical style. The majority of the game is in black and white, with the odd inclusion of colour every now and again. This does make the game not look as graphically pleasing as others, but it still has a very interesting style which I enjoyed very much.  It fits the mood of the game perfectly. The game’s main character is voice acted in the cut scenes in between missions, as well as the odd snippet of dialogue in game too, and these are done at a mediocre standard, they are certainly not the best, but by all means, not the worst. It is definitely better than not having any voice acting at all.\n\nThis is a hard game, I struggled even on medium difficulty settings, and the later levels of the story mode are insanely difficulty to progress at times, just because of the sheer amount of enemies that get thrown at you at any moment. As soon as you clear one squad of cops, they send in another four or five as backup. You either have to be very quick at dealing with them, or have a good hit and run technique. The only way I found it possible to pass some stages, was to simply spam grenades, the deal catastrophic amounts of damage and am really fun to use.\n\nEach of the game’s levels are very large, not only do you have the main objective of slaughtering countless civilians and escaping, but the levels also include a minimum of three side objectives for you to complete, these can range from simply killing a politician during a rally, or maybe burning down some shops on the high street. These add a little something extra that takes you away from the sometimes repetitive job of the mindless killing.\n\nHatred is fairly short game, with only 7 levels I was slightly let down with the amount of content in the story mode. I managed to complete the game in just over two hours.  There is a survival mode which may end up being your cup of tea, but for me this just smells of repetitiveness after five minutes of playing. I would have liked to have seen at least another 7 levels out of the story mode.\n\nI had no major technical problems whilst playing. I did notice a slight stutter to game play when the screen is full of cops and army men shooting at you from all around - my frame rate did drop below 50 fps which was a little annoying, but was able to overlook since I was more focused on not dying. The game does feel a little wonky to control to begin with, but you soon get used to the controls.\n\nTo sum up, whilst Hatred definitely did not deserve all of the bad press it got prior to its release; the game does have a dark side to it, but no more than say the likes of GTA which is critically acclaimed. The game play is of a high standard which I thoroughly enjoyed – however the game is let down mostly due to the shortness and lack of content to play. The price of £14, 99 is a bit much for a game which I finished in two hours, so this is definitely going to be a game to pick up when it is on sale for less than £7.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dragnix/recommended/341940/","Dragnix","{FITH}™Dragnix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dragnix/","743 products in account","This Review was done with a key obtained from the developer.\n\nSummary:\nThis was a hard choice. Hatred definitely has some appealing elements to it in its great visuals, working with a reasonable art style and a good base engine at the core. The gameplay is where things start to falter. While you do have several objectives every mission to complete with a little bit of variety, it comes down to shooting dudes, and shooting more dudes. Now while that's what is expected in a top down shooter, the lack of variety in that is what is a huge problem over the long run, as a lack of enemy and weapon variety hurts the games overall execution.\n\nSeveral game design mechanics work against each other, as in particular the execution system being the only way to gain health does not work with the more high action elements of the game. I love the destruction system however. The final two levels difficulty level is through the roof even on the easiest of difficulties, mostly because of the level design themselves: where the game wants you to play long range when you don't have any good long range options. The controversy of the game is overblown as there is most definitely worse games out there in terms of content, although I will say the audio clips did get to me every so often.\n\nIn the end, this game is a tough one. It has strengths, there's no doubt about that, but it's the lack of gameplay variety that ultimately gives the game the game a 5.5/10 for me, which makes it an average game. I'd do a thumbs to the side if I could, but when it comes down to it, I put gameplay as my strongest criteria, and for that I have to not recommend the game: but consider it's strengths and what you're looking from the game in question.\n\nVideo Review and Gameplay Footage: https://youtu.be/mbkyD4IMH3M\n\nPositives/Negatives\n+:\nVery good art direction. The choice use of color to draw attention to elements in the environment does extremely well.\nGraphics are impressive and the use of the Unreal Engine 4 shows promise for games in the future, even when it's in a grayscale setting for most of it. Details on buildings in particular are rather nice.\nLove the destruction feature. I'm a sucker for a good destruction feature, but the fact of the matter is, this one has levels of detail, like being able to shoot a specific hole through a wall, that I haven't seen before. I want to see more of this in future iterations of games.\nSome of the side objectives did add some much needed variety, and several of the first set of levels did do a great job in keeping with the needed open type of levels you need in this game.\nMost of the time, the performance ran fine for me. While it's not boasting the best FPS, it was passable.-:\nGameplay when it comes down to it lacks major variety. A limited amount of guns and enemy types hurts the game and makes it feel stale rather quickly, which is a major problem.\nEnemy AI and civilian AI is dumb. I mean, really dumb. You expect some of it with the nature of the game (it is a target attack after all), but it's taken to a whole new level here, with people running at you, and soliders using rocket launchers on walls. I'm convinced that a pacifism run is possible.\nLast two levels in terms of design works against the game's overall game design, and makes a difficulty curve that goes through the roof.\nThe game's health mechanic works against the game's overall design elements, and really hurts the pace of combat. Same with the respawn tokens, especially WHERE they respawn you. A lot of travelling for no reason.\nSome weird camera angles at times, especially when aiming down the sights of your gun.\nGame is only 4 hours, and I find that the replayability lacks here with the lack of options.","June 1, 2015","false","6.4"," 775 of 1,351 people (57%) found this review helpful 40 people found this review funny","57","775","1","40","31"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aldershot/recommended/341940/","aldershot","[F!] Aldershot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aldershot/","2454 products in account","Hatred is an isometric shooter where you play as a psychopath who's out to murder thousands of people. The premise is simple, but also the very thing that garnered the game so much attention. The game plays well enough, and it's quite violent, but at the same time, I feel the media has made the game out to be worst than it actually is.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywrJsGtbSdc\nEach level of Hatred will provide it's own challenge and goals, many are quite linear, but there are missions where it takes a more open world sandbox approach. As far as gameplay goes, it's your standard issue isometric shooter. You can run, perform executions to replenish your HP, crouch, pick up new weapons, etc, basically, standard fare. One thing Hatred introduces to this genre is the idea of killing innocent NPCs. In other games where the option to kill innocent NPCs are made available, they rarely give the player any incentive to partake in the action, but Hatred doesn't just give incentive, it makes it the main point. The issue with this is, shooting NPCs that can't fight back is really boring! After a while, the police, swat, and military will show up, which makes the game a lot more enjoyable and interesting, but there are some missions where a large portion of it, is rather dull, gunning down hundreds of unarmed NPCs that offer no challenge what so ever.\n\nArtistically the game has it nailed down. It's heavily stylized with it's black and white aesthetics. Pops of red and blue are the only colors that line the game. The lighting and environments look great, brooding and gritty, very appropriate to the atmosphere. Hatred also features a low, brooding sound track, that never over powers, but adds a ton to the mood. It also features a physics engine that is sure to impress, as gun fire breaks away the walls that surround you. It's a great looking game! But be aware, the game can be buggy at times with NPCs flipping out, cars floating in the air, and other weird oddities.\n\nFor all it's controversy, Hatred is not the worst on the market. Mortal Kombat is gorier, Hotline Miami is more violent, and Postal 2 was more psychotic. The ONLY thing that set Hatred apart from the other games mentioned is that you play as a the villain that takes place in a (some what) realistic world. Basically, Hatred is controversial by concept only, the content of the game really isn't even a quarter as disturbing as the media would have you believe.\n\nOverall Hatred is a competent isometric shooter that has an edgy theme to it. The gameplay itself is nothing special or revolutionary but does the trick. The controversy surrounding this game is way overblown, and dosn't deserve the AO rating (M would be appropriate). At the end of the day, Hatred isn't bad, but it's nothing special either.\n\nPros:\n- Great looking style\n- Competent gameplay\n- Challenging (Once the police shows up)\n\nCons:\n- Does nothing new or special in terms of gameplay\n- Shooting NPCs that don't fight back can get boring.","June 2, 2015","true","4.6"," 123 of 208 people (59%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","59","123","208","5","0"

It rides 100% on the controversial nature of its content, and even thats a let down.\n\nLets start with the gameplay. Its boring. Quite possibly the worst twin-stick shooter I think ive ever played. Aiming in both normal and precise mode are floaty and inaccurate. Instead of a line pointing where your aiming you have a cross hair. Guess the devs dont realize its not a FPS and come to think of it this game would be a lot better if it where. Sure you can get an aiming line (In precise mode as I call it) but thats even worse, so much so that I never used it. In this mode you hold down the trigger that moves the camera away from your character to the area ahead. However the aiming in this mode is very twitchy. Combine this with the fact that this almost always leaves you unable to see your character leaving him open for attack.\n\nThe environments are ok I guess and I do like the destructible buildings, but you only get a few grenades and those are even more inaccurate and jerky then the guns. They try to go for this Sin city look with the black and white graphics but thats boring and sometimes a hindrance to gameplay as in dark areas you get stuck on things that are hard to see. For example in the second level you have to escape a sewer being swarmed by cops and SWAT teams. But more often then not its hard to see your enemies and if you fall in the watter your dead. You have to run to vault over things and you cant run in the water. So that leaves you moving slow till you can find a spot that you can walk out of the water. All the while your getting shot up by extremely dumb and unrealistic AI.\n\nAnd the AI is some of the most basic and dumb AI I think ive ever seen. Cops just rush you, with no thought of cover or tactics. A cop will run up alone and just start shooting you despite the fact youve got a shotgun and mowing down everything. The SWAT teams arnt any better as they take an unrealistic amount of damage and zerg rush you like the flatfoots do. And the civilian AI is even dumber than the cops, acting like mice locked in a box with a cat.\n\nSo in closing let me say this, the game has potential but its not worth the 20 bucks.  Full Disclosure I diddnt finish the game and am taking advantage of Steams new refund policy. Its an OK game but should be 5 bucks not 20.","June 5, 2015","false","1.2"," 51 of 81 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","51","81","0","0"

I was wrong.\nThe concept of the game is OK-Ish, but the controls are so incredibly bad that playing it just painful. Mouse+Keyboard or gamepad, both achieve the same result of making the game impossible to play.\n\nThis game got a lot of positive reviews as a result of the controversy that surrounded it, as a way to get back at the people who demonized it; I think that's bad. The game should be able to live on its own merits, and I'm afraid that's not the case. Just because you dislike the people who wanted to ban the game you shouldn't just pretend the game is good.\n\nWhat made Postal fun was that it didn't take itself seriously; Hatred takes itself WAY too seriously, so much so that playing is nothing but a cringe-inducing experience as you listen to some terrible and repetitive dialogue.

Brutal games. Shocking games. Games which earned age restrictions usually reserved for centenarians who are into ultra-porn. Only a handful of these games exist, and quite a few of them have earned their notorious ratings. Hatred is the newest contender to that throne, a game where human life is cheaper than your ex-girlfriend and bullets are plentiful. But for all its bluster and shock value, Hatred never becomes more than a game built on clever marketing and sometimes-capable gameplay.\n\nIf you’ve been living under a rock or inside a church with a particularly solid internet firewall, then Hatred’s story is pretty much easily summed as a kill-frenzy in shades of grey. It’s like playing through an extended version of the torture scenes from the 2005 Punisher video game, while your nihilistic antagonist spouts one-liners about culling the herd of humanity and how his retribution is justified.\n\nA twin-stick shooter, Hatred allows you to pop rounds off on an innocent populace, stopping every now and again to ease their misery by introducing their heads to an AK47 round or the cold steel of your knife on their throat. No one can stop you, cops are unprepared for your suburban genocide and the more you execute the more you heal. Reading that, the game sounds horrific. Especially when you realise how good some people are at it, and how easy it becomes to commit mass murder later on. The thing is, all of this doesn’t make the game any special.\n\nI’ve seen bigger uproars over players kicking a cat in GTA V or minions begging for their lives before being sliced to ribbons in Ninja Gaiden 3. But to me, they’re nothing more than pixels and coding, coupled together with some voice-acting and command prompts. And hell, I’m all for the idea of a population-thinner of a game. Half the time I was playing Hatred, I was imagining that the people that I was slaughtering were the same folks who clog up entire passages in shopping malls or fail to comprehend the idea of a moving walkway at airports.\n\nAnd on and on and on I killed. I worked my way through pedestrians, families, police stations, trains and a nuclear power station eventually. Holy crap, did it get boring quickly. There’s no real sense of guilt in committing these atrocities in the game, no sense of well-placed emotional regret for offing a random civilian, even when the game does a close-up of the wicked deed. There’s no emotional attachment whatsoever, as your cipher of a main character growls out clichéd dialogue and goes to work.\n\nThere’s also very little satisfaction, as the game made me feel numb. I genuinely didn’t care. Technically, the game is alright. You run around, shoot and chuck explosives. That’s the easy summation of the game. Targeting however, felt deliberately off at times, as players seem to only score enough hits to knock a civilian into a mercy-killing state, resulting in an inconsistent system of murder most foul.\n\nVisually, the game has a few neat ideas. Taking place with a subdued palette of only black, white and grey, colour is reserved for more shocking or explosive moments in the game. It works as long as you aren’t paying attention to the world around you, as the colour scheme often results in difficult scenarios where character blend into their surroundings too easily and making the game massively confusing as you seek to achieve your kill quota.\n\nIt’s just…I don’t even know. The game feels comically underwhelming when you really sit back and examine it. At best, Hatred is an average game, dressed up in controversy. It’s not even close to being as horribly charming as Postal was almost two decades ago, nowhere near as funny as Bulletstorm was and about as shocking as a soap opera ending.\n\nIf you’re looking for a certain thrill to accompany random acts of mass slaughter, you’ll find it in plenty of other games on the market today. Controversy can only carry a game so far, before it trips itself up. Overall 5/10.","October 27, 2015","true","39.1"," 30 of 44 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","30","44","0","1"

It's marketed entirely on its subject matter, its controversy - but that is it. For the first few minutes the game is exhilarating while you're just thinking “Holy ♥♥♥♥! I'm actually playing a game where I massacre a neighbourhood full of people!”. You throw grenades into a house party and massacre a funeral procession in a hail of bullets. But that quickly fades when you realise that the game is just that over and over.\n\nThe gameplay is dull, repetitive and boring. At times it feels borderline unplayable as the controls are clunky and difficult to the point of frustration - both with mouse and keyboard as they are with a controller.\n\nI’m sure many people will disagree with me and that’s fine. Hatred might be exactly the game you are looking for. I’m reminded of all the controversy that used to come with PS2 era GTA games, but without the fantastic end product. For me, Hatred is a less than average game built up by controversy to sell more copies.\n\nAll I can say is thank god Steam refunds came when they did.","June 18, 2015","false","0.5"," 126 of 217 people (58%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","58","126","217","3","4"

The devs have also done really well stabilizing the game and even adding the ability to remove the annoying film grain and chromatic aberration (plus other graphical options). I still can't recommend the game unless on sale.\n\nOriginal text: This isn't a bad game, just not everything it could be, and not worth its current price of $20. I also feel it didn't deserve the hype or the AO rating from the ESRB. But it's technically not the dev's fault about the hype, only those stupid media outlets.\n\nThere are 7 levels and most of them take place in an open outdoors area. The primary objective in most of them is simply to kill X number of people, then usually after that X number of some kind of law enforcement. Most levels have "side-quests" but really it's just going to the icon on the minimap and killing more people there. Completing these side-quests gives you a respawn point aka extra life. Once you run out and die you must start the level over.\n\nThe only way to gain health is to do executions on dying or stunned people. An interesting mechanic. By my count there's only about 8 guns in the game and 3 grenades. You've got a pistol, a machine pistol I only ever saw once on the train level (EDIT: It's an uzi and you do also see it on the next level),  3 different types of automatics, a shotgun, a flamethrower, and a bazooka. You can only carry 3 weapons at a time.\n\nPros:\n+The AI for the cops and such are simple yet very effective. When you get to the later levels and there's more than a couple they will always endeavor to flank and surround you. Makes it quite challenging.\n+Environmental destruction is really great! You can shoot/blow up walls to create new passages in a house if you want, or even drive a car into the house.\n\nNeutral:\n+-The aesthetic style of everything being in black and white except blood, explosive items, and anything lit by fire is interesting and not that bad, but I still would have much preferred everything to be in color. Because of lack of color everyone looks the same which ups the repetitiveness factor.\n+-The executions aren't bad, but with the exception of the foot stomps aren't particularly gory. What makes this neutral is that I wish there was a lot more executions to see.\n+-The main character is basically emotionless. Yes he has Hatred but it's always controlled. I feel they missed out on a lot of opportunities to up the fun factor if they gave him emotion and had him screaming and yelling at people, which would also enable him to be more emotionally involved in his killings and especially executions. All executions are silent regarding the main character, though sometimes he will say a line afterwards. I feel he should've had a wide variety of phrases to say during an execution such as brutally yelling "Die!" among many other possibilities.\n\nCons:\n-What is afflicting the vast majority of people including me is incredibly bad stability and very poor optimization resulting in terrible fps. Apparently it's a very common problem with Unreal Engine 4. The devs appear to be quite willing to work on these issues so kudos to them.\n-I hate how enemies can and will start shooting at you from off screen. In order to counter this you have to hold the right mouse button to do a fine aim which also let's you see further in the direction of your mouse pointer. Only problem is it doesn't work too well on areas below you and you can't rotate the angle (which is fine to me). What we need is a more zoomed out perspective, or enemies with shortened firing range.\n-Not enough screaming or reactions from the people you kill, especially civilians who I would expect to do that more. Sometimes they plead but it's much too underplayed I feel. Not enough emotion here either.\n\nI'm not a huge player of twin-stick shooters but this was one of the weakest that I've played. If this still looks interesting to you then I recommend waiting for it to get a nice discount.","June 3, 2015","false","53.8"," 133 of 236 people (56%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","56","133","236","4","9"

Visually, the game is quite painful to play, the art style is essentially black and white, with some colour in the explosions and some muddy crimson for the blood. That's it. Add shoddy bloom and blur effects and a grainy filter, and the game resembles a mess of black, more black and grey that is more straining on the eyes than helpfu.\n\nSound-wise, there isn't much to write home about, the gun effects sound standard, the music is "okay", but not noticeably interesting. The voice-overs just suck, the 'edgy' writing and 'loner' attitude wears thin even in the first level already, and without any variety you're getting fed up after the following level.\n\nLooking at the gameplay, the twin-stick shooter controls seem to work okay, though there are occasions where the "push L3 in, while moving, while shooting and pressing RT" is more cumbersome than fun or engaging, and more often than not do you get stuck on stairs, around fences or on scenery you didn't know was there in the first place. In addition, the "press LT to get a better view and snipe targets" feels too loosely integrated and removes you from the action more than was originally planned, purely because the right-stick movmements to find and shoot targets just feels too clunky. If you think of other twin-stick shooters and how deadzones or precision triggers work there you'll know what I mean.\n\nTo be brutally honest, would it not be for the subject matter, the game would probably not even get that amount of sales or "cult following" as it gets right now, so to some extent the developer did okay out of it I guess. Overall, the game is a mess, both gameplay wise and visually, the writing (or lack of) is below average, the music is forgettable and the levels - while large and offer some sense of freedom - don't entice you to explore them simply because of the simplistic clour scheme. The only reason I got this game was because I received a free copy, so thankfully I didn't waste my own money on this.","June 1, 2015","false","4.9"," 51 of 86 people (59%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","59","51","86","4","0"

As it is, the most fun to be had in the game comes almost entirely from the moments when the player breaks away from the mission structure and massacre everyone around without worrying about the context of its plot.\n\nThe game only has 7 parts but all of them offer great replay value.\n\nThe highlight of this game is mostly due to itself being very realistic. What I meant by realistic is that the AI in-game actually act like how real people do in the real world. The female AI of this game often tends to run away instead of fighting back even though they are brave feminists. The protecting forces of the game which consist of police offers, the SWAT team and also the army are all male, and never a single female, leaving all the men to die on their own. Just like in real life! Has it ever occurred to anyone that the engineer at the ending was a male instead of a female? Shocking truth!\n\nWhat the game lacks is diversity. Every single one of the civilians that you can kill in game are mostly normal citizens with no special traits aside from the difference in their skin color. To make the game as realistic as possible, the developers should have added AI like feminists or Social Justice Warriors like what Postal did. Besides that, there should also be gays and lesbians making out on the street. This should have already been implemented with no question ask since hipsters and drug junkies have existed in game.\n\nThe achievements created in this game are quite interesting as they contain references to other games such as Grand Theft Auto, Postal and the Witcher series. As you can see on my profile’s achievement page, I have gotten nearly every single Hatred’s achievement, they are really easy to accomplish and are able to be unlocked from time to time as you progress in game. The only achievement which I am having trouble unlocking is the one called “Feminist”. The objective to unlocking it is to kill 2000 men if I recall correctly. But sadly, I only shoot women. Due to this tough obstacle, I am unable to 100% the game. So I do hope they do something about it in the future as this achievement would also mark me as a feminist which I am not.\n\nThe game itself is not flawless but it clearly shows a promising future for a genre more like it to be produced and also be able to offer a lot of fun. Without a doubt this is the best open world shooting game in recent years. 9.5/10","June 5, 2015","true","272.1"," 42 of 71 people (59%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","59","42","71","14","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/excruciate/recommended/341940/","excruciate","Excruciate","http://steamcommunity.com/id/excruciate/","717 products in account","A decently fun game gameplay-wise is hampered by poor optimization and/or coding, some dumb game design decisions (namely the prehistoric and infuriating respawn/restart system), and only being 4-5 hours long with no real replay value. Basically this game will be forgotten as quickly as it was released. The framerates in the 1st level are around 40-50 and the rest of the game is around 35-45, usually around 40 during all the action. Of course it sucks, but was actually tolerable enough for this style of game to play through once. This game brings nothing new to the table & has zero mission variety (100% of missions are go here, kill X amount of ppl). The game is very hard even on easy, and I only beat it in normal time (around 4 hours) because I have enough skill as a gamer to bunker down and get it done.\n\nSome things to point out:\nThe difficulty spikes hard in the military base level when you get swarmed by military guys and just get shot down immediately, and that's even on easy. You can only beat it by being extremely careful and picking everyone off with long-aim fire. The respawn system is infuriating because say you have 2 respawns and you use them, you have to do the ENTIRE level over again... uhg. It's the same system games from 10-12 years ago used because technology didn't allow most games yet to have checkpointing. And on that level you die incredibly easy after you pick up the C4 and start making your way back through newly spawned guys who mow you down from off-screen, erasing the very careful 45 minutes of work I just did. I had to backtrack several times to replenish armor and at one point hide in a room and let the ignorant AI walk in one by one and pick them off that way. The shotgun is absolutely worthless after level 1 because it fires and reloads too slow and only holds 6 shells. It also can take 3 shots to down one guy if he has armor on. The shooting system is good but is made unnecessarily harder by the poor framerate. It makes your aiming somewhat slower like the game is in slow motion when all enemies have pinpoint accuracy and you can get swarmed and downed in seconds. Ducking and popping out of cover to fire is your best friend. Although there is no crouch toggle so you have to hold down crouch and mouse 2 to far aim and release crouch briefly to pop up and fire. Another problem is that sometimes things like rope sections in the train station for instance are similar in color to the floor so you get snagged on obstacles you can't really see while trying to get out of a room and just get shot down in a couple seconds by the military and cops. It happens a lot with other floor obstacles as well because you can't really see them, a lot of times also because the isometric view blocks a lot of stuff from view. I don't care how good a game is, I don't want to have to repeat an entire level because the developers for some ♥♥♥-brained reason decided to have a half-baked respawn system. It makes no sense and just makes it a chore to repeat entire levels in a average-at-best game.\n\nSome things about the game design are insanely stupid. Cars are drive-able but you never, ever want to be even anywhere near them because they catch fire and explode after only a few bullets hit them. Even armored army vehicles with mounted guns explode in a few bullet hits. The game is already pretty unrealistic but something like that should not for any reason be a part of a game. A lot of bullets exploding cars sure, why not, but not only a slight few. Cars irl are designed to not explode anyway. It's just plain brainless game design. I have gotten stuck between a garbage can and a tree when there is what should be a clear path between them. In the military base level they start you out in a army suv with a mounted gun. It is useless since it explodes in a few seconds, that is until you figure out how to ease forward then get back on the gun to kill a few more guys. The level is near impossible even on easy unless you spend the whole time aiming and killing from a distance with mouse 2. Even then it is still exceptionally easy to be swarmed out of nowhere and die quickly. Executions for health gain can be impossible to pull off when on levels like the military base bullets are hitting you from every possible angle. The game on easy mode is equal to what most other games are on their hardest modes. You can be shot from guys far off screen, farther than you can see even with long distance aiming. "He's on the roof!" a citizen yells about me when I am in the street. People can clip through walls while on the ground making execution animations blocked from view because your guy clips through it too to reach the person, or from just being behind a wall that the isometric camera is sometimes blocked by. On the military base lvl I was standing beside two green ammo boxes and they exploded like grenades killing me instantly when ammo boxes shouldn't explode like that. While trying to run vault through a big window, it was only working selectively, causing my guy to just stand there and take massive dmg rather than jump in and hide, i.e. the parkouring doesn't always work. Many times I run off from soldiers to find a civilian to execute for health, but many times it is simply impossible because no matter which way I go there are more cops/soldiers, which means death. In other words I wouldn't call this a action game more so than a be as careful as humanly possible so you don't have to redo a level type of game.\n\nIf it had a solid 60 fps framerate it would be a 6.5/10 at best because the gameplay is fun and well done despite some minor glitches and really stupid game design choices I pointed out. Is the game shocking? No. I'm somewhat desensitized to all violence in games because I've seen it a thousand times before. When I am playing I am not even thinking about the fact that I am some psycho slaughtering tons of innocent people, especially since in later levels they all pick up guns and fire back at you anyway. It just feels like another isometric shooter, albeit a decently fun time at that. The media attention this game got is undeserved because it is really just another average shooter and nothing more. The executions are awesome, but there are only a few different animations for it (around 6 or so, maybe a couple more) which sucks. Once you've seen them a few times, that's it, you've seen them and they will never be any different. And besides, in later levels you really need to turn the animation off to not get swarmed while doing them.\n\nMake no mistake, this game will without a doubt be forgotten very, very quickly. So because of p-ss poor optimization/coding, a sh-t for brained respawn/level restart system, and being very short, I will not recommend this. However if the frame rate is ever fixed I will gladly give it at least a 6.5 out of 10 minimum score, maybe even a little higher, because all problems I pointed out aside, it is definitely decently made and fun gameplay-wise. However even if the framerate was fixed which it most likely never will be, being only 4 hours long with no replay value is what puts the final nail in this game's coffin.","June 1, 2015","false","8.0"," 73 of 129 people (57%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","57","73","129","3","6"

Even with the price drop, it's not worth it.\nDon't let the youtube videos fool you, it has one good level that actaully has NPC activities (parties, police stations, a store) and makes use of the destructable enviroments, then the rest of the game is a series of completely standard shooter levels that were lazily slapped together to pad out the run time.\nThe game isn't bad or even horrible, it's a scam. They could have done better, that's he worst part. The first level is great, but short.

This game was wonderfully advertised for its controversy which is what has made the game so popular in the first place, but if only their ability to build hype was as good as their ability to build a decent game. If maybe a bit of extra thought or purpose was given to the game it might hold it's own a little, but shortly after the opening few minutes you have already done everything that you can.\n\nGraphically, the game has quite a nice gritty visual style which holds up in my opinion; the ability to smash through the destructible environments is a nice a touch. The violence, in terms of blood and gore, is actually fairly tame in comparison to many games that I have played which recieved nowhere near as much controversy. I guess context is probably what puts it into the AO ranks, though personally I don't think it deserves a rating that high; getting it an AO rating only surged its media publicity as being one of the few games to earn that rank.\n\nAll in all, this game shocked me, not because of it's pointless violence, frustrating controls (especially with a keyboard) and lack of any narrative at all, but just because it was boring and lacking in any substance at all. I'm all for video games being an open and free platform for people to create whatever they want in anyway they want to, but I am not for this game being used as an example for that statement as there is much more out there from Indie studios who deserve the publicity for a game that inspires further creativity and something positive.","June 3, 2015","false","0.4"," 107 of 193 people (55%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","55","107","193","3","0"

This game built a lot of hype with the trailers, but with the hype, came controversy. People complained that it was "sickening" and "distasteful." and, "This is why people are violent blah-blah yea sure whatever BS." I don't listen that crap though, it's a game.\n\nStory(?) ---\nSadly, there is no story to why the crusader is killing everyone he can. If there it, I probably haven't been paying much attention then, to hear about it. Hopefully, the DLC will provide a backstory.\n\nGameplay ---\nYou have 7 free-roam levels to conduct your killing-spree. The levels aren't really big, they're big enough to see some variation of buildings and scenery and plenty of open space. You can drive vehicles, but only limited to police squad cars, SWAT tactical vans (sometimes with a .30 cal), and Military Humvees (comes with .30 cal machine gun on top). Health system works by executing people. You execute a civilian or an enemy, you get a portion of your health back. If you die, however, you have to restart the level. However, you can earn respawn "tokens" by completing side objectives.\n\nEnemies ---\nIn the beginning, the first enemy you'll encounter are police officers. They are easy to take out, but in groups, they can take you out if you aren't careful. As you progress, you'll encounter SWAT units. These guys can take some hits before going down and are a bit of a challenge starting off. Here's a warning i'll give; these guys will flashbang you, making you vulnerable to gunfire, so try to keep your distance. Eventually, you'll take on the National Guard. They're like the SWAT units, only sightly tougher. A couple of these guys will sometimes carry a rocket launcher, so keep an eye out. Certain weapons will make easy work of all of these enemies. Civilians will also take up arms and fight back (one of the many aspects of this game that I love) against you. Speaking of weapons...\n\nWeapons ---\nWeapons range from handguns, shotguns, and an AK-47 in the beginning part of the game. Later, you'll get M-16s and Mac-11s, a flame-thrower and rockets. You can carry three of any with you at any time. You'll also get grenades, molotovs and flashbangs. So...pick your poison.\n\nExecutions ---\nExecutions are pretty good to be honest. They range from simple point blank headshots to real edgy style such as shoving your pistol into the mouth of an innocent civilian and pulling the trigger. Downside is that they get repetitive over time.\n\nSurvival Mode ---\nAs part of a free DLC, we got survival mode. Survival mode is straight-forward. Survive. You get three different areas that take place after the events of the Crusader's aftermath including a couple of new weapons, rank system, and three new characters for survival. A police officer who was mentally damaged by the Crusader in an attack, a chick who is considered a reject by society, and an ex-criminal. As the waves progress, the enemies become harder to defeat. Some enemies are color-marked with red skulls above them, these guys will take some hits before going down. There is an in-game "store" after each wave to where you can buy explosives and armor/ammo to aid you and give you a tactical advantage.\n\nConclusion ---\nIf Steam could allow me to give a so-so rating instead of thumbs up/down, I would give it that. It's not bad, then again, it could've been better. The only thing I wish there was is a story to what made him come to this decision to kill. It's a good game to kill some time on and to be honest, it's something different. We're always playing the good guys and anti-heroes who turns good. We're playing a full on antagonist.\n\n7/10","July 25, 2015","true","63.6"," 16 of 24 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","16","24","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/341940/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2973 products in account","IntroductionAh, Hatred… the game that was first in the progress of being greenlit, then quickly removed by Valve because it was deemed too controversial and then finally re-added (with some sort of apology). Given the history and success of controversial games like Grand Theft Auto and Carmageddon that can only be a good thing, right? Well…, not always apparently.\n\nGameplayWhile games like Grand Theft Auto and Carmageddon actually introduced some new - or at least improved – ideas to their genres, despite being controversial, this unfortunately doesn’t apply to Hatred. In reality Hatred is just another isometric action game. Here are some of the reasons why:\n\nThe story is straightforward, and not very deep: you had it with society and then just decide to murder everyone around you, unleashing Armageddon. You will start at your own home and then work your way through the city of New York. There sometimes are smaller, more linear levels where you have to just escape and move to the next place. But not without killing some people in the progress, of course.\nNow, I haven’t yet finished the game but I think I’ve seen enough of it to write a review. Unless there’s something that changes up the gameplay drastically 3/4th into the game, I think the review should be quite accurate.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=527952570\nSince the style is meant to be realistic you won’t find any weird, fantasy weaponry in this game. You will, for example, use pistols, shotguns, machine guns and several types of grenades in your quest to wipe every man and woman off of the face of the earth. As expected, you will be able to find better, more powerful weapons later in the game where you have to face more and tougher enemies.\nIn order to not get hurt you can always try to hide behind and inside buildings and other solid objects (enemies will sometimes try to do the same) but this is no guarantee to not get hurt because enemies often come from all sides and the bullets can literally fly anywhere you look.\nSpeaking of enemies: the difficulty seems to randomly spike up at times. What seemed so easy at first somehow instantly becomes hard(er). I encountered this several times during my sessions and I don’t think it’s me (but hey, I might not know myself as well as I thought).\n\nWounded people can also be executed which will (partially) restore your health bar. Later on in the game they will become harder to pull off, though. This is due to the fact you have to keep a careful eye on your surroundings as more and more enemies will appear and they will also take more damage before they die. Plus, you still can get shot while executing someone.\nStill, it’s a cool concept and the fact that the game sometimes switches to a third person view (showing the killing in much more detail) keeps the game from becoming too much of a borefest.\n\nI do think the camera is a little too close to the character. At times it certainly would’ve been nice if we could zoom in or out ourselves to get a better overview of what’s happening and where. The minimap generally does a good job at trying to show you this information, but I’m afraid that it sometimes isn’t enough and you just want to see things for yourself.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=527952620\nThere are also vehicles at your disposal, like police cars and SWAT cars. However, they won’t be of much use to you since the controls are just horrible. You have to use the left stick to gas and brake (pushing forward and backward) and the right stick to steer left and right. Sounds easy, right? Nope. I think people will eventually get used to them, but they’re anything but intuitive. I guess the reason for this is because otherwise you would drive just around creating havoc and as a result it might make the game (a little) easier.\n\nTechnically the game is more than okay, but the framerate does fluctuate regularly. This might be because of the implemented physics system because otherwise I have no idea what could be causing it. It’s not the most technically advanced game I’ve ever played so maybe with some extra months of polishing we would’ve been able to play it with a rock solid framerate. A missed opportunity.\n\nAudio & VisualsThe songs are generally what you would expect in a game like this: it’s hard - metal-like - music and it fits the mood just perfectly. The sound effects are solid, too, and the voice acting ranges from okay to mediocre, but given everything that might just be a good thing. It certainly keeps things lighter, although it remains a very bleak game nevertheless.\n\nAh yes, the graphics… This is where the game really shines and I’m not being sarcastic here. As you can see by looking at the screenshots everything is shown in black and white, while other elements (blood, some types of lights and explosions, for example) still show up in their original colors. If you’ve ever seen Sin City then you have a good idea of how it will look. Everything is nicely detailed and animated, except for some of the faces, but this is usually only seen up close when the game switches to the third person view and is therefore not a big deal. Overall it’s a very good looking game.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=527952644\nLength/Replay ValueI never expected to say this, but as you can see I became bored about 3/4th into the game. It’s by no means a terrible or bad game, but it all becomes repetitive way too soon, resulting into boredom. Then again, I guess that’s what one should expect from a game in this genre. I’ve been told the game lasts about 4-5 hours and if you play on Extreme you can expect it to be twice that figure.\nSo ultimately not very long but long enough. I might finish it up later, but for now I’ve seen enough.\n\nConclusionHatred certainly looked interesting the first time I saw it in motion and I was definitely intrigued by all the controversy. After having played it myself I can hereby tell you that they’ve created a good, but still very repetitive and shallow action game. I think the developer tried too hard to create something controversial that - in combination with the depressing tone and setting - ends up looking unique and pretty, but at the same time is just not very much fun to play.\nGrab it to see what it’s all about, but, unless you’re a hardcore action game lover, it’s recommended to wait for a sale.\n\nToo long, didn’t readPros:\n+ Visually beautiful\n+ Some big open levels\n+ Side objectives\n\nMixed:\n+/- Random difficulty spikes\n+/- While most of the controls work fine I’d have rather seen a different/better control scheme for choosing weapons (with the controller)\n+/- Would’ve been nice if we could manually zoom in and out\n\nCons:\n- Vehicle controls are absolutely terrible\n- Shallow gameplay\n- The tone is a little too serious and this results in the game not being any real fun (only in shorter sessions maybe)\n- Performance issues\n\nPlease note: a Steam key for this game was provided by the developer.\nRating: 6.0 (out of 10)(Ratings aren’t calculated based on a formula, but on my personal feelings)\n\n\nWant to read more of my unbiased reviews?

As it was to be expected this game was heavily inspired by the original Postal.\n\nPros: Good graphics considering the genre.\n"Noirish" visual style, that fits very well the overall atmospshere, it clearly reminds me of Sin City, with red, yellow and blue being the only tones emphasizing the most vivid (and interactive) elements (like fire or blood) in this otherwise gray world.\nDesctrutible environement, drinving a stolen police car through someone house while they were having a party was lot funnier that it should have been.\nRealistic fire dynamics, the fire spread in a (semi)realistic way, opening quite a few tactical oppotunities on how to deal with groups of enemy when it closed spaces (grilled SWAT is best SWAT). Just dont expect to set fire to a building and  see it spread to the whole city.\nDrivable vehicles, you can drive stolen security forces vehicles (police car, SWAT truck, military HMMV), and it's quite alot of fun, just remember those things are ♥♥♥♥ing deathtraps.\nVERY challeging, as to be expected for game inspired by the 90ies, gunfights are brutal and you'll need you to make good use of cover, and your limited ammo. Playing on hard (medium difficulty) it really forces you to "git gud" if you want to proceed above level 2.\nMOD SUPPORT, I really believe this engine has lot of potetial, and with the incoming mod support we'll surely see some really interesting stuff. Cons The AI can be quite dumb, need improvements.\nThere is no stealth, security forces seems to always know where you are.\nWe need more variations for NPCs civilian clothes, and female faces.Some people seems to be complaining about the lack of a serious plot, or that the gameplay is repetitive and "all you have to do is kill kill and kill", that is surely correct, but maybe they should check a game description before buying it, considering that was ADVERTISED to be the point of the whole game.\n\nConlusionHatred is a nice little (HARD) game, that deliver exactly what it promised nothing more nothing less.","June 16, 2015","true","17.9"," 28 of 47 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","28","47","2","2"

I'd be lying if I didn't say I had fun playing this title but my only complaint would be that the gameplay aspect of it is underwhelming to me (shallow, short, not much replay value, and clumsy unpolished technical hiccups), but personally I love the title for what it is and the context of it, that being a game which is solely about being evil and conveying hatred. I hope this raises the bar for what can be tolerated by the media in videogames and paves the way for more games that are downright mean-spirited and dark to the core in the future, playing as an absolute sadistic scumbag was very enjoyable.

I haven't died very much until the military base mission and it's already started to get on my nerves, it's not so much a 'git gud' feel to this feature but more to make the player get angry and quit playing. And for having to restart a hard mission four times without getting a chance to respawn, playing each time for about 15 to 30 minutes and trying hard to survive, I just stopped the game.\n\nI want this to be a good game, and gameplay wise it's nice, but with this feature it ruins the experiance for me.\n\nAnother thing, kicking at enemy S.W.A.T members or soldiers seems to do nothing, and they just keep shooting you or your character misses. They don't even stumble they just keep shooting at you and it really tears up your health if you're seeking them out for a well-deserved execution for more health, but instead they just kill you. To me this appears as more of a gameplay flaw than it being intended to happen and it's really discerning.\n\nNow most of these problems would be problems if it weren't for the respawn issue, but as far as I have seen those are the primary issues. If there happens to have no future moddable features, map builders, potential multiplayer if you ever consider it, I would not recommend it. In it's current form it puts me on the fence, but recommending this on steam is through generosity and the fact it's fun to play, also because of external factors not relating to the game but moreso media and it's cultural marxist-esque deviants that crawl out of their hole of a basement every once and a while to spew garbage from their mouths as useful idiots, even though they still are just on the internet.\n\nSo thanks for the game, it feels like it needs a couple more tweaks to the features, future features and such and a HUGE THANKS to stepping up to media, intellectuals and SJW's alike.\n\nNathan Explosion voice mod incomming.","June 6, 2015","true","2.5"," 39 of 68 people (57%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","57","39","68","3","1"

Enemies at the very edges of the screen will stand idly if they are just guarding a position, allowing you snipe them relatively easy.

Here's what you need to know:\n\nDoes it run well? Not really, the first few levels seem okay but after that I turned down everything and it only made a little difference.\n\nIs it a real game? Yes, it's difficult and is fun for the first few hours.\n\nDoes the joke go stale? Yes, I enjoyed it for a few hours total and am probably done with it.\n\nIs it satire? Yes, I still think it actually is.\n\nShould I buy it? Only if you like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ off people who wanted it censored. On it's own it isn't anything special.\n\nIf you buy it use the right-click.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSo, I just got here after being shot to death by police for the 100th time, and I feel like I have to write a review on this game because it's soooo controversial or whatever. I bought this when I was extremely drunk and had just talked with a nice lady on the phone who reminded me that I had a $250 deposit coming back my way and I instantly thought "Hey, I can spend some of this on something stupid!"\n\nSo to the review. I bought this because I like buying things people don't want me to have, and this was one of those things, like assault rifles or enriched uranium. I'm sure you've heard about the attempts to censor this game because it's so spooky and will lead kids to shoot their friends and ♥♥♥♥ their dog. However, after playing it, I'm embarrassed that this is one of the few AO rated games.\n\nRemember when this same moral panic happened at the turn of the century and we got Postal 2? I bought Hatred because I assumed it would be similar. For those of you who don't know, Postal 2 has you run around performing tasks where you can usually act normally, but have the option to just massacre people because the line at the bank is stupid long. It's really funny, and I actually can't tell whether Hatred is the same way. It's funny, but I'm not sure if it's intended. My current theory is that it is really subtly satirical. Supporting this is the fact that I heard Hatred Guy quote Postal Guy saying "Only my weapon understands me". I'm pretty sure the devs are sitting there laughing at people who get offended by games.\n\nTo me, Hatred is funny as hell. I swear, everything he says sounds like a /b/tard circa 2005, in that it's a terrible attempt to sound cool or scary and it just sounds like a teenager trying to be edgy. I physically laughed at at least half of the things I heard Hatred Guy say during executions.\n\nSpeaking of executions, they're the only real reason to kill unarmed bystanders since it heals you. I had many experiences where somebody half-♥♥♥♥♥ yelled something like "Please don't shoot!" and I thought to myself "That sounds good, I need all of my ammo for the 100,000 cops I see coming my way on my mini-map so as long as they don't hurt me you should be fine."\n\nAlso, the AI bystanders are a combination of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and idiots. The former because as usually happens, I ran past somebody who yelled "don't shoot me" and since he wasn't part of what I can only describe as a side mission I couldn't be bothered to shoot him. Side missions allow you to respawn with the gun that IS OUT OF AMMO if you kill enough people who only half care whether they live or not. Anyway, this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ begs me not to kill him and I have no reason to so I don't. I have a rare experience where I actually manage to kill most of the SWAT team that just showed up but I'm hurt so I start executions on the ones still squirming. During an execution I see this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ pick up a shotgun from one of the people I shot and he blasts me down as soon as I finish. It was pretty awesome and throws the whole "you shoot defenseless people" argument out of the window. They're idiots because one time after I defended against half of the police force some woman turned to me and asked "Is that real?" I assume referring to my gun.\n\nWhen I bought this game I didn't expect to like it and mostly purchased it while posing on top of my pedestal of freedom. I do like it though, because it's really hard. I had a lot of trouble with the policemen and that was made far worse when the SWAT team showed up, though it seems to take ages for them to deploy. I remember a moment that sums up the game pretty well. I ran towards an icon on the mini map and when I got close Hatred Guy said something about "hunting the hunters". I thought, "That doesn't sound good!" and was instantly killed by about 8 people with shotguns. Since then I've returned to the game several times to prove to it that I'm not a scrub.\n\nYou should buy this game if you want to stick it to the people having a moral crisis over it existing, or like challenging gameplay. Otherwise, it's easy to live without it. Also it plays like ♥♥♥ sometimes.\n\nUpdate: After playing for quite some time I realized that you can see father if you hold right-click.","July 12, 2015","true","18.6"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","71","10","14","5","0"

And that may be enough to some people. But Hatred has way too many problems to be considered worth 20 bucks.\n\n(If you don’t want to read my entire rant, there will be a list of the overall problems with this game at the bottom or the review)\n\nHatred’s gameplay is almost non-existent. It’s a duel stick shooter, where the objective is to kill anyone and everyone because our protagonist, named Not Important, hates everyone and everything for no stated reason. The appeal of a no holds barred killing spree is a fairly large one, the popularity of GTA and other open world sandbox games have proven that. But this game flops due to its repetitive nature. The entire game is shoot everything and occasionally press Y to do a poorly animated finishing move. That’s the game.\n\nBesides being just plain boring, the controls are janky and hard to do anything with, and the game switches between “♥♥♥♥ easy” and “Run the ♥♥♥♥ away or die hard”. Not to mention that the framerate is absolute garbage if you don’t lower the graphics to a point where the game looks like ♥♥♥, and the monochromatic styling of the game makes everything just generally harder to see.\n\nMr. Important is also not winning any acting awards anytime soon. The point of the game’s existence is to be as dark and disturbing as physically possible. Not Important manages to not just kill the people, but to kill the mood as well. The man is hilarious! He’s a walking talking teenage edge machine! Everything he says is either about how much he likes killing people, or swear words (usually both), and it’s all in the darkest, most gravelly voice that I have ever heard. The man has no character, he doesn’t have a personality, he doesn’t have a backstory, and he doesn’t have ANYTHING that could make him a real person. The man isn’t scary because he’s so over the top and unrealistic.\n\nAnd the game isn’t even good on its “EXTREME VIOLENCE” selling point. When the people you’re killing scream, they rarely sound convincing enough for you to actually think they’re real people you’re taking the lives of. And when they do, Not Important ruins the atmosphere by saying edgy ♥♥♥♥ to himself. The blood and damage you inflict on people are hilariously bad. When you shoot someone in the face with one of your pre-animated finishing moves, your victim’s face looks like what happens when you shoot a gmod ragdoll in the face. No splatter, no hole in the head, no blood running from your victim’s skull. Just a gmod blood mark. If you don’t know what that looks like, just google “gmod blood” and go to images, it’s hilarious. And when you stab someone in your finishing move, I don’t think there is any blood at all, I know for a fact you don’t leave stab marks. Your knife literally just clips through them to death. The death effects might be better with the graphics up, I doubt it, but even if it was, it doesn’t matter because the framerate was chugging with the game’s default graphics setting! My computer may not be the best, but it sure as hell should be able to handle a game’s default graphics setting! I don’t even think this should be an adults only game. Besides the concept alone, and Not Important occasionally dropping the C-bomb, this game isn’t THAT bad. It’s even tamer then some M for mature games I’ve seen.\n\nAnd that’s what really disappoints me, the fact that it’s not that bad! If it had repetitive gameplay, janky controls, horrible characters, but did the one thing that it advertised really well, I would have considered it a decent game that delivers what it promises. If it was more brutal, more gory, more disturbing, it would have done what it wanted to accomplish!\nBut as the game is now, I’d pay 5 bucks for it. But as a 20 game, it’s just not worth it.\n\nThings I disliked about hatred:\n-Too expensive\n-Boring and repetitive gameplay\n-Bad Framerate/ bad graphics\n-Protagonist you can’t take seriously\n-Not brutal enough\n-Janky controls\n-Lack of any story or motive\n-Many clipping and camera bugs\n","September 7, 2015","false","2.0"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

You can tell from the execution scenes that the whole gave is actually 3d, but outside of cutscenes and executions the camera stays in a 3/4 perspective, which works well.  I also like the horror movie vibe from the background sounds and grainy video effect.\n4) There is no story.\n\nI'm enjoying it, but wouldn't recommend it for anyone expecting a rewarding experience.

When a game revolves around controversy, it usually end up relying too much on it. This game does that. It's a game that says "Hey look, you can kill police, soldiers, and even civilians!" ... But does it say anything else? No... Not really. The respawn system is a joke. I made it to the mission where you raid a militery base, and can't bring myself past that level. It's so utterly boring... if the respawn system wasn't total ♥♥♥♥ and actually let you respawn without the dumbass tokens, I think there might be a chance that I'd actaully enjoy this game. I like difficulty... but It's like TotalBiscuit said... Developers doing this ♥♥♥♥ in 2014-2015 is unacceptable. I could see if the tokens where only used in hard or normal difficulty, but when I'm in easy getting mowed down by 50 armed soldier... and I get overwhelmed, I have to start completely over. Nothing is more repetitive than having to kill the same faceless zerg-rush enemies over and over again. The devs must not have really thought about it, 'cause having to restart the mission over if you have no tokens really puts emphasis on how terribly cheap the AI is. They'll just swarm you all at once and usually you can't defend yourself. There are still times where enemies that I can't see are shooting me. I don't really know.. but this game needs a lot of work.","August 28, 2015","false","5.8"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","69","9","13","3","0"

I love this game, I never get bored of watching that physics engine in action and since the last update (2nd June) the performance is MUCH better for me so plays a lot better (I'm running i7 5930K and GTX780 at time of writing).\n\nThe game is pretty hard, taken me an hour just to get to level 2 but thats fine I enjoy the challenge. The AI needs some work to be fair but the visual style they went for works perfectly, black and white noir style with some limited colours from things like police car lights.\n\nYes the game is quite limited, only a few weapons types, no level up or upgrade paths but who cares.. thats not the game its trying to be, runing and gunning, thats all you need. The controls are pretty simple, of course as a PC gamer i prefer K/M but dont seem to have any problems.. the run / drop kicks are pretty fun.\n\nI've also heard some people aren't to happy with the checkpoint save system... but it seems pretty fair to me. in fact, Renegade ops uses pretty much the same method but no one seem to question that? (you do start with the lives rather than earning them but lose them all and you gotta start the whole level again too).\n\nI can see why a lot of people would get bored and the content is limited but listen, I'm a BIG fan of the first postal game and this plays just like that.. better even.. Devs have done a great job and look forward to what else they can bring to the gaming table in the future.\n\nIn closing, I feel that a lot of people are being negative about this game just because of the whole issue with the media plus the fact most people on the interwebz are a$$holes and not really judging the game itself which isn't fair... so my comments today are to help even up the playing field and to recommend it based on the game itself and not on the controversy that surrounds it.","June 3, 2015","true","4.8"," 21 of 36 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","21","36","2","0"

I never seriously intended to hurt or kill anyone. I have killed lots of bugs, but that seem to be acceptable, except for a friend who manage to cry when I squashed a whole bunch of ants in my kitchen wall.\n\nI have played a lot of violent games, and did a lot of virtual killing in games like CoDs, GTAs, America's Army, Vietcong and countless others. When I first heard about HATRED I felt really excited that someone had the guts to create and sell such game.\n\nTo fight hipocrates who can accept violence at endless levels for any other media BUT NOT videogames is something that I think that must be very hard to do, mostly because such people regard themselves as "rulers of modern society" and really do think that they can dictate what is "good" and what isn't.\n\nI have lost a few so called friends over the discussion of what this game means. I would often point out that the game does not have to mean anything at all, but the negative reactions towards it must be very well analysed. People have the right to think whatever they want about something, but to ENFORCE it over others ... that's a bit too much in my opinion.\n\nThe game is good. The engine is promising, I loved pretty much everything on it.\n\nThe executions shocked me at first, but after sometime, I would just think of it as a mean to regenerate health.\n\nI played up to the military base level using a gamepad, but when I discovered that mouse and keyboard were much better to aim ... I really became a much better killing machine.\n\nI sincerely hope that you all at DC keep up the good work and bring more games and content like this.

The script is hilarious, its rude and language is vicious.\n- The executions are brutal and i loved it as a health regeneration mechanic as it lead to some tense moments.\n- Taking on hordes of police, civilians with weapons and soldiers leads to some challenging moments where your only option is to run.\n\nCONS:\n- Driving is clunky and frustrating.\n- Weapons, theres a serious lack of them and no melee weapons is a serious downfall.\n- Bugs, for the most part my experience was good but it did freeze on at least 4 occasions when explosions occurred.\n- Short, the story is only 2 and a half hours long and other modes are limited, this means its incredibly overpriced at £14.99.\n- None existent story, its just a poor excuse for killing people really and is daft. Optional side quests are also pretty pointless but you might as well do them otherwise the game will be over before you know it.\n\nVERDICT?\nI had fun with this game so I'm gonna say its worth buying but £14.99 is a rip off for this game and I only recommend getting it for £5 or less.","September 27, 2015","true","6.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I played it a bit, realized this was one of the worst games I have ever played, and, since conviniently enough Steam Refunds came out around this time, I got my twenty bucks back and told the friends on my list not to buy it. I thought about reviewing this game a while back, but I passed on the thought, mostly because I don't like to write negative reviews, out of all I've done at this point I've only downvoted two, one of them because there wasn't a "meh" option or something of the sort, and besides, I didn't even think it was possible to review refunded products. But I did a bit of thinking between the last time I played it and now and I realized that this was one of the worst games that I ever played and I couldn't let it get away from me. I had to warn people how much this game sucked. This is, so far, the worst game of 2015 to me. And no, it isn't because I'm one of those always butthurt SJW's who get mad at the slightest hint of violence, my most played game right now is Grand Theft Auto 5, obviously I don't care about that. And while this game does disgust me, I don't hate this game just from a morality standpoint, I hate this as a gamer. This game reeks of bad programming and lazy development. If you're not sure yet, then read on.\n\nSTORY: You are The Crusader. You despise all of humanity and decide to go on a rampage to kill as many people as possible. That's it. Yeah. It doesn't have any social commentary, any witty dialogue, or anything. It's just a really bad story that the people there put no effort into at all.\n\nGAMEPLAY: The game is a top down isometric shooter, similar to the Halo Combat Evolved games or even Hotline Miami if you want to stretch it, though this game differs from those two by sucking. I played this on my keyboard since, at the time I didn't own a gamepad, and the keyboard controls are bad and I hear that gamepad support for this wasnt much better. You carry three weapons and grenades and you go around killing people. That's it. There are side objectives where you go after specific targets or just blow things up, but that's the most variety with it. There are some executions as well, which are kind of cool for about the first ten times before you realize they repeat the same 5 over and over again. Driving in this is terrible, it feels wonky as all hell. Now, most defenders of the game say you do basically the same thing in, say, GTA or Battlefield or CoD. The thing is, in GTA the cops will go after you if you start shooting people and more go after you the more you do it. You have a clear incentive not, the game punishes you for it. And if you don't want to kill people, you can go play Pool or Tennis or Golf or something, you don't have to just go around and kill people. In Battlefield or CoD, you have a reason to kill them in Singleplayer and Multiplayer: they're part of a rival army and you're at war with them. War is kind of like that. Also, in all three games I mentioned, THE CONTROLS ACTUALLY ♥♥♥♥ING WORK! In Hatred, that's all you do. Kill, kill, kill some more, kill those people over there, that's all. It gets repetative quickly, and the gameplay itself doesn't work properly.\n\nGRAPHICS AND PERFORMANCE: The game is very dull with it's colors, like LA Noire with the black and white setting. There is a neat little idea that fire is the only source of color, which is kind of neat, but trust me, that's the only thing this game has going for it. The difference between LA Noire and Hatred is that with that, I got the maximum 30FPS on PC, which is kind of meh for most people, but I can play it I guess. Hatred never went above 20FPS for me, there was even a section where it averaged out to 5FPS. I had it on the lowest settings and the lowest resolution as well, so don't think it was because I had settings on too high. I had the lowest settings and it ran terribly. The optimization of this game sucks so much that Jenna Haze is blushing.\n\nCHARACTERS AND VOICE ACTING: The Crusader, the main character, is basically if the love child of Duke Nukem and Marilyn Manson smoked a whole pack of cigarettes every hour. There aren't really any notable characters, just nameless civilians and random people. This is not a very character rich story, though I hope most people would realize this.\n\nFINAL VERDICT: Hatred subverts numerous tropes that most good games have nowadays; good gameplay, playable framerates, having a story, good taste, and fun. 2.5/10, this game is terrible. Worst game of 2015 so far for me. To all the Germans and Aussies and whoever missed out on this game because it was banned in your countries, don't worry, you miss nothing. To all the people who passed on this game, good job, you saved twenty bucks. To all the people who still defend this game, stop it, you give this game more press than it needs. I despise this game, I found nothing good from this game, you could say that I have nothing but hatred for Hatred. Save your money for Grand Theft Auto 5 or Battlefield 4 or something like that, they're waaaaaaaaaay better games than this and you can kill a lot of people in either.","August 14, 2015","false","1.7"," 20 of 35 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","20","35","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yij/recommended/341940/","yij","Yij","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yij/","391 products in account","Summary\nHatred is a sick violent sociopathic mass murder simulator. You hate the world and have a sole purpose in life: to commit an unspeakable act of genocide in order to… well, because the main character is angry and feels like it.\n\nPlays out the same as Postal and the Alien/Zombie Shooter series. Run around densely populated areas indiscriminately gunning down every man and woman in sight, innocent or otherwise. Pick up new guns, complete small side objectives to earn respawn points, and aim to kill a certain percentage of the population before being allowed to progress to the next level, or die trying. Rinse and repeat, and that’s all there is to it.\n\nIrky controls, lacklustre storyline, performance issues and repetitive gameplay. Does that make it a bad game? ♥♥♥♥ no! It’s the PERFECT game to relieve stress after a double shift at work. Feels bloody good to just forget about all that open-world-zombie-crafting-XP-multiplier ♥♥♥♥♥ and just kill everything in sight. And don’t tell me you’ve never went on a killing spree in GTA or whatever.\n\nKiddie Steam reviewer verdict: “killed 100 people. Cops came, also killed them. Army came, killed them too. I am an unstoppable death machine. Ran to the exit, car ran me over, killing me instantly. 7/10 would mass murder again."\n\nGraphics\nYup, you’re looking at a depressing monochromatic art palette, the only other dominant colours being yellow and red, for fiery explosions and blood respectively. The dark visuals excellently portray just how dark and sinister the game theme is, though at times can be more of a hindrance as NPCs and objects start to merge into the background. You’ll often at times struggle to notice minute details in the game world, such as the dude pointing a 12 gauge shotgun at you who you just ran past. The black and white style is not for everyone, but it’s done with intention.\n\nSound\n\nI need to say this right off the bat, the soundtrack is AMAZING and fits perfectly with Hatred. You know that sort of game where you start it up for the first time, hear the menu music and think “♥♥♥♥… did this game just speak to me??”, well this is that sort of soundtrack you can expect.\n\nThe score is dark, moody and twisted, with the opening menu music letting you know exactly what’s in store for you. The music throughout the campaign entails a great sense of progression, as earlier levels quietly spew out depressing music with creepy undertones, then gradually getting more upbeat and chaotic as the final levels release bombastic crescendos as you pass the point of no return in your genocide crusade, with the grand finale blasting you with organ church-esque music as you reflect on your blood-ridden journey.\n\nThe soundtrack has been extremely well thought and I can’t stress how well it ties in with the game theme and level design. For those interested, the talent behind the music also composes for The Witcher series (fantastic score in those!).\n\nGameplay\n\nThere really isn’t much to the controls. You can run around gunning down anyone in your path, switch to a slower and slightly cumbersome fine-aim mode, or karate-kick people and throw grenades. Let it be known that the controls aren’t as fluid as you would like and you will encounter problems like getting stuck in doorways or having difficulty judging line of sight to your target. The controls definitely need a while to get used to, and even still it’s far from perfect.\n\nSurprisingly, there is much more depth and strategy involved than you would think. Sure, during earlier segments you feel like the Terminator as it seems no one is capable of bringing you down, until you encounter SWAT and the army, who will hunt you, flank you and kill you. Hatred is brutally hard, and you will die, restart, and die many times until you formulate strategies, know when to retreat and how to set up killzones.\n\nYou can perform executions on people in order to regain health, which shows a graphic animation of your character shooting/stabbing or stamping on the hapless individual in question. The animations get dull after the 50th time so thankfully you can switch it off, however sadly that turns off all the cool and cheesy one –liners the character spews out.\n\nThere are only a handful of levels in the campaign, with each getting progressively more and more difficult. Each map is heavily populated by hundreds of NPCs going about their daily lives, and it’s up to you to ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ up and lay waste to anything that moves. You generally have to kill a certain number of innocent people and defeat waves of various law enforcement agencies before being allowed to progress to the next map. You get a limited number of respawns which can be increased by doing minor side missions.\n\nDestructible environments\n\nHatred does push the envelope and offers players REAL destructible environments that dynamically alter gameplay. Trapped in a room with low health whilst SWAT is closing in through the front door? Just blow a huge effin' hole in the back wall and escape from there! Spotted a cheeky patrol of officers cleverly hiding in the room next to you? Shoot holes in the walls with your high calibre machinegun allowing you to target the officers in the other room!\n\nThis is true destructible environment and not predetermined “I can destroy this glowing wall but not this wall that looks exactly the same but isn't glowing.”\n\nPerformance issues\n\nHatred unfortunately bares inconsistent frame rates during the campaign, much less so during survival mode. Personally it’s not a huge issue with me as it’s never dipped below the uncomfortable realms of the minus 20 mark. Still, if you’re a 60fps freak than you need to check to see if your specs are on par with Hatred’s requirements.\n\nIs Hatred a sick evil game that should be banned?\nThe answer is sadly, no. I could blabber on all day about how the media brainwashes you to think a certain way, but if you’re a mature adult you already know that by now. The fact is if you’ve played GTA, Fallout and many other games, you’ve already committed mass murder. Also no one seems to mind that GTA has an unskippable interactive torture scene, whereas Hatred just has you kill and blow ♥♥♥♥ up. Nothing to see here, move along.\n\nAlso the developers Destructive Creations should be applauded for their marketing the game. They never lied about what their game was about and never tried to sugar coat anything in order for people to buy. They offered a game where you play a mass murderer and can destroy the environment and nothing more. No promise of XX hours, day 1 DLC and the normal ♥♥♥♥♥ AAA companies do now days. This is gaming in its purest form and does exactly what it says on the tin.\n\n\nConclusion\nHatred is a Sick twisted arcadey game, make no mistake, but it's nothing you haven't done before in a violent video game. Whilst it’s extremely short, has quirky controls and some performance issues, it’s a brilliant game to blow off some steam after a long stressful day at work.\n\nThis angry chef approves of Hatred and will be playing it instead of going out and slashing people in real life. That was a joke btw, you ♥♥♥♥in’ maggots.","February 7","true","28.6"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

It plays and looks like a direct homage, and it even directly borrows audio assets from it.  But this game is no Postal.  Thing is, I LOVED Postal when it came out.  I still do, actually.  It's mindless violence, but there's a satire to it.  I feel like maybe the creators were going for satire, and failed miserably?  I'm not sure.  It feels like the crass fantasies of basement dwelling ♥♥♥♥♥ners angry at the world for no reason.   This game was just desperate garbage.\n\nFor me, the main thing that separates Hatred from Postal is the objective.  In Postal, your goal is to kill the authority figures.  The Man, trying to keep you down.  Cops, military, etc.  They're trying to kill you, and you try to kill them.  CAN you kill innocents?  Most definitely.  As much as you like, violently.  But that's your own sickness.  The game never tells you to kill innocent people.  In Hatred, killing innocents IS THE GOAL.  The authority figures trying to kill you?  They don't matter.  They're a hindrance, an obstacle between you and murdering innocent people, nothing more.  This game just wants you to murder, and rather than feeling dark and gritty, it feels desperate, like some skinny goth teenager trying so hard to convince people he's scary and dangerous, when we all know his wardrobe came from Hot Topic when his mom dropped him off at the mall.\n\nOn a technical level, the game is fine.  Plays pretty smoothly, graphics are decent, art style is kind of cool.  It did crash on me at one point, I don't know why.   You'll want to mess with the keybindings; they're a little awkward.\n\nBut honestly, just ignore this one.  It's not worth the controversy, and not worth your time.\n\n","May 1","false","0.4"," 36 of 66 people (55%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","55","36","66","5","0"

Definietely not near GOTY or anything like that. I find it fun but very irritating at times because of the fact of this game has horrible AI. You might hear a lot of bad things about this game due to the drama it caused but if you're a person who's smart enough to tell a difference between right and wrong, then you should definietely play this game. Let's talk about gameplay. Gameplay is exactly what you expect from the trailers. You're insane and you go on a killing spree and that basically sums up the whole game. There isn't a backstory to the character at all, they don't tell you why he started doing this but i guess that's another pro of this game because you make your own backstory on why he's so insane. There isn't a main story either, just you killing people brutally while you say edgy ♥♥♥♥ such as "Your family won't mourn for you, they will be dead" and "Let me introduce myself, i'm a man... Of hate" and "Can you hear your guardian angel crying... I can." And much more gruesome sentences that you wouldn't expect. So if you're underage or can't handle this sort of stuff, then i don't recommend playing it. In my opinion, this game shouldn't have gotten an AO rating. Probably due to the controversy it got. This game isn't brutal enough to deserve an AO rating but mind you, it's still pretty brutal with it's content, but not near as brutal as other games such as the Mortal Kombat series. If you like twin stick shooters, you will like the game. If you don't, then you won't. This game is also short. Game is only about 4-5 hours i heard. But if you're still debating on if you should get this game or not, just wait for a sale to come up and there's also Steam Refunds now so there's that. My honest rating of this game 6.5/10.","June 10, 2015","true","10.6"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

I stumbled upon this game having never heard of it before. The title is what reeled me, and the fact that it was at the top of Steam. I checked it out quickly. I love a game that flips common tropes on their head and is not afraid to push the envelope to the point of breaking. The fact that this is basically a mass-murder simulator when (in the US at least) there are mass shootings every day really gave this game a lot of "edge" for lack of a better term, which is what I like in games, whether that edge be due to controversy, difficulty, or in depth storylines. However, it is rare to find raw unadulterated controversial gore nowadays. I decided, despite the negative reviews to buy this game at its current price and play it.\n\nPay no mind to the negative reviews, this game is amazing. The black-and-white artstyle is amazing, the voice acting is amazing, the weapons, environments, enemies, civilians, executions, all contribute to a fun violence simulator. It is simple, easy to play, enjoyable in its brutality whilst still being challenging to the point of me damn near throwing a tantrum over losing a level 5 TIMES! The best part is, the developers and the game make no bones about what this game is: a mass-murder simulator, designed to simply and brutally explore in an arcade-like manner, the activities of a violent misanthrope bent on killing anyone in his path. Its simple, brutal, and violent, which is something that seems rare in today's gaming environment.\n\nFor god's sake even the credits are a heavy-metal music video of gore and death, showing the main character brutally killing both police and civilians alike.\n\nIt makes a good stress reliever, a good arcade shooter, and just a good game overall with great style and flow in the gameplay. 10/10\n\n","June 3, 2015","true","9.5"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

WOW really worth an Adult Only Rated, When i can do the Same thing in GTA only Difference is I can F*** the Wh***s before killing them, Get your Head out of your ♥♥♥ ESRB.

It would of been the fun death sim I was hoping and waiting for.\nI was hoping for a game that was a similar experience, to the likes of the PlayStation exclusive of dead nation.  Perhaps, another great Miami hotline 2 type game ?\nAfter seeing those trailers and gameplay vids on YouTube, taking a gamble to purchase the game and see what its like first hand for myself. Here are my personal thoughts and opinions so far about Hatred.\n\nHere is the deal, I wanted to like and enjoy the game of Hatred. The problem is that the game is fun until it lags like hell with severe dips and frame rate issues.  I hear they fixed it with patches.  Yet still not fixed i have noticed ?   Perhaps a bit, since I read from other forums that the control support and some lag issues had been delt and addressed.  The funny thing is that this can be fixed easily with the lags concerned. I can see the potential idea this game has.  It just feels unfinished, unpolished with some horrible dips and lags issues, especially during execution sequences and cutscenes.\n\nThe only good things about this game, is the weapons feel brutal when you shoot people in the game.  It has lovely effects and explosion nd destructive sounds.  You can even enter vehicles\nThe execution cutscences are pretty sickeningly cool.  Even though, sometimes when it takes like 15 seconds to come out during the frame rate issues. ??\n\nMy conclussion :\n\nFix these issues and the game is fun to play, no doubt.  It does borrow a bit from Dead Nation and Miami Hotline which is fine. This can not be a bad thing but its develpers, just feels like they rushed the game way too quickly.\nThe character you play is just an upleasant, vile person, that has a troubled day, being in a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mood.  After smoking too much cannibis, avoiding his anti-depressants, then blaming other people and the world for the way he lives.  So he then basically wants eliminate all other human beings, pretty much.\nHe just doesnt seem interesting and the story does not seem to capture the magic for his reason to just murder innocent victims.  It needs more back up.  The detail is nice but a lot is missing.\n\n6/10\n\nNice idea but fix and it will get a thumbs up and a reccomedation to a 7/10.\n\nThanks for taking your time to read.","August 20, 2015","false","19.1"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

After about 30 minutes you will be bored and you will feel like you have played the whole game. Now i'm not saying it's bad because it's rep[etitive plenty of repetitive games have been successful and fun like Skyrim and Doom. This is not one of them. Usually in a game you feel good when killing enemies (For example when I kill someone in Doom i get a satisfying feeling) but this game feels like you'r shooting plastic BBs at random people. Overall, I would say this is not a game you should buy.

I recommend playing in extreme difficulty to get more into it.\nIt really puts you in a dark atmosphere of destruction and murder.\nYou can not only kill everyone spectacularly but you can destroy the environnement like in no other game. Eveything can explode, break, shatter, etc. The maps are pretty big and you have a lot to destroy, not for the sake of destroying (well not only) but as strategic an tactical gameplay. You use the environnement to be the most efficient possible.\n\nThey added a free survival mode DLC which is also fun and very appreciated for a free update. It had some little issues with controls but the devs fixed all the little issues and improved the game pretty much everywhere. Very dedicated devs!\n\nBesides that, Hatred is a rush of adreline and it's very well made.

When talking about gameplay, the "twin stick" controls are some of the worst that I've ever encountered. Trying to perform the health regenerative executions is often frustrating because it requires you to be in an exact spot to trigger, but the character will randomly just not execute your desired action. And it is way too easy to get stuck on environmental details. Not to mention that the character moves like a tank.\n\nIf we are discussing the violence of the game, which has pretty much been the basis of it's hype, it's extremely underwhelming. GTA V is typically far more violent. It's all rather generic. Even the npcs begging for help pales in comparison to a game as simple as, "Not a Hero".\n\nDon't get caught up in the hype; this title is an easy pass.","June 11, 2015","false","9.4"," 14 of 24 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","14","24","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/341940/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","Hatred is a Twin stick shooter in which we take on the role of a mass murder, in his mission to “cleanse the world” from humanity. To accomplish this he, well actually he has no plan whatsoever and just goes from area to area, killing random people by the droves. As you may imagine this doesn't sit too well with the local police force and they will soon set out confront him in a shoot out. Unfortunately for them, our nameless antagonist has the power to regenerate his wounds by brutality finishing off any wounded people. How much he regenerates is based on what difficulty level you chose. Regardless of that strange power, our player character is not an all mighty death dealer and is actually pretty fragile. A couple of shots is all it takes to kill you, so it is best to fight crouched and with suitable cover, especially when some of the tougher enemies show up. Don't rely on it too long though, cover is destructible and will soon be a pile of rubble from all the bullet holes.\n\nTo fight back you will be able to carry up to three weapons and some grenades, however the flash-bang grenades are near useless. Your ammo supply will be very limited and the only way to get more is to resupply from the weapons of the recently deceased. Whole levels may be lacking a certain type of ammo for one of your weapons, in which case it is best to swap it out for one that is easily found throughout the level. Unfortunately, you will see most of the weapons this game has to offer in no time and they are all pretty generic. There is one shotgun, one handgun, one assault rifle, along with a few other weapons. Since this game is purely about killing, it does get old very quickly. There is no melee whatsoever minus an epic flying kick, to down people for an easy execution. The knife our character is carrying is pure show and only appears during the cut-scene animations of a execution. Bullet proof armor is also in this game and will double the amount of damage you take if you are lucky enough to find one.\n\nThe previously mentioned executions are the main source of controversy in this title, as they show a close up, brutal execution of a pleading victim. Funnily enough they are not even that violent compared to other games and due to the few execution animations there are, will quickly lose their shock value.  Remember how I mentioned that this is the only way to regain health? Yeah, I have no idea how the devs thought this would be a good idea since you will be seeing these over and over again, causing a ton of breaks in the action just to see the same execution pulled off time and time again. To make matters worse, time doesn't freeze when you enter an execution cut-scene, so as soon as you finish killing the victim to regain health, you will find yourself surrounded by heavily armed enemies then will be quickly gunned down. You do have an option to turn off execution cutscenes, which you will want to do as quickly as possible, but that kind of destroys the main gimmick of Hatred.\n\nAbout 2 of the 7 levels are throw away romps, through linear uninspired environments like a  sewer or a train. The rest feature a small, open world environment to cause havoc in, as well as multiple side quests. These side quests always need you to kill someone or destroy something, which we probably would have done anyways, but you will definitely want to head straight for them as completing one will net you a token that allows you to respawn if you were to die. You will also be able to drive around these environments with a very specific vehicle, which is usually a police car. Unless that vehicle has a mounted machine gun it is completely pointless to get into one of these, since the controls for driving are abysmal and they take very little damage before exploding. Your character takes his sweet time to get out of a burning vehicle as well, so walking is nearly always the safer option. In case you are wondering, no you can not shoot out of your car window, you will be completely defenseless. There are no maps of the areas and some are strangely laid out, so cars are purely a gimmick. One thing I would like to mention is that our character has no qualms with killing random people, but he will not steal a parked car for whatever reason.\n\nEnvironments look great. Hatred is powered by Unreal Engine 4 and it is the best looking twin stick shooter on the market. From the amount of detail in areas to the limited destructibility of everything via gunfire or explosives, it is a truly impressive. It's a very demanding game however, my frame-rate dipped to the 30's on a fairly high end PC. Ironically enough the very same attention to detail placed in the environments severely harm the game. There are just too many objects that impede your movement and will stop you dead in your tracks in vital moments. Your character can vault over some objects while sprinting, but it is a clunky, unreliable system that feels barely functional. A lot of buildings are designed in a way that makes it have plenty of dead ends , causing you to backtrack, which will be your doom if your objective was to flee from your pursuers. You can jump out of windows with the sprint key, but good luck getting that to work correctly. Some areas have multiple vertical layers which absolutely breaks the AI until they are on the same plane as you. They can not shoot up and you can not shoot down, so it comes down to waiting for them to figure out their way to you so you can kill them.\n\nPlenty of missions require you to kill a certain amount of innocents and that gets old fast. The number required just gets too high and becomes extremely repetitive, not to mention counter productive, as slaying all the civilians will get rid of all your easy targets for a health refill. It's not fun either, they are all bullet spongy and it's total waste of ammo. They can take several assault rifle rounds before they go down and with actual trained combatants it feels like we are fighting cyborgs or something. Civilians are not defenseless however, they will frequently pick up weapons and fire at you. Problem with that is they are equally as skilled with that weapon as a trained soldier, only difference being the amount of damage they can take. It really breaks the illusion of them being victims when they all know how to operate a machine gun and are fearlessly fighting along side soldiers, to the death. That could have been cool, seeing a few people go all John Rambo on you, though seeing them endlessly pull more ammo out of there pocket and refusing to flee no matter what, time and time again is just plain weird. Enemy AI also have the ability to see you through solid walls and will no your position at all times. Cops just appear out of thin air instead of closing in on you and everything just feels badly designed.\n\nSurvival mode is what saves this game. It throws away Hatred's inconsistent sense of realism and places you in unique small maps specifically designed to fight in.  The environments in these allow for much more fluid movement than the cluttered messy environments in story mode.  You will be able to pick from three different characters that appear after the aftermath of the end of story mode and all have different stats. Instead of the boring ambient music of story mode, you will have the option of playing an awesome heavy metal track in these maps. After each wave you will be able to buy explosives, ammo or body armor with the points you gain from killing as well as gaining experience to increase in rank. The higher your rank, the more perks, weapons and weapon slots you can access. This mode is a decent amount of fun and shows you the difference of designing a game around the gameplay, over how much edge you can cram into a series of dull, pointless objectives like in story mode. This is a weird one to recommend. If the subject matter does not bother you, this is a mediocre twin stick shooter that will kill a few hours.","October 21, 2015","true","5.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","5","7","2","2"

(if it wasnt obvious already...)\n\nYou can kill Men, Women, but no Kids or Animals. (They are not even in the Game)\nFor me personally its good at what it does, it entertains me, but it sure has a few flaws.\n\nPositive:\n- I like that steam, especially gabe newell had the "balls" to let this game be sold on steam. not because im a psycho who wants to murder people in reality, im far from that, rather more because it shows that there is some hope that not everything gets cut into "social correctness", like it happend with many other games before.\na good example is the borderlands series which mutated into some politcal correct kiddie franchise, with the last part.\n\n- Graphics and animations are nice to look at. still, i wonder what the game in full colour would look like, or as fps.\n\n- The game offers a challenge, even on easy difficulty you have to be careful or you will die quickly.\n\n- You can destroy a lot of the Buldings, also drive some of the Cars\n\n- The controls, regardless if you use mouse and keyboard or a controller, are easy to understand and use.\n\nNegative:- Hatred in current state is poorly optimized. im playing with an Intel i7 5820k 6core cpu +  an nvidia 970 gtx and got several fps drops during the levels.\n\n- There are only 7 small levels. When you rush, youre done with the game in about 3 hours.\n\n- There is no Multiplayer mode. I bet this game would be a real blast if you could play it in 2 player coop, at least.\n\n- Ive seen some bugs, like videoglitches, got stuck in the wall several times, "scratching" sound, but those should hopefully be fixed soon.\n\n- The AI is dumb\n\n- Camera angle and overview are often so bad that you cant see what youre doing or who is shooting at you. thats especially frustrating on higher difficulties.\n\n//\n\nAll together its hard to rate this game, the biggest flaw is for sure that its too short.\n\nAbout the violence i can say that its not as bad as i expected. If people shout this game is evil and should be banned, i can only shake my head and ask myself if they ever played gta, manhunt, hitman or else.\n\nSure its violent, but not more than things that have been out for a long time.\n\nSince my old favorite top down Game, Nation Red, seems to be dead now, i guess Hatred will become my new sparetimewaster.\n\nI hope for some more content in the future, and Destructive Creations, if you read this somehow: please, add some kind of coop or multiplayer!\n\nIn the end its a matter of taste, but i  would say, when you get it on sale for 9,99€ someday, its a good buy","June 2, 2015","true","20.7"," 43 of 81 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","43","81","2","0"

It' just a glorified postal game with better graphics and explosion, but its boring...sure its fun to play for 5 or 10 minutes but after you've seen all the different animations 10 times  it just gets so damn repetitive : Kill everyone at place A, Kill everyone at place B , C  and D untill the credits roll.

The first thing I have to say is there is a serious lack of weapon variety. For the type of game it is, one would expect a wide variety of weaponry at your disposal. I would expect somewhere between 40-60 weapons, seeing how this game is focused entirely on killing people. There are about 13 I would estimate. Many of which you will hardly get the chance to use. you will only be using the weapons your enemies are currently using, because it is nearly impossible to find ammo for any other weapons.\n\nI must point out a large problem with the game, in the nicest way possible. The controls are absolute ♥♥♥♥.They basically ruin the game. A large portion of this issue is the camera. The ♥♥♥♥ing camera. It fought me and won throughout my whole experience. I constantly found myself tryin to shoot a soldier just out of view, as the camera fought back the whole time, trying to re-center my character as I was being riddled with bullets. As of the time of this review, they have lowered the attack range of the soldiers to make this issue less lethal to your character, however it would have been a much better idea to make the camera work.\n\nNow on to the gameplay, when everything is working fine for the moment, It is average I suppose. The best thing I have to say is that it is actually difficult. That is very rare in games made today. You really dont feel like a badass though. I constantly find myself running around looking for a civillian to kill, becuase after about 3 seconds of heavy combat you are nearly dead. And furthermore, During combat you are always going to be trying to merely wound most of your enemies, (which if I might add, is strangely hard to do) so that you may execute them for health. Becuase trust me you are going to be needing to execute someone every ♥♥♥♥ing second. It is a interesting mechanic, But such an essential mechanic that there are very few satisfying moments where you can just gun down 15 or so people.\n\noverall, the concept of a game focusing only on killing people has a lot of potential for interesting gameplay, but it was poorly executed in hatred.

The black and white graphics are ugly and makes seeing targets a nightmare. The game runs poorly. Aiming is awkward (but not for the cops who shoot at you!). You can't revel in destruction, because ammo is limited and there's even a loading screen tip telling you the save your rifle ammo for cops. That might have been okay if you had a machete or something, but no, you end up having to JUMPKICK victims which is as ridiculous as it sounds.\n\nDespite being a game about a spree killer, it feels like the devs actually avoided controversial elements as much as possible - there are no kids (even the old 2D Fallout games let you kill kids!), no religious elements (i.e. asking victims if they believe in God), no political agenda, no targeting of specific groups, no torture, no nothing.\n\nOne of my most memorable gaming experiences was a level of Cannon Fodder where you had to blow up several bases that kept spawning enemies. The only way to blow them up was with a cannon in the middle of the level, but if you tried to use the cannon, the enemy's bazooka guys would blow you up. So first you had to go around the whole level and kill every bazooka guy. After all that trouble, it was very satisfying to hop into the cannon and easily blast every base. THAT is how a game about a spree killer should work - killing helpless victims isn't challenging, so it isn't fun by itself, so it needs to be the REWARD after you've accomplished the game's real challenges. I mean, how great would it have been to play as the Hatred guy BEFORE the rampage? Imagine you're buying nails and fertilizer at the hardware store, and the cashier makes some crack about how happy is that you're finally going to fix up your busted eyesore of a house, and he "can't wait to see the final product!" I mean, how much more satisfying would it be to blow up his store with a pipebomb then?

Oh man, i'm 15 and edgy and I want to play! Stop right there ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  Save your dollars for a good game, like EVE Online.   I had to lower the graphics due to it being so poorly optimized, my gaming laptop couldn't handle everything on Ultra. As a point of reference, I run most things at 60fps or above on High or Ultra settings.   I tried playing with both a mouse and keyboard, and with a gamepad (Xbox 360 controller).  The controls are ♥♥♥♥, absolute ♥♥♥♥.\n\nLet's talk about the content.  "Oh noes, Betamax is telling us not to play games because of it's violent content!"  Shaddup.  I'm not telling anyone not to play anything.  I'm saying it's not worth the $20 you'll pay for it.\n\nThere really is no content other than running around trying to shoot people.  Now, that may appeal to some of you, but when your opening video is your game trailer, you start to wonder how much work they put into this abomination.

Freedom of expression!  I'm a Kalashnikov-Kin and I identify with this game!"\n\nThis game is less about "freedom of expression" and more about "Let's see how far we can push the limits of common decency in gaming".\n\nYes, me, talking about decency.   I don't particularly care about that.

Perhaps donate it to a good cause, like a cancer foundation (Which this game will give you) or some local human/animal/Canadian shelter or something, I dunno.  Maybe use it to buy movie tickets to see Jurassic World next week, or see Mad Max if you haven't yet.\n\nOr you can give me your $20 and I can use it to light a cigarette with, because either way, one of us is going to develop cancer, and I won't let it be you because you bought Hatred.","June 2, 2015","false","0.0"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","60","9","15","3","0"

But will you want to see what the whole noise was about ? In Hatred we play as an unnamed man who hates the entire human population and wants to cleanse it, so he picks up a gun and massacres anyone that stands in his way. So how is Hatred ? Well it's bad. I'm not gonna judge the game by it's content. The game is just bad plain and simple. I was at first liking the entire thing. Shooting was really fun. Running around gunning everyone down while police try to stop you but just simply can't. The game looks nice, the lighting effects and the destruction are all quite impressive but the good stops there. The game starts to get boring after a couple levels cause there is no variations. You just simply run and gun until the game ends. The story is not there. There is no motivation to finish the game. The script is also hilarious when the main character spews one liners which are so over the top it's quite amusing. The executions are brutal but half of the time you won't get to see them for the camera spinning around and if the civilians glitch through walls. The game also has a massive difficulty spike when soldiers show up which are too tough to handle since they have armor and machine guns which kill you almost instantly. Overall the controversy surrounding the game was just there to sell the copies cause the game is really disappointing. Only get this game on a sale or otherwise skip it entirely. I give Hatred a 4.5/10","June 3, 2015","false","6.3"," 73 of 140 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","73","140","0","1"

Very nice graphics, animation and effects. Simple but addictive run and gun, and dodge and aim. Each level seems fairly open with a degree of exploration and side missions.\n\nGameplay consists of exploring varied environments such as a town, sewers, wilderness, moving train cars, in a 3D isometric style 3rd person perspective, using radar to find and eliminate the vast majority of denizens of any given place. You can carry 3 guns + 3 types of grenades, have limited ammo, can also sprint, dodge roll, and kick people within proximity to stun them or kill them.\n\nThe level of detail and fluidity in the graphics and animation is what we should have expected from something like Wasteland 2. I would love to see a mod turning Hatred into an action RPG shooter, or somat.\n\nI'd say the game could take a $5 drop in price, considering it does become a bit repetitive, although its fun to play a level or two at a time without becoming too fatigued.","June 3, 2015","true","7.1"," 14 of 25 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","14","25","2","0"

Sadly, there is no real reason to play this game.  The game is great looking, in its color, its atmosphere, and its lighting.  Thats about it as the entire game is "ok" at best.  Walking controls take a while to get used to and driving controls are impossible to get used too.  an intresting touch (i thought at first) is when you run low on health, you need to exicute somebody to gain health.  Sadly this runs off fast as there are few exicution cutscenes, the cutscenes themselves get in the way, and you oftin have to run away from battle to injur a random person just to heal.  the degsine of the charachter is cliched and so is his diolauge, i get tired of listining to him and i kinda wish he'd shut up.  The game is playable and enjoyable for a while.  But when these problems kick in, they kick hard.\n\nThe only reason i bought this was because i wanted to see how dark, possibly comidic, and how fun this game would be.  in the end its only fun in short bursts, lacks any dark humor, and treats itself too seriously.  i would love to see something diffrent from Destructiave Creations because they seem to have potential.

Here are a few of the pros and cons I found with the game.\n\nGame Length: 3 Hours\nDifficulty (easy)\n\nPros:\n+ Fun, Cheesy Dialogue\n+ Awesome Destruction\n+ Gorgeous Visuals\n+ Gunplay is pretty good\n\nCons:\n- Missions lack variety, kill kill or kill\n- Terrible Performance, 30-35 FPS average on Nvidia 970, 35-40 on 980\n- Long Loading Screens that can take up to 30-60 seconds\n- Annoying Respawn Mechanic (Complete side objectives to get respawn tokens, if you run out of tokens and die you have to restart the entire mission)\n\nAlthough the game striked up a lot of controversy regarding it's subject matter, "Hatred" is just your standard run of the mill Top-Down shooter. It's nothing too special but it has it's moments. The explosions for example are the highlight of the game.\n\nAll three difficulties are the same, they only determine how much HP you gain from each execution you perform.\n\nI give "Hatred" a 3 out of 5.","June 1, 2015","true","6.2"," 147 of 286 people (51%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","51","147","286","12","13"

If you are a huge fan of the original postal give it a try otherwise you might want to skip this title. I personally found the game enjoyable but the short length and poor optimization (since corrected on my machine in patch 3) hinder the experience.\n\nIf you do plan on picking it up I reccomend you wait until it goes on sale, at $20 the price point is quite steep considering it is only three hours long. $10 would be the ideal price point for this title.\n\nPros:\n- Extremely well done levels/enviroment\n- Enviroment is highly destructable\n- Enjoyable but run of the mill combat\n- Cops and Soldiers have a decent AI\n\nCons:\n- Requires a bleeding edge 4+ core CPU for good performance making it inaccessable to many.\n- Repetitive\n- Extremely short\n- God awful car controls\n\nI would give it a 6/10, if co-op and mod support are added as planned it would be about a 7/10. I reccomend this only for people who meet said niche outlined above. In order to run this game decently you will need a high end multicore cpu, with at least four cores due to the intense resource drain caused by the physics system.","June 3, 2015","true","58.9"," 26 of 49 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","26","49","2","0"

Where Hatred falls is in variety and direction. The game tried to be to edgy, forcing people to kill civilians and making it the only object loses its appeal immediatly what makes violent games like this appealing is the mere freedom of that choice, making us do so simply becomes a chore. The game is beaten easily in a day but I must mention one thing, these developers have been updating this game constantly and consistently listening to consumer feedback. This type of effort from developers make me feel there is some hope. Hatred maybe so-so but its art style, physics, and goofyness have me appreciating it more than I thought I would.

It looks good (both technically and aestically IMO), has a great atmospheric soundtrack, nice animations and one of the best destruction systems in gaming period.  Its also got a solid challenge; it's not just shooting fish in a barrel like some were thinking.  If you can look past the controversy and see it for what it is you might enjoy it.  Seriously though, they're pixel and not people....  Playing this won't turn you into a serial killer and I personally don't find shame in enjoying its gameplay.  I almost feel like after the censorship campaign failed against Hatred, that then people felt the need to crap all over it for being a bad game in general.  I find this pretty pathetic because as I said it's not objectively bad.  It's not perfect though.  Optimization is questionable (1440p, max IQ is using 100% from a GTX 980 with framerate dips into the 30 range), the "story" is paper thin and the ending is abrupt.  But it's also a $20 indie game so your expectations should be adjusted accordingly.  I think 6-7 out of 10 is reasonable for the game.  There are a number of critically well received games that are flat out broken especially with the popularity of early access.  Destructive Creations are also very transparent with the community and have been very quick to release patches for issues some have encountered as well as adding new features.","June 17, 2015","true","8.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

What happened? WHY? I listen to his dialog for clues, and slowly, a deep tale of misguided masculinity and once good intentions gone astray begins to emerge, as the protagonist struggles with a world gone mad. The gameplay is solid, as you run around, guiding his wounded soul on a journey of healing and catharsis.  Sometimes the terrain is difficult to navigate, symbolic of today's confusing world. Its a steal for a mere $20. In short, its an amazing action game filled with gun play, explosions, and fully destructible environments, but on another level, it is a deep emotional tale of old fashioned masculinity searching for a place and self expression in a modern world of over indulgence and leisure.","June 2, 2015","true","4.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game is really misunderstood. Its metaphors and stuff. Subtle. Very subtle. It LOOKS like you are playing a complete psychopath that has finally gone berserk and started killing everyone and everything. But its the BURIED TRUTH behind his gaze that I find most compelling. What happened? WHY? I listen to his dialog for clues, and slowly, a deep tale of misguided masculinity and once good intentions gone astray begins to emerge, as the protagonist struggles with a world gone mad. The gameplay is solid, as you run around, guiding his wounded soul on a journey of healing and catharsis.  Sometimes the terrain is difficult to navigate, symbolic of today's confusing world. Its a steal for a mere $20. In short, its an amazing action game filled with gun play, explosions, and fully destructible environments, but on another level, it is a deep emotional tale of old fashioned masculinity searching for a place and self expression in a modern world of over indulgence and leisure.","June 2, 2015","true","4.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Hatred delivers exactly that. The game is somewhat difficult even on easy, but once you get the hang of gunpay it becomes second nature. The destruction is beautiful, my jaw dropped the fist time I kicked in the door of a house and subsequently threw a high explosive grenade in the living room. Walls can be shot through, most cover can be destroyed, and Michael Bay seems to have left all of his extra set pieces lying around the levels which adds a lot to the destruction. Gunplay feels wonky at first, I definitely wouldn't recommend with a controller, but as I said I had no problem using corners and doorways and windows for cover once I figured it out (Shooting through walls to make murder holes for yourself is great too). I beat the game in 3-4 hours on easy, but even though I had most of the "sidequests" I still wanted to see more. How many limbs can I take off with one shotgun shell? How many cars can I daisy chain together in an explosion? These qusetions I was yearning to find the answer to. I have kept playig once in a while (Yeah I know its been out 10 days) and it has still been fun as hell to cause mayhem. The levels are massive and have a lot to them, exploration via murder spree is a fun part of the game. Lots of goodfies lying around for those who do like to wander around.\n\nEverything considered, Hatred is definitely worth it on sale, I paid 20 and was happy, but then again its my kind of game. If you enjoyed Postal 2 AND Fallout 2 you'll probably enjoy the wonderful sadism this game has to offer.

The executions are okay, but the gameplay is repetetive and a little dull as a result, and the really bland colour scheme makes it difficult to discern what's going on sometimes and can lead to annoying deaths when you're trying to escape the feds and you can't see you're running into a fence because it's so hard to make out. The majority of the game seems to be really large open levels which can be good and bad but they don't have a huge amount of variety I feel. Some of the side objectives can be entertaining, but some of them seem a little buggy where they just don't get marked as complete when you've clearly done so. The ridiculously edgy comments the edge lord character makes were funny at first but I got sick of them by the 3rd level. Lastly, even on easy there is a pretty big difficulty spike on the later levels, I'd say level 4 onwards.\n\nOverall it's decent but nothing special, there's no great variety in anything at all, including weapons and executions, level design and gameplay, but it can be fun if you just want a quick murder session, but you probably won't play it for too long at once. Not worth the price tag I feel.","June 4, 2015","false","2.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

There's a heartbeat effect when you are low on health that makes the game freeze with lag every time it happens (Every 2-3 seconds),making the game nearly unplayable,and there's random lag spikes even wen you're simply walking down the street or driving a car.

You play as an unnamed man who simply has lost all faith in the world and decides to go out and kill every person in sight in a mass murder simulation (you know, for the kids, right?). What caused him to become like this? Why is it seemingly impossible to kill one man when you have the police, SWAT, and the Army against him? Don't bother asking because you'll never get the answer. There is little to no plot other than you just going around killing people and finding ways to do so. The graphics are not bad for its current update, but it was nearly impossible to play at first due to the developers not taking into consideration the port for different graphics cards. Gameplay is simple: run and gun and survive until you kill everybody. On the side, you gain health by performing distrubing executions on people in agony, which can be very hard to stomach. While it can be enjoyable at first (not the concept itself, but the gameplay), it runs thin by the third level and loses its grasp on your attention due to its repetitive nature which actually keeps players from coming back for more. I will give the game credit for its physics and destruction engine because it was pretty cool to see the buildings crumble from grenades, but its not satisfying enough to keep the player from coming back.\n\nHatred was an interesting idea when it came out, but between its void story, its rather dull gameplay, and very low replay value, itd be best if you spent $20 elsewhere.\n\nFinal Verdict: 3/10\n\nPros:\n-Pretty Good Graphics\n-Nice Physics Engine\n\nCons:\n-Little to no plot\n-Very unlikable character\n-gameplay dully repetitive\n-no replay value\n-rather disturbing content","September 5, 2015","false","4.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Its isometric 3rd person view gives it a good view which allows you to see if cops or military are coming you way, but it makes it difficult to aim with the cursor because even though you are aiming to the npc of any choice it misses shots that are at close distance. The graphics of this game are well done and seem to be something they put a great effort into and its as much as i have to say about it.\n\nCompared to the previous games that the developer created (postal 1&2, Manhunt etc.) this video game lacks a purpose other than to just "kill people", yes if you look at this with a deeper meaning it could be that the developers wanted to show that killing could be done with no purpose or motive unlike its previous titles.\n\n\n\nIn the end this games recognition was all about the cheap advertising hype that the creators of the game made by releasing the gameplay and trailer  through mediums that would catch the attention of the news,anti-violent game groups and the gaming community that want to have freedom of what brings them joy.

Aside from the premise the game is a twinstick shooter, that feels very much like a arcade game with a few modern features like vaulting over cover and crouching.\n\nAll of the weapons feel satisfying to use and the executions are brutal. This game is amazing in the graphics department and is truly something to look at especially if you have a rig good enough to max it out, absolutely gorgeous. The game has a unigue style where it is mostly black and white but certain things like blood,fire,and police lights are fully colored.\n\nThis game does have a major flaw however, the AI mainly for civilians, the majority of them do not act like a civilian would in this scenario, some will just stand there with their thumb up their ♥♥♥ staring at a wall or hell even run towards you at times it breaks emersion and generally makes the game less fun because you'd think it would be satisfying to kill them (which it it most of the time) but sometimes it isn't because it feels like you are shooting absolute morons who cannot fathom the idea of common sense.\n\nThe same goes for the hostile in the game (police,vigilantes,military etc.) but in a different way, i won't lie this one is much harder to notice, but once you figure it out it can easily break the game, the hostiles will not think to check the second floor in a house if your up there! you can make all the noise you want, but usually no one will come up occasionally someone might wander up there but it will usually be one at a time and they are very easy to take out, you can just sit up there and wait for all the hostiles below to funnel upstairs (it takes a very long time) and you can easily take them out, its almost like a onofficial safe zone its broken and it desperately needs a patch.\n\nover all i've enjoyed hatred so far and im sure i will all the way to the end but these are issues that cannot be overlooked when you are deciding whether or not to buy this game\n\nI give it a 7/10 would commit mass murder again","November 26, 2015","true","5.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I completed the game with all side missions. This game is very similar to the first Postal game only with modern graphics. The game mechanics are spot on and very responsive. The game tends to slow down a little when things get really busy such as massive explosions and the debris scatters everywhere while tons of dead bodies lay about. The only thing I do not like about the game is that it's no monochromatic and shows a real lack of color other than red. Sometimes when things get real busy you lose track of the cursor or sometimes even your character.  Story mode is really straight forward while challenge mode is a bit repetitive. Levels are big enough to keep you busy but once you have done the side missions, there is not much else to do. Not the best game out there but good enough to kill some time. 7/10","November 23, 2015","true","12.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","1"

For anyone who thinks this game crosses the line, it is no different than what goes on in GTA or similar games.\n\nYou are psycopath who thinks everyone deserves to die. Simple as that. Game runs smoothly and the different weapons certainly have their pros and cons. Grenades are satisfying and the side missions are a good addition. Ammo for your favorite weapons is hard to come by (starting rifle) but have found that in the later levels this doesn't become such an issue. SWAT members are a good source of automatic ammo.\n\nThe only real con I have to this game is it is hard to keep track of the cursor, even if it is a bright color like yellow or green that is not really seen in game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheRushQuarian/recommended/341940/","TheRushQuarian","Carl Sagan: Time Attorney","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheRushQuarian/","551 products in account","The problem with most modern games is that people like to write about the things that offended them rather than actually looking at a game critically. Hatred at it's core is just a simplistic game that is designed to be fun, and the fact that many "professional" reviewers are actually taking it seriously, the fact that people think that Destructive Creations aren't obviously turning this game up to 11 on the edge meter just to make sales is baffling to me. Hatred is probably the text book definition of a concept that sells itself, you have the brain-dead gaming sites that take it seriously which boost sales, and the socially inept pocket of gamers that want to spite some invisible enemy that is trying to push some agenda on video games. You'd half expect this game to hand you the gun and line up a bunch of liberals for you to shoot at purchase.\n\nIf you look at Hatred as a game, and not some sort of weapon against decency, you'll come to realize that it's one of the more simplistic games to be released as of recent. Each level has you going around and performing various objectives, whether it be just kill a certain amount of people, or to escape a police ambush by hopping on a train. There is no complex leveling system or dialogue choices, just a straight forward goal of go to X and shoot Y, and they give you a decent variety of weapons that can be used towards said goal. The game is charming in it's simplicity, and half of the amusement I have received from this game is just reading the discussion forums and looking at reviews, I had a decent amount of fun playing Hatred just because I realized the game shouldn't be taken seriously. I recommend it if you want to have mindless fun for a decent amount of hours, but I think everyone has to look at the discussions about this game to get a lesson on how to completely miss the point.\n\nP.S.

No aliens, no mutants, no stupid quest for the dragon's balls. Just good antisocial, psychotic shoot-'em-up action, strategy and government intervention.","June 1, 2015","true","11.5"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","7","12","0","0"

The game is predominantly hated by humanists, my little pony fans, unprofessional journalists and minecraft gamers. But this game has laid again the groundwork for that, whereof were games in the past and it is furious shooting at everything, that moves, and that furious shooting which you can chill out with after a hard day. The game became very popular especially thanks to an Adult Only label and execution cinematics in trailers. However, there aren’t much execution cinematics in the game itself currently, and murdering civilians isn’t different from for example Counter Strike or Call of Duty. Otherwise you can turn off execution cinematics in options if it isn’t comfortable for you. The game shouldn’t get the Adult Only label but rather Pure Gamers Only label, because gamers aren’t psychopaths. Psychopaths are completely different people.\n\nCurrently the technical side of this game isn’t perfect. There are many glitches, and it happened to me two times that I was respawned outside the map, and I had to kill myself with a grenade – thanks God I had some! Authors of this game apparently don’t know how to use the Unreal Engine 4, in which the game was made, properly because the performance is very badly optimized. Sometimes you will have very low FPS even though you have a very high-end PC. Unfortunately, this is purely developers fault, but I believe that they will work on it, as it’s an interesting indie studio.\n\nThe graphic in this game is very acceptable for me personally. I like the monochromatic atmosphere of this game, which totally takes you into the gloomy atmosphere of cold-blooded murders. The psychics in the game works great too and lots of different games should take the example from demolition options in this game. Explosions are absolutely beautiful and in detail processed. I haven’t seen such well made explosions for a long time. The environment or levels, which are overall seven, are beautifully designed, and it worth to explore all, because otherwise you would miss interesting places. There are lots of side quests but no one will takes you to these interesting places. Completing side quests gives you respawn points which is like a checkpoint. You can choose from 3 different difficulties – easy, hard and extreme.\n\nThere aren’t many weapons but it correspond more to the reality. Matter of course is handgun, SMG, rifle and even a rocket launcher. There are 3 types of throwing explosive projectiles – a grenade, a Molotov cocktail and a stun grenade. In options you can change the colour and type of the crosshair. Especially well processed is flamethrower. It just phenomenally burns and burning people will entertains you. But it’s a shame that you won’t enjoy the flamethrower much in this game. You can also drive a police car or a military vehicle but they are too vulnerable and blow up very fast. It’s a shame that you can’t use common cars in neighborhood.\n\nThe games audio perfectly complements the atmosphere and it’s well set in each level. Especially in the Train level and Power Plant level music fits perfectly. The music never sounds annoyingly in the whole game. The main protagonist sometimes while murdering says some harsh yelling, which appears more comically than hatefully. Sounds of weapons including reloading sound very realistic.\n\nEven though authors have already planned lots of improvements, they should start with technical side and supplement the knowledge about the Unreal Engine 4. I have noticed few things that need to be upgraded: throwing explosive projectiles. It’s too slow and the angle and power of throwing would come in handy. I miss the choice to permanently highlight aggressive units in the option – it’s better for aiming. And I also miss the option to catch civilians and use them as a human shield or eventually a possibility to execute a standing person. By the way executions replenish your life. Amazing would be experience system or levelling profile of your character, which would be suitable for skirmish mode or endless wave mode. Cooperative mode could be about two psychopathic outcasts killing more politicians in other cities, after they had watched news about the murder of Downtowns politician and had been inspired. When you had started the apocalypse, I would also appreciate if other security forces such as rescuers and firemen would arrive. What needs to be improved is AI (artificial intelligence) because civilians can see you through the wall and stealth doesn’t work. Although civilians pick up dead persons weapons, they are able to go right in front of you for the weapon and get killed. Something like fear factor is missing here. Currently is just Top murderers leaderboard but I would appreciate some Time trial leaderboard too. One last thing that I would like to mention is running over by a car – it always instantly kills you compared to for example the grenade. I would be pleased if they would change the damage, which will depend on the angle and power of the hit. I don’t mention things that authors are going to do.\n\nIn conclusion I must say that Hatred is a great game, which is unnecessarily hated by family friendly gaming reviewers. And it’s just because they don’t know anything about origin games, and what games used to be. Users rating via Steam gaming platform says it all or it at least gives evidence how reviewers aren’t objective, and they don’t know for example the game Crusader: No Regret, which Hatred reminds me a lot. Hatred on highest difficulty is an interesting and tactical game. Now seriously, which of reviewers had actually finished the whole game on highest difficulty? I do!

"Go here and kill" Sounds like a fun premise, but in practice it goes dry quick, especially with the overly serious tone. Perhaps if a modding commuinty were to spring up and inject a bit of fun into the grimdark atmosphere it'd be worth it, but as is, it's like one of the worse  a early 90's image comics.

I found the experience completely mundane and had no choice but to claim a refund under the circumstances. This game is not even worth a third of the asking price.\n\nThis controversial title is essentially a twin stick isometric shooter that looks very impressive with a dark and gritty atmosphere. Sadly this is the only postitive aspect of Hatred as everything else is lacking on a significant level. The controls are wonky and the concept of killing everything and everyone becomes tiresome very quickly indeed. The game doesn't really have a shock factor either to warrant the controversy that it's generated - I feel this was more of a publicity stunt to draw attention to the game as opposed to people having legitimate concerns about the premise.\n\nIt is also a very challenging title which isn't really a negative but the difficulty can often frustrate due to cumbersome controls and incredibly accurate AI. If you fail a level at any time; you have to go back to the start. You can however regenerate health but this involves performing executions which result in a repetitive cinematic cut scene over and over - sometimes you'd rather go without health just to avoid having to watch yet another same cut scene. You also have the opportunity per level to earn a respawn token by completing a secondary objective but as this often surrounds executions which like the above; you may want to avoid as this aspect just kills the flow of what is already exceptionally mundane gameplay.\n\nOverall; Hatred is a very impressive looking title that lacks any substance whatsoever. The gameplay mechanics are irritating and the lack of depth along with the bland structure leave the product significantly lacking. It'll only take a few hours to finish but you'll be bored long before then. If you are still interested in taking a punt on the game; just don't exceed the two hour criteria for a refund - this game is essentially the same throughout. Everyone else should simply avoid - it's not worth the refund hassle even if you're mildly curious.","June 10, 2015","false","0.3"," 25 of 48 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","25","48","0","0"

It has many problems, but once the mod support comes out its going to be one of my favorites for sure.\n\nBefore I start praising this thing let me address the issues:\n\n- There is a huge difficulty spike between levels 5 and 6, level 7 was a joke considering what I went through last time.\n- The frame rate never really bothered me personally, but Ive heard complaints and I completely understand.\n- The game is way too short. I really think that there should have been at least 12. Mod support will fix that Im sure, but its still just too short as is.\n- The art style is great and all, but I personally would have prefered normal color, giving off a vibe of eerie realism to the whole ordeal. Granted the whole thing is quite cartoonish but still, it would have made the game far more disturbing if it took off the stylistic element and just showed all of these gruesome actions in a normal look. The actions could still be seen as cartoonish, but I think the feel of those actions could have been alot more powerful if you just saw them in a normal look.\n- The Ai is pretty ♥♥♥♥ing dumb. Mostly with the civilians. The Cops and soldiers  arent the smartest, but they do show a bit of competancy with flanking manouvers and keeping with groups. They have problems mind you but no where near as dumb with the civilians. I mean, if a spree killer was shooting up the building I was in I would run the ♥♥♥♥ away and never look back. I cant count how many times people have basically ran up to me when I am clearly slaughtering as many people and just stood there cowering in fear. Its hysterical really.\n\nAnd so, why do I love this game so much?\n\n+ As much as I have loved the idea of Postal 1, it was such a horribly made game that I couldnt enjoy it. This is Postal 1 mostly fixed. Without the ridiculous amount of enemies coming at you( Rocket launchers and grenades on the first level? Give me a break.) And aside from some bugs, its pretty well made all around. It just feels good to take Mr. Hyde out for a spin once in a while so you can become Dr. Jekyll once you get back to reality.\n+ The action and gore are satisfying as hell, and this is probably the most cathartic game I have ever played. I cant wait for mod support.\n+ The makers of this game gave this game meaning with a rather brilliant idea. Instead of giving the character a story or a reason, the game simply asks why anyone would do this? Racism? Homophobia? Communist/capitalist ideology? Distrust and blame for other people for how horrible your life is? Jealosy for how people live their lives better than you? A sense of worthlessness? Nihilsm? Just for kicks? The game has no answer for you, only a question. And I think the mod support will allow others to create answers for you.\n+ While I would have preferred color, I will admit that the stylistic choice suits the game somewhat, it gives it a surreal quality which is quite needed in a game like this considering how ridiculous it gets.\n+ The 90's cheese in this is unbelievable. Its a shame that the guy who voices the main character went uncredited for this, yet I do understand why. I personally lost it at "Its time to shoot some canned meat." This guy was just amazing at how he delivered all of these silly lines with such a straight faced performance. The characters long hair and trenchcoat take me back to the days of high/middle school. All he would need is a goalie mask and it would have been perfect. The final level in particular was great too in terms of design. Back in the 90's nuclear reactors were all the rage, and alot of B-movies from that time had settings like the one here.\nOverall. I just cant wait for mod support. Listen to the premise. If that gets you pumped up, then give it a try. Don't expect the best, and yes its a very simple and repetitive game that you dont spend 8 hours a day playing. Use it as a stress reliever, like when you really hate someone or a group of people and you want to get back at them somehow. Just don't take it too seriously, it is just a game after all.","June 6, 2015","true","73.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you've read other criticism of this game, then you know how divided the opinions are on it. I suspect the reasons for that are twofold.  First, the controversy surrounding the game's trailer. And second, the subject material. I think it really comes down to this one thing:  are you okay playing as a mass murderer? If you're not, then you have no business being here. Because that's all this game is. There will be no redemption.\n\nIf you're still reading, then buy the game and come along for the ride. Because a lot of the negatives leveled at Hatred have been greatly exaggerrated. The main character's dialogue is corny, yes. The driving, should you choose to do it, is a bit awkward. Everything else is pefect.  If you've seen any video of this game, then you know what you're getting into. A black and white art style, puncuated with colorful police lights, explosions, and splashes of red. Gunshots are crisp. So are the screams of terror. The destruction system is top notch. Buildings can be lit on fire, blown apart, shot through. It allows for more tactics then I expected. And you will need those tactics because this game can be very difficult.\n\nA few tips:  play with mouse and keyboard. I tried my Xbox controller and found that it just wasn't accurate or fast enough for the chaos of this game. Also, I suggest going into the menus and changing the color and shape of your aiming reticle. The default size of the reticle, along with the white coloration, tended to get lost in the background during some of the more tense moments. Further, do not expect to go toe-to-toe with the army of opponents Hatred will throw at you. When things get too hectic, retreat, refill your health with a few executions, and ambush opponents when they come to investigate.\n\nThumbs up for the developers having the guts to make a game like this, and to Steam for selling it.\n\n","June 13, 2015","true","16.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Check.\nSlightly better than B-List voice acting? Check.\nKillable everything? Check.\nOverall, I think this was a fun but short game. I didn't care much for the controls, but the gameplay was fun enough to keep me playing. I think it's a great game to let off some steam but if you think it's going to be cutting edge in any real way you'll be disappointed. The media certainly hyped this game up to be far more controversial than I think it really is; it could also be because the majority of us are so de-sensitized to violence in video games that it doesn't seem as bad as we anticipated it to be. I would have liked to see more variety in the executions and the NPCs, and there is a surprising lack of children in this game which probably would have helped it reach a more controversial level. I honestly don't think too many people will be in shock and awe at this game unless they have never played a violent video game in their lives. All-in-all I do not regret purchasing this game and would recommend it to anyone that likes a good mindless shooter.\n\nDLC I'd like to see:\nSchool/College\nHospital\nSubway/Metro\nRetirement Home\nDMV\nCo-op killing spree mode","June 13, 2015","true","26.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

His long hair and black leather coat flow softly as he moves. The maps are equally beautiful with many interesting details (that you can DESTROY!) pop culture jokes and internet memes, some of which you'll only see in the execution mode (corn ♥♥♥♥ers!). The victims will talk back at you, and while most of them beg for their life, others will sass you defiantly before you kill them. Your inner monologue is as corny as you can expect and is a helpful reminder not to take the game too seriously.\n\nThe game is short - only 7 levels with three difficulties - and took me roughly 10 hours to complete. You could probably rush through it in five hours, if you ignore all the side quests. My only regret is how difficult the Misogynist achievement is: I've killed 7,000 people in total, you'd think that 2,000 of them were women!\n\nHatred is a rare power fantasy, so have some fun with it.

It has many problems, but once the mod support comes out its going to be one of my favorites for sure.\n\nBefore I start praising this thing let me address the issues:\n\n- There is a huge difficulty spike between levels 5 and 6, level 7 was a joke considering what I went through last time.\n- The frame rate never really bothered me personally, but Ive heard complaints and I completely understand.\n- The game is way too short. I really think that there should have been at least 12. Mod support will fix that Im sure, but its still just too short as is.\n- The art style is great and all, but I personally would have prefered normal color, giving off a vibe of eerie realism to the whole ordeal. Granted the whole thing is quite cartoonish but still, it would have made the game far more disturbing if it took off the stylistic element and just showed all of these gruesome actions in a normal look. The actions could still be seen as cartoonish, but I think the feel of those actions could have been alot more powerful if you just saw them in a normal look.\n- The Ai is pretty ♥♥♥♥ing dumb. Mostly with the civilians. The Cops and soldiers  arent the smartest, but they do show a bit of competancy with flanking manouvers and keeping with groups. They have problems mind you but no where near as dumb with the civilians. I mean, if a spree killer was shooting up the building I was in I would run the ♥♥♥♥ away and never look back. I cant count how many times people have basically ran up to me when I am clearly slaughtering as many people and just stood there cowering in fear. Its hysterical really.\n\nAnd so, why do I love this game so much?\n\n+ As much as I have loved the idea of Postal 1, it was such a horribly made game that I couldnt enjoy it. This is Postal 1 mostly fixed. Without the ridiculous amount of enemies coming at you( Rocket launchers and grenades on the first level? Give me a break.) And aside from some bugs, its pretty well made all around. It just feels good to take Mr. Hyde out for a spin once in a while so you can become Dr. Jekyll once you get back to reality.\n+ The action and gore are satisfying as hell, and this is probably the most cathartic game I have ever played. I cant wait for mod support.\n+ The makers of this game gave this game meaning with a rather brilliant idea. Instead of giving the character a story or a reason, the game simply asks why anyone would do this? Racism? Homophobia? Communist/capitalist ideology? Distrust and blame for other people for how horrible your life is? Jealosy for how people live their lives better than you? A sense of worthlessness? Nihilsm? Just for kicks? The game has no answer for you, only a question. And I think the mod support will allow others to create answers for you.\n+ While I would have preferred color, I will admit that the stylistic choice suits the game somewhat, it gives it a surreal quality which is quite needed in a game like this considering how ridiculous it gets.\n+ The 90's cheese in this is unbelievable. Its a shame that the guy who voices the main character went uncredited for this, yet I do understand why. I personally lost it at "Its time to shoot some canned meat." This guy was just amazing at how he delivered all of these silly lines with such a straight faced performance. The characters long hair and trenchcoat take me back to the days of high/middle school. All he would need is a goalie mask and it would have been perfect. The final level in particular was great too in terms of design. Back in the 90's nuclear reactors were all the rage, and alot of B-movies from that time had settings like the one here.\nOverall. I just cant wait for mod support. Listen to the premise. If that gets you pumped up, then give it a try. Don't expect the best, and yes its a very simple and repetitive game that you dont spend 8 hours a day playing. Use it as a stress reliever, like when you really hate someone or a group of people and you want to get back at them somehow. Just don't take it too seriously, it is just a game after all.","June 6, 2015","true","73.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you've read other criticism of this game, then you know how divided the opinions are on it. I suspect the reasons for that are twofold.  First, the controversy surrounding the game's trailer. And second, the subject material. I think it really comes down to this one thing:  are you okay playing as a mass murderer? If you're not, then you have no business being here. Because that's all this game is. There will be no redemption.\n\nIf you're still reading, then buy the game and come along for the ride. Because a lot of the negatives leveled at Hatred have been greatly exaggerrated. The main character's dialogue is corny, yes. The driving, should you choose to do it, is a bit awkward. Everything else is pefect.  If you've seen any video of this game, then you know what you're getting into. A black and white art style, puncuated with colorful police lights, explosions, and splashes of red. Gunshots are crisp. So are the screams of terror. The destruction system is top notch. Buildings can be lit on fire, blown apart, shot through. It allows for more tactics then I expected. And you will need those tactics because this game can be very difficult.\n\nA few tips:  play with mouse and keyboard. I tried my Xbox controller and found that it just wasn't accurate or fast enough for the chaos of this game. Also, I suggest going into the menus and changing the color and shape of your aiming reticle. The default size of the reticle, along with the white coloration, tended to get lost in the background during some of the more tense moments. Further, do not expect to go toe-to-toe with the army of opponents Hatred will throw at you. When things get too hectic, retreat, refill your health with a few executions, and ambush opponents when they come to investigate.\n\nThumbs up for the developers having the guts to make a game like this, and to Steam for selling it.\n\n","June 13, 2015","true","16.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gigmajor/recommended/341940/","gigmajor","Hérétique","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gigmajor/","708 products in account","The game is nothing special. It was briefly given the same treatment that Wolf 3D and Doom were given over two decades ago by certain religious organizations and "family" groups.\n\nThe game is a isometric shooter like Crusader: No Remorse. You go around killing people, men and women. If they are wounded, then you have the chance to execute them. Doing so will trigger a short sequence where the protagonist antagonist guy that looks a lot like Nathan Explosion gruesomly murders the terrified injured person begging for their life, or in some cases cursing or taunting their killer. Police, SWAT, and US Army will periodically be summoned to kill you. Civilians may also pick up weapons and fight back to a suprisingly high effect.\n\nMost of the missions include at least 2 or 3 sidequests that you may complete at your leisure. Usually it involves something extremely bloody. To the game's credit, the grenades, molotov cocktails and random propane tanks and gas cans explode in a satisfactory way, cause a massive amount of property damage, and often set off chain reactons. You can also take control of some vehicles and military humvees with mounted machine guns. The driving is somewhat hard to control and the cars tend to blow up unexpectedly with you in it.\n\nThe graphics are alright. Sometimes it is hard to see some things. You can press a key to outline objectives and targets to help you out. The game really does not care how many people you wipe out in a target area or how badly you mess something up with explosives, so long as you mess it up and kill some people.\n\nThe models of your victims that you burned to death are have a relatively high degree of detail, despite the fact that you will not likely see them unless you execute someone among them and the camera closes in.\n\nThe controls take some time to get used to. They are not bad, but may feel better on a controller. The AI is somewhat subpar. The civilians sometimes run into your fire, although they could just be panicking after watching some dude murder hundreds of people. The combat AI isn't very bright either, as it bunches up frequently, but the bullets hurt a lot, so you can't really let your guard down. Aiming down and crouching are extremely useful skills to have as close range combat at higher difficulties guarantee death as combat NPCs are harder to kick down than civilians since they are shooting at you and will most likely only stagger for a moment before shooting you to pieces with help from their buddies.\n\nThe game has a habit of respawning you in bad places, and you sometimes get stuck and can't get out. This is rare, but it does happen.\n\nThere are quite a few weapons in the game. Most of them are just standard stuff. The game does have a flamethrower that is extremely fun to use against mobs of people.\n\nThe ambient music is suprisingly not heavy metal, but spooky ambient. In fact, it gets pretty tense at times. The author appears to be Adam Skorupa, the guy who did a massive amount of metal and ambient trackwork for the games Painkiller, Gorky 17, and The Witcher. There are a couple of metal tracks in the game that are not featured during gameplay. The rest of the sound design is alright.\n\nThe player character is characterized slightly more than the Doom Marine. His one liners, surprisingly, did not get on my nerves.\n\nThe optimization is pretty bad at release. I was able to play it with only a handful of stutters, but they were notably bad.\n\nThe game is OK. It actually isn't that edgy and seems to be fully aware of itself, which is a refreshing surprise.

The game tries to be serious, grim, dark and edgy but it just falls flat on its face because it isn’t violent enough or dark and grim enough and the lines the character says is really tone ruining they are kind of cheesy but for the most part they are quite cringe worthy. Though this game failing to be serious and edgy and dark isn’t really a bad thing.\n\nThe gameplay is really similar to postal where you go place to place and you have to kill a certain amount of people before progressing to the next level, though there are a few point A to B missions here and there but it’s mostly kill x amount of people. There are also side objectives which will reward you with respawn tokens, you can also drive vehicles but for the most part nearly all of them will be destroyed way too easily, you have a health and armour system and you gain health back by executing people, you have a three weapon limit, and this game has a very detailed destruction system with the environments, houses and buildings.\n\nThe controls are difficult to begin with but after a short while you’ll get the hang of it, you might run into a few health issues where there are no defenceless people running around and there’s a group of armed people nearby and you’re low on health and there is a few weird examples of weapon balancing since a 9mm pistol does more damage than an ak47 does, but this game is just fun to cause destruction and chaos.\n\nThe controversy:\n\nIf you don’t know there has been A LOT of controversy surrounding this game because of its content in killing innocent people and in America this game got the AO rating but it is all underserved, this is nothing new, it’s nothing you haven’t seen before from previous violent video games such as manhunt, postal, grand theft auto, soldier of fortune etc. so stop complaining and crying YOU BUNCH OF ♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!\n\nSo this is quite a good game to play, it’s fun to run around wreaking havoc by setting people and houses on fire and blowing up houses and buildings and just generally causing destruction.","June 17, 2015","true","12.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That is until I played this game. Controller controls are actually pretty bad here. Keyboard and mouse is the way to go for this game. Very floaty, makes the protagonist get feel sluggish and action button is tied to weapon switch. A control scheme disaster. Thankfully Keyboad and mouse are WAYYYYYYY better.\n\nHis name is not important. What is important is... OH SCREW IT, Y'all heard the pun before.\n\nHatred is a isometric shooter that was made to stir up controversy. Did it do what it was made to do? Yes it did. It got attention. Publicity. "No publicity is bad publicity" is the saying that fits this game well.\n\nIt's gaining a hype train because "OH NO! IT'S TOO VIOLENT". Ahhhh to be honest, It's not as violent as I thought. It's the context people flipped out over. Really, Virtual violence is nothing to get disgusted over. It's not real and whoever thinks a game like this will turn people into killers is more brain dead than the AI in this game can be.\n\nSo how's the game? It's okay. To put it as blunt as possible, it's repetitive. Is that a bad thing with this game? Well if you're like me, you gotta deal with frustrating things VERY often. That repetitive nature of shooting people can help relieve stress. Because DEATH, KILL, DESTROY, SWAG!\n\nIt's a well working game. More optimized since it's release. Yes. Bought this game before and refuded because of a horrible experience with the game. This game still isn't all too amazing however. So let me list the problems with this game.\n\n\n\nThe story is literally just filler, the protagonist sucks as a character, forgettable ambiant music, cars control like wild go karts, the "Challenge" people talk about isn't actual challenge, "NOW THAT'S EDGY" all over the place and with the stuff going on around there, I can pretty much hear the developer go "TEE HEE! THAT OFFENDS PEOPLE~" like the herp derp 666 symbolism all over the place. To me, It's just overused. Though I gotta say, that blatant "HURR DURR SATAN WAS HERE" stuff did get people all booty tickled. I salute to that at least.\n\nSo that challenge I was talking about. It's consistant in "bad" games where it's challenge comes from how many things are thrown at you rather than... an actual challenge. The downtown level is a perfect example of this. Too many things going on that it's hard to keep your respawns. Not that I can't beat it. I got close. It's just not a fair challenge and challenge junkies like me want something better.\n\nI'm not expecting 3D Ninja Gaiden levels of fair challenge but at least something that doesn't seem like they ran out of ideas.\n\nNow for some good stuff.\n\nThe game is actually VERY pretty to look at. Here's what makes the game fun too. It's the beauty of the distruction and death. I'm not saying that as some sort of edgy poem either. Graphics in this game are very pretty and when shooting up places, it looks spectacular to see things fall and crumble.\n\nGameplay may be repetitive but damn is it fun to see the massive genocide through. Seeing how many you can put down. And yes, the civilians aren't defenceless either. They WILL shoot back with guns they pick up from dead cops.\n\n\n\nSo in the end, I would recommend this game. If you're looking for virtual stress relief, this game is for you. It may be dumb. It may be edgy but it's fun. A good game to play after a stressful day, week or month. Mod support is here too. So that's a huge plus.\n\nNow people can have their dreams of slaughtering MLP fans~","February 17","true","16.5"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

At times it can be a bit repetitive, but that's a problem most isometric shooters have. This is the type of game you play for about 20-30 mins to blow off some steam and fill up your time with. Lots of people have reported having graphical problems, but I've had no such issues, the game runs solid for me. Pretty much everyone that has said issues has AMD hardware, so that kind of explains it ;P\n\nThe only big thing that's really affecting my enjoyment of the game is the health and respawn system. I get the idea behind executions healing the player, it's honestly a pretty good idea that fits with the game's theme, but come on, have some medpacks lying around too, or have the player's health regenerate halfway. It's hard as hell getting people to become wounded.\n\nAlso, PPPLLLLEEEAAAASSSSEEEE get rid of the current respawn system. I get that the game doesn't want people to save scum, but having to earn respawn tokens lest start the huge ♥♥♥ level from the beginning is annoying as ♥♥♥♥. Have the player's progress after getting to a respawn point undone, but have the amount of respawns at said point unlimited, that would be much better. Or at the very least, give the player some respawn tokens on the fly.\n\nStill, it's a fun game. If you like the Alien Shooter series and have a taste for dark exploitation films, you might like this. It's really not the threat to gaming and society as a whole that it was made out to be, it's just good ol' arcade action delivered from a different perspective. Really didn't deserve the AO rating.","July 5, 2015","true","7.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I was pleasantly surprised by the variety of options available. The graphics of the game are dark, where the shadows and textures propel a dark atmosphere and tone. The music and voice effects really help set this tone, making the player feel uncomfortable or ill at ease. The voice effects of people\nscreaming also add to this dark, unsettling feel. The difficulty settings are well done, where harder difficulties will present a challenge.\n\nThe story is pretty much nonexistent. Your character feels that society has failed him, and decided to go on a killing rampage to the death. It doesn't hold back; there is no comedy or satire, only pure bloodshed. Because there is no build up or lead in as to why the character became this way, it is hard to immerse yourself in the story,\nor relate to his decisions. There is no pulling back for him, just pure anger. The players not  able to stop what is happening, which  may give some a feeling of distaste or horror. Many of the people being killed have no way to defend themselves. As the game progresses,\nyou start to battle soldiers, and it begins to feel less about doing evil acts, and more about fighting threatening opponents.\n\nThe weapons each carry weight, which is nice to see. Adding an option to upgrade weapons would have been a nice addition, as it would have provided a connection from the player to the character, such as having quicker reload times, for example. The enemies will in time shoot you from off screen, and they will start to attack in a horde, which can be overwhelming, as it is supposed to be, but there is no real way to thin them out with ease. Because you get overwhelmed so fast, there is no option to fall back to a fortified location, and no mines or traps you are able to place. This can be good if your looking for something harder in this genre other wise it will be more of a annoyance.\n\nThe level design is beautiful. It's expansive enough, with plenty of places to take cover, and the areas feel like what they are supposed to. A neighborhood feels like a neighborhood. I never felt lost, and the directives plus the minimap were fairly straight forward. Walls, cars, buildings, provide variety in escape access, or availability to create your own path, which I appreciate. Its always nice to blow your own door into a wall.\n\nThe only way to replenish resources such as health is to perform an execute move, more often successful on civilians than soldiers. If you hold off on killing civilians, you can save them for when you need extra health. They become more valuable as a resource or medkit, rather than just a stain on the wall as they are at the beginning of the game.\n\nWhat this game nails is the overall tone of painful, almost unbearable discomfort that comes from perhaps feeling of 'this could happen in this society; that could be me'. The last thing you would want to do would be a civilian with this character coming down the road at you. Seeing the evil he depicts, the actions that he takes, causes the player to really think that this sort of thing really exists in the world.\n\nPerformance wise, and content wise, this game is great. If you like top down shooters, absolutely this game is for you. The weapons feel heavy and good; there are a few weapons and movement issues- not gamebreaking but sometimes inconvenient which I go  more into during the video. The story and the theme is dark; it's in your face, loud, and extreme, and has been flushed out perfectly to do such. This is one of the best top down shooters I have played. The theme may be hard for some to get past, but I found it very worthwhile in gameplay.\n\nThis is a summary of my review video, which I encourage you to watch\nif you are looking for a more in-depth review.\n\nThanks for your viewership and support; for more videos click here:\nhttp:/www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho","September 26, 2015","true","7.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/amazingcomedy/recommended/341940/","amazingcomedy","erik6767","http://steamcommunity.com/id/amazingcomedy/","107 products in account","Fun little isometric arcade game. At times it can be a bit repetitive, but that's a problem most isometric shooters have. This is the type of game you play for about 20-30 mins to blow off some steam and fill up your time with. Lots of people have reported having graphical problems, but I've had no such issues, the game runs solid for me. Pretty much everyone that has said issues has AMD hardware, so that kind of explains it ;P\n\nThe only big thing that's really affecting my enjoyment of the game is the health and respawn system. I get the idea behind executions healing the player, it's honestly a pretty good idea that fits with the game's theme, but come on, have some medpacks lying around too, or have the player's health regenerate halfway. It's hard as hell getting people to become wounded.\n\nAlso, PPPLLLLEEEAAAASSSSEEEE get rid of the current respawn system. I get that the game doesn't want people to save scum, but having to earn respawn tokens lest start the huge ♥♥♥ level from the beginning is annoying as ♥♥♥♥. Have the player's progress after getting to a respawn point undone, but have the amount of respawns at said point unlimited, that would be much better. Or at the very least, give the player some respawn tokens on the fly.\n\nStill, it's a fun game. If you like the Alien Shooter series and have a taste for dark exploitation films, you might like this. It's really not the threat to gaming and society as a whole that it was made out to be, it's just good ol' arcade action delivered from a different perspective. Really didn't deserve the AO rating.","July 5, 2015","true","7.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This game kind of reminded me of those evil moments in Fallout or GTA where you just play ruthless and evil through the game. It's oddly funny how crazy the guy is and some of the things he says are ridculous and off the wall. All in all I'm not really much for top down shooters, aside from X-Com or the oringinal Fallout games, but it caught me by surprise how well the gameplay was easy to figure out and the engine made a nice spice to the destruction and mayhem you could cause unlike you could in GTA games. Blowing up buildings, being able to shoot through walls, and burn places down with a single molotov felt so awesome, along with the classic chain reaction of cars blowing up one after the next. This game felt unique compared to a lot of other top down shooters, while it's quite controversial to many I would argue it can be just as crazy as GTA or Fallout with the ruthless evil-crazed goal of wiping out everything. But in my opnion.. I'd give this rating a 9/10 a 9 because I feel like the story felt slightly short even on a high difficulty. But it was well worth every buck. I'd say this game has great potential in forming into a small franchise or even some twisted undead sequal added in the mix. Not giving away any spoilers, but the developers or people who beat the game may get the idea. Loved this game, and I hope to see another or added content to this one.

This game kind of reminded me of those evil moments in Fallout or GTA where you just play ruthless and evil through the game. It's oddly funny how crazy the guy is and some of the things he says are ridculous and off the wall. All in all I'm not really much for top down shooters, aside from X-Com or the oringinal Fallout games, but it caught me by surprise how well the gameplay was easy to figure out and the engine made a nice spice to the destruction and mayhem you could cause unlike you could in GTA games. Blowing up buildings, being able to shoot through walls, and burn places down with a single molotov felt so awesome, along with the classic chain reaction of cars blowing up one after the next. This game felt unique compared to a lot of other top down shooters, while it's quite controversial to many I would argue it can be just as crazy as GTA or Fallout with the ruthless evil-crazed goal of wiping out everything. But in my opnion.. I'd give this rating a 9/10 a 9 because I feel like the story felt slightly short even on a high difficulty. But it was well worth every buck. I'd say this game has great potential in forming into a small franchise or even some twisted undead sequal added in the mix. Not giving away any spoilers, but the developers or people who beat the game may get the idea. Loved this game, and I hope to see another or added content to this one.

In fact, I was able to beat the main story in one sitting...But that does not mean that there is anything wrong with this game. In fact, this is probably one of the best games I've ever played, and that not just Vodka's WRATH speaking, this is a really well done game. The main story is very interesting, because it gives you an in depth look into the mind of a mass murderer. From the start of the game, you get to hear what Not Important's mission is and you get to understand why he is deciding to do what he does. As you go from level to level, the game slightly increases in dificulty each time, giving you a last level to remember. The graphics on this game were beautiful (for a top down shooter), I love how the only colors you see are the colors of blood and explosions. This is a completly new style of video gaming, although it might be considered a "shooter" or whatever GTA is known as, this game probably deserves its own Genre, purely because of how unique the gameplay is. Althgough any open world game (GTA, Saints Row, POSTAL, etc.) allows you to kill innocent pedestrians on your free time, while following a story. But Hatred is like none of these games. The object of the game is not to "work for the mafia" or "eliminate rival streetgangs", the pure object of this game is to seek personal vengence on the world. This game is an amazing deal for only $20 (sometimes $10 on sale), even though it does have a fairly short main story mode, the game also comes with a survival mode (havn't tried yet), and possibly more ( havn't gone beyond the main story). In addition to all of this, the graphics are amazing, the gore is awesome (if your into that), and the ending even made me a little teary eyed..... This is and will continue to be one of the best games ever made, and I would deffinetly recommend you buy it and give it a try (As long as your PC meets the specs). I would definetly rate it 100/100, 10/10, 5/5...

The game plays exactly as expected. Typical top-down shooter style of game play. The game will definitely not be for people who like a lot of depth and expect something new and completely ground-breaking, but for people who simply like hours of mindless fun, I would definitely recommend. I personally think the game is a pretty fun game, as it is nothing different than Postal 1, which I really like. I am not going to sit here and say it is a masterpiece, because it isn't. I do not care about the context of the killing as I do not care about mindless AI within a game. If I did, I would be crying every time I senselessly run over a pedestrian in GTA.\n\nThis game is not without its flaws though. The AI are kinda eh-ish, as they will run directly at you while clearly knowing you are the guy that is friggin murdering everyone. If the devs could fix that, that would be great. The game also gets rather repetetive, but it is not meant to be any different than that. It is a game about a misanthrope who goes on a rampage, that is it. If you see the trailers, hear what the game is about, and still buy and whine about it being repetetive, that is on you.\n\nIn conclusion, I got exactly what was advertised.

The game plays exactly as expected. Typical top-down shooter style of game play. The game will definitely not be for people who like a lot of depth and expect something new and completely ground-breaking, but for people who simply like hours of mindless fun, I would definitely recommend. I personally think the game is a pretty fun game, as it is nothing different than Postal 1, which I really like. I am not going to sit here and say it is a masterpiece, because it isn't. I do not care about the context of the killing as I do not care about mindless AI within a game. If I did, I would be crying every time I senselessly run over a pedestrian in GTA.\n\nThis game is not without its flaws though. The AI are kinda eh-ish, as they will run directly at you while clearly knowing you are the guy that is friggin murdering everyone. If the devs could fix that, that would be great. The game also gets rather repetetive, but it is not meant to be any different than that. It is a game about a misanthrope who goes on a rampage, that is it. If you see the trailers, hear what the game is about, and still buy and whine about it being repetetive, that is on you.\n\nIn conclusion, I got exactly what was advertised. If you are sensitive to non-existent people dying, than stay away from this game. If you liked Postal 1, you will like this game. If you like mindless deadly action, you will like this game. I give the game a good 3.5 out of 5. Cheers.","June 1, 2015","true","97.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/1mirg/recommended/341940/","1mirg","mirg","http://steamcommunity.com/id/1mirg/","170 products in account","it's a isometric shooter based around the concept of the main character being a mass murder who's reasons for killing everyone is because they are done with this world. That's about all the story you get about the main character. The combat is abit clunky, but the destructions you can create compensates for it. The movement mechanics is...well, meh. I get stuck on pretty much everything from time to time while playing, the driving is worse....like driving a car on ice all the time. The violence is passe at best, you get more violence in witcher 3, dying light, and such. The language or narrator I should say, does swear and invoke a tone of the game. But, it's not like "Omg, I don't understand what they saying" kind.\n\nReally, I fail to understand why this was placed as "Adult rated" at all. The game isn't as bad as witcher 3 in gore and it isn't as bad as GTA in violence and the language isn't really worse than normal games were swearing is including. The only reason why I can see this getting a Adult rating for is the Mass killing concept of the game and the main character wanting to kill everyone because they for some reason detest everyone ( there prob a SJW ).\n\nAnyway, I still like the game game. It's a entertaining old school arcade style video game. Even though the story doesn't do it's job at telling me the characters backstory. The game is overall entertaining, but mostly due to the explosions. If this sounds like your cup of tea, get it. If not, don't.","June 1, 2015","true","6.8"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","2"

I haven't played the game long, but i can already tell that I've gotten a basic gist of the gameplay to write a review on it.\n\n*Performance*\n\nFirst off, Destructive Creations did a poor job of optimizing this game, I should be getting a constant 60 fps, but instead i'm getting a jittery 30-42, it is still playable, just not as enjoyable as it could be performance wise.\n\nThe performance gets a 4.5/10 it's not horrible but it's not great either.\n\n*GAMEPLAY*\n\nRegardless of my kneejerk reaction the first time I saw the trailer, joining in with the large amount of people demonizing the development team for making such a "horrid game," I now find this game very fun to play, although I can tell that the gameplay will become repetitive in time do to the fact that every level is just "Kill (X) amount of people to proceed." Where the gameplay starts to diversify though is in the side missions, whether it be crashing a house party or killing deer hunters, this small touch really makes the gameplay feel interesting, wondering what will be on the next level for side missions.\n\nThe gameplay gets a solid 7/10 i'm really enjoying the gameplay and look forward to what cool side missions there are.\n\n*GRAPHICS*\n\nThe graphics in this game are very interesting, it's black and white as to hark back to older horror films and it gives the game a very old timey, gritty feeling. But there are colors in this game, explosions are, well, bright and...explody, all the blood shed from police and innocent civilians is a lighter shade of red, and the Lights on the cop cars flash red and blue in a blinding fashion (in a good way). I feel though for all the extensive graphics options, the black and white filter of this game doesn't let the graphics shine in a way I feel they should have, don't get me wrong, the game looks nice, just not as nice as it could without the filter.\n\nI give the graphics a 6.5/10 They could of been better, but they still look nice.\n\n*STORY*\n\nYou all could of seen this coming, the story of our long haired, disturbed protagonist is no where to be found, while this can be looked at in a negative way, I look at it differently. The game starts out with (Noname) saying that he's going to kill as many people as he can and that he always wanted to die violently. The way I look at the story, the lack of story almost leaves itself open for more creativity, i.e. what could his name be? what happened to him as a child that spawned this dark cloud of hatred inside of him? But, i'm rating what story is here, which is none.\n\nI give the story a 3/10 there is no story, but in a way it makes (Noname) more mysterious and creepy.\n\n*OVERALL*\n\nIn the end I think we all got what we were expecting, a shallow, but extremely fun and interesting game about a psychopaths life ending rampage. I say if you have the money to spend on this game and have an interest in playing it, or have had one for some time, get it, I don't think you will be disappointed.\n\nI give Hatred a 7.5/10 very fun and worth a try.\n","June 1, 2015","true","5.6"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Fifteen pounds, that's the equivalent of a meal in a restaurant - hell.. less than a meal. You can't compare this to GTA, you can't compare this to Battlefield, you can't compare this to Witcher. Why would you? Big-budget organizations vs. a small Polish games company with a considerably lesser budget and experience.\n\nThe game isn't perfect, the A.I. is buggy at times, the performance isn't superb, and aiming with a controller is ridiculously difficult. That being said, you have to appreciate the game for what it DOES do right (and it does a 'lot' of things right).\n\nThe art style is superb, I'm sure I'm not the first to compare it to something like Sin City, but I'm going to anyway. The game is predominantly black-and-white, with certain items and effects being in colour. Sirens flash blue and red, explosions are shades of orange and yellow, and blood is purple. No, I'm just kidding, it's red. Very red. The destruction system is superb. You can shatter glass windows, blow holes through walls, drive vehicles THROUGH buildings, it's phenomenal. The whole feel of the game is incredibly sinister. Sure, you can do these things on GTA, but it's not stylized to be a rampage 'sim', if you will. Hatred on the other hand, represents indiscriminate murder for the sake of it. The screams of innocent people as you slit their throat, set them on fire, shoot them through the head, all sounds so real.\n\nPeople also argue the game was made to be 'edgy'. I hate that word. The developers set out to make a game of their choosing, and they did so successfully. They didn't need to advertise the game, because the media sh*tstorm that occurred as a result of such a game did it for them. People criticize that, whereas I praise it. It might seem like a simple premise, so why did nobody do it sooner? Destructive Creations had the balls to do it, and it paid off.\n\nI wouldn't say the game has huge replay value. That being said, it's not pretending to be something it's not. If you're willing to sacrifice a meager sum of money for a few hours fun here and there, I'd highly recommend it.\n\n8/10.","June 1, 2015","true","2.2"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

This man is the epitome of edginess. He wears a trench coat, has really long hair, and has some of the most cringeworthy lines in gaming history (e.g. "Only my weapon understands me"). I feel a bit silly for calling Life is Strange cringeworthy after playing this. Anyway, his mission is to kill every human he encounters.\n\nIt's an isometric shooter where you run around rather expansive (sometimes) levels killing civilians and cops. That's basically it. It's not terrible but it has problems that hold it back. As much as I love Sin City, that look doesn't work here because it's hard to see things like basic objects that you'll only realize you've been walking into after you've been riddled with bullets, and enemies that blend in with the environment and get a sneak attack on you. The isometric perspective also makes it difficult to navigate through some areas and it hides certain objects and people from you. Giving players the option to rotate the camera (like in The Sims) or making the game an FPS would've made it a little bit better. Jumping over small obstacles doesn't work like 75% of the time, which can really screw you over at times. You sprint and then run at the obstacle and you'll sometimes hop over it. You move rather slowly, making you an easy target. You can regain health by means of the gory executions, but good luck getting one of those. The AI is also kind of idiotic. You'll start attacking and they run away to another area that's right in the open for them to just get attacked again. The game does get somewhat difficult after the first few levels but the increasing difficulty and the other issues I mention tend to exacarbate each other, turning the game into a medicore experience that brings nothing new to its genre.\n\nIf you like isometric shooters, only buy this when it's on sale for like $5 or lower. There's no way it's worth any more than that.\n\nStory/campaign: 5/20 - Basically Elliot Rodger. But hey, at least it's different from what we get today.\nGameplay: 18/40 - Nothing new and it's bogged down by a few camera and control issues.\nSound: 15/20 - Not much to complain about. Sometimes the sounds don't play and the sound effects glitch out.\nPerformance: 10/20 - Even with 60fps enabled, it barely reaches 30. Game also crashes before completing some levels.\n\n48/100","September 2, 2015","false","1.7"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","54","7","13","3","7"

But once you get over the violent premise, there's really not much of a fun game left here. I would say at best it's very average, but Hatred does not live up anywhere close to its hype.\n\nThe best way to summarize Hatred is "kill x number of people to move on to the next level" about eight times, with the occasional side mission of "kill x people at this location on the other side of the map". Most of the time, this made me alternate between sessions of roughly 75% boredom and 25% frustration. After a while, it became a chore to get kills because of the dumb pedestrian AI, frequently running directly into fire and explosions I didn't even create.\n\nThe "armed" AI is a lot smarter, but quickly becomes frustrating as they have the ability to track and shoot you at a range much farther than what you see onscreen or your radar can see. I'm pretty sure 85% of the time I was getting shot at, it was by offscreen enemies. I played on the "Normal" difficulty, so this is probably even more frustrating on higher levels.\n\nThe black and white graphics also hinder the game a lot. While I got through most levels without too much trouble, the lack of coloring oftentimes making it tough to spot items or enemies that can be finished off. The only way to regain health is by these finishers, which repeat way too often. There's an option to disable the animations, which I imagine most people will end up doing just because it gets old fast.\n\nFinally, the weapons. Most of them work well enough, but the pistol does so little damage it makes me wonder why they even bothered to include it, usually taking a full clip to kill an unarmed enemy, even on the easiest difficulty. The shotgun does decent damage, but it has a stupid mechanic where it loads one shell at a time. You might be thinking "big deal, most shooters with shotguns do that", but Hatred makes you HOLD the Reload button to put every shell in, meaning that it's next to impossible to move while reloading with it. It's especially frustrating because no other gun in the game makes you hold the key, just tap R and you load a new clip in like every other shooter.\n\nHonestly, I'd just stick with Postal 1 if you want a top-down shooter about a rampaging psychopath.","April 14","false","4.3"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","7","13","0","0"

It's gory, brutal with lots of one-liners and above all fun to play. The npc's have great voice actors that help with the immersion. The developers also recently added new side quests and a new Survival mode!\n\nThe game doesn't take itself very seriously and I regard it as such. The story is as simple as a guy going on a rampage trying to kill as many people as possible, along with a couple of sidequests that usually involve even more killing. Nothing more, nothing less. It can be very challenging on the highest difficulty setting, found myself cornered by law enforcement one too many times. Challenge is good!\n\nThey've also fixed most of the performance issues in the latest update and added even more visual settings.

You play as the Antagonist, a man who hates humanity and decides to commit mass murder until he dies. The dialogue is mostly said by the Antagonist, and is either painfully dumb or hilariously cheesy. This game is not meant to be taken seriously.\n\nGRAPHICSUsing the Unreal Engine 4, the game looks good and has great destruction. Unfortunately, the performance is very poor, the environments look bland due to the black-and-white style and the NPCs are not much varied.\n\nGAMEPLAYYou go around and shoot people. The end.\nAll joking aside, your goal is to go to points of interest and kill everyone that you find in the surprisingly huge levels. You can use three weapons at a time (ranging from pistols to flamethrowers) and three types of grenade as well as gasoline tanks and whatnot scattered around the environment. You can also drive some vehicles, but they usually destroy after a few shots. If a person falls to the ground and doesn't die, you can execute him/her in order to regain health. The animations tend to get repetitive and annoying, but you can disable them in the options. The A.I. isn't even all that smart, with civilians casually strolling by while you are stomping someone's head on the ground.\nThe concept is repetitive, and if what you have read might keep you entertained, than buy this game. Otherwise it's not for you.\n\nCHALLENGEThe game is challenging thanks to the high number of police officers. You will mostly likely die because of explosions, getting run over by a car or simply not executing someone. The order difficulties tend to make the make more entertaining, while still not being too frustrating and impossible.\n\nSOUNDMost of the sound effects are fine, but the music isn't all that memorable. The voice acting is cheesy and the music lends itself to the nature of the game, with a hard-rock soundtrack that fits the gameplay but isn't all that great outside of it.\n\nREPLAYABILITYA total of 7 levels, 42 achievements, mod support and possible DLC make this a game playable once or twice in its current state. There are some secrets in the areas that you explore, but nothing worthile.\n\nMuch ado about nothing. This game will be forgotten in a few months and we will all look back and laugh at how everyone overreacted. The game is a good time-waster, not that different from something like 1997's Postal or going on a mindless rampage in GTA. If you like the genre, you'll have a blast playing this.\n\nStory: 6\nGraphics: 7.5\nGameplay: 7.5\nChallenge: 8\nSound: 7\nReplayability: 7\n\nENJOYMENT: 7\nFRUSTRATION: 6\nFollow me on Twitter: @nickygra97\nSubscribe to my channel\nLike on Facebook\n{LINK REMOVED}Check my official website\nJoin my Steam group","November 29, 2015","true","5.8"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","8","15","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maximumslothfulness/recommended/341940/","maximumslothfulness","Maximum Sloth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maximumslothfulness/","618 products in account","Hatred features a protagonist/antagonist (depending on your point of view) hell bent on murdering everyone in his vicinity and dying a "violent death."  Personally, I love these types of games, and I've been watching Hatred for awhile, so I figured why not light $20 on fire and give it a shot.  I know next to nothing about the technical aspects of video games, so below are a few of my observations.\n\nIt's a top down twin stick shooter (isometric if you want to be fancy).  The camera does a fairly decent job of keeping up with your character, but every so often I find myself getting shot...and getting shot....and getting shot from seemingly invisible foes.  There is a 'mini map' (it shows the location of enemies and nothing else) that alerted me to the fact that these incorrigible civvies have armed themselves and had begun shooting me from off screen, as have the police, military, and swat units.  Frankly, I found that a little annoying, since I couldn't see them and they could see me.  I began the practice of randomly spraying off screen in their direction, wasting my precious little buddies on walls/doors/cars, and not on those pesky humans.\n\nThe targeting system, in my opinion, works fine.  I play with an Xbox 360 controller so I hold down LT and it 'lengthens' my point of aim.  Think of it as a zoom, since that also takes focus off of your character.  Not that great when you're getting mobbed by half the population.  I swear these people are more murderous than I am.  If they see a weapon you can bet your left nut that they'll pick it up and start blasting away...at you.  I'm shocked that no one else harbors my disdain for humanity, no one else wished to pick up the flag and join my mission.  A shame really.  In any case, I haven't had too much of a problem with the aiming system.  While it can be a hassle for the above reason, it's alright for the most part.\n\nWeapon variety is another thing Hatred could benefit from.  There are only 10 (maybe?) weapons in the whole game and they fall into 6 categories: special, handgun, grenades, shotgun, smg, and rifle.  In the first category you have the rocket launcher and flamethrower.  The rocket launcher is just that, it launches an explosive projectile towards whatever you're aiming at.  Typically the target(s) will either explode...or explode with a red mist.  The flamethrower lights things on fire, as a flamethrower should.  Just make sure you keep it pointed in a safe direction, too often I found myself gleefully hosing victims only to find a pillar in the way...and myself on fire.  The handgun is, you guessed it, a handgun.  Point at victims, pull trigger, hopefully watch victim hobble away in pain.  If you missed, then keep pulling trigger until desired effect is reached or you're out of ammo.  I've only found one handgun throughout the game so far, and I'm around 4/5 hours in.  The grenades come in three flavors - boom (standard), burn (molotov), and flash (flash bang).  Boom grenade goes boom when thrown at stuff (walls, doors, people, cars, etc.).  Again, be wary of walls, pillars, and other obstructions.  Boom grenade doesn't discern between friend and foe.  Burn does just that, it burns aything it lands on.  Same warnings apply, although the radius is rather small, especially if the contents don't burst on someone.  Flash grenade blinds/stuns targets.  The effects last 2-3 seconds and you better be behind something when it explodes or you're going to be blinded as well.  If that happens, the cleanser becomes the cleansee if you know what I mean.  The shotgun is a pump action, takes FOREVER to reload, and has a short effective range...meaning if you don't have the shotgun firmly planted in someones ribs it's likely not going to kill them in the first shot.  DO. NOT. USE. IT.  I know I know, I too was drawn to the pull of the shotgun, but alas, after I mutilated...I mean cleansed, a scant few people I found myself on the wrong side of the law, and the ground.  Throughout my play time I found two smg's, one used by SWAT, and the other used by the russian mafia.  Both function the same, except the SWAT one has a blinding light that I use to let someone know I'm aiming at them.  This way they have a fighting chance.  Unless of course they're a bum lounging around in the sewers, then they're perfectly alright sitting there waiting to be executed.  I only discovered one rifle thus far, and it's used by the military.  Basically has the same characteristics as the smg's, but a higher damage rate.\n\nI also seem to find myself cleansing the same people a little too often.  Some of the character models look really similar for civilians, police, swat, and military units.  It didn't bother me personally, since most of the time their facial features were being stomped on repeatedly or shot off.\n\nThe AI is no joke.  On the second level I was skipping to the first objective with my trusty handgun and people started yelling, screaming, and running before I had cleansed anyone or anything.  Old bart started fleeing the gas station when I was approaching the wall he was standing behind.  Now, unless Bart is superhuman, I'm not entirely sure how he knew I wanted to put a bullet in his head before I was even visible.  Jokes on him since I blew up the entire gas station, specifically the pumps, while he was standing right next to them.  Died like the punk he was.\n\nThe instant someone obtains a weapon they turn into Robocop.  Meaning they don't miss, at least not on 'Hard' difficulty (there was easy/hard/extreme to choose from), which I guess makes sense, since it makes the game pretty damn hard.  Literally anyone can pick up a weapon and start shooting.  I thought that was pretty neat and realistic until I walked into a firearm convention.  My God.  Everyone turned and looked at me, I looked at them, they looked at me, I pointed my gun at them, they pointed their weapons at me...I ran, they all fired...I kept running, they chased and continued firing.  Now at this point the police also got involved.  I managed to reach an apartment complex and hid in the bathroom, but they knew...they all knew.  I've never seen so many explosions and so much destruction.  In the end I came out on top, mainly because they all wanted the glory and decided to attack via the one entrance...they entered one by one.  It was close though.  One last helpful hint...if you hear sirens make sure you're inside, I thought I was cool and could take a police cruiser on, I stood right in front of that house taunting them to come at me.  Welp, they called my bluff, ran me over and dragged me until I was dead.\n\nIf I had to rate this game on a scale of 1-10 I'd give it around a 7.  Hope you enjoyed reading through my journey with Hatred, and I do hope to see you out on the streets cleansing with me. :)","June 15, 2015","true","22.2"," 15 of 29 people (52%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","52","15","29","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/iusedmorethen5characters/recommended/341940/","iusedmorethen5characters","No Knock Raid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/iusedmorethen5characters/","130 products in account","Hatred is a top-down twin stick shooter where your goal is to kill everybody that moves.  The game takes place over 7 distinct areas where you can free-roam (for the most part) and do objectives as you wish. The game does have requirements to move on to the next stage, mainly "Kill X amount of people" or "Get out of X". There are several side objectives that mostly involve killing the majority of people in a given area. Completing these side objectives gives you respawn tokens to use if you die. If you die and you're out of respawns, you have to restart the level.\n\nYou yourself play as an edgy misanthrope who has long hair, wears a black trench coat, and spouts one-liners. You are controlled with WASD by default, and there is a sprint mechanic that you can use to vault over small walls, a crouch mechanic that makes you harder to hit and increases your aim, an aiming mechanic that allows you to precisely aim as well as aim higher or lower to compensate for the top-down nature, and this spidey-sense type mechanic that highlights living enemies on your screen as well as equipment pickups. You can carry up to three weapons at a time, from about 10 weapons There is a health system, where you can only regenerate a bit of health by executing 'not-quite-dead' enemies. It sounds all horrible, but trust me, you get used to the same 'stomp the guys head in' or 'shoot the guy in the head' animation after a hundred times. The player character does sometimes get caught on hard-to-see level geometry or a tiny chip of a wall still standing which can be pretty irksome if you're trying to get away from a firefight.\n\nYou aren't just shooting innocent civilians, you'll be fighting police, weapons dealers, vigilantes, hunters, SWAT, and the army. Even unarmed civilians will sometimes pick up a gun and start unloading on you. They aren't pushovers, either. On higher difficulties, SWAT can take three shots with a shotgun and still be standing, and you'll often be forced to retreat and find some civvies to execute. The AI has a lot of room for improvement, but I let it slide because it's not really something you ask for in an indie game.  An annoying features is that enemies can shoot you from beyond your maximum view range, forcing you to rely on your (inconsistent) minimap to find your shooter.\n\nThe gunplay is solid and even the 9mm pistol manages to actually do something rather just being the equivalent of spitballs against tougher enemies. The physics engine is great and it's a lot of fun to play around with, though it can be pretty CPU-intensive. Speaking of graphics, I'm a fan of the style, where everything is grayscale except red, blue, and explosions. It can give me a headache playing too long, though.\n\nIt's a pretty short game, I beat it on hard in 3 hours, but like I said, they're free-roam areas and I was mostly just rushing objectives. Unless you want to screw around with the levels you liked later or get achievements, it's not a game that you'll replay a lot. There is workshop support and multiplayer/coop planned down the road, which would add a breath of fresh air to the game.\n\nFinally, the moral panic. The game is not a fourth as bad as the trailers made it out to be. It's actually pretty tame. Like I said, you get jaded to the executions, and there's not really a lot of over-the-top gore except for bloodstains, blood pools, and some limb removal. I honestly don't see how this got an AO rating, it's M at best. For the tone, it gets pretty clear the game is parodying itself. The over-the-top one-liners by the player character (who is called the Antagonist by the developers) includes a line from the POSTAL DUDE. An important code for something later in the game is 666, for god's sake. Don't be offended.\n\nOverall, I'd give it a 6.5/10, above average. Make sure you buy the game if you like it, not just to stick it to the people who don't like it.","June 1, 2015","true","14.6"," 50 of 99 people (51%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","51","50","99","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aythadis/recommended/341940/","Aythadis","Aythadis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aythadis/","940 products in account","Should just re-name this to Postal 1.5\n\nSo according to the media, playing this game will turn you into a psychopath and make you go on a shooting spree at a school or shopping mall. Why? Because you kill innocent people? Please, do you truly believe that garbage? Everything in this game has already been done in MANY games already. Look at GTA, you've been able to kill people in it since GTA 3! Hell this game already exists, it's called POSTAL 1 (which is a great game btw,) and those games are rated MATURE!\n\nStory\nYou play as a "Kill All Of Humanity" hipster that has long black hair, black trench coat, carries weapons, has deep and gravely voice, while spouting dark and edgy sentences. You know, that dark and edgy that just makes you face palm and mostly not laugh at how bad it is. You go from one place to the next killing everything that moves to progress to the next area. In other words there isn't much for a story, other than "Kill everyone, don't die, move to the next area."\n\nWARNING! THIS GAME IS SUPER SHORT! There is only 7 levels in this game!\n\nGameplay\nThis plays like any other twin stick shooter. You carry 3 weapons and 3 grenade types. You pick up the guns/ammo from the dead people, and repeat. You can pick up armor, but there is no health pick ups at all! The only way you can gain health back is to "Execute" people. You can only do this when people are laying on the ground. You will be given a prompt to do an execution, and a little cut scene will play. After awhile though those get super annoying. Luckily in the options there is a "Save Executions Only" which is funny cause there isn't really anything "Safe" about them. It only disables the cut scene executing and just instead you shoot them quickly and move on. There is also a handy kick that helps knocking people down to do an execution quickly.\n\nWhen you die, you have to restart the entire level, unless you acquire a re-spawn token. You have to complete the "Side Objectives" to obtain these, which are mostly "Kill everyone ____," "Cleanse the people ____," "Blow up ____." Most are easy to do. Completing one of those or completing certain main missions reward you a re-spawn token. And you will chew through those fast if you are not careful. The army will easily take you down. I've went through 4 tokens just on 10 army guys. :/\n\nThe AI can be super dumb when it comes to civilians. They will just usually run away, or run in circles, or run straight up to you even! Sometimes the civs will even pick up a gun if there is one lying around and fight back! The cops though, oh man they do not mess around. (See problems.)\n\nGraphics\nOMG this game looks amazing! This game is done all in black and white, while certain things have color, such as blood, fire, explosive objects, police lights, blood, explosions, neon lights, TV's, blood... Just about everything can be destroyed or can be moved around. The destruction level in this game is really amazing. Some of the best I've seen in a long time, like this is on the lines of Battlefield! There is however problems with it. (See problems.)\n\nProblems!\nThere are some major problems with this game. Right when I booted it up the game says I can run everything on Ultra settings. That might be true, but I had to lower everything to Low. The reason was this game ran like ♥♥♥. On Ultra I was sitting at 15FPS. I had to go all the way to low settings just to try and keep it at 30FPS. It does drop randomly to about 24-26FPS. I've also had it dip all the way to 1FPS, to where I thought the game froze/crashed (and this was only on level 2!) This game is also extremely dark is a lot of places. Even maxing out the gamma, I still had troubles. I couldn't see doors that I was supposed to go in, or would get stuck on objects that I couldn't see.\nI've also had a really hard time with the Aiming/Hit boxes. When I try to line up a shot, I have NO idea if I'm actually going to hit them, or another object that is in my path. I've had lots of times where I end up shooting boxes, or shoot the ledge that I'm standing behind instead of the cop that is in the middle of a room. I've also had cops shoot me through solid walls that can't be destroyed in any way. I've died so many times because of that.\n\nAnother thing is VEHICLES ARE YOUR WORST ENEMY! So much as a brush with a vehicle will instantly kill you! This becomes a bigger problem the farther you get, as there is more vehicles later on.\n\nAnother issues is any enemy that gets right up close to you. You will have issues trying to hit anyone that is right up in your face. You will just end up shooting past them, and then they kill you.\n\nDifficulty\nOMG This game hard!... At least it was at first. Once I found ways that the AI could not win at, I abused it and caked walked the entire game. I completed it on Extremist first try.\n\nFinal Verdict!\nIf you enjoy violent games like these, then pick this up.There is far worse M rated games out there. Just keep in mind that it is extremely short and is super easy.\n\n7/10","June 4, 2015","true","12.7"," 52 of 103 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","52","103","3","8"

Hatred is here, and it sucks.\n\nOkay, first of all, I don't have a particular problem with the game's theme itself. Unfortunately, our society isn't perfect and yes, there are tragic occurrences when some bolk goes mad and kills a lot of people out of God knows what. It happens. And as such, a game in fact has every right to touch such a sad subject. It's not even a new thing, just check on Postal for instance!\n\nBut man, Destructive Creations screwed up everything they could do right in this case. The engine itself was a bad idea, UE4 is poorly optimized and unnecessary for a top-down-view shooter, Unity would have been a far better choice. The game is sluggish, runs horribly on the same PC that makes GTA V fly, and ugly as hell too. So there's that.\n\nIn the terms of gameplay, it shows nothing new, and gets boring after a few minutes. Is it cool to kill people without a reason? Well maybe it could be, but isn't, thanks for the horrible AI that makes them feel like mindless idiots wandering like zombies. It's just bad.\n\nJust like the shooting mechanic: aiming is difficult, there is no cover system, the enemy is always overpowered, and it's just simply not fun to shoot. Which is sad because in such a game, using guns might be a selling point.\n\nAnd the game ends in 4 hours, giving us absolutely no reason to play it again.

I have not completed the game, but I plan on it, but this review will be based on my early impressions after playing for a few hours.\n\nThe gameplay is your standard twin stick shooter with an interesting twist. Instead of being the protagonist and fighting off zombies, monsters, robots etc, you are the evil antagonist, senselessly slaughtering innocents and police alike. There is very little plot, aside from you hate everyone, and want everyone to die. The Controls are a little clunky if you don't have a controller set up. I've died once or twice because the controls are just silly.\n\nPro's:\nBeautiful graphics for a twin stick shooter, among the best I've seen to date for this genre.\nBrutal Executions (only way to heal yourself)\nDestructible Environments (Who doesn't love blowing a hole through a building and killing everyone who is on the inside?)\nVariety of weaponry: Run out of bullets? pick up a cops gun and use that instead.\nSide missions to spice things up a bit and add a layer of difficulty.\nCivilians will pick up weapons and fight back: Again, adding another layer of difficulty. They fight for their lives instead of just being lambs for the slaughter.\nExplosions! Lots of "Red" gas cans, propane tanks, and other combustibles that you can shoot to make a big explosion. Excellent if there are a few cops near it!\n\nCon's:\nKeyboard controls are clunky. Difficult to move and throw grenades / kick / aim while moving and shooting.\nGrayscale makes it hard to differentiate between civilians and police officers / swat team members\nNo real Plot: I feel my self wanting there to be a reason why I hate everyone so much that they all need to die.\nRepetitive game play. There is no real diversity, as in every other twin stick shooter I've played, you run and gun. that's all there is to it!\n\nIn the end I'd say that this game will be fine in small doses, but would be the type of game that I could burn out on if I played too much too fast. I'd say it's worth a shot if you can get past the whole "killing civilians for no reason" aspect of the game, and don't mind a bit of repetitive mindless killing.\n\n7/10\n\n","June 2, 2015","true","19.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It's just a game that the devs put alot of love into. The Antagonist's movements are pretty damn fluid. The destruction is FUN and free form.\n\nI'd like to see a sequel with bigger bombs, more weapons, and more weapon pickups.. Maybe even selectable Antagonists?

It sucks too because I really wanted to like this game but it just wouldn't let me. The novelty wears off in about 15 minutes once you've killed hundreds of people in the same boring way. The execution animations are also repetitive. There's maybe 10 of these executions and after you've seen them for the first time they get really old, really fast. And what makes this worse is that you HAVE to execute people a lot, since that's how you regain your health. Controls are really bad, especially on keyboard and mouse, don't buy this game if you don't have a controller on hand. There is no checkpoint system, instead you have to earn "respawn tokens" by completing side quests. If you have no respawn tokens and you die, the game starts you at the beginning of the ♥♥♥♥ing level. This gets really annoying, since you've usually got hundreds of people to kill and starting over can set you back a good 15-20 minutes.\n\nOn top of all the gameplay issues, the game is riddled with bugs and performance issues. I have a pretty modest set up, I'll admit (3.4GHz quad-core AMD, 8 gigs RAM, 750 TI), but I can run most new releases on at least medium and get a solid framerate at 1080p. This game however, ran extremely slow, with my max framerate being about 35fps, with an average framerate of ~20fps. I even put everything on low and turned my resolution down to 720p and it did nothing to help the problem. I'd imagine if you have a 980 or higher you could run this game but you may want to be careful  if you're on a modest PC, and if you're on a low-end PC just forget it, you won't be able to run this game.\n\nHatred is a good idea, but the dev team just did not handle it properly. If I had to rate it, I'd give it a 2/10.","June 2, 2015","false","2.1"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

I could barely see ahead of my charactor so stratagysing was nearly impossible. Trying to aim is tough and fleeing in any one direction while holding down the run button made it that much more difficult. The people in game knew exactley where i was coming from and ran and screamed before i was anywhere near them. The police were aiming at me through the walls like they had x-ray eyes.

Gameplay is repetative, but in a good way.  A lot of small options and functions seem to be missing though.\n\n1. Why the hell can't i use civilians as bullet sheilds? Maybe add a grab option?\n2.  Hand guns and other munitions seem to lack any range. as in cops on the edge of the screen are often immune to shots that seem to dead end just before going off camera.\npretty sure most guns have more then the screens 25-30 m range, though I understand acc at that range is tricky with pistols.\n3. How many civilians do you know that could take a 9mm in the face and keep on running.  Aparently everyone in this game can.  a 2 shot minimum for regular people is foolish.  A little variation in peoples durability would be cool.\n4. Driving system is so touchy moving at more then a crawl is tricky.  If I cant shoot from a car then just make it a mouse control.  Oh and also WHY CAN"T I SHOOT FROM A CAR?\n5. Physical combat boils down to a kick. Id like to see more varied physical combat without having to first kick them down for execution.  Maybe keep the kick at a range, but mix in some face smashing if you use the same button in close. (without annoying camera changes)\n6. Grenade usage is painfully bad.  If you can take the time to force us to watch badly directed shots of his executions you could at least use that same tech to create an accurate throwing system.  I don't know about you, but I want to be able to nail the upstairs bathroom window.  Put in an aiming system that gives the player short moments of first or third person control.  Allowing the player to actually place grenades, instead of having them bounce off ♥♥♥♥ and come back 50% of the time.\n\nHatred is a lot of fun as is, but it seems the devs just didn't take the time for the little details that make a game great.  The foundation is here, now we just need some detail oriented updates.","June 3, 2015","true","3.0"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

It reminds me ALOT of the original postal gameplay wise...in fact it is postal gameplay wise.  Its a twin stick shooter at the most basic level.\n\nVisually the game is alright.  It by no means looks bad and it has a style that probably enhances the visuals with its crushed colors.  Its a game you should be able to run at 60fps without any issue.\n\nI had bought this game merely out of spite for all the negative press it has been getting from people who had never played it.  Demonizing and calling for censorship...of a game,  I wasnt expecting much from it but from what Ive played so far im enjoying it.  Classic gameplay without question but its hard enough to keep you coming back and trying to keep pushing further into the levels.\n\nWorth $20?  Hard to say really.  If you like twin stick shooters it might be.  The game has good production quality and its not sloppy but if you dont like the genre it wont change your mind.  If you are a casual fan then wait for a sale.  Its a good value at $15 but paying full price is as close to showing the modern gaming press that you disaprove of their antics as you will ever get.","June 1, 2015","true","1.1"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stupidbastardupdated/recommended/341940/","stupidbastardupdated","Micless Vagrant","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stupidbastardupdated/","162 products in account","A solid enough twin stick shooter. Make sure your rig is somewhat beefy before heading in, the game has an intense destruction system/mechanics that can really take the ♥♥♥♥ out of a lesser PC.\n\nThe game plays fairly well and the controls are decent enough. The camera pans where you aim, and can be manipulated about as we'll as you'd expect with the isometric view. Weapons, lines, and animations are all at least passable, and have a nice amount of variety. You'll usually be able to kill a few dozen people before noticing repeats. The lines are lovably cheesy, and the whole game has a very Postal 1 atmosphere while still managing to take itself seriously to a humorous extent.\n\nThe destruction mechanics are interesting and fun to use, from driving a car through the front of a grocery store to using grenades to flush out soldiers by blowing down a wall it's but functional and fashionable. Vehicles can be driven and are like miniature race cars with paper-thin exteriors. They're fast, get you where you want to go, but don't expect to live long in it. The player is very mobile and can vault over objects, take cover, sprint, etc in an easily controllable and responsive manner, though it may take some getting used to in order not to get stuck on bushes and leap over cover.\n\nThe major flaws are the aforementioned hardware requirements, the isometric view being a pain sometimes (though adapting and using the minimap is a key skill in overcoming this), and the washed out colors making it difficult to see some enemies/locations (but once again there are in-game mechanics in place to nullify this, it's mostly a passive issue that simply requires some more attention to minimaps or using the highlighting key).\n\nAll in all if you enjoy a bloody, destructive romp, twin stick shooters, or edgy funtimes that make the politically correct ♥♥♥♥ their pants in sheer frothing rage, then this is your kind of game.\n\nP.S.: ♥♥♥♥ the ♥♥♥♥ing military base. ♥♥♥♥ it.","June 1, 2015","true","17.5"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

The level of violence within has been seen before, and even done a bit better. Character controls feel clunky and inaccurate. The missions are repetitive and the action very quickly grows stale. Executions add a bit of shock value, but only if you've never played any of the Mortal Kombat series. In fact, they're rather abbreviated and goreless. Some blood is spilled, but there is very little in the way of actual gore.\n\nThe shock factor simply isn't there. The main character says little mean quips while you fire on civilians, but let's stop kidding ourselves; If we applied a grey filter to Grand Theft Auto and threw in a little extra voice acting, we'd have a better game. The main character isn't even capable of firing from high ground to hit low targets.\n\nI honestly feel as though this game is a poorly executed, level driven Grand Theft Auto clone with a bad camera angle and control scheme. Furthermore, I'd say the vast majority of these positive Steam reviews stem directly from the hype that was applied during the advertising period prior to the game's release.\n\nThis could have been a newgrounds flash game, and it would have played no differently.\n","June 8, 2015","false","7.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I suspected from the trailers that this was going to be one of those games that "tried too hard". Essentially, it looked like it wanted to cash in on the "anti-SJW" backlash of Gamergate. Despite this, it looked like it would at least be fun to play. It is not. In fact, it is not even a finished game. The visuals are incredibly poorly thought out, a mostly black character in dark, monochrome environments simply was not a good idea. The mouse and keyboard controls are tolerable, but the aiming system is a bit wonky. With a controller, the game is essentially unplayable. Of course, the bugs ensure that any enjoyment the game brings to player is fleeting. Basically, as many others have said, it's Postal as narrated by Xavier: Renegade Angel. The difference between Postal and Hatred is that Postal had the good sense not to take itself seriously. Oh, and even RWS does a better QA job than Destructive Creations. I'm not quite sure why this game has such a positive rating, have you deluded yourselves into thinking that liking this broken, poorly made game will strike some kind of blow against DIGRA or whatever the conspiracy theory du jour is?

Releasedate. 6/1/15\n\nGame is unfortunately downright unplayable right now.\nMultiple crashes to desktop during the first two missions. (especially during executions.)\nLaggy, extremely low fps - but only during critical health state... strange bug... please fix that asap.\n\nanother thing: controls.\nWay too inaccurate and delayed controls for a quick twin-stick shooter (only tried it with controller so far)\n\nFor controllers, there's no real binding-options, whatsoever.\nThere's one button for weapon change/execution. No binding-possibilities here.\nThat sucks. Especially when you're desperate for health.\nBecause the only way to get additional health is by executing someone.\nThis means: In situations of desperation, caused by low health, a laggy gameplay, and  inaccurate controls, you'll find yourself spamming the 'Y' button in front of each corpse, hoping for some health.\nInstead, you'll just switch between weapons most of the time. That's annoying. I'd recommend changing the command for switching weapons to 'holding Y button'.\n\nQuestion for the devs: Don't you test your games before release?!\nThose are bugs and gameplay-flaws that occured to me only after the first hour of gameplay... what the hell??","June 1, 2015","false","1.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

In fact, the whole theme of the game, going in murder spree and killing everything that moves, has already been done way back in time by games like Postal.\n\nBesides mediocre quality overall, there are some serious issues in the game, like aiming with controller, difficulty to distinguish persons from objects, performance issues and so on.\n\nThe game does have some good aspects as well, for example the destruction physics is pretty awesome and the aesthetics done by using wide scale of gray as color is actually pretty neat. Still, at current state I just can't recommend  it. If the developers actually fix some of the problems, then I could see this game actually being a decent one and fun to play in short bursts, but not right now.","June 2, 2015","false","2.8"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

To heal, you need to execute wounded victims, which can be hard since it's a random chance to actually wound someone. I think either regening health or first aid kits would have absolved this issue. Maybe even have Med Kits that you pick up and use, while keeping executions in the game. Getting shot from offscreen is more of an annoyance than a problem, mostly because 9/10 times I can just right click and see who's shooting at me. I think a better way to show people behind walls, instead of the gray and gray look, is to use the objective finder red outline instead. It's much more noticable, and a simple way of doing things.The cars are a neat idea, but dear god, trying to drive one at all, even without getting shot at, is a horrific experience in and of itself. A shotgun blast sends your car into flames, and then a bird ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on the hood is the final kicker for it to explode on you. Those are really all my complaints, but everyone else seems to like to find everything wrong with a game and make a big deal out of nothing.","June 9, 2015","true","5.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

BUT BE WARNED!!!!! CHECK YOUR SPECS BEFORE GETTING THIS!!!!\n\nI've come back to write a review on this game after getting a system upgrade just so I could play it.\n\nI'll still reccomend this game... if it goes on sale.\n\npros:\ndecent graphics, ok soundtack, insane physics engine, very dark atmosphere, lots of killing. great concept of a game. very challenging.\n\ncons:\nI'm still shocked at how much processing power this game needs to run. literally need a decent quad core to even get this to run.\nGameplay is a bit clumsy, aiming is irritatingly difficult, and gets hard to watch after a while with all the monochrome-style graphics... and I'm playing with a 32 inch lcd tv hooked up through HDMI. Also... gets kinda boring pretty fast? I don't know how to explain it.\ndespite all the violence it actually gets kinda dull pretty fast.\nController support sucks. Literally almost impossible to play decent with a controller for this style of game. I mean, you CAN... but, this is a rare case where a mouse and keyboard are more effective because of how the game is set up. There's also some gameplay issues you'll find annoying involving actually moving around and aiming.\n\noverall:\nI just can't bring myself to call this a bad game. It isn't a bad game.\nIt's a decent game with a lot of negative aspects going for it. Annoying graphics and gameplay are two of them. Very well made game though! But, I do have to put out the warning on the negatives.\n\nbut, CHECK YOUR SYSTEM TO SEE IF YOU CAN RUN THIS GAME!\nI made the mistake of getting this (not on sale... ugh) before checking, and was shocked to see how much I needed to upgrade. DO NOT BUY IF YOU DON'T HAVE A QUAD CORE PROCESSOR!\n\nAlso, just wishlist this game and wait for a sale.

Imagine cinema without Scarface, Hannibal Lecter or even Mike Leigh's Johnny. Moral ambiguity is essential to the silver screen but remains only a distant hope on our monitors.\n\nThe game certainly has its limitations. The core mechanics are those of a middling-quality isometric shooter with some fine destruction physics. Moreover, no significant narrative is provided for the orgy of destruction. This could either be viewed as serving the nihilistic atmosphere, or be considered as a narrative failing when compared to cinematic anti-heroes.\n\nHowever, considering that the utterances of Hatred's anti-hero are not especially inspired, it's perhaps for the better than the minimalistic approach has been taken - we are free to each craft our own reasons for the violence.\n\nPositives:\n\n- Good atmosphere; cold, grim visuals\n- Surprisingly good physics & destruction via UE4. It works well when backed into an Apple Store's bathroom and gunning down soldiers, who finally bring the entire structure down, forcing a hasty run-and-gun exit through the rubble.\n- Good concept\n- One of the best flamethrowers since Return To Castle Wolfenstein.\n\nNegatives:\n\n- For a game so rooted in gunplay, the actual gun sounds lack punch.\n- Something of a manufactured controversy - not really as violent or drastic as people might expect,\n- A fundamentally simple game that would struggle to justify a higher price point.","June 3, 2015","true","12.8"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Gameplay is repetative, but in a good way.  A lot of small options and functions seem to be missing though.\n\n1. Why the hell can't i use civilians as bullet sheilds? Maybe add a grab option?\n2.  Hand guns and other munitions seem to lack any range. as in cops on the edge of the screen are often immune to shots that seem to dead end just before going off camera.\npretty sure most guns have more then the screens 25-30 m range, though I understand acc at that range is tricky with pistols.\n3. How many civilians do you know that could take a 9mm in the face and keep on running.  Aparently everyone in this game can.  a 2 shot minimum for regular people is foolish.  A little variation in peoples durability would be cool.\n4. Driving system is so touchy moving at more then a crawl is tricky.  If I cant shoot from a car then just make it a mouse control.  Oh and also WHY CAN"T I SHOOT FROM A CAR?\n5. Physical combat boils down to a kick. Id like to see more varied physical combat without having to first kick them down for execution.  Maybe keep the kick at a range, but mix in some face smashing if you use the same button in close. (without annoying camera changes)\n6. Grenade usage is painfully bad.  If you can take the time to force us to watch badly directed shots of his executions you could at least use that same tech to create an accurate throwing system.  I don't know about you, but I want to be able to nail the upstairs bathroom window.  Put in an aiming system that gives the player short moments of first or third person control.  Allowing the player to actually place grenades, instead of having them bounce off ♥♥♥♥ and come back 50% of the time.\n\nHatred is a lot of fun as is, but it seems the devs just didn't take the time for the little details that make a game great.

You play as a man who's purpose is just to kill everything, the game plays like any other top-down twin stick shooter with you using a wide array of weapons to kill everything on screen.  As i said the games not bad but not great either, there are plenty of other games like this which are better and contain co-op play.\n\nI enjoy using the weapons in the game and I do like the art style the game has chosen where the game is all in black or white except for blood and police lights.  There is never a dull moment in this game as your always firing your gun at something and this game has some awesome destruction physics in which buildings can be shot up or blown up which is great for making a getaway when trapped.\n\nHowever there is a lot of things i did not like such as the horrible dialog and one liners your character makes, it makes 80s action movie quotes seem like poetry by comparison, the camera control is probelly the biggest enemy of all as you try to shoot something in front but instead the camera is zoomed at the bottom limiting your view and the combat does not feel very precise.  lastly the Frame rate is pretty bad for a top down game with me only getting about 40 FPS with a 980.\n\nOnce again not a bad game especilly for the devolpers first game so far but i can not reccommend this game as being worthy of the price or your time when there are better games than this.

I suspected from the trailers that this was going to be one of those games that "tried too hard". Essentially, it looked like it wanted to cash in on the "anti-SJW" backlash of Gamergate. Despite this, it looked like it would at least be fun to play. It is not. In fact, it is not even a finished game. The visuals are incredibly poorly thought out, a mostly black character in dark, monochrome environments simply was not a good idea. The mouse and keyboard controls are tolerable, but the aiming system is a bit wonky. With a controller, the game is essentially unplayable. Of course, the bugs ensure that any enjoyment the game brings to player is fleeting. Basically, as many others have said, it's Postal as narrated by Xavier: Renegade Angel. The difference between Postal and Hatred is that Postal had the good sense not to take itself seriously. Oh, and even RWS does a better QA job than Destructive Creations. I'm not quite sure why this game has such a positive rating, have you deluded yourselves into thinking that liking this broken, poorly made game will strike some kind of blow against DIGRA or whatever the conspiracy theory du jour is?

Releasedate. 6/1/15\n\nGame is unfortunately downright unplayable right now.\nMultiple crashes to desktop during the first two missions. (especially during executions.)\nLaggy, extremely low fps - but only during critical health state... strange bug... please fix that asap.\n\nanother thing: controls.\nWay too inaccurate and delayed controls for a quick twin-stick shooter (only tried it with controller so far)\n\nFor controllers, there's no real binding-options, whatsoever.\nThere's one button for weapon change/execution. No binding-possibilities here.\nThat sucks. Especially when you're desperate for health.\nBecause the only way to get additional health is by executing someone.\nThis means: In situations of desperation, caused by low health, a laggy gameplay, and  inaccurate controls, you'll find yourself spamming the 'Y' button in front of each corpse, hoping for some health.\nInstead, you'll just switch between weapons most of the time. That's annoying. I'd recommend changing the command for switching weapons to 'holding Y button'.\n\nQuestion for the devs: Don't you test your games before release?!\nThose are bugs and gameplay-flaws that occured to me only after the first hour of gameplay... what the hell??","June 1, 2015","false","1.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

It sucks too because I really wanted to like this game but it just wouldn't let me. The novelty wears off in about 15 minutes once you've killed hundreds of people in the same boring way. The execution animations are also repetitive. There's maybe 10 of these executions and after you've seen them for the first time they get really old, really fast. And what makes this worse is that you HAVE to execute people a lot, since that's how you regain your health. Controls are really bad, especially on keyboard and mouse, don't buy this game if you don't have a controller on hand. There is no checkpoint system, instead you have to earn "respawn tokens" by completing side quests. If you have no respawn tokens and you die, the game starts you at the beginning of the ♥♥♥♥ing level. This gets really annoying, since you've usually got hundreds of people to kill and starting over can set you back a good 15-20 minutes.\n\nOn top of all the gameplay issues, the game is riddled with bugs and performance issues. I have a pretty modest set up, I'll admit (3.4GHz quad-core AMD, 8 gigs RAM, 750 TI), but I can run most new releases on at least medium and get a solid framerate at 1080p. This game however, ran extremely slow, with my max framerate being about 35fps, with an average framerate of ~20fps. I even put everything on low and turned my resolution down to 720p and it did nothing to help the problem. I'd imagine if you have a 980 or higher you could run this game but you may want to be careful  if you're on a modest PC, and if you're on a low-end PC just forget it, you won't be able to run this game.\n\nHatred is a good idea, but the dev team just did not handle it properly. If I had to rate it, I'd give it a 2/10.","June 2, 2015","false","2.1"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

I'll say that mowing down civilians in it makes me feel kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and uneasy but really going any more in to that is just beating a dead horse that most media outlets can't seem to get enough of. That said, at its core it's a pretty fun twin stick shooter. When it's time to deal with some actual threats the game's actually pretty challenging and rewarding. Ducking, dodging, and generally evading gunfire is pretty intense and the guns themselves feel like they have a proper oomph behind them.\n\nThe destructable environments lend a lot to that effect as well when desks, glass, thin walls, and just about anything in the level really is destroyed and blown up by gunfire and  explosions. The destructable environments themselves also allow for some creative approaches to combat as well. SWAT team swarming the house you're holed up in and you need a quick way out? Shoot the conveniently placed oxygen canister in the garage to blow a hole in the side of the building to flee through. Need to clear out a heavily fortified building but can't get through the front door without getting mowed down? Steal a SWAT van and drive it through the side of the building.\n\nThat said, it's not without its faults. The driving mechanics feel extremely clunky and sometimes it's easy to glitch the vehicles out on the geometry in really weird ways. I mentioned before that just about anything in the level can be destroyed. Well the game can be pretty stupid at times about what qualifies as just about anything. It's pretty silly when you can ram an armored van straight through the side of a solid concrete building but at the same time it just stops dead in its tracks when it hits a chest high brick wall. The monochrome color scheme can be a pain in the ♥♥♥ at times as well. A good example would be the sewer level where it makes it extremely difficult to tell whats blocking your path and what isn't, which makes it fairly easy to get caught on the terrain during a firefight or duck behind what you might think is a pipe running along the floor only to realize after taking two shells in the chest is actually an overhanging pipe.\n\nOverall though, while the premise behind the game might be understandably off putting to people the core mechanics themselves are pretty great. If nothing else, it'd be pretty cool to see what the developers could do with it outside of a mass murder simulator.","June 9, 2015","true","2.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

In it’s purest form effectively cathartic.\n\n\n\n~Visceral execution sequences~ Endlessly enjoyable destruction of the game environment,  much like a sword this cuts both ways,  both for and against the player.\n\n\n\nPresentation aside the game runs reasonably well save texture oddities and physics bugs, persistent clipping is a tad annoying as well however not something I feel detracts from the game-play on a whole.\n\n\n**Note how the game runs is relative to specs,  only very recently did DC add an advanced graphics options for tweaking on lower end systems,  as of my initial review I was running Hatred with an Nvidia GTX 780ti my second machine couldn't even play Hatred till the very recent optimization patch,  even so there is a drastic difference in performance.(The Marina Sewers and Powerplant levels really take an excessive toll on my AMD Radeon 7570 HD)**\n\n\n\nI do feel some decals(blood splatters on npcs) could have been executed better in terms of both visual fidelity and frequency,  particles however are to die for,  great job!\n\n\n\nSome feel that the control scheme is atrocious,  I do not have any issue with the default mouse and keyboard controls,  this is probably due to being conditioned to worse control schemes over a decade i.e. the first two Gothic games and Secondlife. While there can be some line of sight issues at given moment nothing stands out as a red flag.\n\n\n\n**if one experiences any excessive clunkiness it is probably hardware related - tweak your settings or upgrade your rig.**\n\n\n\nAs of this review I am at the Military Base, the second to last mission. Based upon my overall experience playing on Hard Difficulty I give Hatred a solid 4 out of Five stars.\n\n\n\n**I have progressed further since that point however decided to replay prior maps to unlock certain Steam achievements,  up until mobo failure on my main rig at least. Only very recently have I been able to play Hatred again as the DC team has released a patch which optimizes performance for ATI/AMD hardware to an extent.**\n\n\n**Don't say Destructive Creations never did anything for their consumers!**\n\n\n\nA brief reprieve worth remembering,  kudos to Destructive Creations.\n\n\n\n**Lastly,  do not let my review be a standard to how one should feel on this game,  if you hate this game so be it,  however if one feels I am supposed to apologize for enjoying Hatred - ♥♥♥♥ you. Gotta love double standards.**","June 9, 2015","true","146.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","8"

It is trying to be as offensive as possible which is fine I guess, but I have to admit, it goes from boring, to hard, not due to any skill just because the ai and enemy spawn is rather lame. A lot of the shock value comes from the fact you are shooting unarmed people, and pretty much once that wears off, you are left with half the game of just running around killing people. The other half either running/fight the mobs of police that shoot you all at once from different directions.","June 30, 2015","false","3.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I have not completed the game, but I plan on it, but this review will be based on my early impressions after playing for a few hours.\n\nThe gameplay is your standard twin stick shooter with an interesting twist. Instead of being the protagonist and fighting off zombies, monsters, robots etc, you are the evil antagonist, senselessly slaughtering innocents and police alike. There is very little plot, aside from you hate everyone, and want everyone to die. The Controls are a little clunky if you don't have a controller set up. I've died once or twice because the controls are just silly.\n\nPro's:\nBeautiful graphics for a twin stick shooter, among the best I've seen to date for this genre.\nBrutal Executions (only way to heal yourself)\nDestructible Environments (Who doesn't love blowing a hole through a building and killing everyone who is on the inside?)\nVariety of weaponry: Run out of bullets? pick up a cops gun and use that instead.\nSide missions to spice things up a bit and add a layer of difficulty.\nCivilians will pick up weapons and fight back: Again, adding another layer of difficulty. They fight for their lives instead of just being lambs for the slaughter.\nExplosions! Lots of "Red" gas cans, propane tanks, and other combustibles that you can shoot to make a big explosion. Excellent if there are a few cops near it!\n\nCon's:\nKeyboard controls are clunky. Difficult to move and throw grenades / kick / aim while moving and shooting.\nGrayscale makes it hard to differentiate between civilians and police officers / swat team members\nNo real Plot: I feel my self wanting there to be a reason why I hate everyone so much that they all need to die.\nRepetitive game play. There is no real diversity, as in every other twin stick shooter I've played, you run and gun. that's all there is to it!\n\nIn the end I'd say that this game will be fine in small doses, but would be the type of game that I could burn out on if I played too much too fast. I'd say it's worth a shot if you can get past the whole "killing civilians for no reason" aspect of the game, and don't mind a bit of repetitive mindless killing.\n\n7/10\n\n","June 2, 2015","true","19.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I say that as in the edginess transcends shadow the hedgehog levels, even gears of war levels and becomes so over the top it ends up being just downright cheesey and funny.\n\nPhysics effects become taxing on your system as a level progresses, as all the destroyed objects don't fade away. (edit: heard from friends with less powerful systems that the physics effects are taxing as all hell on lower powered PCs right from the get-go)\n\nGameplay is damn good, though what feels like a massive difficulty spike on the last level where you really have to play it smart instead of just killing everyone en masse and rushing the cops head-on, and it really encourages you to get those additional objectives complete (you'll need those respawn points)\n\nGraphically, it's fairly sound and with the exception of the occasional glitch where a decal texture on the floor spreads to everything near it.  Only real beef is how ugly Nottam Portant's hair looks, but you're not playing the game to look at his hair - or if you are, you're not going to get very far.\n\nsolid 8/10 and becomes 11/10 when you blast dethklok as you play the game","June 1, 2015","true","10.9"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Hatred is here, and it sucks.\n\nOkay, first of all, I don't have a particular problem with the game's theme itself. Unfortunately, our society isn't perfect and yes, there are tragic occurrences when some bolk goes mad and kills a lot of people out of God knows what. It happens. And as such, a game in fact has every right to touch such a sad subject. It's not even a new thing, just check on Postal for instance!\n\nBut man, Destructive Creations screwed up everything they could do right in this case. The engine itself was a bad idea, UE4 is poorly optimized and unnecessary for a top-down-view shooter, Unity would have been a far better choice. The game is sluggish, runs horribly on the same PC that makes GTA V fly, and ugly as hell too. So there's that.\n\nIn the terms of gameplay, it shows nothing new, and gets boring after a few minutes. Is it cool to kill people without a reason? Well maybe it could be, but isn't, thanks for the horrible AI that makes them feel like mindless idiots wandering like zombies. It's just bad.\n\nJust like the shooting mechanic: aiming is difficult, there is no cover system, the enemy is always overpowered, and it's just simply not fun to shoot. Which is sad because in such a game, using guns might be a selling point.\n\nAnd the game ends in 4 hours, giving us absolutely no reason to play it again.

Laugh maniacally as you gun down the weak and feeble, wading through crunchy bone fragments. Crush your enemies, see them driven before you, hear the lamentations of their women, and then stomp on their womanly skulls!\n\nAll in all, a fun little isometric shooter, a little on the easy side once you master the ancient art of crouchwalk-fu which will throw trained soldier's aim completely off. maybe they studied at the Stormtrooper school of marksmanship, who knows. They do suffer from "PsychicGuard" syndrome though and will track you through walls, quick on the trigger once they get a clear shot too.\n\nThe game does get repetitive after a while, I found by the time I was getting bored I'd almost finished it however. I imagine it will be a good one to pick up and put down when you're in the mood for good ol' fashioned cathartic vidya game genocide. Controversy surrounding it can safely be ignored, it was not, is not and will not be the antichrist reborn into pixels, nor will it brainwash your sprogs into Charles Manson clones, not that they should be playing an AO-rated game in the first place.\n\nAs for performance, didn't experience much slow-down putting everything to ultra, although I understand some combinations of GPU and CPU are causing more issues than others. I hope they work some more on optimizing for those systems. Apart from a few freezes when starting the game all was good.\n\nTL;DR - Fun, fairy easy isometric shooter with w@nky protagonist.

You play as a man who's purpose is just to kill everything, the game plays like any other top-down twin stick shooter with you using a wide array of weapons to kill everything on screen.  As i said the games not bad but not great either, there are plenty of other games like this which are better and contain co-op play.\n\nI enjoy using the weapons in the game and I do like the art style the game has chosen where the game is all in black or white except for blood and police lights.  There is never a dull moment in this game as your always firing your gun at something and this game has some awesome destruction physics in which buildings can be shot up or blown up which is great for making a getaway when trapped.\n\nHowever there is a lot of things i did not like such as the horrible dialog and one liners your character makes, it makes 80s action movie quotes seem like poetry by comparison, the camera control is probelly the biggest enemy of all as you try to shoot something in front but instead the camera is zoomed at the bottom limiting your view and the combat does not feel very precise.  lastly the Frame rate is pretty bad for a top down game with me only getting about 40 FPS with a 980.\n\nOnce again not a bad game especilly for the devolpers first game so far but i can not reccommend this game as being worthy of the price or your time when there are better games than this.

My FPS seemed to jump all over the place when playing this game. One minute it's at 40-50, the next it's dropping to 25-30. WTF man! Turning down my settings helped a bit, but even still. Certain parts of the game lag and stutter like crazy, while other parts run butter smooth. I don't understand it! That's one complaint, another is how easily overwhelmed you can get. The damn cops just swarm you at random sometimes and drain your health faster than you can say "aw ♥♥♥♥!" Even on the easiest difficulty. I understand the need/want for a challenge, but I find this whole "respawn point" nonsense ridiculous! I lose 'em all then I gotta restart from the beginning of the stage? C'mon! Just gimme a checkpoint ffs! Or at least have two different game types. One with limited continues which the player has to earn, and one with checkpoints. Finally, my third and final complaint is the storyline. If you can even call it that. I was hoping for a descriptive backstory of the main character, but no. All you know about him is that he's just some sadistic psychopath that wants to eradicate the human race. That's it! How about explaining who he is, where he came from, how he became this way, what drove him to these motives etc. I thought this game was supposed to be dark and brooding, but instead it's no different than GTA. There, I said it! I know it's been said before, but it's true. The only difference is you can't steal cars. (I.E break in and hotwire them.) You can only drive vehicles which the engine is running and the door is open. Now, I'll be honest here, I bought this game primarily for the controversy behind it. But in all honesty, that A/O rating is nothing but a joke! I mean...\n\n- Intense Violence\n- Blood and Gore\n- Strong Language\n\nSeriously? That's it? GTA has way more suggestive themes than that and it's only rated M. Seems to me that this game is nothing but a publicity stunt. Build hype using shock-value and watch the money flow in. Well, I for one am here telling you that, heh, it's really not worth it. So if you plan to buy this game simply for the controversy, don't. You will be sadly disappointed. The executions are repetitive and the forced, bad ♥♥♥, over-the-edge, "I'm sick of humanity and I'm gonna kill you all" dialog gets old pretty fast. Now if you want to buy it because you enjoy top-down shoot-em-ups with great physics and destructable scenery, then my suggestion to you is wait for a sale. In my opinion, this game isn't worth $20. No offense to the devs, they did a great job on the textures, physics, gameplay and all. I just felt they could've beefed up the storyline a bit, as well as the objectives. All you do is kill civilians, kill cops, execute people, escape. Next stage, rinse and repeat. I'm sorry but it just gets tiring, especially when you lose all your respawn points and have to start from the beginning of the stage. Steam refund here I come.","July 8, 2015","false","2.0"," 10 of 20 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","10","20","2","0"

It has its moments, but overall, it feels clunky. I entered some buildings and it did not show the insides, so I was stuck guessing what to shoot. I'm not going to hate on this game for what it is, but I'm not going to say I absolutely love it. Also, not sure about anyone else, but after playing for a bit on ultra settings, game really started to drop in frame rate. I have no problem running any modern game in full res, but even when I lowered the settings, it still dropped in frame rate after about 4-5 minutes in. It may just be me, but I find it odd that I can run Sniper Elite 3 in full res, with tessellation on, and it runs flawlessly. With a few updates, and hopefully cool mods, this game can become something pretty great, definitely has the potential.","June 1, 2015","true","5.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

This is violent, you should not let your 12 year old son play this, nor should his little ♥♥♥♥ mouth be stinking up the mic on any M rated game. (Please, us adults get online to game and get away from BS, not listen to more of it.)\n\nANYWAYS, here is my review. This game is really fun and have plenty of replay value, BUT, and a big butt at that, there is only 7 levels. Super short game. I beat it in less than 4 hours. SUPER dissapointed because the story was going so well, then it just ends. Thats it. Its not a cliff hanger, but it seems just way too short. With only 7 levels to go back through and beat on all difficulties, I just feel it was too short to earn my $20. If they fix the optimization issues, make the gameplay feel smoother, and every other little thing that certainly gets in the way of playing fast-paced, then I could feel better about my purchase. Please add a FREE DLC! Then I will be happy. If they add more stories onto it, then it will be worth the buy. But if you wanna try it, and have $20 you don't want, go for it. You can even play less than 2 hours and get a full steam refund (Check out the new steam refunds policy made today!)\n\n7.5/10 I would totally run around murdering people while using a scottish accent, again!","June 2, 2015","true","5.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Twin stick shooter where you just shoot civilians. Does it live up to it's hype? Not quite, but that doesn't mean it's bad either.\n\nIt's somewhere in between. Certainly a good game when you want to relieve some stress, shoot some people up and then close it, only to come back to it the next day for same short session. Don't expect miracles, don't expect deep story or even name of character, you just shoot people.\n\nYou know what? It's not a bad thing at all. Destruction mechanics, shooting mechanics are cool and kinda realistic. It's fun to shoot civilians, but sadly executions get tad repetive. Game is also kinda hard.\n\nI like the game's aesthethic. It's black and white, with some colour from sirens of police cars and few other smaller things. Optimisation is a bit bad but devs will resolve it, I'm sure of it, more after the service they were doing to fans.\n\nIt's alright. Strong 7/10, but is it worth the full price asking now? Well for value I got from here so far, I'd say yeah. There are much worse games (Grass simulator) that offer nothing at all, yet they cost $10, and this here? Offers heavy atmostphere, heavy soundtrack that further adds to how intense this game is, destruction physics that allow you to literally destroy entire houses and fun shooting mechanics.\n\nGet it now or wait for price drop. Whatever floats your boat. It's not THAT brutal, it's not bad, it's not excellent, it's alright, and that's more than enough for me to like it.","June 1, 2015","true","8.0"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

If this game wanted just to be controversial, then it needed to be done right. It needs more forced sex, more realistic gore so you can cut people's limbs off and cut open their stomach, torture, the ability to ♥♥♥♥ the bullet holes of your victims, schools full of children to massacre, churches to massacre, babies to strangle, and assassinating Barack Obama brutally. This is ♥♥♥♥, and I expect these things to be in the next game (If there is a next game). In addition, the game has ♥♥♥♥♥♥ controls, awful AI, lighting so godawful you can't even see people without holding alt, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ optimization.
