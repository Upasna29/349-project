Unlike other series in which you play as "bad guys" who ultimately tend to do the right thing, Kane and Lynch are 100% scumbags.  Kane is a self-serving, traitorous sociopath and Lynch is just completely mental.  It's a real treat to see how they interact with each other and how their personalities affect the storyline.\n\nThe combat is good, not great.  The cover system is a little wonky and the AI is outright terrible at times, but I was always having enough fun that these issues didn't bother me much.  Shooting feels off at first, but as you progress and get a feel for the weapons, it becomes a total joy.  You really get the feel of desperation that would accompany a heist gone wrong leading into a frantic shootout with the cops (like I would know).  Kudos to whoever did the sound for the weapons, I haven't heard beefier sounding assault rifles in any other game!\n\nThe graphics are pretty mediocre, and look like what you'd expect from a non triple-A title in 2007.  That being said, the levels you play in are more than interesting enough to make up for it.  You'll go from banks and upscale office buildings to the streets and rooftops of Tokyo to Havana in the middle of a political revolution.  One of my favorite set pieces was a gunfight in a busy nightclub, which seemed to be lifted straight out of the movie "Collateral."\n\nOverall, this is a solid game with a few flaws that stand out, but definitely won't ruin the experience of playing as such interesting characters in such interesting situations.  And for only $6.99 (down from $60 when it came out) you can't go wrong giving it a try!","January 6, 2014","true","26.5"," 69 of 72 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","69","72","0","0"

You play as Kane in the single-player campaign mode , haven't played multiplayer as I don't even know if its alive or I dont want to do anything related with GFWL.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty much average and feels wonky , the story is also not that fantastic, but once you happen to start the game, you would want to finish it no matter what, I took two 5 hour sessions to complete this game, even though it has its flaws, but overall its above average, and you would not want to lay the campaign in SP mode once you complete it once. Graphics-wise  its an old game with mediocre graphics in today's standards , but the graphics was not painfully bad as of its age.\n\nIt has excessive profanity and tries to appeal as a dark narrative  and adult friendly game but fails at execution and the final product turns out to be like a violent average B-rated movie, which has its moments but, didn't impress me too much , although I would recommend it for a one time gameplay which was worth the $2 dollars at the time of sale. So yeah, if you want a few hours of fun, get it in a sale , or buy it anyway as its only 7 dollars if your very desperate to try it out.\n\nI would give it a 6.5 out of 10.","October 1, 2014","true","9.2"," 53 of 64 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","53","64","0","0"

Forced together on a violent and chaotic path of redemption and revenge, no action is considered too harsh as this volatile partnership is pushed beyond reason in this brutally realistic, character-driven third person action shooter.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- Accuracy is very bad\n- Voice Acting will sometimes overlap and/or glitch out\n- A.I. partners feel awkward\n- The Ending left something to be desired for\n\nThe Good:\n\n- Fun commentary from Kane & Lynch\n- Lots of exciting levels\n- Feels healthy when compared to other games made in this generation\n- Story is well executed\n\nThe Review:\n\nKane & Lynch easily earns its mature rating, with ferocious, bloody attacks and an excessive use of swear words. Essentially a third-person shooter with some simple squad commands, it is an uninspired, frustrating action experience.\n\nFor example, to jump into cover, you simply run up to an obstacle. Sounds easy enough, except you have to run into a wall or obstacle a couple times before you "click" into cover.\n\nTargeting is just as irritating. Gunshots seem a hair off almost every time. Computer-controlled players prefer to play hide-and-seek rather than to engage in heated battles. Kane & Lynch showed promise with a strong story, but after a few levels it turns up dead on arrival. Overall, however, the game is an enjoyable piece of software that will keep you entertained in its sub-par length game of approx. 5 hours.","July 1, 2014","true","4.5"," 39 of 44 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","39","44","0","3"

Every single criticism that you've heard about this game just might be valid, but that still doesn't hinder my recommendation of this game.\n\nYes, the recoil on the guns is absurd. This isn't a problem, because bullets are much more damaging when they actually hit what you want them to.\n\nYes, the graphics are dated, but it's early 360/PS3 graphics, so that makes more sense than it would otherwise.\n\nYes, the characters are all but unlikable. However, this seems to be intentional, as IO interactive stated in an interview before release that you shouldn't be trying to do so. Think about movies like The Departed. There's nobody to root for, not even the titular protagonists. Fortunately, the further you progress, the more that Kane and Lynch ♥♥♥♥ up. The characters, not the game.\n\nYes, the story is confusing, but it's only confusing if you don't bother to put the puzzle pieces together and try to figure out the facts from what little information. It's like the story in Dark Souls in that way. The only difference is that this is fresh territory that nobody has bothered to theorycraft yet, so go nuts blazing a trail that nobody's blazed before.\n\nYes, I had some problems with Games for Windows Live, but i was able to install the program for it and log in with my Microsoft Account that i use to login to Windows 10. You even get achievements for Xbox for playing with it on.

Difficult because it is full of good ideas unfortunately not always well done, uncomfortable because in these times of mania censorship and witch hunt, is a game that does everything to be tipped as amoral and violent. Stuff to embarrass any GTA.\nIf Tommy Vercetti and Carl Johnson could be sympathetic in their raids towns, Kane & Lynch on the contrary are the classic antiheroes, two shady characters sadistic and ruthless than any other video game or movie would be the perfect antagonists. There is nothing heroic about them, there is no possibility that it clicks a minimum of empathy for the two hardened criminals.\nIn most hate and detest and do nothing to hide: their constant foul language is there to prove it. Killers and robbers without remorse, killing machines rated the massacre without respect for anyone. The beginning of the story is withering. The two are, from complete strangers on the bus that takes them to death row when they are freed by an armed part of the gang called "The Seven". Kane, accused of stealing their money, will take a few days to bring them back, otherwise he will be killed the family.\nWhat's more the flank Lynch, a schizophrenic tangled with slight problems of self-control, to watch him and help him in the mission impossible.\nFrom this moment everything that moves, especially when wearing a blue uniform and a star on the chest, it is shot down regardless.

It got a bad reputation mainly because of the Gamespot controversy, but that doesn't mean the game itself is bad because of it. I don't know what else to say other than it being a generic cover-based shooter, so let's get to the pros and cons.\n\nPROS+ Kane and Lynch are awesome characters and what make this franchise memorable.\n+ Each level is different, all set in impressive locations: bank heist, skyscraper, prison break... heck, even civil war.\n+ Shootouts are very intense, combined with Jesper Kyd, Peter Peter and Peter Kyed's musical score.\n+ Not a weak storyline.\n+ Clean and "realistic" graphics (meaning that it is not full of post-process effects like many games nowadays).\n+ Splitscreen co-op.\n\nCONS- No online co-op\n- Single-player campaign is short.\n- Multiplayer, as innovative and fun as it was, it is actually dead.\n- Clunky gameplay and gunplay.\n- AI has some issues that sometimes break the immersion.\n- You have to manually install GFWL through the game's folder, you do not need an account to play though.\n\nI do recommend it, especially if you have a buddy to play co-op with.

And this makes this game really good in term of the storyline, its very nice to see action different then we usually do. Of course its fast third person shooter so don`t expect "The Kite Runner" hearth-breaking storyline that will make you cry, or that will lead you to some serious toughts like for example "Spec Ops: The Line" did. But for this genre it`s really good with strong language and sometimes really violent moments.\n\nLet`s talk about graphics, which is great too, its game from 2007 so it`s not perfect today but its still really good, great i would say with awesome with awesome destructible environment, another game from years ago which has this awesome feature which is adding load of immersion into the game and what`s still very rarely using in videogames.\nFrom the other hand, i can`t say much about the music, i think it`s ok, at best, nothing that i would hate but just after i beat the game on highest difficulity settings i can`t really remember any track from the entire game, nothing at all. I guess if i would rate it it would be like 5/10 just because it`s not bad, doesn`t make you want cut then eat your ears, but that`s like i said nothing spectacular and you will probably forget it just after you quit the game like i did.\nSpeaking about difficulity level, its nothing special too, on highest difficulty like i was playing you will die or fail mission here and there but that`s mostly in situations where you are just flooded with countless enemies that are shooting at you from every angle. Otherwise its really easy.\n\nUnfortunately game cover mechanics ain`t the best i`ve ever seen, it works ok usually but ofter you will find yourself in those clunky situations where you want to take cover while you`re under heavy fire but your character will just refuse to stick to this particular cover. Controls though are very fluent and i did not have any problems with the game itself.\n\nI would strongly reccomend you this game when its on sale, it`s really worth to spend few dollars on it. very short but i would say condensed experience if you are into third person cover shooters.\nI had load of fun with the game and i hope you will too.\n\nAlso game has co-op which will give you load of fun with your buddy ! Definitely should try this on out\n\nFrankcastle51 out.\n\nPS. I could say that full price is definitely not appropriate to game lenght and overall experience but when its on sale, get it :)","November 24, 2014","true","4.4"," 29 of 35 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","29","35","0","0"

The console port feel doesn't spoil the thrill ride of a hardcore FPS with a strong cinematic leanings. The story is serviceable but it's the characters, their looks and development that surprised me in good ways. There are a lot of unpolished elements with the cover, shooting and AI but the general gameplay is good enough to keep you playing. While the ending was controversial I was OK with it and interested enough to play K&L2.\n\nRecommended for: Adults only who don't mind very gritty violence and language.\n\nConclusion: 7/10.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JPrice321/recommended/8080/","JPrice321","JPrice","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JPrice321/","323 products in account","Kane & Lynch is certainly a controversial one. Famously responsible for getting Gamespot employee Jeff Gerstman fired, Kane & Lynch has earned a reputation for being a game that whilst being promising given the developer background (I.e Hitman series) ultimately led to dissapointment. However is this lukewarm reception justified? In a way, it sort of is.\n\nThe story is your standard revenge tale following main leads Kane and Lynch as Kane attempts to get his daughter back from an old gang that wants him dead. Nothing hugely inventive and with no real twists or turns in the plot it remains pretty uninteresting save for the ending which just happens upruptly and really leaves you with a feeling of "Is that it?". The most intreguing part of this story are its characters. Whilst Kane and Lynch themselves aren't hugely dimensional, the fact that they are often portrayed as bad people brings a nice, not often explored angle to the entire game. This portrayl lends itself well within the first half of the game with many heist like activites being the main goal, such things as bank heists, nightclub areas and prison breakouts. These areas prove to be where the game shows off the potential it could have had if more love and care went into the entire package.\n\nThe gameplay itself isn't all that exciting, just your standard third person action shooter affair. However the cover system isn't traditionally placed on a button in Kane & Lynch, instead they opted to make it an automatic cover system so you instantly stick to a wall. This sounds good in theory and for the first half of the game it works ok but it's in the game's second half where it falls apart. The problem is that the system doesn't work half the time leaving you running at the wall like a fool hoping you'll stick to it, this led to a small number of deaths that could have been easily avoided if the cover system was more competant. Also your partner AI is seriously dumb in most instances often getting themselves downed in need of saving because they stood out in enemy fire which again leads to numerous game overs.\n\nThe game's presentation is sloppy at best; pretty bad lip syncing in game, dialogue interupting other dialogue which causes them to over lap, bland visuals and design. That said however the voicework itself is pretty decent and varies up the locations to at least give some semblance of variety.\n\nOverall Kane & Lynch isn't going to set the world on fire or win any awards, however it doesn't totally fail as there is some fun to be had with the servicable shooting. If you see it for sale at around £5 then it's probably worth the 3-4 hours of gameplay, just don't expect it to be all that great.","August 3, 2013","true","3.9"," 23 of 27 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","23","27","0","0"

The pair that make up Kane & Lynch may sound like a duo from a buddy movie where two rule-bending cops save the day, but they are in fact deeply disturbed convicts, broken out of prison by balaclava-clad henchmen, so they may repay a debt to a mysterious crime organisation.You assume the role of Kane; a monstrous killer with a good man trapped inside of him, who has had his wife and child kidnapped while he is serving time, meaning he must jump to the fiddle of a group called The Seven, who will destroy the remnants of his family life without blinking. Kane is consumed by rage and sadness, but has a touch of Max Payne about him. He has almost nothing to lose, and will stop at nothing to get to his wife and daughter, and it's hard not to warm to him even though he is a dangerous killer.Lynch is your side kick; a violent maniac who's psychological profile would likely read like there had been a serious administrative error in a psychiatrist's filing cabinet.He is prone to attacks of intense hallucinations, that usually stir him into a trigger-happy frenzy where innocent bystanders are fair game, and is sent to watch over you as you struggle to return a mysterious bounty to The Seven. With such intriguing and powerful characters it's easy to get swept in by Kane & Lynch: Dead Men, but after several hours of play, it is going to be the gameplay that really matters.In that regard, Dead Men is of mixed success.There are times when the best technique is to charge head on with scant regard for accurate aiming, fighting with fists and shooting from the hip. Then, a moment later you're expected to work your way forward methodically, picking enemies off from quite a distance. While variety is desperately needed in most shooters, here it is too sporadic, and often hopping between the two is rather confusing.There's also the fact that the targeting reticule blends into the background with infuriating ease, and the tendency of weapons to spread their ammunitions means while they are great for close exchanges of fire, missions with an emphasis on ranged shooting can be incredibly annoying. In every game mode snapping on to cover is unreliable, and the basic controls for climbing never seem to work particularly well. For every staggering set piece there is a niggling problem, and it means that while we all wanted Kane & Lynch to be near perfect, it is instead ever so slightly flawed. The visuals are as mixed as the rest of the game. Sometimes stylish and detailed, Kane & Lynch can also come across as rather rough and untidy.If you enjoy games with decent plots, developed characters and decent dialogue, this violent, offensive and witty action game is probably worth your attention, and if you're a shooting game purist, try not to expect too much.","February 10, 2015","true","5.4"," 22 of 27 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","22","27","2","0"

No, Kane and Lynch: Dead Men is gritty, dark, with a twisted story and completely mad characters. Kane is kinda calm and smooth talking, but when ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan, man he gets ♥♥♥♥♥♥! Now Lynch... wow, Lynch is just too bananas for the game. At first he'll struck to you as a hippie but oh he so isn't... And when you combine those two shot-out mercenaries against the world: just trust me, you won't regret the story that comes out of it.\n\nAbout the game itself: even though it's a third person shooter, the controls are very fluid, as is the gameplay. When it comes to weapons it's a bit meh: you always start with an assault rifle and the same bloody pistol, but you can trade with Lynch for his shotgun and badass revolver. And hell, you could always pick up a machine gun from a dead guard and just blast everything and everyone because who cares, you're a mercenary! "But what about ammo?", you may ask. Well, that's covered too: your allies are always carrying ammo for you. Always. Oh, and if you're downed in battle, they'll come up and revive you. And there you go again, shooting everything and everyone.\n\nFinal veredict: 9/10.

Read enough of the other reviews and you will clearly see that people are mixed on this game.  I'm also not going to touch on the review scandal.  That was an ugly bit of business, but it doesn't impact the game on its own merits.  It showcases how scummy the company is that made the game.\n\nI like the characters overall.  The gang of mercs that you build up has their own personalities and each one adds to the story a little bit, but the center is on Kane and Lynch.  The banter between these 2 during the course of a mission can be a lot of fun to listen to and it helps drive the story a little bit further.  Games like this usually don't have much of a story to them, but this one has little pockets waiting to be seen, if you give it a chance.\n\nIt's not without issues, though.  The cover system, while functional at times, does not always work and sometimes you will snap into cover at odd angles or stupid moments and it won't work when you always need it to.  Gunfire definitely drives your aim skyward, but that is a relaistic idea (even if it seems too aggressive in this game).  Enemies do take a fair number of hits to put them down, but if you're in that much of a bad situation, you can always switch to your pistol and go for headshots.\n\nThe music and sound effects are great and, again, the banter between the characters will keep things moving.  Sure, profanity abounds in this, but given the source material, what did you expect?\n\nOverall, a mix of locations (and the club shows how many people you can put on a screen at one time... nice chaotic atmosphere that makes it harder to get by without killing any innocents) keeps things interesting and varied.  There aren't too many guns, but there are enough to get the job done and give you a little freedom to determine what works best for you.\n\nIs it perfect?  Hell no.  Will you get frustrated with the things that don't work well?  Quite possibly.  But is it worth giving it a try to enjoy what does work?

I'd been hesitant to buy it for this reason, however having now picked it up during a sale (a whopping $1.75) I was able to try it out. Having ran through the surprisingly short campaign (it took me four hours to complete, all within a single sitting, on the highest difficulty setting), I know understand why the game was so ill recieved by some. K&L:DM is a bog standard cover based third-person shooter in its gameplay, and that gameplay is subpar at best. Most weapons I found to be completely inaccurate at anything beyond short range, enemies were basically bullet sponges (however this may be attributed to the difficulty I was playing on), the movement was clunky, and attempting to get behind cover often resulted in either awkwardly walking against a wall, or sticking to cover that you didn't mean to stick to. Your AI teammates also seemed to be pretty dim as well. This, at points, lead to very frustrating moments, and many undeserved deaths. It's still functional, but it isn't sharp by any means. Where the game does shine however is in its narrative and atmosphere. The entire game felt grimey, from the characters to the enviroment and even the soundtrack. It nailed the "criminal" feeling quite well. The story was also quite good, although nothing I haven't seen before. Interesting (if a bit shallow) characters, and funny dialogue with more cuss words than a bar full of sailors propelled it forward. If you're willing to slog through the sketchy mechanics, then there's a good afternoons time to be had with this game. Though do as I did, and pick it up on sale. For cheap, I'd definitely recommend it.","November 29, 2014","true","4.2"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

From the L.A Bank heist shootout to the Nightclub showdown, you’ll have a vague idea what rests ahead.\n\nVisually, the Hitman: Blood Money game engine has dated well. And holds up to many games this current generation with well-rounded reflections, shadows and environmental destruction which add a sense of realism and immersion into the game world. Cut scenes suffer from audio cutting out resulting in the end of the conversations missing, while the addition of sub-titles makes this issue smaller, the end result is a still mildly frustrating. As for the voice acting, Lynch leaves something to be desired but the voice acting for Kane adds much more to the character of this flawed man.\n\nMechanically, while it works, the cover system is “clunky” at best; resulting in poor cover mechanic and a sub-par targeting system with precision targeting is almost non-existent in the game.\n\nGameplay-wise, Kane & Lynch is a kinetic and non-stop experience, shooting and seeking cover is exiting whenever you can control it. Although it can get repetitive at times, there’s no stop sign to show at you by the constant number of henchmen coming at you. The command system that plays out in a strategic way where you can command your team mates/NPC’s to target selected enemies or take cover; however it was an under-exploited system because you will find yourself doing all the shooting due to the poor AI.\n\nKane & Lynch is a thrilling but very violent and masochistic action game. You have the opportunity to end the lives of innocent bystanders to even hearing the voice of a cop beg for their life because they have children; all while the wife and daughter of Kane are held captive. The story follows at a psychological drama emotional vibe, and certain strong elements that would put the player in enough stress if it isn't by the story's way of destroying up the characters’ lives, and although it doesn't grab enough interest on its character development it does at least satisfy you with those individual personalities of each that makes a credible duo that are not precisely role models nor does it glamourize the lifestyle of the protagonist which many games or movies lean towards to justify their actions.\n\nExciting, ultra-violent, masochistic guilt, pulse pounding vengeance, searing vulgarity and Japanese gangsters in leather motorcycle outfits, this game has every top-notch action film element one could ask for.\n","December 22, 2015","true","5.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Kane and Lynch: Dead Men is a 3rd person shooter, with a reasonable plot with some interesting locations and scenarios such as robbing a bank, breaking people out of prison. However gameplay had a turn for the worse when they went to Havana onwards, where you suddenly turned into some army commando fighting against armies of soldiers. I only played on local co-op on game pads, so i'll be reviewing based on the gameplay i experienced. I'd only recommend buying it if extremely cheap on offer, especially if you are looking for something to play with a friend at home. Options are relatively limited for couch co-op play at the moment, so this option gives this game a good plus point.\n\nPros:\n+ Reasonable story line\n+ Kane and Lynch make great main characters for the game\n+ Some nice scenarios\n+ Multiple endings\n+ Local Couch Co-op\n+ Gamepad support\n\nCons:\n- Uses Games for Windows Live, which means you have to create an X-Box Live profile and install another bit of software. Takes a little bit of time to set up.\n- Quite a short campaign.\n- Awful AI in enemies and your squad of men that follow you. Came across one situation where we couldn't get through to the next access point in Havana because one of our men had decided to get on a fixed gun despite all enemies being dead. There was a generic army guy following us in his place. Trying to get him to come with us was annoying because he kept jumping back on the gun as soon as we got him out of it.\n- Enemies have ridiculosly good aim from far away and don't suffer from any recoil.\n- Poor gamepad controls: looking is way too unsensitive even when on maximum settings, Lynch's gamepad settings always changed to the default again every time you started the game.\n- Some game controls you almost never end up using, such as passing eachother weapons, or giving orders to your squad, but that could be down to the very short campign however.\n- Awful automatic wall cover system, which rarely ever works, and when it does it happens when you don't want it to.\n- Bullets and grenades clipping off air when you try to shoot or throw them near a corner of a wall. Throwing grenades while in cover can be disastrous.\n- Grenades are pretty crap in general.\n- Lynch in the side of the car in one of later missions has almost zero range to shoot anything. In the same mission, there are enemies that can be driving and shooting you from behind, but no one can turn around to shoot at them.\n- All achievements are for Games for Windows Live, and non existant on Steam.\n\nMy Score: 6/10","December 1, 2014","true","9.6"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Although, it shouldn't really be called 'Kane & Lynch'. 'Kane & Friends' is more accurate.\n\nGameplay: 5/10\nHere we go... The AI is frustrating, the gun mechanics are clunky and sometimes unresponsive, there are clipping issues galore and some enemies are too infuriating, even on easy, that's not being bad at gaming, that's developers screwing you over.\n\nHOWEVER, this game is worth playing through to the end for the story and, while it may be an unpopular opinion, this game is great.

Also, there is a nightclub scene where there are dozens of civilians around you without the FPS rate dropping. I remember it being rather new and fascinating at the time the game was advertised.\n\nI think Dead Men aged well and can still be entertaining today.

There is no other way to describe it. The controls are terrible. For example. Reload, pick up weapon, action, climb something all mapped to one button, and there is no button to take cover, which is kinda important in a cover based shooter, especially when there is a heap of snipers (like there is in KAL:DM).\n\nThe shooting just feels off. The crosshair gives no indication where the bullets are going to go, so no long range headshots. I understand guns aren't laser beams but when you character can't hit the broad side of a barn with his assault rifle, you know somethings off. They also lack a feeling of impact or power. They sound like toys. The only weapons that feel somewhat good to use are the AK and the SIG 552.\n\nThe story is just silly. You'll jump from location to location without any expliantion, and characters are thrown in with no introduction. Kane continues to trust Lynch even though he is a pyshcopath with no real skills and  ruins two missions early on by killing hostages . You'll murder half the police force in LA and Tokyo and be able to escape by catching a ride on a train or a van, even though you weren't wearing masks or anything. You'll attempt to sneak out of a building having just shot everyone inside (granted, you don't get away with it and need to murder every cop in sight. )  I mean I know it's a video game but it's just too silly to take seriously, which is the developer's intention.\n\nAnd then there's the actual missions. Each one leads to a dumb shoot out. Sneaking between outposts in a war-torn country? Don't sweat it, just have a shoot out. Bank robbery? Just shoot everything, including the cops. Night club kidnapping? Guess what, you'll just shoot everything that moves! Everything is just a gunfight. A gun fight with bad controls and idiot team mates that you need to keep alive. There are missions that imply the developers were going to have stealth, or something interesting, but nope, just shoot the cops/gangsters/brown people and go to point A to B.\n\nThis game's only redeeming feature is the fact that the concept is somewhat interesting. I mean having two guys who will just use people to get what they want is admittedly somewhat interesting, but in no way will carry this game.","January 11, 2015","false","4.0"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

It was beautiful, the character models\nlooked very polished and shooting them was very satisfying (the ragdolling in this game is pretty funny as they fall into a boneless heap when you kill them.)\n\nI liked how your crew could revive you with a shot of adrenaline but made it so that you couldn't rely on it as you could overdose and die from it anyway.

Kane and Lynch: Dead Men isn't exactly a gem of a game, and the gameplay is quite mediocre. Most guns have terrible accuracy, and the enemys were somewhat difficult, but dumb as well, since they just rush most of the time. But what it lacks in gameplay, it makes up quite well in story. The game looks pretty bad, but realize, it's from 2007, and wasn't exactly a big project from Eidos, just a few guys got together and made it. The story feels like, as others have said, like a Tarantino film. The characters are intresting, and hits the crime feel pretty damn well. Only part that weirded me out was towards the end of the game, which I do not want to spoil. It's one of those games where "It's not bad, but not great either." Just depends on how you view the game yourself. When it's on sale, I recommend picking up a copy, but don't go anywhere near that thing they call a sequel and a port to PC called Kane And Lynch 2: Dog Days.

Hate it or love it.\n\nTop Cons:\n\n- AI at most times is like a r3tarded creature with heavy myopia, which reacts and attacks only to touching - when bullets penetrate it- and when you are close enough to give it a kiss.\n\n- Scripted moves, like nothing happens if you don't go to the right coordinates with all of your crew members etc.\n\n- Windows Live account required and achievements are also stored there.\n\n- Some settings like V-Sync, even if you switch them off and save, the next time you start the game, they will be enabled again.\n\n\nCons\n\n- Default key bindings are weird. Like for Reload, the default key is E or for Walking is Shift etc.\n\n- Crew members sometimes don't follow you and as a result you have to wait for them to come when you change scene and is required to have all of them near you. Or they get killed because you left them behind.\n\nPros\n\n- I liked the story plot.\n\n- I liked the characters. True badasses with psychological issues.\n\n- Nice graphics. (Note that this is a 2007 game)\n\n- Nice movie scenes.\n\n- Various enviroments and missions. From prison breaks and assassinations to civil wars.

Follow a ruthless ex mercenary who's family has been held hostage by a mysterious group known as "The 7" and a medicated psychopath who is prone to blacking out and going on murderous rampages. A crazy series of missions from bank heists, hitting up clubs in Shanghai, to fighting in a South American civil war - the story is over the top, such as rapelling down an office building to blow up the window and fight your way to the bottom, and the characters pull the story together just enough that you'll be happy to follow along. The weakest point in the game is the combat, and lacklustre gameplay mechanics. Shooting is mediocre and hard when your shots don't hit their mark (usually making you rely on a lucky shot or two that hits its mark), the cover system is practically useless and very tough to use, and the ability to command your fellow criminals doesn't have enough of an impact to be worth doing since they can often take care of themselves.\n\nRegardless, this game oddly captured my interest and held onto me for the span of its short, couple hour campaign.","March 30, 2015","true","3.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The AI companions can't take cover properly, and they can't revive each other if they are downed - you must revive them yourself.\n\nThere's no reload button, the character reloads automatically. Which means, that sometimes he starts reloading when you are just about to jump out of cover to shoot. Or, he won't start reloading and you jump on enemies from behind with almost empty mag.\n\nCover system is similar to Mass Effect 1 - when you approach an obstacle, the character will take cover automatically.\nI've only had slight problems with this, and that the camera angles from cover are very badly synced with your aim. Most of the time when I peak out of cover, the shots are hitting the wall which I was taking cover at.\n\nAtmosphere is good, the game has the exact feel - dark, criminal, unfortunate. I don't like Kane, he's both uninteresting and makes wrong decisions. Also constantly refuses Lynch's suggestions, then he pays for it.\n\nHad no technical problems, apart from wrong installation - I had to manually go to game's folder and install GFWL support. It also constantly ran at 60+ FPS on max details. The graphics are avarage, enviroments sometimes feel empty. Characters look good though.\nFortunately, you don't need to login to GFWL to play the game, so the presence of GFWL has no effect. Don't be afraid of it.\n\nOverall, it's a good game, but I don't recommend it because of auto-reloading and auto-cover systems that can cause trouble. Also it's very short (4 hours), companions are dumb at certain situations, and Kane is annoying character.\n\nThe Kane and Lynch 2 is a great though, it pretty much gets rid of EVERY negative points I mentioned in this review for Kane and Lynch 1. I recommend checking the second game.","February 7, 2015","false","4.0"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

It has its moments, but the bland gameplay is what holds it back. K&L's story was the only thing keeping me hooked and is where the game truly shines. The gritty criminal underworld atmosphere, the diverse characters with layers and flaws, and the pursuit of vengeance make for a great tale. It all feels like a mindless action movie at times, which is fun. Kane and Lynch's conflicting personalities and little quips make for a good laugh as well. The plot is actually pretty dark, which I enjoyed immensely. Had playing the actual game not been so tedious, I'd agree that this is an underrated title.\n\nBut this is where the game fell flat. The cover-based third person shooting isn't special in any way, and gets old fast. Sure, it's a short game (3.5 hours for me on normal with more than a couple of deaths), but the shooting doesn't feel invigorating enough to excite me. It all felt like a chore. There are some challenging stealth portions, which made for nice breaks, but they were few and far between.\n\nGranted, I did play this title solo. Maybe co-op is more fun, but I can't say as I didn't feel interested enough to try it. It's not an expensive game, and is dirt cheap especially on sale. If you're on the fence and like these types of shooters or are in the mood for a good tale, I'd say give it a try. It's certainly not a broken or terrible game, and I had some fun with it. Maybe you'll like it more than I did.\n\nTo sum it all up: Good story, bad gameplay","February 25, 2015","false","3.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/uknownuffin/recommended/8080/","uknownuffin","Johannes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/uknownuffin/","493 products in account","So for me it's a yes. Is it a life changing game? Well, obviously no. Was it fun to play? Yes, specially since (at least in normal) the game was not too difficult and not too long either. So it's just kind of like watching a 5 hour long movie. The mechanics of the game were not amazing and the graphics are clearly outdated, but I found no bugs whatsoever. I must mention, however, that the gameplay is far from perfect and that it has a lot to improve on.\n\nRegarding the characters and the story, well, I'd say they do their jobs. Just don't expect too much, and you may actually like them. The story wasn't boring and, in the end, I kind of cared for what had happened to one of the characters enough to google it, so yeah...\n\nBoth main characters are pretty much two criminal pyschopaths, and although that put me off a little, I'll admit the game was not that bad. I am just glad to know that these are just fictional characters, thank Lord Gaben. Anyway, as a positive last aspect of the game, I gotta say that the fact that you just don't die, but fall to the ground while seeing "the light" and hearing "voices from your past" is a great, great addition. So, instead of automatically realoading after getting shot too much, like in most games, you just fall inconscious, almost dead, until one of your mates revive you with an adreline shot. I loved it! It brings continuity to the gameplay and the story. I really liked it.\n\nAnd as final thought, I'd like to say that I hated the fact that you've always got to rappel everywhere. I think the devs were really proud of figuring out how to include that in the game, and then decided to use it in all levels, even if it sometimes brought nothing to the story and felt rather forced.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/recommended/8080/","widgetguy","widgetguy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/","972 products in account","Quick Summary: Play an anti-hero like a poor man’s Max Payne in a third person shooter with a gritty semi-realistic storyline.  The game appears to have co-op functionality, but I don’t think you can go through the single player campaign with a friend. Also, the game uses Games for Windows Live.\n\nYou play the campaign as Kane, a former mercenary indebted to a powerful crime group with international dealings. By indebted, I mean they own you and will kill your family if you don’t pay them back what you owe. The group has tasked Lynch, a low level thug as your new partner, and he’ll be tagging along with you to make sure you behave. Unfortunately Lynch has some serious problems, which add considerably to your own situation.\n\nThe game is played as a third person shooter where you can pick up the weapons your fallen enemies drop, and/or request ammo from one of your allies (usually Lynch). There are maybe a dozen guns to choose from but some are noticeably better than others (stronger, more precise).  There’s even a rocket launcher on a few levels to take care of tanks/helicopters. An important distinction is that unlike the Max Payne games, you have a “regenerating health” system instead of a standard health bar. This means if you take damage, you just have to hide for a few seconds and you’ll fully recover. This of course means the game is faster paced and you’re going to be more likely to try daring Rambo style attacks or charge enemy positions.\n\nPros:\n+I mentioned the gritty storyline, and I actually enjoyed it. The “hero” Kane makes all sorts of stupid but believable decisions, and his new partner Lynch is even dumber. There are no “good guys” in this game, as is probably the case among real world criminal thugs.\n+This is straightforward action, no puzzle solving or map exploring. You won’t get “lost” while playing this game, which I appreciate when I want to just blast my way through a mediocre game in one afternoon.\n\nCons:\n-The game’s graphics are lackluster for something less than 10 years old, and the gameplay can be kind of clunky. I am told that if you have Windows 10, you will not be able to adequately run this game.\n-I mentioned blasting my way through the game in one afternoon, and by that I mean the game is like 5 hours long. Hope you got it for a cheap price because there really isn’t that much replay value.\n\nOverall, I don’t regret playing the game, but I’m glad I got it from a Humble Bundle because there’s nothing about it that’s “awesome.” Not horrible either though.\n6.5/10\n","February 22","true","4.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

One day, someone thought "Guys, we be makin dem stealth games but what if... a shooter?" and so the Kane and Lynch happened.\n\nDER PLOT\n\nKane (the protagonist) is an ex-mercenary. We meet him in a prison van that is taking him to (hehe what a plot twist) the prison where he will get fried for being a baddie hired gun. His thoughts revolve around his wife and daughter, both of which he abandoned and now he regrets it (good timing, bro).\n\nIn the same van we meet Lynch, pretty much a psycho who killed his wife during one of his "blackouts" as he calls them.\n\nThen suddenly BAM BOOM KAPOW RATATA SOME MASKED GUYS ATTACK THE CONVOY AND GRAB KANE AND LYNCH WITH THEM AND OH GOD EVERYONE SHOOTS EVERYONE, COPS DROP LIKE FLIES, WHAT A FUKKEN CHAOS, JESUS CHRIST ALMIGHTY. Turns out that they were hired by some super top secret criminal organisation which Kane stole loadsamoney from in the past and now they make him get the money back.\n\nLynch is freed because Kane needs a sidekick and who would make a better sidekick than a psychopath?\n\nLong story short: they set on an adventure to retrieve the money for the crime syndicate, making friends and enemies on their way. However, Kane faces a personal tragedy by the hands of the criminal people and that makes him upset enough to actually shift his focus on killing them instead of killing cops, Japs, and Jap cops as he did by that point. He then goes to South America and whoops their criminal a$$es. Lynch is with him all the time and he fuks shít up because he's a psycho.\n\nKane and Lynch then shoot the criminal men. The end.\n\nDER GAMEPLAY\n\nIf you ever played any Hitman game I think you can agree that shooting wasn't really the strong point of the series. It didn't matter, Hitman is about stealth anyway. Here however their lack of experience shows (well in 2003 they made this shooter called Freedom Fighters, it was rather good, you can look it up). It's not bad, aight? Not very good but not bad either. I had a feeling like weapons don't generally deal much damage and are very inaccurate.\n\nWhen you get downed one of your mates can inject one marijuana into your eyeball to revive you, but once he does that, you cannot get revived for again some time because otherwise you overdose and die. Sounds fun and all but when you get injected and then get shot down quickly afterwards, instead of immidiately dying, you have to wait for a guy to come to give you another marijuana shot which kills you. WHY CAN'T I IMMIDIATELY DIE INSTEAD?!?!?!?! This works both ways. Sometimes your mates get knocked out too and you have to give them the medical weed, otherwise they die and it's game over.\n\nYou can give your men simple commands like "stay here", "follow me", "go there", "attack that nígga", etc. I generally didn't use them but sometimes they came in handy.\n\nDER CONCLUSION\n\nKane and Lynch: Dead Men™ is not the best game I have ever played. It is above average, I'd say. However, despite some very questionable design choices both gameplay and plot wise, I enjoyed this title. The game looks pretty ok to me even today. The story reminds me the action movies starring Bruce Willis or some shít like that. It was really neat.\n\n6,7/10 on my scale. If it's on sale or something, definitely worth picking it up. Also has co-op mode but didn't try it.","February 16, 2015","true","7.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","60","3","5","4","0"

I just cannot believe that people who made Hitman made this game. No gore, terrible AI, only the word "F*CK" is more frequent than bullets fired... The cover system is broken, you get shot through walls, the crosshair is kinda useless since bullets go another direction every time you fire.\nWhen I was buying I expected blood, controversy, raw gunfights... But I only got some stupid figurines with X-Ray vision and the only red thing I saw in this game is its title.\n\nThe overall feeling about the game is like I was playing some beta version. So many things could have been done much better. Yep it a playable game but I believe there are better games to spend your money on.\n\n5/10, B - for Boring\n\nPersonal: Hey some bad guys came to rescue me from prison transport, COOOL lets roll, heres my MP-5. Plenty of cops to shoot thats it. Shoot the first one, there he is, aim for the chest and "plupt" miss. WHAT? The cross was right on him. Ok fire next one "plupt" what the hell is this sound? Am I really firing a weapon? "Plupt" Yep finally a hit. Or is it? Wheres the blood? No flinch? Did he even register he is injured? Why is he just staying in the middle of the street? WTF? Ok next hit, nothing, ok next one, nothing. After like six hits he finally goes down.

He's calm, collected, has his stuff in order, but nothing ever seems to go his way. On the other hand, you have Lynch. He's psychotic and prone to being a complete screw-up, but at least he's consistent. This dynamic duo is out to do what they do best, kill a ton of people, and...and...and?\n\nThere's a plot to this madness, but expect it to kinda fall by the wayside after the first hour and a half. It's clear to me that IO interactive had some great ideas, but they forgot to put it all together for most of the game. There's a prison bus escape, then some shoot-outs, there's a robbery, and then some more shoot-outs. The rest of the game takes place in Havana and Venezuela, and it plays out like every other 3rd person War game. To add to this, the PC port of this game is a bit crap. It's prone to glitches, poor graphic effects, and objects disappearing whenever they feel like it. I honestly thought they added to the game. It made for a very surreal atmosphere.\n\nIt's possible that I don't find the game nearly as appealing as the characters. A lot of the time with these 3rd person shooters, you have Nathan "Indy" Drake, Lara "Rambo" Croft, the men (and women) of Gears of War, and so on. These heroes are made to be charismatic, given aspects that people can relate to, and are basically good people caught in bad situations. I mean okay, I can buy it sometimes, but the idea of playing as a couple horrible ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who make bad situations even worse? That's so cool. Would they be better off dead? Most definitely. However, I get the feeling that Hell wouldn't be an acceptable end for them. Hell is more like....stage 3. Somehow they shoot their way out, but manage to end up somewhere else, and shoot that place up as well. Along the way there would be a failed string of negotiations, heists, kidnappings, liberations, bar mitzvahs, and house parties.\n\nAs a shooter, Dead Men is merely competent. Aside from the odd difficulty spike or two towards the end and some primo snipers, most gamers will sleepwalk through the chaos. Mostly this game gets by on some neats moments, its engaging protagonists, and some really decent sound-direction(good music). If you're curious and don't mind putting up with more issues than Sports Illustrated, give this game a go. During sales it tends to cost about as much as a candy bar, and lasts slightly longer.\n\n\n","January 12, 2015","true","4.0"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sharuun/recommended/8080/","sharuun","No More Please","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sharuun/","204 products in account","Well that sucked. I noticed before even playing this game, that Steam was warning me, by the game not even starting up. "We're warning you! It sucks! Just back out while you have the chance." This is actually a big problem for a lot of people who buy this game (And the solution is so simple. You just have to install the Xlive folder in the actual game.) But, where does one begin with Kane and Lynch?\n\n... Probably with Kane and Lynch. They suck. They are the least-likeable a-holes I've met in a game. And I'm supposed to connect with them, according to the game. Look! Whenever Kane get's shot down he thinks about people yelling at him. I'd rather call him a wuss than an empathetic character. I started to like Lynch for his dark comedic moments, but as the game went on, he just turned into this hate-spewing jerk that would ruin a lot of missions and cause them to go on far longer than they'd have to (In the actual script). He also ruins a lot of tries I've had at levels, because the AI is so off in this game. Enemies are not only really dumb, but the "tactical" system of the gameplay turns into babysitting, since most of my squadmates wanted to go out and shake hands with the enemy. And if an ally is shot down, they're on a timer for you personally to heal them. I never found out an alternative to have my other allies heal them, but no. I'd have to run in the middle of enemy fire in the next 15 seconds or I fail the mission.\n\nAlso the cover-shooting sucks horribly in this game. The game is incredibly picky about where you take cover, and even when you successfully take cover, most of the time enemies will shoot through your cover. I had a helecopter shoot through solid concrete and kill me. Solid concrete. If you can't take cover behind something that'd make sense to take cover behind (like bales of hay or low walls that just can't be used for cover, because it hurts their feelings) you could always duck behind them... after Kane hesitates a few moments to get his head shot. The whole time, I kept thinking about much better games I could be playing like Grand Theft Auto, Uncharted, or Mass Effect with much better characters and mechanics.\n\nOh! And what's the biggest problem in the game? The story. It's a floppy, predictable mess. The places you go to have very loose connections and you can end up in the middle of Cuba dressed as a guerilla in the middle of a firefight with no explanation of how you got there, other than, "We need to get so-and-so." And all the characters besides Kane and Lynch involved in the story are just as unlikeable or just flat-out forgettable. The game tries to make me feel all emotional when bad things happen to Kane's family, but I had no reason to care for them OR him. In fact, I personally think that the more horrible things happened to Kane and Lynch, the better. They really deserve it. I like Niko Bellic, Tommy Vercetti, and Trevor- because they have redeeming qualities.... Well, maybe not Trevor, but still. Kane and Lynch have no redeeming qualities. They're just heartless jerks that kill tons of people.\n\nK&L also wanted to go with the choice-influenced ending, where you choose to stick with your mates and tough it out or go with the coward's ending. After playing this muddy game for so long, I didn't really care about the moral implications of my choice or the "good" or "bad" ending coming about. I chose the one that ended the game faster. Yeah, I'm a coward. Deal with it.\n\nThis is a horrible game. The characters, story, and gameplay are all over the place and poorly put-together. Do yourself a favor and buy a Grand Theft Auto game. It's got better elements in all three of the categories, and you can feel like the a-hole for killing tons of people in it- not hate the characters for being a-holes.","July 4, 2015","false","4.6"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

The story line is nothing special but the ambient audio is fairly well done.  Where Kane and Lynch fails is in its combat and enemy ai.  Inexplicably, enemies can take multiple shots to the head and body seemingly to no effect only to be easily dispatched at slightly closer range.  The developers may have intended this to reflect greater innacuracy at a distance, but the way it is implemented is confusing to the player.  With each hit the enemies draw blood but are not otherwise staggered making it difficult to determine if any damage is being dealt.  Had I purchased this at release and paid full price, I would be very disappointed, but the online co-op mode makes the title worth a bargain price.  I would recommend Kane and Lynch: Dead Men as a bargain, below average FPS.","March 22, 2012","true","0.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This is not the case. The graphics are primitive, as is common from this developer, and the controls are just awkward. The shooting controls are bad but not unusable once you realise that shooting from behind cover is a waste of time and just aim at enemies directly. The gameplay consists of running into a scene and 10-20 enemies show up and you are informed with no shortage of expletives what your mission is, pretty much just shoot them all and make a getaway.\n\nIn some ways I want to be lenient because it probably achieves its goal of being a throw-away shooter. But I can't when I even regret paying peanuts for it and I'm not even going to waste my time or other people's time pretending this is anything more than mediocre.

The game mechanics are serviceable for the time but third person cover based shooters have been done far better in more recent years and there is really not much else to the game in terms of features, it just feels like cover based shooting moving to cover based shooting throughout the whole game. The game's story is very bland and uninteresting, neither Kane nor Lynch are particularily interesting characters and the game doesn't do much with the setup of villain protagonists to make memorable characters and story. The game abandons the urban environments two thirds into the game and becomes another generic jungle military style game. Its also far too short; I beat it on normal in around 5 hours. Also, co op doesn't work because it has GFWL.\n\nProbably the most memorable part of the game is an early mission inside the nightclub. You have to make your way through a crowded nightclub while using a hostage as a human shield, you're limited to just a pistol and the enemy gang members are hidden within the crowd and aren't immediately visable, it reminded me of some of the crowded party missions in Hitman: Blood Money. If there were more interesting or memorable segments like this, the game may have been worth playing but moments like this a lost in a sea of forgettable shooting segments.\n\nIf you want to play a single player crime game where you control a group of criminals and plan heists, play Grand Theft Auto V instead. Kane and Lynch is definitely not worth playing unless you want a short, generic crime shooter that you can beat in an afternoon and then forget about.","November 17, 2015","false","5.5"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","0"

Throw in a sidekick that's a sloppy ripoff of the character Waingro from Heat, and that's Kane and Lynch for you.\n\nThe gunplay is wildly erratic at times; shooting long distance is frustrating as most bullets are off quite a bit. The engine is more or less the same as older Hitman games (same company) so the physics, especially when shooting bad guys, can be downright comical.\n\nOverall its a forgettable game, without achievements or trading cards, and it taking about 4 hours to beat (even on its toughest setting). it's a tough pill to swallow.\n\nHowever if you like mindless action, you really can't go wrong - just don't pay more than a buck or two.

Nobody has ANY redeeming qualities about them, the story is ♥♥♥♥ and exists because Lynch is a ♥♥♥♥ing basketcase ♥♥♥♥♥♥ who never ends up being likable in any way. Kane is some ♥♥♥♥ing Max Payne remorseful ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t emotional jackass who I want dead as much as anybody else in the game. The swearing in the review is completely mild compared to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ swearing in the game, EVERY 1-5 SENTENCES HAS THE WORD F___ OR SH__ FOR NO REASON. Swearing is used to express emotion but in this game it literally makes no ♥♥♥♥ing sense, and it doesn't work at all. DID I MENTION THE WHOLE GAME NEVER GIVES YOU CONTEXT FOR THE STORY? HAHA OH YEAH THAT...HALF THE STORY IS BASICALLY MISSING. For example "I always pay back my debts..to the last penny." when he kills the Yakuza leader Retomoto but we have NO IDEA what the ♥♥♥♥ he is talking about and no context is given the story is like ♥♥♥♥ing dark souls.\n\nGameplay\n---------\nTrash..it gets old really quick and nothing is really redeeming about it\nGunplay is ♥♥♥♥ because the guns have ludicrous recoil and spread so you have to struggle to ♥♥♥♥ing hit anything that isn't right in front of you.\nEnemies literally everywhere and almost everywhere you go either cover is garbage or your AI lemmings walk into bullets forcing you to go out of your way in the OPEN to REVIVE ANIMATION them in order for you not to fail the ♥♥♥♥ing mission.\nWay too many mounted machine guns in this game that you have to STRUGGLE to ♥♥♥♥ing hit with your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ spread guns like what the ♥♥♥♥ dude\nYour AI lemmings serve no purpose in this game, I mean they can kill ♥♥♥♥ thats like 2 feet in front of them or maybe a few enemies when you sic all four of them on some guy but they suck ♥♥♥.\nSnipers are a joke, you jiggle back and forth to not get hit until you figure out where the fuccboi is and kill him or you get one shot.\nThe Havana level is a travesty of a level because of all of the above, literally mounted machine guns everywhere and you can't hit them easily with your garbage guns.\n\nMusic/Atmosphere/Whateverelse\n----------------------------------\n\nThe aesthetic is somewhat okay, the game is so dark and edgy and crime-focused that it adds up to barely not ♥♥♥♥. You end up fighting pretty much every major crime stereotype except for black gangbangers and some variants of the mafia.\n\nMusic is forgettable and ♥♥♥♥♥♥, does nothing to help the mood or soften the blow of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game.\n\nWhatever else IDK its ♥♥♥♥ don't play through this ♥♥♥♥ing game\n\nALSO NO PC CO-OP HAHA THEY DIDNT SAY THAT ON THE STEAM PAGE WHAT A JOKE GAMES FOR WINDOWS LIVE WOO ITS TOTALLY ♥♥♥♥\n\nEnd statement\n\nStory and gameplay are forgettable and trash bin material.\nRest is passable but nothing special.\n\n(-9/11) "Like reanimated ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with guns!" -IGN","August 1, 2015","false","4.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

I want to start off by saying that it DOES work with windows 10 if you install the windows live thing. The game itself has great visuals for something that came from 2007. The storyline of the game is pretty decent and the characters are not too shabby. However, controlling the game and the AI are the big problems here.\n\nThere's a feature of the game where you "stick" to walls. It's really hard to do this, and if you manage to do it, you cannot shoot too close to the left because all the bullets will end up in the wall next to you. Sometimes during the game you have your crosshair on someone's face (almost immediately next to you) and it will not give you a headshot (or any shot). Since it's 3rd person, sometimes another character in your team will block your view with their face. It's really frustrating. On top of that, the team itself has a horrible AI. They tend to move on their own to zones where they get killed and then it's impossible to recover them without dying. Somehow your team will rescue you, but they will not rescue one another. Pointing to the team to shoot someone sometimes results in that character running up to them while being fired from all other sides by enemies. All I wanted was them to point and shoot a specific character from that distance.\n\nIf the game is on discount, I say check it out. I got it for a couple of bucks on black friday. I don't regret it.","December 2, 2015","false","10.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

From level to level you meter out death that despite kanes protests the game did sod all to prohibit. In other words i started shooting the innocent too, but in my defence, i was bored so shoot me.\n\nThe controls on offer were vast, sadly none of them worked well and dont get me started on the cover system so some timish i swear i could hear lynyrd skynyrds freebird taunting me. So with the mess thats on offer the best tactic was to run at everything and shoot it in the face. AI team mate controls were excellent if you wanted them dead and the save system sucks if you stop the whole game, meaning if you dont finish a level, your sure as hell going to have to do it again when you reboot.\n\nI can only hope while kneeling and praying on broken glass that Kane and Lynch 2 is an improvement as i certainly dont wish to self harm again.\n\nSo all in all i wouldnt recommend playing this game even if all the others disappeared off the planet and would go as far as saying have you consided knitting.\n\nWell from me it gets a thumbs down but so you understand the severity, its so down it transcends even hell and if it was ever to get a thumbs up or a fist in my opinion, im sure you can imagine where i would be putting it.","February 9, 2015","false","5.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's not great by any means, but if you can be forgiving of its shortcomings, the plot will reward you.\n\nPROS\n+ Excellent story. The setup drags a little bit, but once you're into the meat of things, it keeps you hooked.\n+ A solid script, characters who are less heroic than your average shooter, and nice voice-acting add a lot of gravitas.\n+ There are some truly great setpieces worth experiencing, namely a shootout in a crowded nightclub and a moving daylight shootout through the streets of Tokyo. They're reminiscent of Michael Mann movies like Collateral and Heat.\n+ The squad commands allow you to employ some complex tactics in firefights, advancing under covering fire, guarding each other's flanks, etc.\n+ Some inspired moments of art direction.\n\nCONS\n- The weakest levels and least polish - including an atrocious driving level - are all up front, meaning that if you bounce off the game you'll bounce off hard.\n- The A.I. isn't terrible, but the things that it does well - flanking and maneuvers - are limited by linear level design that doesn't cater to it and exposes its weaknesses.\n- The cover system is inconsistent. You'll abandon it pretty quickly, not that it makes a huge difference in the gameplay.\n- Lack of polish abounds. Jagged edges, texture bugging on an early level, some too-simple level design.\n- Games for Windows. We all know why.\n\nPRO OR CON???\nThere are some nasty difficulty spikes, even on Easy mode. It takes some trial and error. Normally, that kind of unevenness wears thin very quickly for me, but something about the story kept me going at it anyway.\n\nThis is a SOFT RECOMMENDATION. It's not a big money risk, given its sale prices now, and you can finish it in a few evenings max, so it's not a big time sink either. Story's worth it, and a few moments are very memorable.","March 25, 2014","true","6.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I've played about half of it. This game is not as bad as you'd think, but as a 3rd person shooter after Gears, I was expecting Gears. I could also knock Spec Ops: The Line for that. Kane and Lynch I won't pretend is great or awesome, but apparently they did something right because Rockstar based Max Payne 3 and GTA V's realism aesthetic directly from Kane & Lynch. Max Panye 3 since I own and have finished was directly inspired and GTA V I can only assume it was inspired because of the Trevor/Lynch comparison.

For one, it's short. Campaign is 4-6 hours. The gameplay is alright... nothing to ride home about, but solid enough. Graphics are ok for the year of release. Story is rich but without enough substance.\n\nGet it like I did for a buck or two. I'd be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ if I payed any more than that.

I only did single player campaign and didn't play any coop/ multiplayer playthrough so my review is based on the experience of single player campaign.\n\nSince it's a very old game, i shall not comment on the outdated graphics. It probably was good during its time.\n\nI downvoted this game because there were a few bugs to be fixed even in the launcher.\n\nThis game used to befrom GFWL, but with GFWL down, and since it's in steam, i think steam needs to improve on the installer.\n\n1) After downloading and successfully installing the game, the game wouldn't launch.\n2) A bit of google got me to understand that i have to install GFWL.\n3) Luckily, that wasn't too difficult, it's just in the game's steam folder however i don't understand why steam cna't just include that step for installation since it's required to run the game.\n4) I encountered 1 crash during the whole playthrough.\n\nInstallation aside, now to the actual gameplay review.\n\nLike what you probably read in other steam or online reviews, the aiming/ hitbox is bad! It was so horrible in the beginning i felt like i wanted to give up on the game. Playing single player, the "teammates" you have are almost nonexistent other than for reviving you. Maybe someone can comment on coop experience.\n\nStory telling wasn't exactly fantastic also. They did try to give it a 2 different ending scenario choice, but there just wasn't any development in the characters.\n\nThe "dying" scene during playthrough can be quite annoying as well. You will never know whether your teamamates will revive you and it just keeps looping some old dialogues and flashes a white screen. (Maybe i'm lousy so i see a lot of it) but its just plain annoying after a while.\n\nI felt that the game did have potential, but it just didn't pull through.\n\nCurrently installing the part 2. I hope it will be greatly improved. I may also grab a friend to try out the coop experience. Hope it's better.","November 28, 2014","false","4.6"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

But I did not like this game. The shooting is probably the best part and even that is average at best. The gameplay feels clunky, outdated and frustrating. The weapons are pretty average, nothing fun to use. The characters are fine for about 5 minutes and then they just turn annoying.\n\nThe overall story was alright but left me feeling very dejected, the endings are a real slap in the face. Perhaps the dialog can redeem this slightly, but not enough for me to recommend this. If you want something like this get a Hitman game instead. Better gameplay, characters and story.\n\nI wouldn’t say avoid like the plague but only get this if you really want to see what all the hype was about when it came out, not for its lackluster gameplay. Don't get me wrong it has its moments but overall its a no.\n\nHave fun? ^_^","May 10, 2014","false","4.9"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

Or at least the one which gave me the strongest pain in the ♥♥♥. If the Hell is real and after death some people trap in it, the main torture in there is playing this game. Everything in this game is just horrible. If I didn't know that it was developed by the creators of Hitman, I would think that it's a debut work of some third-rate polish or russian developers. It has everything that typical classical polish shooter can offer you:\n\n- terrible dispersion (you can aim right at the enemy's head and bullets will hit anything but the space you are aiming at);\n- useless ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s as your allies which are given to you not to help you but to die all the time in the places with most rapid crossfire so you will surely die when trying to resurrect them;\n- covering system (I swear I have never seen such a terrible one in any game) you leap to the walls radomly and you can never tell if they will protect you from the shots or not);\n- tons of enemies which shoot at you from every corner and whom you can't see through ♥♥♥♥ing gates/grass/trees etc.;\n- absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ story (though I must admit that I liked the characters) and absolutely mocking endings, both of them.

This game tells a briliant crime drama starring fantastic characters that manage to be extremely charismatics and well developed even in a game this short.

It looks like ♥♥♥♥, the story is just utterly ♥♥♥♥, I had no empathy at all for any of the characters.  Hmm whats that? One of your relatives died, well you deserve it for being in such a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game!\n\nThis game tries too hard and at the same time doesn't try hard enough.\n\nYou have a character who is confident and an expert in the first level turning into an utter noob in the second level just so the game can give you a tutorial level .. just when you don't need it.  Be prepared for really terrible consolised controls.\n\nSometimes you'll have a tonne of friendly NPCs on screen with you, but 5 seconds later they will all be mown down and you are basically back on your own again.  Oh did I mention your buddy will take a few bullets and you need to go and give him an adrenaline shot to get him back on his feet?  This can be useful as a get out of jail card, but it feels lame.\n\nThere is coop, but its LOCAL coop.  You have one person on keyboard and mouse, the other on an xbox controller.  This is due to Games for Windows Live.\n\nAt the end of the day though.  Games for Windows Live is just a very minor annoyance compared to everything else in the game.  Even when that spoiler spoilery ending happens .. I kinda laughed.","August 20, 2013","false","10.8"," 4 of 13 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","4","13","0","0"

The shooting in this game is bad, you aim and get lucky if the gun even shoots in the directioin you're aiming, now I know you could easily say thats realistic, but its not realistic to shoot enemies and watch as the bullets go through them like they were ghosts. The cover system is even worse, you click into place like a magnet which can get fustrating because it can leave you in the open, this could've been easily solved with a cover button. The whole control your squad thing was almost useless, the only time I used the controls were to make Carlos go to the gate in that one mission and tell my squad to follow because sometimes they would get stuck. The story was ok just two guys killing every cop and security guard in every city they  attend to get revenge on a few other bad guys while trying to protect/recover his daughter. I see that some people are saying the characters are amazing, I beg to differ, they are just horrible guys that are very simple minded, which hurts the story because they don't and can't contribute to the story to make it more dynamic and interesting. Conversations between characters get old very quickly with every one ending is F**K You Kane, or F**K You Lynch, it was funny at first but then it just was overdone. Even the environments in the levels were generic.\n\nI think that this game could've been way better if worked on a little bit more, I'm still going to play the sequal because I'm curious if they fixed/improved this series. Like I said before I like the missions, the Japanese night club level was my favorite with the prison break in is a close second. They did do a good job of keeping you busy, there wasn't one time where I was bored or had nothing to do, had a lot of action. But with all the problems it just was not a good experience. I'm not bashing it just being honest.","February 15, 2014","false","3.8"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

Two of the things I got for myself were from the recommendation of another. I had just finished Spec Ops: The Line and wanted another TPS, and a friend said I should get Kane and Lynch 1 and 2 (they were both four dollars).\n\nWhen these games came out, they weren't negatively received or anything - they just were received as pretty much average, and therefore they faded into obscurity, basically. A lot of people don't like them. Having played the first one in full and some of the second one, I'm not surprised that in this world where a lot of people like things such as Skyrim this is the case.\n\nThe game develops the two main characters really, really well. You get a sense of who they are and what they are trying to do moreso than other games. There's little subtle things like hearing events of Kane's life in the past when you're on the ground about to possibly die, hearing mortally wounded police on the ground quietly breathe and beg to be spared, saying things like "please...I have a family", the fact that a lot of the NPCs that fight by your side lack any sort of empathy whatsoever, and most prominently, Lynch speaking to himself constantly throughout the game, with his psychotic tendencies very apparent.\n\nThere's actually a scene where he ends up executing a bunch of hostages that need to be kept alive. I didn't know until just recently that if you play co-op, the person controlling Lynch actually lives out these events and hallucinates the hostages as being SWAT members. The ultimate irony is that all these sort of things on an individual level are more human of moments than Spec Ops is collectively with pretty much it's entire story - when that's a game that is supposed to be completely about that sort of thing. By the end of the game, the story I'd played felt very true and structured - not common in shooters. Why these games got 6 and 7 out of 10s is beyond me.","September 13, 2014","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's not many of them.\n\nThe voice acting was tolerable, especially the titular characters, however, there were a few side characters that were just meh.\n\nThe save point system is great. If you or a teammate dies (and you will, more on this later), it almost always starts you at the point just before you died.\n\nThe character exploration was fairly limited, but what little backstory you learn of Kane and Lynch is somewhat interesting, even though it never really gets used in the story.\n\nAnd thats it. Now for the cons...\n\nThe story is abysmal. The loosely connected missions barely have anything to do with each other outside of verbal descriptions between scenes with no visual guidance. It really has a way of disconnecting you from the story. There's no gearing up for anything, it's just a "we have to do this to get that" and boom, you're doing it.\n\nThis is more of a gripe than anything, but vertical split screen on a shooter means you will be killed by enemies you run right past because you couldn't see them. Im sure in single player theres not much of an issue but on co op we both died multiple times because of it.\n\nThe controls are fairly awful on a Xbox 360 gamepad. The shooting feels imprecise, always accelerating just beyond your target. Normally you could just move the left stick a little to compensate, but the cover system, which automatically forces you into cover, will cause you to lose the shot. It's just sloppy all around.\n\nAll in all, it was a decent co-op game. But if I had to play this alone I probably never would have finished it. I would not recommend this game, but if you really must get it, do yourself a favor and wait for it to go on sale. It's not worth more than three bucks.

I was especially aroused satisfied with the rain effects. Seldom I can say that..\n\nYou are interested\n\nAfter firing a handful of shots, you realize you don't have a friggin' clue why they included a crosshair to begin with.\nSoon you throw your first bouncy ball grenade. How on earth are you supposed to get it where you want to? "Oh *@#~ too high. For ~#@+'? sake too low. Come on! Almost Yes!! It bounced back, RUN RUN RUN!"\nThe emenies are balls too. It seems they hibernate until you are close enough, Just like some kind of LOD but for AI.\n\nYou are infuriated\n\nAt least the story is good. At first. Then it's a kind of a crescendo. It seems rushed the further you advance, As does the beautiful level design. It's less and less polished until the end of the game, the graphics seem downgrading themselves. LOD that is worse or even disappearing when close up? What is this sorcery?\n\nYou are confused\n\nYou realize some sound effects appear to be missing, like revving engines punches or even gunshots, forcing you to have the impression you should be paid to be playing this game, not because it may be bad, but because you have to do like 50 % of the sounds by yourself to at least create the illusion of immersion. Your mother walks in as you casually wet your mouth and produce warfare noise with your body's orifices, furiously trying to hit an emeny at the same time. She thinks you are regressing.\n\nYou feel pity for yourself\n\nThere are situations where you just keep dying. You are not particularly bad at this kind of games, but you can't help it. Choppers shoot you to death even though you have the impression to be safely hidden under a roof and behind a wall. Simultaneously. But hey it's a game, noone stated you could apply real life rules to this game. You know you can do it, you've come and suffered this far. The game isn't that long.\n\nYou are angry motivated\n\nYou finally make it. The ending seems as cut off and rash as it can, but you don't feel a thing, you stopped anticipating anything some time ago. You feel nothing. You feel entitled to write a review for this game. Entitled, not capable. All you can come up with is THIS.\n\nYou feel like your mother was right\n\nI recommend this game because it's not fair only I have to go through this agony.","March 30, 2015","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nosferatu_BE/recommended/8080/","Nosferatu_BE","Nosferatu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nosferatu_BE/","273 products in account","Kane & Lynch: Dead Men is a third person shooter game with a few interesting twists, but ultimately the poor execution of some elements drag it down quite a bit.\n\nFirst off I've played this game a bit when it came out on Xbox, did a little bit of coop back then, but never finished it. It has been sitting in my Steam library for a while now until I recently decided to finish it. The game itself was released in a time where things were still good in the gaming business and companies churned out games at a fast pace. It was also a high time for Xbox and most relevantly coop was the thing every game needed to have.\n\nSTORY\nThe game takes an interesting perspective from the bad guy who gets broken out of prison and is confronted with his past. Needless to say life as a mercenary is shady and he did some things his former employers couldn't agree with. His wife and daughter are leveraged and he is blackmailed into retrieving something. Beyond that the story gets rather predictive with failure and revenge as central pivoting points.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nAs said the game is a third person shooter and the controls handle a bit slow and rough, but when playing with the controller everything runs pretty good.\nCover mechanics however are poorly done and for some reason you can only get in cover on the edge of a wall, even the lower ones. This is very frustrating since enemies are abundant and aim pretty good, even on the lowest difficulty.\nOn the other hand most of your weapons have such low accuracy you really have to get very close to hit something. Result is that moving from cover to cover gets you killed most of the time, luckily your team-mates revive you almost every time.\nAnd that is pretty much the only thing they get right, other than that they're pretty useless. You have a few basic commands, but anything other than 'Stay here' or 'Come over' is pointless. You can order them to attack a specific target, but this just results in them rushing towards it and shooting them in the face with a shotgun. The animation however is pretty nice though. That's mostly the gameplay throughout the game, aside from a few vehicle missions.\n\nVISUALS\nThe game is a bit older, but it still looks acceptable, but nothing special. There is some destructibility, which was also very popular back then. Most animations in the game appear somewhat crude, but then again acceptable for it's age. It should run pretty good on today's laptops as a counter argument.\n\nAUDIO\nThe audio is nothing to be noted specifically, no orchestral scores. Just your standard background music with a few tension increasing tempos. The voice acting, including lip sync, is actually pretty good for the standard of those days. But the dialogs happen mostly during game, which can be very incomprehensible at times. However most of them are restricted to a lot of swearing and banter, so you won't miss much.\n\nMULTIPLAYER\nAs said the game can be played coop and it will be waaaay more fun when playing with some buddies, like with much of these coop games. Also the online versus mode is very original, especially with a name like Fragile Alliance, things can get interesting. You can view the tutorial and get an impression of what it would be like, but that's about it. Servers are dead, both coop and versus. So sadly I cannot divulge into this any further, but I can expect it would change my opinion of the game.\n\nVERDICT\nBuy it cheap if you want to experience the beginning of the franchise, but other than that just skip it and go straight to the next one. If you have enough friends who are willing to play it with you I would probably recommend this one for sure. Most coop games from previous generation are well worth it just for that.","May 18, 2015","false","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are numerous technical issues and bugs through out.  I clipped through quite a few doors, experienced sound/music playing when it shouldn't and in order to get the game to run without stuttering I had to disable a bunch of USB devices.  The cover mechanic barely works and I wouldn't recommend using a controller for this game.  I found using a controller to be pretty imprecise, once I switched to mouse/keyboard the shooting was a lot easier and more satisfying.   The story itself is interesting enough and there are some cool scenarios (i.e., bank robbery, prison break); but unless you're a fan of shooters I would probably stay clear.","February 24, 2015","false","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I bought this game the year it came out on Xbox 360 even after multiple friends had given me bad reviews on it. Instead of putting this one up on the shelf to collect dust, I played through the campaign multiple times, and again even with friends and family. The CO-OP is a blast, and I really enjoyed the multiplayer as it was around. The multiplayer was quite comparable to the PayDay franchise, except that there was a twist; as you tried to rob the location with your fellow team they as well as yourself had the option to betray eachother. The winner took all, or if you did decide to work together you got to split the money. The multiplayer was short and sweet, but because you could not do much with the money, or beyond the level of customization it seemed to quickly face it's demize. Although multiplayer is now dead, the gameplay and story still make this an enjoying title for the price. If you have ever played the 2006 Reservoir Dogs or even have played PayDay 1 or 2, you are in for a similar experience. As Multiplayer gaming dominates the market, this franchise is one of the last I have seen with a truly CO-OP experience. Pick this game up...

The game also has a strange ambiance of North Korea.\n\nThis game is bad. The "frustration" dialogue and acting is really really top notch. The plot dialogue is cheesy and forced. There are honest to goodness invisible walls... I mean come on now, WHAT YEAR IS IT??\n\nThe gameplay is repetitive and the weapons are largely ineffective. You know how all the bad guys in a movie have terrible aim? Well Kane & Lynch gives you those terrible weapons. On that note, I didn't really feel "♥♥♥♥ ed" by the game (played on "Aspirin," which I surmise to be a Starbucks "Tall" or an everywhere  else "easy"). Like, if you're getting shot at, you're going to die, so you better stay behind cover. It does get grating when you're using the same old weapons and everything requires a ton of bullets to kill, though.\n\nFinally about the atmospere of the game. Everywhere you go is really desolate. It's a lot like that drive through of Pyongyang... there's just nobody on the roads or milling about or anything. The level design is also ♥♥♥♥... at one point you're just ♥♥♥♥ing walking around a prison during lock down with no closed doors to the contol room LOL. Also, the levels start of exceptionally terrible, and then as the game goes on they increase to just bad, which I've never even seen before.\n\nSo, if you're the type of person to laugh at rochambeau-ing with pistols, to laugh at the utter lack of security at a maximum security prison, then give this game a try when it's on deep discount ($10 max, I would give it). If you're not, then you might as well go play the old Hitman games (seriously, the levels are really reminiscent of games from THAT long ago, that's how bad they are).\n\nOverall though, if you miss this game, you're really not missing much.","March 6, 2015","false","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game also has a strange ambiance of North Korea.\n\nThis game is bad. The "frustration" dialogue and acting is really really top notch. The plot dialogue is cheesy and forced. There are honest to goodness invisible walls... I mean come on now, WHAT YEAR IS IT??\n\nThe gameplay is repetitive and the weapons are largely ineffective. You know how all the bad guys in a movie have terrible aim? Well Kane & Lynch gives you those terrible weapons. On that note, I didn't really feel "♥♥♥♥ ed" by the game (played on "Aspirin," which I surmise to be a Starbucks "Tall" or an everywhere  else "easy"). Like, if you're getting shot at, you're going to die, so you better stay behind cover. It does get grating when you're using the same old weapons and everything requires a ton of bullets to kill, though.\n\nFinally about the atmospere of the game. Everywhere you go is really desolate. It's a lot like that drive through of Pyongyang... there's just nobody on the roads or milling about or anything. The level design is also ♥♥♥♥... at one point you're just ♥♥♥♥ing walking around a prison during lock down with no closed doors to the contol room LOL. Also, the levels start of exceptionally terrible, and then as the game goes on they increase to just bad, which I've never even seen before.\n\nSo, if you're the type of person to laugh at rochambeau-ing with pistols, to laugh at the utter lack of security at a maximum security prison, then give this game a try when it's on deep discount ($10 max, I would give it). If you're not, then you might as well go play the old Hitman games (seriously, the levels are really reminiscent of games from THAT long ago, that's how bad they are).\n\nOverall though, if you miss this game, you're really not missing much.","March 6, 2015","false","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The backstory is interesting and paints a pretty dark picture. You also hear audio clips of the character's dark past when they are wounded. Unfortunately they don't develop the characters as much as I would have hoped, and the story ends somewhat abruptly with an unsatisfying ending; some will probably argue that the abrupt ending adds to the grit and darkness of the story, but it came across to me as underdeveloped.\n\nThe "solid" part of the 5/10 accounts for the sound effects and originality in story line.

The gameplay is really janky and a lot of the time when you shoot someone when they are behind cover your bullet won't hit them and just goes through them instead, causing you to either wait for them to move or you being forced to move into different cover to take them out.\n\nThere's a nice assortment of different environments and levels to play through including a prison, bank, a nightclub, the streets of japan and even some jungle levels late on in the game. I have to say actually that the nightclub level in this is probably the best nightclub i have seen in a game so far, it had really immersive strobe lighting and was packed with 100's of NPC's who then run around screaming when you inevitably have a shootout in it. Compare this to the clubs in games like Deus ex or Sleeping Dogs and there's no comparison, and this game came out in 2007 so that's impressive to me. Only the new Hitman game and the new Assassins Creed Unity has really played around with interactive crowd density.\n\nIt's weird though because the actual story about Kane and Lynch has had no effort put into it BUT the actual characters all have more personality than you would expect in a game like this and i found the voice acting really well done as well, i actually wanted to finish the game to see where the story went. It's just why and how Kane and Lynch continue to work with each other had me saying WTF!!!! Lynch is a psychopath who kills innocent people for no reason and then has a blackout where he doesn't even remember doing it. Later on in the game Kane has him keep his ex japanese girlfriend hostage, and without spoiling it you can tell that isn't going to end well. If they were brothers i could understand it but they just met each other and another character who you break out of prison even says he doesn't wanna work with Lynch because he's a crazy b*stard and killed his own wife. They have a character in the game who gets it! so why doesn't Kane? it's stupid and they could have made that way more believable if they just spent more time on the writing\n\nI would actually recommend this game purely for the nightclub level, the rest of the game is ok if you can get past some of the jank.","February 27, 2015","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game also has a strange ambiance of North Korea.\n\nThis game is bad. The "frustration" dialogue and acting is really really top notch. The plot dialogue is cheesy and forced. There are honest to goodness invisible walls... I mean come on now, WHAT YEAR IS IT??\n\nThe gameplay is repetitive and the weapons are largely ineffective. You know how all the bad guys in a movie have terrible aim? Well Kane & Lynch gives you those terrible weapons. On that note, I didn't really feel "♥♥♥♥ ed" by the game (played on "Aspirin," which I surmise to be a Starbucks "Tall" or an everywhere  else "easy"). Like, if you're getting shot at, you're going to die, so you better stay behind cover. It does get grating when you're using the same old weapons and everything requires a ton of bullets to kill, though.\n\nFinally about the atmospere of the game. Everywhere you go is really desolate. It's a lot like that drive through of Pyongyang... there's just nobody on the roads or milling about or anything. The level design is also ♥♥♥♥... at one point you're just ♥♥♥♥ing walking around a prison during lock down with no closed doors to the contol room LOL. Also, the levels start of exceptionally terrible, and then as the game goes on they increase to just bad, which I've never even seen before.\n\nSo, if you're the type of person to laugh at rochambeau-ing with pistols, to laugh at the utter lack of security at a maximum security prison, then give this game a try when it's on deep discount ($10 max, I would give it). If you're not, then you might as well go play the old Hitman games (seriously, the levels are really reminiscent of games from THAT long ago, that's how bad they are).\n\nOverall though, if you miss this game, you're really not missing much.","March 6, 2015","false","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Shooting with the guns are pretty hit or miss, no really, either you miss the target by a mile or you hit them and it's not like it's consistent either.\n\nI'm sure the graphics were good back in 2007 but it is pretty dated by now. The voices are somewhat weird, sometimes they're kinda good, next they sound very much out of place and not very good acted. Also, the weapon sounds are not that good.\n\nThe story was very much forgetable. Kane owes The7 something but his family gets dragged in to his affairs instead... and it shifts from the "get this suitcase!" to the "find Kanes daughter and make sure she's secure!" kind of objective. It will be forgotten before this day is over, I'm afraid.\n\nI think the only reason I kept playing this was because I know the sequel - "Kane & Lynch 2: Dog Days" - is better. At least I remember it being better... hm, that'll be up next. Oh, if you can get this for a really cheap price, then it could be some hours worth of fun, just saying.","March 17, 2015","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But if you buy it on sale, it's OK for the money.\n\nIt's just simple 3rd person shooter, where you are really bad guy, things go bad and you are going bad and at the end - no, it is not Hollywood story.\n\nUnfortunately, gameplay is flawed.\n1. Companions are pretty stupid, those additional non-core are dying too quickly and probably the most important command is to keep close, otherwise they rush forward into trouble.\n2. Cover system is bug itself - you never knows, whether it is engaged or not when you approach proper place. That end up in troubles and deaths, because you want to move and you are locked to cover, or you want to pop-up and spray enemy and you are not - and you move and expose yourself to fire.\n3. you cannot pick-up ammo of the same type when from different weapon (OK, mags are not always interchangeable, but this is not hardcore sim)\n4. grenades - USELESS. You have to wait for power indicator to rise for distant throws - but it takes too long and do not reset to zero. All the time you are exposed to fire and as enemy is eventually closing in meantime, you may realize, that he is too close, but you hardly can do anything than waste the first grenade by overthrowing and go for another one.\n5. sometimes you start scripted spawn of enemies at closed, empty place, just around you, that leads to pretty nasty ends.\n\n\nSo, why to recommend? Well, if you don't pay too much and do not expect great game, it is still relatively decent game, with some good moments, ending - although scripted - is fair and rough as you may expect for somebody dancing with devil. Last mission - if you choose to go through it - has cinematic atmosphere.\nShould developers at least made shoot-outs more intense, gave you chance to flank enemies or force/allow you to move from position to position to get advantage it would be better game despite the flaws.\nBut if you intentionally overlook some troubles and if you are fine with oldtimers, it's a fair fun for 1 or 2 evenings.\n","February 3, 2015","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That by itself is enough to make me not really want this game, but I decided to play it anyway.\n\nAs for the actual game, it's nothing great.  The gameplay is alright.  It's a mediocre cover based shooter at best.  I only really had trouble with one area of the game.  My biggest complaint about the gameplay is that most of the guns feel the same.  You have pistol, shotgun, automatic weapons, and single shot weapons.  They made several different automatic weapons, but they all handle roughly the same.  The game is also really short.  It only took me about 5 hours to beat, and the replay value is almost nonexistent, which sucks.  It's also annoying how the HUD only shows how much ammo you have for your weapon, not how many bullets are in the magazine.  A lot of minor inconveniences come together to really bring the game down.\n\nDespite how bad the gameplay is, the story is probably what disappointed me the most.  Kane gets busted out of prison and is forced to work with the men who betrayed a while back (you never find out what he did).  One issue that I had with the story was that there was little to no foreshadowing.  Now foreshadowing isn't necessary for a story, but you have no idea what's going to happen until it happens, and then you feel confused because you don't really know why it happened, or if there was any hint to it before.  The story wasn't anything great, but it was the main reason that I played to the end...  and boy did it let me down.  The game lets you choose between 2 endings, both of which leave a bad taste in your mouth.  I won't spoil it if any of you want to see it, but just take it from me it isn't worth it.\n\nOverall, this game just isn't worth your time.  If you want a cover based shooter, there are thousands of better ones, and if you really want to know the story, just look it up.","February 11","false","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay is really janky and a lot of the time when you shoot someone when they are behind cover your bullet won't hit them and just goes through them instead, causing you to either wait for them to move or you being forced to move into different cover to take them out.\n\nThere's a nice assortment of different environments and levels to play through including a prison, bank, a nightclub, the streets of japan and even some jungle levels late on in the game. I have to say actually that the nightclub level in this is probably the best nightclub i have seen in a game so far, it had really immersive strobe lighting and was packed with 100's of NPC's who then run around screaming when you inevitably have a shootout in it. Compare this to the clubs in games like Deus ex or Sleeping Dogs and there's no comparison, and this game came out in 2007 so that's impressive to me. Only the new Hitman game and the new Assassins Creed Unity has really played around with interactive crowd density.\n\nIt's weird though because the actual story about Kane and Lynch has had no effort put into it BUT the actual characters all have more personality than you would expect in a game like this and i found the voice acting really well done as well, i actually wanted to finish the game to see where the story went. It's just why and how Kane and Lynch continue to work with each other had me saying WTF!!!! Lynch is a psychopath who kills innocent people for no reason and then has a blackout where he doesn't even remember doing it. Later on in the game Kane has him keep his ex japanese girlfriend hostage, and without spoiling it you can tell that isn't going to end well. If they were brothers i could understand it but they just met each other and another character who you break out of prison even says he doesn't wanna work with Lynch because he's a crazy b*stard and killed his own wife. They have a character in the game who gets it! so why doesn't Kane? it's stupid and they could have made that way more believable if they just spent more time on the writing\n\nI would actually recommend this game purely for the nightclub level, the rest of the game is ok if you can get past some of the jank.","February 27, 2015","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nosferatu_BE/recommended/8080/","Nosferatu_BE","Nosferatu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nosferatu_BE/","273 products in account","Kane & Lynch: Dead Men is a third person shooter game with a few interesting twists, but ultimately the poor execution of some elements drag it down quite a bit.\n\nFirst off I've played this game a bit when it came out on Xbox, did a little bit of coop back then, but never finished it. It has been sitting in my Steam library for a while now until I recently decided to finish it. The game itself was released in a time where things were still good in the gaming business and companies churned out games at a fast pace. It was also a high time for Xbox and most relevantly coop was the thing every game needed to have.\n\nSTORY\nThe game takes an interesting perspective from the bad guy who gets broken out of prison and is confronted with his past. Needless to say life as a mercenary is shady and he did some things his former employers couldn't agree with. His wife and daughter are leveraged and he is blackmailed into retrieving something. Beyond that the story gets rather predictive with failure and revenge as central pivoting points.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nAs said the game is a third person shooter and the controls handle a bit slow and rough, but when playing with the controller everything runs pretty good.\nCover mechanics however are poorly done and for some reason you can only get in cover on the edge of a wall, even the lower ones. This is very frustrating since enemies are abundant and aim pretty good, even on the lowest difficulty.\nOn the other hand most of your weapons have such low accuracy you really have to get very close to hit something. Result is that moving from cover to cover gets you killed most of the time, luckily your team-mates revive you almost every time.\nAnd that is pretty much the only thing they get right, other than that they're pretty useless. You have a few basic commands, but anything other than 'Stay here' or 'Come over' is pointless. You can order them to attack a specific target, but this just results in them rushing towards it and shooting them in the face with a shotgun. The animation however is pretty nice though. That's mostly the gameplay throughout the game, aside from a few vehicle missions.\n\nVISUALS\nThe game is a bit older, but it still looks acceptable, but nothing special. There is some destructibility, which was also very popular back then. Most animations in the game appear somewhat crude, but then again acceptable for it's age. It should run pretty good on today's laptops as a counter argument.\n\nAUDIO\nThe audio is nothing to be noted specifically, no orchestral scores. Just your standard background music with a few tension increasing tempos. The voice acting, including lip sync, is actually pretty good for the standard of those days. But the dialogs happen mostly during game, which can be very incomprehensible at times. However most of them are restricted to a lot of swearing and banter, so you won't miss much.\n\nMULTIPLAYER\nAs said the game can be played coop and it will be waaaay more fun when playing with some buddies, like with much of these coop games. Also the online versus mode is very original, especially with a name like Fragile Alliance, things can get interesting. You can view the tutorial and get an impression of what it would be like, but that's about it. Servers are dead, both coop and versus. So sadly I cannot divulge into this any further, but I can expect it would change my opinion of the game.\n\nVERDICT\nBuy it cheap if you want to experience the beginning of the franchise, but other than that just skip it and go straight to the next one. If you have enough friends who are willing to play it with you I would probably recommend this one for sure. Most coop games from previous generation are well worth it just for that.","May 18, 2015","false","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game had a lot of potential. I enjoy games that involve ordering party members during combat. At times it felt a bit like their previous title Freedom Fighters. However, the nostalgia factor wasn't enough. You'll get 4-5 hours out of this game. The cover mechanics are just awful. Even if you do manage to stick to a wall the enemies can shoot through it. Co-op is local only. Microsoft DRM was a pain as I had to uninstall and reinstall manually from another source. At the start of the game (tutorial level) they showed you how to give someone a gun from your inventory but this ability was never required/benficial. The story was very weak.

It took 30 minutes just to get it working, and another 20 to stop the freezing and fix the controls. The gameplay is bland, shots lack impact, teammates can hurt you, you'll go down in a couple of hits and die on the second down. Having died on a certain section over and over, I decided to write this review while letting the team AI play in the background, and I'm making just as much progress as before with none of the risk. Oh, and if you've given the AI an order at any point, they will not revive you, resulting in an instant game over.\n\nYou have to use a specific file in the intalation folder just to get the game to run, then you have to deal with GFWL, which I thought we were past at this point.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chazisop/recommended/8080/","chazisop","chazisop","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chazisop/","572 products in account","Summary: Short, uninspired, buggy.\n\nKane & Lynch as an idea has all the elements that make Hitman, developed also by IO, work. A contracted killer, here a mercenary that worked as part of a group rather than a lone hitman, bound for death row, gets out of prison by his old group to make amends. His family is kidnapped and he has to comply to save them. Although a bit cliche, the story could work, but it simply doesn't. The characters are underdeveloped, the plot never gets deeper, while large gaps are left to fill in with your imagination.\n\nGameplay-wise, the gunplay isn't anything to write home about, reminding of linear FPS that were considered outdated even by 2007 standards, with bullet-sponge enemies. The guns are often inaccurate, even in short distances and while firing with discipline (aiming, short bursts etc.). The cover system doesn't always work and sometimes while you are in cover you still get shot without the situation justifying it (e.g. when covering behind solid rock or cement that shouldn't be pierced by bullets. The AI is laughable, with some covering the wrong way opening themselves to shots, or when in groups just running straight at you, which diminishes any sense that you are fighting actual opponents.\n\nThe game requires Games for Windows Live, and in newer systems you have to find out on your own and download the client yourself in order for the game to launch. Multiplayer is long-dead, co-op is off-line only, the campaign is short (I finished it in ~6 hours while really taking my time). There's also a few crashes and glitches, although this is an afterthought in the game which is already dissapointing.\n\nI got this as part of a bundle and it was as good as a movie you let play in the background. You can skip it safely and not miss anything, if you really want to play the second one (haven't played that yet, so no idea if it any good), just read the plot online, you're not missing anything.","June 30, 2015","false","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That by itself is enough to make me not really want this game, but I decided to play it anyway.\n\nAs for the actual game, it's nothing great.  The gameplay is alright.  It's a mediocre cover based shooter at best.  I only really had trouble with one area of the game.  My biggest complaint about the gameplay is that most of the guns feel the same.  You have pistol, shotgun, automatic weapons, and single shot weapons.  They made several different automatic weapons, but they all handle roughly the same.  The game is also really short.  It only took me about 5 hours to beat, and the replay value is almost nonexistent, which sucks.  It's also annoying how the HUD only shows how much ammo you have for your weapon, not how many bullets are in the magazine.  A lot of minor inconveniences come together to really bring the game down.\n\nDespite how bad the gameplay is, the story is probably what disappointed me the most.  Kane gets busted out of prison and is forced to work with the men who betrayed a while back (you never find out what he did).  One issue that I had with the story was that there was little to no foreshadowing.  Now foreshadowing isn't necessary for a story, but you have no idea what's going to happen until it happens, and then you feel confused because you don't really know why it happened, or if there was any hint to it before.  The story wasn't anything great, but it was the main reason that I played to the end...  and boy did it let me down.  The game lets you choose between 2 endings, both of which leave a bad taste in your mouth.  I won't spoil it if any of you want to see it, but just take it from me it isn't worth it.\n\nOverall, this game just isn't worth your time.  If you want a cover based shooter, there are thousands of better ones, and if you really want to know the story, just look it up.","February 11","false","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I still played it to the end so I will give you a quick review -no spoiler- of why you should not get this game, whatever the price.\nThe game is a shooter, with some extremely limited squad management involved. You play as an inmate on the run from death row. Now with that in mind, I will start with the qualities of the game:\n-It is fairly short and believe me, that's quite the relief.\n\n...and done.Now, that's out of the way, I will list some of its many shortcomings:\n-Its a port from the console and it shows. It's not very ugly but it is still pretty bad for a 2007 game. The optimization is non existent and the fps will drop even on a modern mid-range rig.\n-The control are truly inadequate and moving around is really frustrating. Commanding the squad is not too hard but there ain't much you can order them anyway.\n-Aiming is a royal pain, you always find yourself in a particular angle that prevents you from firing at the enemy. It is so cumbersome that you will find the cover system more effective at protecting the ones you are shooting at.\n-The AI is stupid both for your enemies and allies. This makes the game really easy very often, especially in corridors. To compensate for this, you are regularly thrown in arenas where inordinate amounts of bad guys will spawn from all sides. Your teammates will be of very little help. It makes it more irritating than interesting.\n-Finally, the scenario is very unoriginal and full of clichés. The English dubbing is only semi-convincing.\n\nIn short, better you replay one of your old favorite rather than trying this poor, generic game.","January 24","false","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LazyAsFuq/recommended/8080/","LazyAsFuq","NoLimit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LazyAsFuq/","146 products in account","In my older days, this game was the absolutely sickest game I've ever played. I think it had something to do with my first real desktop computer. Even though back then my graphic card sucked and I could barely play it still brings back good memories. The only thing that didn't was the Games for Windows Live. And even though I now own the Steam Version of the game I can see on the forum that it is still a big issue. So if you can't remember your password to Windows Live you're pretty much screwed and you can spend hours just to download all the updates, patches just to be able to play the game.\n\nI know the game didn't really get a lot of positive reviews and there was a lot of drama surrounding this game due to a little company called GameSpot, but that's a different story. Speaking of stories. The game is about a criminal, who's in jail writing a letter to her daughter Jenny. Some dudes, help him escape and he found himself in a chair bounded and is asked to deliver back the money he stole from his old teammates. They have kidnapped her daughter until Kane delivers it back to them. To guard him, they hire a watchdog (Lynch) to look out for him and the journey begins.\n\nIt wasn't so long time ago I actually replayed this game and it didn't quite live up my expectations of what I remembered. The game hasn't really aged very well. The gameplay is not as snappy you would probably like. It feels all a bit clunky and not responsive at all. The cover system is a bit average and so is the gunplay. It has some decent graphics for its time and interesting locations and missions overall, but the story falls a bit flat and that's Kane and Lynch weakness. The writing of the game is not really interesting either. They use a lot of swear words, not there's anything wrong with that, but they constantly use it, and it becomes tiring. You have a squad you can use by calling commands, but it's never really used properly, and you're in most cases better of alone.\n\nConclusion, yes Kane and Lynch falls flat on pretty much every level, but it's not a bad game per se, it's just that it's so average and doesn't bring up whole new set of stuff. I've also heard that the game doesn't really work well on the most graphics card, so it's probably not optimised well, but that's just what I read on the forum. I'm going to recommend this game anyway, just because it holds a nostalgia value for me and I would probably also have picked it up sometime anyway. If you want to play with your friends you can do coop, but it doesn't really advance the story in any particularly way. So try it out and see if it's something for you.","April 19","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I enjoyed it back when it was released, beating it several times on Xbox 360. I was impressed by how they managed to create such violent and depressing atmosphere in a story about characters who are downright insane in a disturbingly twisted way. The game feels like it was planned to be actually big, but after going through rough feature cuts it turned out to be what it is, a story-driven cover-based TPS with plot holes and the most basic of TPS mechanics you can find.\nBut the story and atmosphere is what deserves some attention in K&L. Heard of the night club level? Or sieging a business skyscraper dressed as window washers? Give this game a shot. Seriously, it deserves to at least be tried.\nThe reason I give it a thumbs down though lies in this exact Steam version. This is not actually a Steam version, to be exact - it probably won't even work when you buy and install it before you get Microsoft's Game Marketplace installed. I still own a disc version and can confirm that it's the same edition with absolutely no differences (except the MS Game Market is installed along with the game not making you confused about why it doesn't launch). For best experience get it on used disc or play it on your console of choise. Putting aside all technical details, the atmosphere deserves your attention.

The game isn't too difficult, F is every other word (frequently more), the story is predictable (to me), and a whole lot of plot points get ignored. The multiplayer, a big point for me when purchasing, is flicky at best, and one person always ends up playing while the other walks into walls.\n\nPretty though. If you turn off all the bloom, shine, reflection, and gunflare effects.","December 25, 2010","false","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
