"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EleimaStargazer/recommended/373440/","EleimaStargazer","[GWJ] Eleima","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EleimaStargazer/","431 products in account","Yup, that's right, this is another RPG Maker game. And that's not a bad thing, per se (just take a look at the most brilliant To the Moon), but there are so many bad RPG Maker games out there that nowadays, it makes you cautious.\n\nStargazer starts out with a very straightforward premise. A young man named Zach loves astronomy. So much so, that he spends most of his nights out in the forest looking up at the stars. His nickname, predictably enough, is the Gazer. Until one day, a star falls from the heavens, and Zach hurries over to the crater. Except it's not just a lump of red hot rock, it's a blonde young woman called Aura. Nicknamed Star. The town is ruled by an evil old man called the Chancellor, and of course, he's after the star. So the pair decide to flee and tour the world, visiting all the summits they can to go look at the stars from an elevated height. To do so, they smuggle aboard a pirate ship.\n\nSorry, just give me a second, I'm having Stardust flashbacks.\n\nAs gameplay goes, it's nothing to write home about, pretty straight forward turn based JRPG style. You equip your characters with gear of varying stats, and everyone takes a turn to whack at the baddies, whether that's badgers, bears or foxes. So far, I've only recruited the Star, the Gazer, and the Detective, but I hear there are few more, that your characters interact, and you can even have weddings in your party.  When you take a look at the cards, however, there's something profoundly disturbing: they're all white.  And they all have blue eyes.\n\nSo far, there's been very little to grab me, to be honest. For starters, the premise is such a huge déjà vu, but the developer adds insult to injury by sending you on a series of fetch quests in the first hour. The fetch quests are a bit grating, as they reinforce inane stereotypes. You play as Aura and she runs into a young girl who immediately wants to recruit her into her club, the Princess Butterflies. And of course, surprise, surprise, the girls are at war with the boys who keep slinging mud and teasing them. The girls' response? To steal a "prized item" from the boys' hideout and to capture the leader and kiss him. I don't even know where to start, there are so many things wrong. Predictably enough, Aura gets into a heap of trouble, arousing the suspicions of townsfolk after being specifically told to lie low. I'll grudgingly admit that without this, the game would lack impetus, but I can't help but wonder if there could've been another way to get this storyline moving. The Chancellor's goons tracking Zach and Aura from the crash site to his home, perhaps?\n\nAs it is, the game doesn't have any major game breaking flaws, but it's a series of small and not so small offenses that are its downfall. All in all, I didn't *hate* my time with Stargazer, but with some many other wonderful games waiting for me in Backlog, however, odds are I won't be returning to it.","August 19, 2015","false","4.5"," 47 of 78 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","47","78","2","0"

This one is in conjunction with John Wizard, which seems to bring the best of both creators to the game. This game has all the qualities I love about about fantasy--magic, mystery, and a good story line.  The character interactions are really fun and sometimes hilarious. The love stories are fun too. I love that there are so many side quests. I am currently on my 4th time through the game.  Ordinarily I am a console (PlayStation) fan, but I haven't had the time to get into anything deep lately.  For fun and relaxation I've been pleased with the quality of Aveyond and John Wizard PC games, and think Stargazer is every bit as good as Lord of Twilight. I have set Aura's magic up diffently each time, and it's been a treat to see things I didn't notice on other times through it.","October 24, 2015","true","45.1"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

I actually played it through which took me around 22 hours. However I think Steam only logged me 2 hours of playtime. (I mostly play offline.)\nI chose this game because I liked the “art style” and to be honest the premise of romance in the whole story.  Since I’ve seen quite a bit of trashy RPG Maker games, my expectations weren’t so high otherwise.\n\nSTORY: Well, you probably read the short description, while there are some “turns” there are no “twists”, it doesn’t really improve from there. The party just runs kind of aimlessly around and finds some clues about Aura’s origin until the final battle against the bad guy. However I still had fun doing all this. Maybe it is the mix of the character dialogue that I found to be quite entertaining, the change of scenery (which can be ridiculously drastic) or the gameplay.  (About the characters: They are all nice and I enjoyed them except for ONE that is. I did not like her, did not like her part of her sub-story, did not ever use her again nor was she ever of any importance to the story – I really do not know why she is in the game at all.)\n\nGAMEPLAY: I played on normal. For what I experienced the game is more about … well, the experience and story? To be honest, this game doesn’t excel at any category, not the story, not quest variety or battles. However the mix of it all is charming and it does not need to exceed to be fun. And most of it is optional, though you might have problems money wise from time to time if you only follow the main quest line (It is to a certain degree all about the equipment.) Back to being positive, the mix of sub quests, battles and searching for hidden meteors or solving puzzles is fun.\n\nART: I liked the whole presentation, everything was so cute. And I liked the little details e.g.   being able to change Aura’s clothing colour, the scenes played out when re-entering the house of a party member …   And while I mostly play with sound turned off, when it was on, I liked it pretty much.\n\nIn conclusion, I really like the game and I am probably going to replay it (and skill Aura differently). I think it’s cute and fun.  But I personally was a bit disappointed in how you unlock the second wedding and quite unhappy how the third “wedding” turned out to be. If I had not been intrigued by not one, not two, but three weedings, I wouldn’t even mention this, but well … it did. (I was on team Scarbeck-Kala, man) Ignore this, if you are not girly like me. And the rest still makes up for it all.\n\nEven though I probably sound quite negative about this game,\nI recommend it, especially on sale.\n\nI hope this review was of any help to you.","December 25, 2015","true","2.8"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

You control Zach, a guy who likes astronomy and looks the sky every night. One night a falling star crashes and you go to see only to find the "meteor" is actually a blonde woman. The first hour or a bit more are simple "fetch" quests, regarding a conflict between a girl vs boy gangs. Then, after making a lot of noise you decide to escape from the city and go tour around the world.\n\nHonestly, the game itself it's not bad, and I'd say the music is quite good, but in a couple of hours a game should "catch" you. I got a little bored when I had to go to the Bear Forest again, to look for a (clueless?) captain of a pirate ship to the leave the starting area, so I quitted the game, and I don't believe I'm going to enter the game again.\n\nIt's just not interesting enough to wanting me to go back to disclose the story.\n\nPS.- Steam incorrectly logged the time.

Although i said that it's a RPG Maker game, it's quite different from other RPG Maker games. Most of the systems are customized, and surprisingly, you can play it with a mouse (although i rarely use it).\n\nStoryThe story starts with a meteorite which struck on the ground. A guy who loves to gaze at the stars (and fonds of meteorite) chases "it", only to find out that it's a girl. He decided to take care of her and together, they find out who the girl really is, and do what must be done. Maybe the ending is quite cliche, but trust me, you'll enjoy it. The dialogue doesn't really focus on that a lot; rather, it focuses more on the quests, which doesn't really mentioning about that story too much. The dialogues mostly only covers about some light conversation with some jokes on it, which can bring a smile on your face.\n\nThe only thing that confuses me is how some characters are shown without any sorts of introduction (i mean the 2 girls), and suddenly becoming allies out of nowhere.\n\nMusicWell, i'll be blunt: the music is awesome. I especially love the music on the first area and the first town. It sounds pleasant and hypes me up. There are a lot of areas with different music and all of them brings up the atmosphere.\n\nGraphicsWell, if i said that the music is awesome, then so is the graphics. Most (if not all) the graphics are custom made, and it looks great to my eyes (especially the trees!). The details are very high compared to the default asset and each area has their own set of sprites. The color is choosen perfectly, although i have to admit that the lighting in lovey dovey town is too bright (after finishing the area). I also am somehow dissapointed with the "travelling" sprite (both by the bird and ship) because it doesn't cover much detail. It's still awesome though.\n\nThe UI is also very well made. Did i tell you that the UI is customized? Well, for starters, you can see your health bar without even opening the menu. Also, if you are lazy, the mouse control can help you getting what you need: saving, exiting the game, opening the options, anything! The battle system also brings out our character's handsome and beautiful faces right on the screen. I love with the way they are designing the UI, although i got confused at first with the wording since they are not using general term (i mean.. that "Battle" and "Profiles" menu, which i usually take as "Party" and "Status").\n\nThe mappings are done perfectly. Each areas mapped differently and has their own charm. I can see the effort that the devs put into it (especially in Rosegarde, the biggest town). The town is very big and i tend to get lost there (okay, maybe that's just me). The dungeons are designed not to be too hard nor too easy, which is good if you don't enjoy getting lost in dungeons. However, the transition between some areas, especialy if there is a change with the music, are quite slow which makes the game looks like lagging.\n\nBattleThe first thing that i want to say is: there is no random encounter! Yes, i have to admit that i am one of those people who hates random encounter because it can break my concentration. The monster will reset as you move between the screen. The battle can be hard or easy depends on your difficulty, and i must say that it's quite hard on normal difficulty. And while we are at it, i have to point out that you can choose difficulty in this game (if you haven't notice it already, that is). If you hate long battles, i suggest you to play the easy difficulty. In late game, your healing will be outed by enemy attacks, and some of your character can die easily (some of them die a few times when i play it). You'l also have to use items in order to beat the last boss (or maybe i'm just suck at it).\n\nYou can't revive your characters by resting at the inn. You have to revive them first either by using skill or item.\n\nThere are 7 playable characters with their own unique skills which will be unlocked on main quest progression. However, you can only use 4 in battle. Well, at least all characters (even the non participant) will get exp after defeating a monster.\n\nThe only thing that i have to complain is the long the transition time between and after battle (especially after battle). I prefer to finish battle fast and the transition is quite slow for me.\n\nQuestsThere are 2 types of quests in this game:  main quest and the optional one. However, both aren\'t listed differently, which made me confused at first as to where to go next. At that time, all of my optional quests can\'t be finished if i didn\'t progress the main quest and i somehow miss the main quest on the quest list).\n\nThere are a lot of quests. There are 200 quests in total (+1 if you are counting the "slay the final boss" as a quest) when i finished the game. Some quests are simple and a continuation from the previous quest, some can only be unlocked by finishing a certain quest (well, there isn't that much of this type), and some will require you to reach some point on the main quest first in order to finish it. The huge number of quests can make you bored, but hey, there are lots of thing to do, and it also means that there are a lot of content in this game.\n\nPuzzlesAlthough it's not the main dish in this game, there are some puzzles. Some are quite easy and some are quite challenging (it's not too hard though). I enjoy doing the puzzles and although there are quite a lot of them, i still hope that there are more puzzles to solve (maybe as much as the quests).\n\nPros:\n- Tons of quests\n- 7 playable characters with their own unique skills\n- No random encounter\n- Auto save on every screen\n- Custom difficulty\n\nCons:\n- Lags after changing screen (especially on the areas where the music changes)\n- Slow transition before and after battles.\n\nConclusionIt's a great and enjoyable game to have and play. Make sure you have a lot of spare time when you play it though, you'll need it.\n\nShould you buy this game?Yes.\nA discounted price would be awesome, but i can also say the same for the normal price, as long as you content with buying a RPG Maker game for such price.","June 1","true","29.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
