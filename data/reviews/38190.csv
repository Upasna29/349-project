Some stuff was VERY well hidden but the hints were helpful. The quest aspect was kinda cute too. I tend to like HOGs sothis was okay. It was good fun and didn't take too long to beat.\n\nDon't get it at full price though. Getting this on a sale is your best bet.\n\nOverall, average but okay. Something to play on a lazy afternoon when you wanna play something quick and to completion. 2.5/ 5 for me.","September 27, 2014","true","4.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The backgrounds are re-used fairly often, which is cheap. There's also this weird between-levels activity where you dress up some flamboyant young man in all sorts of tacky jewelry. It's not terrible if you like the genre (which I don't), but it's hardly a travesty, either. 2 out of 5 stars kinda thing.","December 28, 2010","false","8.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aecellus/recommended/38190/","aecellus","Aecellus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aecellus/","133 products in account","Fairly standard hidden object game, that took me about 2 and a half hours to complete. The hidden object aspect was fun, and not too easy, with a few pieces extremely well hidden. The addition of the 'comics' and voice acting was nice, however the story was a dull and predictable 'save and marry the damsel in distress' that could be set anywhere at any time. Historical accuracy is not a feature of this game.\n\nPersonally, not recommended as there are other hidden object games on the market that are superior, despite this being a fun little distraction. It's not worth buying at full price, but as part of the Cradle Bundle - especially if said bundle is in a sale - it's a nice 'freebie'.","June 23, 2014","false","2.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"
