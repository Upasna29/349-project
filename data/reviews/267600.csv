"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vyvern7212/recommended/267600/","vyvern7212","Vyvern","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vyvern7212/","706 products in account","Airport Simulator might be the most tedious and boring game ever released. Heres what you do in this game:\n1. Select gate for plane to taxi to.\n2. Extend tunnel.\nIf its a passenger plane:\n1. Drive stairs to gate.\n2. Drive bus to gate.\n3. Drive luggage wagon to gate.\n4. Drive interior cleaning to gate.\n5. Drive exterior cleaning to gate.\nIf its a cargo plane:\n1. Drive cargo wagon to gate.\n2. Drive exterior cleaning to gate.\n\nWait 5-10 minutes\n\n1. Drive everything back to the garage.\n\nThats literallyy it. Theres no management, there is no way to lose you just get money for every task you do. You start with 8 gates even though youre probably never going to use more than half of them at a time. You can hire "helpers" that drive the vehicles for you. The game is over once everything got an "helper". The graphics are bad but you cant really expect good graphics from a 15€ game.\n\nWhile playing it I got the feeling that devs were never even close to an airport. On what airport do they use tunnels and stairs/buses on the same plane? On what airport does the luggage go to end of the airport and the passangers to the other?\n\nThe game is also riddled with bugs. When you save the game all textures and models unload and all you see is the skybox for about 3 minutes. The Tunnels jiggle all the time and get stuck inside the terminal. When i tried to taxi a plane back to the runway the game just crashed.\n\nNot only is this game awful it is also falsly advertised: It clearly says in the description that there are "Many management and business options for the expansion of terminals and extension of runways" which there are none. Not a single one. It also says its available in german, french and italian which isnt the case either. Steam finally has to hire someone that plays every game for at least an hour before it is made available on the store.\n\nTL;DR Do not under any circumstances buy this game, dont even accept it as a gift.","December 19, 2013","false","1.1"," 1,674 of 1,778 people (94%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","94","674","1","6","20"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tremelo/recommended/267600/","Tremelo","Tremelo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tremelo/","322 products in account","This is a frustratingly uneven game. It starts off painstakingly slow: An aircraft comes in and you, apparently being the only person at the airport with a driver’s license, have to drive various vehicles to and from the plane: a passenger bus, a rolling staircase, a fuel truck, two types of cleaning trucks, a luggage trolley, etc.  It’s very tedious, but eventually multiple planes start arriving and you have to juggle various tasks among them. The plane at gate 5 is fueling now, the plane at gate 6 wants fuel next. A plane that just landed is waiting for a parking spot and you’re trying to push back a plane at gate 3 to make room for it. At this point the game isn’t exactly *fun*, but it’s at least involving. Get those tasks done to get the planes off the ground!\n\nBut then you earn money and hire help and once you hire enough employees to handle every vehicle at every gate the game becomes nothing more than a slightly interactive screen saver: A plane lands, you assign it a gate and everything is taken care of. You just sit there and wait for it to take off again.\n\nThere is one maddening exception: The pallet loader for cargo aircraft. You can’t hire anyone to drive this. It’s all you, and it's buggy and annoying. For starters, only one cargo plane can be serviced at a time. If you have 3 cargo planes parked at gates you'll only get loading/unloading instructions for one of them. You can entirely finish loading up the first plane but you won't be able to start loading and unloading the second plane until the first plane is on its way to the runway. It can sometimes take 10-20 minutes between the plane being loaded up and actually pushing back, during which time your pallet loader gathers dust and other cargo planes take up gate space waiting to unload. Additionally if you make the mistake of parking a cargo plane at gate 6, 7 or 8 you need to make ridiculous round trips back and forth across the tarmac between unloading a pallet on the south end, going to a parking spot on the north end, and returning to the cargo area on the south end again to pick the next pallet up (for gates 1-5 the parking spot is thankfully right next door to the cargo area so moving the pallet loader from the cargo area to the parking spot takes about 5 seconds).\n\nThere are other frustrations too:\n\n+ Wonky physics that allow you to flip a plane nearly upside down with a nudge from a luggage cart\n+ Tasks that appear and disappear from your task list\n+ A non-intuitive interface\n+ An inability to move vehicles to a gate prior to a plane being assigned to it\n+ Awkward vehicle/gate rules. An aircraft can't push back until all of the vehicles servicing it have returned to their parking spots. It's not enough to simply clear the gate area. This makes multitasking difficult. For instance, say you're fueling a plane at gate 1 and when finished drive the fuel truck to gate 2 to service that aircraft. Even though the fuel truck is no longer at gate 1, that aircraft won't push back until the fuel truck has actually parked in the fuel truck area.\n\nFor that small percentage of people who *really* like airports, there are bits and pieces of this game that are slightly interesting, but the bugs & game logic & freakin’ pallet loader make it nearly impossible to recommend.","July 18, 2015","false","21.2"," 31 of 36 people (86%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","86","31","36","5","2"

The game consists of waiting around a lot for things to happen. The things? Driving a few service vehicles aroung from garages to airpot gates and back. Once you have automated all but one task (for some reason loading cargo cannot be automated) you merely sit and watch the same things repeat over and over again. Your involvement is now over. The claim of countless missions is a lie and the publishers should be ashamed of themselves. There is one mission. It just repeats over and over again.

Sound only works if you adjust it to 2001 standards (so it matches the graphics). It's slow and boring. No way to speed up time.  All you do is drive around in excruciatingly slow airport support vehicles to a predetermined location and move on to the next vehicle. This must be done in a certain amount of time or else you start losing money. If you manage to actually make money, you can use it to "upgrade" each service, which simply automates it.

Initially, you have to do all the driving, but you earn money for completing each vehicle task and receive larger cash injections when planes take off.  As you earn money, you can upgrade each of the vehicle tasks to automate the work three times, the only difference seems to be the speed in which the AI vehicles move.  Once you have upgraded all of the vehicle tasks once, everything is automated except for unloading/loading of cargo from/to cargo planes - which cannot be automated.  Once you have upgraded everything as far as it goes, the game ends, which took me about 18 hours, almost all of it waiting and watching.\n\nThe description for this product is also misleading - super jumbos, there are none; coordinating air traffic controllers and technical staff, not in the game; organizing perfect catering, nothing beyond driving the vehicle from point A to point B; detailed and comprehensive simulation of events at an international airport, only if you think the only thing that happens is people driving vehicles; many management and business options for the expansion of terminals and extension of runways, not in the game; and countless missions and tasks the player has to fulfill, only one "mission" which happens to be the objective of the game (to upgrade all automation tasks) and then the game ends.\n\nOverall the game barely held my attention, and only then because I assumed there must be something more to the game once the gate upgrades were done.  I was wrong, now I want my 18 hours back.  Might be worth it if the price drops to a couple of dollars, otherwise you're just wasting money.","January 2, 2014","false","18.6"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","20","22","0","1"

Again, I was wrong. As you go on, the only way to get by is to automate the airport functions by hiring helpers. At first, they are desperately slow (you have to pay more to make them go faster) which frustrates you into upgrading everything as fast as possible. The problem is, you are effectively upgrading yourself out of the gameplay! There are perhaps 2 functions left that you have to do manually, and that's allocate a gate, and load/unload cargo. The latter is probably one of the more redeeming features of this game, in that the cargo lifter requires a little bit of effort as you have to line it up fairly precisely, and that it has some legitimate animation! If they had extended these features to more of the equipment, so you actually connected and sealed the stairs and the skybridges etc, I might have been inclined to stick around a bit longer.\n\nIn summary, a bit tedious and a bit limited. Save your money...\n\nFor the sake of constructive feedback to any of the development team who might see this (unlikely I know):\nFix the bugs with the AI - they get close to their goal on some tasks and then just abandon it altogether\nGive an option to take over automated tasks - In case of the above, I had no way to step in!\nPlease extend the animations a bit! - Connecting the walkways, and seeing people in the buses can't be that hard to do if you can do containers in and out of a cargo hold!\nFind some form of expandability for once a player has automated the terminal. - Maybe designing and building a new terminal? Extending the current one? Upgrading equipment? Replacing old equipment with newer kit?!?\n\nThere was a fair bit of potential for this game but it just fell short of my expectations, even for this price. Deep down inside I hoped it was going to be like 'Air Mogul' with the customisation of the buildings as well as the operation of the equipment, and i'd definitely come back to it if these things were patched in at some point, but for now, I bid you adieu, Airport Simulator 2014...","December 21, 2013","false","14.0"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

The idea of an Airport Simulator sounded interesting and as I had acquired this in a Bundle Package I thought I would at least give it a try otherwise it would just sit there in my library collecting dust. No more than 15 minutes into the game, it will now definitely continue to sit there gathering dust forever.\n\nJust like some of their other titles, the developers of this game should honestly hang their heads in shame. The game is buggy, there are graphical glitches all over the place and there are absolutely no tutorials on how to control anything you have access to in the game, so you just have to figure it out all by yourself (seriously, what is your problem with tutorials? None of your games that I have played have anything of the sort).\n\nAlso, the dialogs are blurry and impossible to read for me, I know this isn't the case for everybody, but it seems to be the case no matter what settings I apply in-game. I'm not wasting any more time on this game, so I won't write any more as I am just going to be repeating myself. I knew it wasn't going to be amazing because of all the bad reviews, but this is much worse than I even expected.\n\nLong story short: Do not buy this game, not at all, not in a sale and not as a part of a bundle unless you're getting at least one good title out of said bundle.\n\nWaste of my time.","July 5, 2014","false","0.2"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","2"

If you however want to do something then this isn't that game for you, even if you want to browse the web or play something else while your waiting you can't because when you alt-tab or click outside the windowed version the time stops.\n\nThe graphics aren't to bad and the gameplay is okay, its not overly buggy besides from some animations and things getting stuck when automated, but....\n\nIt's very boring, very repetative and quickly loses  its charm.\n\n3/10","December 19, 2013","false","8.4"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

This is limited to choosing things of a menu without any detail of what your actually doing. The graphics aren't up to scratch which should be expected for a simulator.\n\nThe "comprehensive simulation"  refers to all the time you spend driving around airport vehicles (like buses, stairs, etc) in painfully slow vehicles. The game processes at a turtle speed (I gave up after having to wait 20 minutes without a fast forward button with nothing to do).  There was no tutorial or walkthrough built into the game so made it difficult to play and UI wasn't very approachable.\n\nWould score this game 1 or 2 out of 10.

Then do I have the game for you. Airport Simulator is a game where almost nothing happens in its entirety and I really mean that. This game is so slow that you can grow a beard that is 2 feet long before you complete the first challenge. I mean what else is there to say its so BORING! I have done household chores that are more fun than this game FOR REAL! Another thing is that they are charging $10 for this abomination of what they call a game. Honestly your better off just giving that money to a homeless person because they will be able to find more enjoyment with it. Then there is the sound, dear ♥♥♥♥ing god what were the programers thinking. When you start up the game it sounds like a smoke detecor went off in your house it just drives me crazy. I honestly can't think of anything positive to say about this game and most games that I end up getting that are bad I have at least one positive to them, but not this one. So why did I buy this then? Well have you ever looked for the worst possible game to play just becasue it is bad? I thought that I would get this game because it is literly the worst rated game on steam, its true just how many games are there on steam that have a overwhelmingly negative overall user score  almost none. So I bought it expecting that it would be a good laugh, but enjoyable for being so bad like the Tommy Wiseau's The Room is, instead I was crying and wishing that I had never spent my money on this garbage. I bought this before the steam refund ever existed so I was basically stuck with this thing. Overall don't buy this garbage of a game even if it is on sale you will just waste your money and if you think that it would be funny to send to a friend as a gag gift you would be a terrible person because it will basically give them cancer. There are SO many better games that you can get for $10 and even less. Don't infect your hard drive with this disease and I honestly hope that this trend in all these fake simulator games will just die and fade away because they fill up steam promising fantastic experiance, but instead they just ♥♥♥♥ your wallet and waste your time.","April 23","false","0.3"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","85","11","13","8","0"

The game itself, it starts off slow, VERY slow, and then once you start generating little bits of cash and start to upgrade your gates, it starts to get slightly more entertaining! Then, if you're like me, and you upgrade all of your gates, once you upgrade every gate to level 1, there's nothing to do, besides escort cargo for a cargo plane! I told myself everyday, 'Don't worry Josh, ride the wave, you'll do it and finish the game tonight'... I said that for 4 consecutive days... 4 FUDGING DAYS!!! But, i did it... I got the confirmation message, telling me that i'd completed the game and couldn't upgrade my gates any longer and saved myself from dropping into the deep hole of pure insanity!!

Basically, all you get to do is drive around various airport vehicles (stairs, buses, luggage carts...) and assign planes to gates. However, it doesn't really matter which gate you assign a plane to, and there's not much you can do wrong with driving the vehicles around. The "management" part of the game has you paying money for upgrades of the various vehicles, where the first upgrade automates a vehicle (you no longer need to drive it yourself, but you also can't take control if you want to), and subsequent upgrades speed up those vehicles.\n\nAutomated vehicles are slower than manually driven vehicles (which are also pretty slow), so you might think you'd cleverly automate only some vehicles or some gates or what have you and do the rest by hand. However, as soon as you're using more than one gate, you run into a problem with manually driving the vehicles: you only get one of each type. So if you need, say, a passenger bus on gate two while it's already loading or unloading passengers on gate one, you're out of luck. But as you have a time limit for getting any vehicle in place, you'll probably end up driving the bus from plane one to plane two, then back so that unloading can continue - once an activity is started, there is no deadline, but they only continue if the vehicle is present. Except stairs. You can remove stairs and the passengers will continue loading from the bus into the plane.\n\nThe strangest part about this "game" is that the aim of it is to make yourself mostly useless, as you're supposed to get all gates fully automated at upgrade level three. Obviously, just watching the game take care of the planes for ten to fifteen minutes at a time before you get to assign a plane to a gate (one click), then watch again, isn't really that much fun. Apparently even the developers realised this, so they gave us cargo planes. Unloading and loading cargo planes is the one thing you can't automate, so you have to drive the cargo lift yourself. It's a shame though that the game is only capable of keeping track of the loading state of one cargo plane at a time - if you have more than one cargo plane at a gate, the second (and third etc.) planes will have to wait until the first one leaves.\n\nThe only thing you can do "wrong" in the game is be too slow getting a vehicle in place, which will result in money being subtracted from your account - one Euro per second until you get it done. Actually managing to be that slow is almost impossible though. One might think that as the frequency of landing planes increases, a penalty for not getting rid of planes fast enough will occur - not so. They will simply queue up on the taxiway until it is full if you don't assign them to a gate, and once it is full planes will stop landing.\n\nAll in all, the only thing this "Simulator" simulates is a horrible attempt at making a game, but it simulates that very well.","December 20, 2013","false","14.1"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","1"

I never post reviews when I should but if this review helps just one person save there money then I hope I accomplish that.\n\nOkay at first, I am a big fan of simulation games, and upon seeing this game released on sale I decided t give it a try. Upon opening it, I was brought to the main menu game was running smooth at this point no problems. I clicked on new game, and was brought to a cheap tutorial screen that did not explain anything outside of the fact ill win when i accumlate enough money to hire 3 star assisants.\n\nI was left to my own will to figure it out, so i decided i would give it a go. The world loaded, graphics are mediocre at best, I have seen worse. The first plane landed I was ready to go, I had to pick a gate for the plane to park in, I picked gate #7. The plane eventually made its way over to the gate and parked. A task list then popped up, this is where it takes a turn for the worst. My first task was to drive the gate tunnel to the plane. The controls for this are horrible and theres no explanation for it at all. It took me 5 minutes to figure out how to line the tunnell up with the plane. Ok got that done, my next task was to drive the stairs over. I switched to the stairs, which were all the way on the other side of the airport. I started to drive over to the plane, in the slow slow vehicle. obviously i dont expect ferarri type speeds but it took me at least 3 minutes to get it over there. At this point im thinking okay, i hope it gets more interesting. Nope, my next task is to drive the bus over. Again its half way across the map. I drive it over park it. My next task is guess what? Drive the  mechanic van over. I did it.. My next task was? You guessed it.. I had to drive the luggage truck over.. With horrible vehicle controls on it, i made it over after almost flipping the vehicle about 19 times.. I was hoping i was done.. Nope, my next task? Drive the cleaning van over. I drove it over..My next task youll never guess. Nope not driving, It was waiting! I watched a timer count down from 8 minutes to 0 minutes to do guess what, Drive the bus over to the terminal. After doing that, guess what? I had to drive the stairs back, then the gate, then the luggage truck, then the mechanics truck and then finally i drove the cleaning van back.\n\nSo long story short, if your looking for a annoying horrible physics less than ideal driving simulator that does not explain anything about game mechanincs then buy this. If your looking for an airport simulator look elsewhere.\n\nPros:\nSort of cheap price with the sale\n\nCons:\nBoring\nNo explanations of game mechanics\nMediocre graphics\nHorrible music something like elevator music.","January 2, 2014","false","0.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Back in the day, I played Airport Inc/Tycoon - a game where you built your own terminals and areas within them, runways, and competed for aircraft contracts etc etc. From the description, I could only assume that this game was like that, but with modern graphics and (hopefully) better gameplay.\n\nHow wrong I was. This game is mediocre on every level compared to the 14 year old game I previously played - and that wasn't brilliant.\n\nHow anyone can develop a game and think it will be fun to drive poorly animated, poorly controlled airport vehicles to and from a plane at incredibly slow speeds is something I have yet to figure out.\n\nI have played 41 minutes of this game and hoped I was missing something. Perhaps after I had done all this to one plane, I would be able to move on with the 'detailed and comprehensive simulation' - no! Another plane arrives and repeat, you must...\n\nPlease save yourself the money and don't buy this game. I now need to try to get my money back for flagrant false advertisement.\n\nSimply - dreadful, miserable experience.

Very cut and dry simulation.\n\nThe UI in the game is clumsy at best, and is easily bogged down. There is very little instruction on what exactly needs to be done, and the "goals" in the game aren't explicitly clear. They also don't follow a linear progression of difficulty, because the first goal I recieved took a very long time to achieve, but the second was done within ten minutes.\n\nIt is also not clear in any facet, how you are accumulating money. You just see random influxes of cash when certain tasks are completed, and other times when there is nothing to be done.\n\nAlso, as much as I appreciate the fact that the larger automobiles in the game drive a lot clumsier than the smaller ones, it is totally unnecessary because the game is programmed that each vehicle has the same predetermined speed based on your skill with that task, and that only applies when you have a gate guy driving.\n\nOn the whole, I find this game needs some work, and there needs to be more things to simulate. Like actually running the airport, inviting businesses in and take up real estate to pay you rent, getting other airlines into your airport, managing your monthly expenses, gas, fuel, workers salaries, etc...\n\nIf it combined the data/financial savvy of a game like SimCity, with the easy playability of Airline Tycoon, and added some additional features like growth and expansion from a small airport to an International one, then this game would be golden.\n\nAs it stands, I do not recommend this game.\n\n","January 27, 2014","false","1.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Almost everything people have already said, I can agree with. With one exception. I actually did enjoy the game for the first hour or two. The challenge behind making enough money to automate things was great. However, that quickly dies once you find that you have two major steps in playing the game.\n\n1. You work your butt off driving things and trying your hardest to get planes out on time.\n\n2. Once step one is nearly complete and a number of automation is set up you drive around in a vehicle watching things go. Even then your ground crew isnt the most efficient because they will take much longer to drive to places than you.\n\nSitting back and watching a painfully slow airport sim (which you have no control over other than driving vehicles) is crap. You may not realize it at first but when it dawns on you the game gets put into the "junk" category in steam.\n\n-----------------------------\n"Many management and business options for the expansion of terminals and extension of runways"\n\n-This is so bs.

Well uhh.. Look elsewhere. This game is so buggy it makes me wonder if the developers played more than ten minutes of it. The two biggest faults are that vehicles get stuck all over the place -- even when the game's AI is supposed to be handling them -- and there's no fast-forward button. Some tasks take 9 minutes to complete. That's 9 minutes in REAL TIME that you literally have to sit there and wait. The game leaves a LOT to be desired, and it's a shame, because the overall design/layout for the various tasks and stuff is not entirely awful. With some major overhauls this game could actually be worth it.\n\nThat being said, I completed the game to the best of my ability, unlocked all the upgrades for all the gates (took me a solid 24 hours) and even after having everything automated the computer still managed to get vehicles stuck. I've encountered all kinds of wacky, silly bugs in this game, a few of which make the game unplayable and require you to load a save you made before encountering the bug.\n\nI'd love to see this game updated and fixed, but until then, don't even consider spending money on this terrible, terrible game.","January 21, 2014","false","24.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You have to drive the fuel truck to the parked plane, wait half an hour (real time) for the plane to finish refueling then drive to the other side (at a max of 10 kmph (5ish mph) to put the truck away, then you have to get another truck with a slower speed and take that to the plane, wait another half hour.... ♥♥♥♥ this game seriously...

I thought, I might give this game a try. I really enjoy simulation games, but this one is crap. It's really crap. Gameplay itself is not that crappy, but the engine is totally messed up.\n\n- I got two gates operating with one plane each. The empty bus at plane 1 could simply unload plane 2. But it has to return to its parking lot first, otherwise plane 1 can not lift of. That itself would not be a great problem if all of the vehicles weren't THAT incredibly slow. So I drive across the airport for like an eternity to park my bus, just to make sure my plane 1 can start, and THEN drive back again to plane 2, that stands RIGHT BESIDES PLANE 1. Sigh...\n\n- Last part before starting a plane is to pull it from terminal to starting lane. So that's a great idea. Unfortunately the puller-car doesn't pull the plane at all. I parked it right where the game told me to, then drove of to the destination point... and the plane remained, where it was. Well... I tried, what I could do about that. And I ended up with pushing the plane all the way across the airport. Yet it has not arrived in its destination, but my car got stuck under the engine. Sigh...\n\n- You can buy employees to operate the vehicles. One at a time, three speeds each. I was happy to see the first vehicle operate by itself. It started its mission, drove off to the plane... and kept on driving... and driving... and driving... DAMMIT, these cars are SO DAMN SLOW! It might get faster, the better you upgrade them. But one step one it's another thing that takes forever. Did I mention, that the vehicles drive ultimately slow? Sigh...\n\n- Oh, and I accidently parked the car you can use to explore the airport somewhere wrong. On a road. It was wrong because the AI wasn't able to navigate around it. When it met my car, they had a quick "bump" and then the AI stopped. It didn't even try to drive around. OR EVEN PUSH IT AWAY! It just stood there and looked unsatisfied. But didn't even notice me about that problem. Wonder what happened if I didn't look after that one... Sigh...\n\nBut well... in fact you can play it. If you get it started. And it doesn't stop while playing. And you don't get stuck. And there are no bugs that keep you from winning. And if you really enjoy to see planes leaping across the airport, right after you pushed them with your luggage-car. That was fun to see. But in fact it was a bit... disappointing, regarding to where the plane was intended to be. Sigh...","January 31, 2014","false","17.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game took 20 hours to beat and was as boring as watching a box of rocks, I was only able to overcome the shear pain of playing by filling out paperwork (Work Related) or by actually playing another game (handheld/phone) while this one was running. When you first start off in the game you have to do all the work yourself, which is just driving vehicles to and from the planes in a timely fashion, and the idea is that you will make money and hire workers so you dont have too do the tasks. In the end you will have a task that you must complete on average every 15min, the rest of the time the airport runs itself. I do not see how this game can ever be enjoyable to anyone! UIG (creators/publisher/whatever) needs to be taken off of Steam, there games are simply crap, and should never had made it past steam's quality control. I got this game in a game bundle and have no regrets on my purchase, however had i bought this game solely looking for enjoyment i would be VERY upset.

There's no 1080p or higher support (for a 2014 game!).   The game will run at 1050p... but it's just 720p upscaled to 1050!  Jaggies everywhere!  Console players may enjoy this kind of treatment but PC gamers don't.  Textures are low res, but you can't change the graphics fidelity much anyway, the options are too basic.\n\nI picked this up in a bundle in one of my crazed bundle buying sprees, so have only myself to blame.\n\n","July 4, 2015","false","0.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

A simulator would likely allow you to get inside the vehicles you drive, or even go inside the buildings. This dosent do much. Certain aspects are broken. Like taking the plane taxi and moving the plane in place for takeoff. On my first try I flipped the plane several times. In order to move the plane you have to ram the wheels. Yes ram a airplane full of passengers which can cause a flip. If it was real life there would be no survivors. Another thing is when you first get in its very confusing and you get lost in certain aspects pretty quick. A simulator is expected to be like the real world. This dosent even come close. You technically dont hire people at all. You make upgrades which actually are helpers which actually do all the driving for you. Once you get to a certain point, the game literally plays itself. You dont have to do anything except tell the planes what gate to go. What would make a airplane simulator fun would allow you to build buildings, put in shops and organize how your main buildings process new custormers, buy airplanes, hire employees for various jobs, and even design your airstrips. This game has none of that and cannot be recommended. Out of 5 I give this game a 1.5.

Maybe it is because of the mindless tasks you need to fullfill or the soothing music, but one of the game producers is called Insomnia, which should give some hint to how much it will demand from the gamer.\n\nThe graphics are rather good and the music is excellent, though very repetative since it's only 1 or 2 tracks. You are in charge of the loading, unloading, fueling, repairing and pushing back airplanes at an airport. This is easier than it sounds, since all you have to do is drive vehicles to their marked parking spots next to the airplane, at their (un)loading docks or garage. With the exception of the cargo loader for cargo planes and the taxi used to push an airplane from the gate to the taxi strip, the occasional upgrading of vehicles so that not you but an NPC gets to those jobs and assigning a recently landed aircraft to a gate there really isn't all that much you can do.\n\nI found it addictive though, and with a little program called Voice Attack I don't even have to touch my mouse / keyboard unless I assigned an airplane to a gate which has no NPC's. Ow yes, almost forgot, the cargo loader for cargo airplanes cannot be automated, so at least you can do that manually.\n\nIt still has a lot of potential and a future version 2015 or 2016 I wouldn't mind playing. I recommend this only because I have fallen slave to it, but I think most people would rather play something where you actually have to DO something.","August 21, 2015","true","37.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I'll give you the negative points first; The video settings, no matter what aspect ratio and/or resolution I set the game to I could not for the life of me get it to show me the full game screen in fullscreen mode. Instead, I was forced to play in windowed mode, which was irritating. The game crashed a total of 3 times in the span on 4 hours. The fixed view from the control tower has blind spots due to where it is located, and if you preselect units which are almost completed with their tasks, you run the risk of the game bugging out and being made to sit and wait a long, long time before the next objective becomes available. I should also mention there is no tutorial, you are thrown in head first to figure it out as you go.\n\nSounds like a lot of negative right? It is, but this game for some weird reason was also very addictive. Once I got over the initial shock of not having a tutorial, I got into a nice rhythm and within about 4 or 5 hours I had upgraded all 8 gates at least once and was working on the second level upgrades. My airport was essentially running itself by that point. I had a lot of fun with it and while it does have it's negative drawbacks, it can still be a lot of fun to play. I would recommend this game to someone, only after they have reviewed each of the negative points I made and went into this game cognizant of what to expect.","July 18, 2015","true","22.8"," 10 of 23 people (43%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","43","10","23","3","0"
