"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeeJaxOff/recommended/371880/","TeeJaxOff","TeeJax <3","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeeJaxOff/","3936 products in account","Collider is a fantastic party game with single player, local co-op and local competitive modes, which is a lot more addictive than expected.\n\nThere are five game modes in total out of which three can be played single player. All five of them can support up to 8 players so have your controllers and friends ready! The game modes vary nicely and I found each one to be very enjoyable.\nCollider is very much a time-burner. Once you start playing you don't realise just how long has passed until you stop. I found myself constantly thinking 'Okay, just one more round' then playing for another ten minutes.\n\nThe co-op part of the game is where it really gets fun though. It's really awesome to work with and compete against your friends. I found single player to be rather relaxing whereas co-op was the complete opposite; we all found our competitive sides coming out. We ended up playing for around 45 minutes when we only planned to play one round of each mode.\nI think local co-op is often under appreciated these days and I'm glad there are still games like this that understand some people just want to play with one copy of a game on one device. There is a lot of re-playability due to this and it doesn't run the risk of having no-one online like so many multiplayer games end up with.\n\nThe gameplay itself is great, the game runs fine with no issues and the controls work perfectly when using a controller like recommended. You can still use a keyboard but I found it a lot harder and not as enjoyable. The graphics are very nice yet simple, though I feel this works in favour, everything is beautiful yet there isn't too much going on.\n\nThere are a few tiny, tiny gripes so far I have with the game but nothing that stops me from playing. My first is the distinct lack of a pause feature. Now I know games like this don't require one but when I'm playing and I've gotten pretty far in a mode and have no choice but to die to take an urgent phone call it sucks. Secondly some options would be nice so you are able to adjust sensitivity and volume. Also I was hoping to 100% this but I feel the 'That's a paddling' achievement is out of reach as it requires owning at least 7 controllers which i'm sure very very few people have. Lastly there could be some form of tutorial or explanation to each game mode (I didn't realise I could shoot until reading an achievement and even then it took me pressing every button to find it out). The last two the developers have said they are working on though which is great and shows that the developers do listen which is rare.\n\nAll in all Collider is fun, both alone and with friends, and is one of those games that if you have a few friends and some time to spare it's definitely worth trying.","March 14","true","4.0"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

You get to choose from one of 5 different game types, each with its own unique rules and variety of amazing music in background. Singleplayer is good and challenging as it's quite hard to achieve good scores alone. Multiplayer however is epic and terribly addictive, I can't wait for another opportunity to play with someone else, it's just too good!\n\nAdvantages\nGame is full of colors yet not with exaggerated amount of them, so it's pleasant to eye whole time\nQuality and diversity of soundtrack is amazing, I love this retro tone!\nControls are simple\nGameplay is smooth and nicely done\nIdea of game is overally good and innovative, I'm really addicted to this game right now\nLocal multiplayer works perfect, with great ideas of competitive and cooperative rules\nCost of it is entirely worth playing it\nDisadvantages\nThere are no options in game, it could really use audio or at least sensitivity options\nLacks a bit of introduction into different game types, for example I accidently discovered that I'm able to shoot after about 20 minutes of solo gameplay (I played on controller)\nCould use an option to add bot as other players for people who are not able to test out local multiplayer\nBad news for people who don't own any kind of controller - it's required to play multiplayer\nSummary\nGame is excellent, addictive and have high replayability for people who want to get better and better at it. I really enjoy playing it, singleplayer might get boring when you feel like you reach your limits and won't get any further with scores, but multiplayer is fenomenal, I can't wait to have an occasion to play more (I really hope bots / internet multiplayer will be added one day). Description also says that game is moddable. Unfortunately I'm not gifted with skills of creating my own mods so I can't wait to see what other people are capable to create from it. I will definitely play more soon!\n\nPersonal score\n9 / 10\nIf you find my review helpful or funny be sure to follow Opium Pulses curator page right here for more reviewed games!","March 4","true","4.4"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","13","20","0","3"

If you have a place in your heart for old-school addictive arcade games that punish your incompetence, this will be right up your alley. While it’s core is simple, it has plenty of twists on the dodge-em gameplay.\n\nCollider has 5 game modes, all of which support up to 8 players and 2 that require a second human to play. I found all of them to be fun and frenetic in their own way, ranging from the one-handed play of Acrobat, to the complex base building of Defend the Core (my personal favorite). Adding players simply ups the chaos, as every player shares the same circular arena.\n\nControls are simple, just move and shoot. You can use a mouse and wasd, but I preferred a PS4 controller where you just use the two joysticks. The action is tight, and the controls are extremely responsive; you can start and turn on a dime. When you die, it’s not the game, it’s your own damn fault.\n\nWhile not spectacular visually, it’s a whole lot of fun and only gets more insane as you add players. I eagerly await the online multiplayer.","March 5","true","1.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheNooBThatMeows/recommended/371880/","TheNooBThatMeows","SuperPvPNoob","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheNooBThatMeows/","90 products in account","Now, i first saw this game on Orlygift, which gives out codes in raffles for steam games, and it actually looked really fun, despite the simple premise and design. So I decided to pony up and buy the game for myself, after not winning it. First of all, even though it looks like an HD asteroids  remake meets a pong ROM hack, the vibrant backgrounds and EDM soundtrack support it, allowing you to stay enveloped in the game.\nUnfortunately if you want to play every mode, you need at least one controller and a sperate human being (unless you're really good at multitasking). And even though the two multiplayer required modes are more for fun and playing around, that is what they are designed to do. The single player modes (which can be played with up to 8 players like the rest) are more focused on survival, which is well fitting. These three modes are Acrobat, compression, and Core Defence, with each mode getting a couple more mechanics than the last, and are varient enough to not get stale.\nAcrobat is a mode where you simply have to not get hit. This is for players who are more run than gun, as it doesn't include the gun feature like the other modes, though this is not a bad thing, as it allows the player(s) to focus on dodging the bullets, or enemies as they're called in the game. This mode also spawns "Seekers" occasionally, who will follow you until you die. They are stopped by the center aroun the core, but it's a circle, so they just slide around it, adding a better challenge to the simple mode.\nCompression mode is like acrobat mode, you still have to dodge enemies, but three things are different. 1. You can get powerups. 2. You have a gun mechanic. 3. The walls are closing in on you. There are no seekers, but the walls are a bigger problem. Now touching them won't kill you, but getting squished isn't impossible. The walls move in slowly, but they get closser every time you shoot the core's circle, or the walls, which ou will do a lot, so only grab the multishot power up if it's absolutely neccessary.\nNow Core Defence is different. Veeeery different. In core defence, you are ctually siding with the core that has tried to kill you over and over again, and what do you get to protect it? Defences which I call "cores", because it's easier. These cores vary from powerup genorating factories, to the classic shields and turrets. You will have a _lot_ of cores if you can place them close enough to the center core, and there will be many lines close up, and that's good. Now you cannot control when or how you get the power ups, you can just hope you get a good one, but over all it is one of the best modes in the game, and it gets even better from the fact it's the most... "in depth" single player available mode.\nOverall this game is just fun, fun, fun, and fun, although I reccomend it to people who have a lot of gamer friends, so you can enjoy it how it's supposed to be played, with friends. Get this game.","March 20","true","1.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While you can play by yourself, I strongly recommend playing with multiple people. It gives the game an edge of competition that is very much lacking while playing single player.
