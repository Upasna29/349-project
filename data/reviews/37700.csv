"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stumpo/recommended/37700/","stumpo","Stumpokapow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stumpo/","2598 products in account","This is an incredibly low budget time travel FPS game. If you're looking for polished setpieces, you won't find them here. But if you're looking for using cluster bombs on civil war battlefields to mess with history, this is your game. One mission (sorry for the mild spoiler here, but it'll help sell you on the game) involves you getting put in a POW camp, being broken out by a mysterious stranger... and then traveling back in time and being the mysterious strange who breaks yourself out of the POW camp. It's so absurd, but it's awesome. The part where future soldiers with automatic weapons show up at the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius is totally campy. The one rule of the game is that you can't mess with history... until the game tells you to mess with history.\n\nIf you're in the mood for something that's very clunky with a lot of heart, I think you'll enjoy making your way through the game. It's a pity that surface-level complaints about the game caused reviews to miss how enjoyable it is.","December 9, 2013","true","6.1"," 61 of 65 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","61","65","3","0"

It is a great game for those interested in an FPS that goes to different points in history.\nWell, if you have an older Nvidia graphics card anyway. Running a GTX 970 the Physx features of this game wouldnt work, even with legacy drivers installed (fog, leaves, weapon smoke and other particles) - without these the game just isnt as good IMO. Therefore, i had to play on an old 9600GT to get PhysX working. Worse; It wouldnt run on my Radeon card at all.\nEDIT: Tested on Windows 10 Tech Preview 64bit. Its not the OS that's causing the issue for some people. You just need an older GPU\n\nTechnical problems aside, the actual game:\nPROS:\n- Fantastic idea - Travelling back to various periods including WW1 and the Civil war. These arent exactly common in other games and it was a refreshing change, and on the whole they did it well. They actually explain the time tavel part of it too, and the plot involves 2 opposing groups fighting to either preserve or change history.\n- Good levels - who doesnt want to form up in rank against the confederates at Antietam, or break out of a WW2 concentration camp?\n- Reload animation minigame - get it right and it speeds up the reload, get it wrong and it jams and takes longer. Great mechanic.\n- Weapon upgrade system\n- Fairly good voice acting, and chatter from other sodiers on the battlefield\n- Slight choice to pick the mission you want to do next\n- Feeling like a badass when you are wrecking Romans and Confederates with future weaponry\n\nCONS:\n- Maps arent as open as they appear, invisible walls and linear design\n- occassionally getting stuck to surfaces\n- A few turret sections that are only ok\n- you can bypass the necessity for reloading by switching to secondary and using it, by the time you go back to your primary weapon it has reloaded itself. This takes away from the feel of the game, especially in the civil war with muskets that should take a while to reload.\n- The ending leaves the game open a bit for a sequel thats likely never coming.\n\nIn conclusion though, the negatives don't outweigh the positives for me and I think if you have an older nvidia card this game is definitely worth a shot. If you can get it working with PhysX the graphics hold up surprisingly well, and the game has a great concept and its a hell of a lot of fun.","January 10, 2015","true","8.0"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aps97/recommended/37700/","aps97","[ARX]AnthonyPS","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aps97/","140 products in account","*UPDATE*\nI finally managed to launch the game with my new gaming laptop since it has NVidia graphic card. The game is surprisingly made really well and I love it! So I decided to remove completely my old review and write a brand new one, a simple pros and cons.\nPros:\n+ Completely unique and cool storyline. I don't think any other game has ever thought about stories like this. This kind of story has been my dream for a pretty long time and I never thought someone actually made a game like this\n+ Chosen war era is very unique. Other game developers rarely make any games about World War I, Civil War, and the American Indian war, since I know most people will hate sitting on trenches waiting for a head to pop up or having to reload for a long time after every shot while their enemies can hide in trees with bows. But I love it because it is different.\n+ Great storyline, not epic but it is really cool and people would be able to make a movie out of this game.\n+ Mediocre, but still acceptable graphics. Not much to expect from an old low-budget game. But it is still acceptable for me and I think it is pretty good.\n+ Challenging gameplay. Just don't play on the easiest difficulty. With increased difficulty you will receive more damage and it will feel much more tense. Imagine having to reload your musket with the enemy charging you with bayonets.\n+ You can use modern assault rifle in civil war era. That's fun LOL.\nCons:\n- Cannot run on computers with AMD graphic cards\n- Laser weapons, all weapons has 100% accuracy when you aim down the sight and 100% damage on all range. But it has no multiplayer so I don't care about OP weapons\n- Abandoned by developers\n- Invisible walls\n- Bad voice acting\n- Character dialogues tend to overlap\n- Random crashes, but not too often\n- Terrible soundtrack. Almost no soundtracks in-game\n- No stealth element. Enemies will easily see you from far away and you get no silenced weapons. You will also move way too slow when you crouch.\n\nOverall, you will easily notice this game is pretty crude since I heard it is a low budget game. Square-ish no expression face, bad voice acting, bad animation, no melee animation, etc. But the storyline is very unique and the war era is really not like other FPS games. There may be other FPS Civil War/American-Indian War/World War 1 game out there like Verdun, but as far as I know, people rarely make games in this war era and it makes this game worth buying and playing. The campaign itself isn't too long and it's just like finishing CoD and Battlefield's single player campaign. But I really like this game for its unique storyline and war era. However, I decided not to change my recommendation status since I personally think this game is overpriced. Wait for a discount or something. It's not worth the price for its short campaign and little to nothing replay value.","November 23, 2014","false","7.1"," 30 of 47 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","30","47","2","4"

What is this? Simple.\nA first Person shooter. BUT that is not all. You are able to experience various events.\nEven though only digging at the top, you are able to learn history (Atleast i did).\nExample: What do you think is the darkest day of american history? 9/11? Well wrong.\nThe battle of Antietam in the american civil war.\n\nThis game captures time traveling, altering history and history itself.\nYou are about to be killed when a mysterious agent, give you "the choice" to save your life.\nWhy did he choose you?\nYou are a ghost of time. You arrived to early, your papers from your transport got lost. You don't exist according to documents. So it's not so obvious, if you are missing and recruited to maintain time.\n\nTimelines where you will go:\nAmerican Civil war.\nFirst World war.\nSecond World war.\n-Secret-\n\nLet's keep it that short, because you will love the complex story of the game itself, if you cope with it.\n\nMOVING ON TO THE PRO'S AND CONS\n\n\nPro's\n\n- Interesting concept of the ghosts of time (no records of them, did they even exist at all?)\n- Various assets of weapons (Modern ones, First World war weapons, etc.)\n- Actually nice sound quality\n- Nice capturing of history (What happend, when? etc.)\n- complex story\n- Seperate Targets (Some can die and don't change the history, some need to be saved)\n- unexpected turn of events at certain points\n\nThis game actually reached my interest in history, especially in the history of america.\nLet's be specific, my interest in the civil war.\nAnd because of that bit of interest which i got from this game, i actually started to study history.\n\n\nNeutral\nThis is a section where i put the points which i can't judge about what you guys would feel.\n- Graphics are a bit old, but easy to overlook when you are in a fight.\n- Voice acting is a bit harsh and the movement of the mouth is badly captured, but the voices themself are pretty to be honest.\n\n\nCons\n\n- You can get distracted on pretty easy ways.\n- Instructions of the levels are rarely explained through talking\n-> Frustration rises because you overlooked a hint or a way.\n- complex story (some people like it, like me, but many can't cope with it)\n- Same Missions (find a historicly relevant person, secure them, while shooting the enemy)\n- no multiplayer\n\n\nIf you have trouble deciding whether you buy this game, feel free to contact me, i try to answer your questions, the best i can.\n\nThank you for reading this.\nGreetings\n\nKörnäl","January 4, 2013","true","72.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You sure were quite the attention nabber at the presentations in the eyes of many only to fall flat on your ♥♥♥ on release. Darkest of Days got nothing but poor ratings across the board and, in my honest opinion, I have to disagree. Sure, the story and abrupt ending was incredibly idiotic, but the game itself isn't really all too bad. The campaign was of decent length and I had fun mowing down people in the Civil War era with a full automatic SMG. While DoD only stays in the WWI and Civil War times, it still has pretty cool mission design in some places. And I guarentee you will love the last level of the game but hate it because you wish there was more levels like it. However, I recommend Darkest of Days.","October 17, 2010","true","7.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Travelling through time, the possibility of playing through different eras of history and even pre-history, while occasionally bringing in weapons from a different time period to help you out, all within a first-person shooter seems like it would be hard to screw up.\n\nHOWEVER. This game doesn't capitalize enough on its own ideas. For example, in total there are only four points in history you visit: The American Civil War, both World Wars, and Pompeii at the end. Why can't we go visit the Roman Empire? Or see the Peloponnesian Wars? Hell, why not go investigate Ancient Egypt? Or if you really want to go nuts, take the player back to pre-historic times, like the Jurassic era. Running away from a T-Rex because you're armed with nothing but a tree branch and some rocks could make for an interesting chase sequence!\n\nOn top of that, I noticed that a lot of the time, NPCs kept walking straight through walls, sometimes even getting stuck in them. Another time, an enemy was actually shooting me through a ROCK.\n\nAnd if THAT weren't enough, the game ends on a friggin' cliffhanger that is highly unlikely to ever be resolved, because I doubt the developers (if they're even still around) are going to release a sequel.\n\nOverall, it's a mediocre title that could have been fantastic, had they simply gave it a bit more effort and imagination.","January 5, 2014","false","7.8"," 7 of 21 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","7","21","0","0"

It has been quite some time since I've last played this title and sadly, I may never get a chance to play it again (more on why exactly later). My regret at not being able to play again and my recommendation should be enough to indicate that I enjoyed this, but let me tell you why.\n\nDarkest of Days is not a AAA title, it lacks polish and was clearly not developed with a large budget. It reminds me of a girl that you find enchanting and even sexy despite a plain apperance, because she has that certain "something" you like in the opposite sex, she has quirks in all the right ways, that allow you to overlook or even like any flaws she has. Darkest of Days was that sort of game for me. It has bugs, it's actually kind of ugly (even when it came out), the premise of the story is amazing, but the execution isn't very good. The main character is a faceless man rescued from certain death from the scene of Custer's last stand, whisked away time agents and put under the wing of the forgettable and strange Dexter. You are then thrown in various historical periods to prevent changes to the timeline, it follows a somewhat predictable but not entirely boring temporal civil war-like paradigm.\n\nSo far it sounds like I hate this game, but I don't, as I've said I like it. Why? I'm a history buff. The sheer gratitious pleasure of wielding a futuristic automatic weapon against American Civil War era soldiers, Roman Legionaries, and World War 1 era German soldiers was enough to sell me on the game alone. While the environments and situations are not as varied as you would think based on what I just said, it was enough to keep me interested and wanting to see what happens next. This novelty of concept alone was enough to make me like this game, if someone ever picks up this concept and does it better I may never want to play another first person shooter again. Also everything felt well done enough to not distract significantly from my enjoyment of the theme. By far the best segments of the game are the beginning sequences in the American Civil War and the end which takes place in the ancient world.\n\nShould you buy this? Well, that depends. Remember how I mentioned I can't play this anymore? Well, when I built my new PC I decided to go with an AMD GPU, Darkest of Days does not function without an NVIDIA GPU and to my knowledge (and last I checked) there is no work around for this and the development house that created this game no longer exists so a solution is unlikely ever to be forthcoming. The other factor you have to consider is: does anything I mentioned to you sound like it would be as interesting to you as it was to me? Remember, this isn't your Call of Duty or Battlefield. It's a somewhat mediocre offering from a small studio that collapsed. What it does have is an interesting concept, it has little else going for it. If you like the concept and you can actually run it, I suggest this highly as a short diversion. If not, stay away.","April 14, 2015","true","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Halfway through the game I had to crank it down from medium to easy.\n+Graphics are good for their age.\n+Can fight endless swarms of Nazis.\n+Can replay any mission later with any selection of weapons you've unlocked.\n\n-Really short, but this could have been to keep the game from dragging on.\n-Oldschool shooter mechanics. No leaning or prone, for example.\n-No multiplayer\n\nAll in all, pretty good! I recommend it, especially on sale. You're only paying for 8 hours of gameplay, and that's if you die a lot like I did, so keep that in mind.\n\nOnly thing that would have made the game better is if it had TimeShift's time manipulation gameplay features.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RepublicEmpire/recommended/37700/","RepublicEmpire","Darth Pyrrhus II  of Epirus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RepublicEmpire/","66 products in account","Darkest of days is a game worthy for history fans. There's one problem: it's too short. The game has a huge potential, but it has bugs and often crash especially graphics as well. The plot is trying to be cool, but feels like a Sci-Fi B movie at best. The ending was like weak to say. I must address the pro and cons of the game.\n\nPro: the actual historical weapons are accurate. Imagine reloading a rifle musket is long and tedious. If you planned to use it in close range, use its range since its rifling barrel gives huge advantage. I recommend use the rifle musket in long range. WWI weapons are authentic to say which its very impressive that the developers understood the weapons of the time. What's great to experience some of historical moments in Civil War to WWI, but I will not spoil it.\n\nCon: the story felt weak, graphical issues, and wasted potential. They could done a better job explaining, but they assume time travel as if it was Back to the Future. I would like to see Time Travel fit with Multiverse theory where altered timeline interact with original time. This is like as if it was a Terminator's version done badly. The graphics are another problem; if you don't have Nvida, don't buy this game. But if you have Nvida even a good one, it will crash for no good reason. My laptop can run Attila total war without any problems, but this game will continuous crash. The AI is the worse and sometime use an aiming bot as if out of nowhere.\n\nThe AI are like brain dead and always focus on you instead of other enemies. The game is flawed in the content and the ending is a sequel bait which they were about to make a franchise out of it.\n\nConclusion: I do enjoy the game. Not perfect, but I would play it once and awhile. This game is a guilty pleasure and might do a Let's Play series. My rating on this game based on enjoyment, criticism, and idea is 5/10. It has flaws which many will not enjoy, graphical issues, weak spiked difficulty AI, and weak story. However, I like this potential idea where I wish some one will remake this game or a better than first one sequel, historical events, and using historical firearms.","March 17","true","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
