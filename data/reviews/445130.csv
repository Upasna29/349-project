If this game was trying to let those without social anxiety have a better understanding of  people who do suffer from it, I feel like it didn't do a very good job-- because the main character is REALLY,  really unlikable. Having social anxiety does NOT mean you're a spiteful person who dislikes everyone around you, which is how Samantha came across to me. I understand everyone with anxiety handles it differently, but I'd hate for Samantha to be the Social anxiety poster child. Just sayin.\n\nThe bit of the game that bothered me the most was, as she's leaving the kitchen, she says out loud "You can have your precious kitchen back now." leaving the two chatting girls behind her with confused expressions. I'm sorry- but WHO with SAD would ever do something like that? 1) It's rude and forward. 2) It's way too embarassing. Come on.\n\n\nI would hope this game doesn't give anyone the impression that people with SAD avoid people out of some sort of uncalled for anger and bitterness. I've never felt anger towards people, who are simply minding their own business, just because their presence makes me nervous.\n\nThat said, there were small bits of the game that I related to tremendously, like the pretending to clean up the kitchen to waste time and avoid looking odd. The increased heart rate as the microwave goes on and on, fearing that it will disturb the others.\n\nOverall, I can't say I reccomend this game. It had a lot of potential, the art and music was cute. The overall message that something as simple as getting oatmeal can be a nerve-wracking task for someone with SAD, is a good one. Unfortunately, the attitude and personality of Samatha completely ruined it for me- it's not her social anxiety that makes her unlikable, it's the fact that she's a bitter person with rude thoughts.","May 12","false","1.1"," 68 of 84 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","68","84","2","2"

Some people (including myself,) have had issues with unlocking the final achievement,  Once more, with feeling , although someone suggested verifying the games cache, which worked for me.\n\nReview:\nA simple girl is sitting in her simple dorm, when she realises that she is hungry, very hungry. So her objective is simple, to make herself a cup of oatmeal, but here's the catch, she has  social anxiety . Now whilst it  is  nice to see social anxiety represented in a game, it doesn't cover most of the problems of social anxiety, which seems to be the problem that people are finding with this game. The story, after one or two play throughs, does get very repetitive, as most of the endings are the same, with a little variation. Despite that, the art is well done and the soundtrack accompanies the art and story well.\n\nOverall a cute and fluffy game, with 5 easy achievements. However it doesn't address many of the issues related to social anxiety. The game currently does not offer any trading cards, but it would be nice to see some in the future. An okay game if you have half an hour to spare.\n\nIf you like my review, any feedback is appreciated and if you would like to see more reviews from me in the future, feel free to follow me!","May 7","true","0.7"," 32 of 38 people (84%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","84","32","38","3","5"

The instance where she insults the girls in the kitchen for having a conversation is uneccessary and really made me uncomfortable. Instead of taking a healthy and helpful view of social anxiety, this game is like a farcicle representation of soical anxiety that makes those who suffer from it seem callous and idiotic. Cute art work, clever idea, but why rest so heavily on being stupid and a jerk? Sadly, the poor representation of anxiety in this game takes too much away from an otherwise promising concept.

Depression and Anxiety are not sweet things, they are a darkness the creators of this game clearly do not understand. This game isn't just bad, it's borderline offensive.\n\nAs a real sufferer of Major Depressive Disorder, I am highly unamused by these armchair psychology adventure games about depression and anxiety on steam. Generally speaking, they portray self-diagnosed upper-middle class individuals who live lives of little to no adversity. In this regard, Samantha Browne is no different. The character absolutely suffers no actual anxiety or depression. The Samantha Browne featured in this game is simply lazy, unwilling to accept criticism, and views all other female characters in the story very misogynistically. At one point, she expresses no issue with venturing into general public, her "anxiety" only relates to talking to other young adult women in her dorm who might challenge or call into question her physical value to men. The themes at work here are oddly enough anti-feminist, and Sam is often times a straight up internalized misogynist. If I had to sum Samantha up with a spattering of adjectives, she's unskilled, overprivileged, ignorant, has an unwarranted sense of self-importance, has no common sense, and makes terrible decisions constantly.\n\nIncluded below is a Stream-Of-Consciousness style play-by-play of a playthrough of this game so you can understand how horrifically banal, overprivileged, and logically absurd the whole thing is without actually contributing to its sales. Great works of feminist literature have been written about these topics, and for this or anything like it to be lumped in with them is absurd. This is feminism for people who have never sat through Roots or The Color Purple. Playthrough:\n\nAs I opened the game and gazed upon the 3-frame steam rising from the already-made oatmeal, I became overwhelmed with trepidation. Why was the oatmeal already made? In an attempt to access some kind of options menu to turn down the absurdly loud music, I entered a credits menu, and my fear turned to outright terror. There were no options. This was a game made in Renpy, and there were no options. I would be forced to play this game with its 7-key toddler keyboard soundtrack on max volume with clipping. I do not like my experience being restricted, so I alt-tabbed out of the game at this point, only to discover that the window was nowhere on my task bar. The music still poisoning my ears, I remembered to lower the volume in my OS, at which point the track started over. It was becoming abundantly clear to me that, somehow, somewhere, someone thought this music was worth playing at absolute max volume allowed via the engine.\n\nDespite the ominous feeling deep within my bones, I soldiered on and returned to the game via alt-tab. As it turns out, Samantha Browne is the kind of girl who makes oatmeal in your grandma's cat coffee cup, how quaint. Mulling over Sam's bad decision making was getting me nowhere, the time to begin this Adventure(s) was upon me.\n\nOnly a few seconds into the game I was startled to learn that Samantha Browne is, in fact, not one of US, but one of UK. So Indie. I was introduced to Sam's "remote" 5-story, at least 70 room, dorm in the middle of campus. It's a flat, not because she's british, but because that's what the other students call it. Uh... Okay. We now learn that Sam has 0 friends. Bummer. Poor Sam, she truly lives a tortured existence of macbooks and iPhones that I'm sure only her mom calls her on. I was offered a chance to view the consequences of not obliging Sam's horrible decision to eat a high-carb food 6 hours into the night. "I'm sure she'll just ♥♥♥♥♥ on Tumblr," I thought, before clicking the top option.\n\nI got introduced to Sam's desktop pretty quickly, upon which I learned that she was at least some degree of a furry, wonderful... In addition, she was illegally viewing copyrighted material on a TV Streams site. Samantha's power as a good role model for young women was only growing. The only word I can pick out of the Pirated TV dialogue is the male saying "♥♥♥♥ING" in a threatening manner to the female. How mature and progressive, I thought! I am now thrust into my first decision, do I lie to my furry boyfriend about my """crippling" "social" "anxiety""" (emphasis mine), or do I "make up some excuse"? I told the truth, because as we've already explained, my Sam is a smart furry role model who is working on improving her awful decision making. She quickly undoes my decision by spelling because "coz", much to my chagrin. We learn that Sam has no problem going to a Grocery Store, but can't be ♥♥♥♥♥ to walk downstairs because a person or two might be there. Sam continues saying and doing illogical things for 2 minutes. That was a joke, but the game immediately broke into 5 minutes being told to me not shown... after I wrote that joke. I can't make this up. After an official had declared Sam fully out of bed, choices once again forced themselves into the narrative. I could pick whichever oatmeal I liked. Joy! Upon my selection of Apples & Cinnamon, Sam spelled yes "YAAAAAHHHHSSS". I begin to lose energy to play the game. One man can only be expected to put up with so much tongue-in-cheek exaggeration. I picked a single oatmeal packet, but Sam overrode my decision and forced me to pick 2 because she isn't a bovine or something. "Look at me, making choices, like an adult," the adult character said. The toxic unchecked western privilege had begun to consume me. I am now playing a mini-game where I choose a spoon from a selection of one spoon while a 7 second jazz loop of royalty free muzak plays. This is a real game on steam, I chuckle to myself. Sam proceeds to complain about walking 10 feet. As she steps into the hallway, we learn that our introverted protagonist who "is scared of being seen" is wearing booty shorts that we had no option or inkling to change out of, probably because we're an overprivileged white womanchild who is afflicted with habitual whining instead of any real depression or anxiety, just a hunch. As it turns out, Sam's social stigma stems from someone trying to give her constructive criticism on her makeup, you know, the makeup that a character with introversion and social anxiety naturally wears all the time!\n\nI am given the choice to talk to two friendly looking Stephen Universe fanfiction characters, both of the female gender. I choose to not speak to them as Sam has clearly established a dislike for women and only women because they may compete with her or criticize her. Sam has trouble using a kettle, but doesn't have the inkling to google a solution on her iPhone. Use of the iPhone is also not an option for wasting time, and for some reason we must stay in the kitchen while the oatmeal steeps. I am now in a stirring montage. This is on steam. Sam doesn't even know how to remove things from microwaves and also doesn't seem to understand simple Newtonian Mechanics relating to fluids. Despite previously refusing to talk to anyone, Sam makes a very snide remark to the other girls that they can "have their kitchen back". This level of frank misogyny shocked me. By the time I have made it back to introverted Sam's room she is baring her midriff and the artist has now decided to differentiate the cheeks of her butt with a line. Classy.\n\nWe've locked ourself out of the room and the furry boyfriend has become dismayed, whatever will we do?\n\nI don't know because apparently I lost the game at this point, Sam can't complain about her hunger on Tumblr because she's locked out of the room, and we can't go talk to the other girls because as we've already covered, Sam is a raving misogynist, so we simply get a game over.\n\nThis game is painfully stupid, it should not be considered free until the developers find a way to refund the time you waste playing it.\n\n0/10. Worst game I've played in a few years.","April 20","false","0.9"," 89 of 144 people (62%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","62","89","144","26","18"

Very hungry. So, she needs to go to kitchen and try to make a cup of oatmeal, but due to her condition this will not be a simple task.\n\nThis short non-kinetic Visual Novel had potential, since it demonstrates accurately how a simple everyday task may be an impossible thing to do for a person with social anxiety. Sadly, it develops too little the main character, which may pass the impression that people with social anxiety are all about their paranoias - and they aren't. A game that addresses such a delicate matter like social anxiety should have done a deep development of their protagonist, in a way she could look more like an individual person rather than a generic character with social anxiety.\n\nAlso, after one or two playthroughs, the story gets very repetitive as most of the endings are the same with just a small little variation.","May 11","false","2.3"," 17 of 23 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","17","23","0","0"

However, I can say that this is not fun; the writing completely fails to make you care about the main character. This was a short game: it should've been very easy to polish the writing enough to make you care about your character, at least a little bit! Instead, we're just told to "go fetch the oatmeal." A key example: one of your choices is "WHAT ABOUT THE THINGS?". This actually influences the game, but it's so silly that anyone who is not an ultra-anxious future cat-lady would just sort of roll their eyes at this. Moreover, the outcomes just seemed lazily done; you have a chance to drop your oatmeal (which happens if you undercook it), and when this happens, LITERALLY EVERYONE comes out to laugh at you. It's unrealistic (*one* person doing this, asking if you're OK, and then you freaking out would've been more realistic).\n\nThe music rather annoyed me. This is mostly a personal taste thing, I think there are people who would like it; I'll assume that I'm not in the target audience.\n\nFor all of the negatives, the art style struck me as cute. I liked it, and it probably hits the target audience well.\n\nThe key driving factor of a Visual Novel is the "Novel" part, and I have read better written fanfics. This is not worth even the 10 or so minutes I spent on it.

In 10 (!) repetive playthroughs you working for an extremely buggy achievement called "once more, with feeling". Another questionable thing is how much calories does one cup of oatmeal even have?

The artwork was decent and it was tagged as a visual novel so I decided to give it a try because it was free. When I got into the game I immediately regretted my decision. Playing as Samantha was very annoying and throughout the whole game I wanted to slap her.  All this over a bowl of oatmeal.\n\nWhen you start the game you’re put into the shoes of a young college student named Samantha Browne who is hungry, however due to her social anxiety she has yet to feed herself and now has to grab a late night bite by going to the kitchen. Simple, right? Wrong. For some reason every choice Samantha makes causes her anxiety, from choosing which flavor of oatmeal to using the microwave. What makes matters worse is her inner monologue comes off as annoying and pretentious, the whole time spent trying to get her to feed herself all I could wonder was how she ever made it to college and how does she plan on making it in the real world. Some of her anxiety I could understand and relate to but most of it just made me roll my eyes, and there really isn’t any story besides her trying to eat.\n\nControls are easy, you use your mouse to click to make choices as you try to get Samantha fed. You have a anxiety meter at the top right that fills with each choice you make. Some choices only add a little bit while others add more, your goal is get your oatmeal and get back to your room without your anxiety meter filling up. I found the feature interesting, however, I didn’t like how every choice, no matter how small, gave Samantha anxiety. Choosing the wrong oatmeal flavor, waiting for water to boil, trying to use the microwave all made her anxious. My first playthrough I managed to easily feed her and get her back safely but couldn’t not do so without some anxiety building up. If your meter fills all the way up there are a variety of ways to lose; Samantha locks herself out of her room, Samantha doesn’t even leave her room and I imagine starves, Samantha drops her oatmeal and many others.\n\nThe artwork in the game is rather simplistic but still visually pleasing, the graphics help put a visual aspect to how anxiety feels. There is also some animation in the game which is a nice touch. I was quite fond of the mug Samantha used to make her oatmeal, it had a cat on it! The music isn’t bad, it fits the game and the sound effects were nice.\n\nWhile I know everyone has different levels of anxiety and things that trigger it, I really just couldn’t relate to most of what Samantha was going through. I found it dumbfounding how she had such trouble just trying to feed herself, and I’m not even talking about the anxiety she felt having to maybe see people in the kitchen. I imagine some people can find this game relatable which I think is good and I applaud people using video games as a medium to tell emotional stories. Other than it being free and having Steam achievements I find it hard to recommend The Average Everyday Adventures of Samantha Browne, however if you have social anxiety or just want to see what it can be like then give it a shot, it’s very short.\n\n\nLunar Productions[lunarproductions.tumblr.com]\n","June 2","false","1.5"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

I don't think it meant to capture anything in it's bare seriousness, as in everything, there are degrees here aswell.\nI think it only meant to introduce the surface of this concept in it's own silly way. And not to hurt people, not to do anyone harm. I think the title and art style already forehinted this. They didn't even mention 'anxiety' in the description, to not emphasize it that much.\n\nBut I'm glad, and I appreciate that those who didn't like this game, at least explained their thinking. And yea, it's stupid to cook an oatmeal for that long. But again, hey, it's a game!\n\nAnd at last, my opinion: cute music. and art. and story.\nmuch wow. much free! and that mug is awesome.\n\nBonus: it has 10 (TEN!) different endings.

For example, maybe she lives at home with a suffocating parent and going to the kitchen would draw attention and force you into a long conversation about "what are you going to do with your life" which makes me anxious just thinking about it. But in a college setting, I just kept thinking "how does she even get to class?" So what, there are people in the kitchen, none of them seem at all inclined to talk to her, which is how I prefer things with my social anxiety. If they had tried to force her into conversation, okay a little more believable, but not much. She's in college. Going to classes would be a lot worse for people with social anxiety.\n\nAlso, how do you undercook oatmeal? You put in hot water, then you wait. If it's not done after 30 seconds, microwaving it isn't going to "cook" it faster. You just let it sit for a while. This may have worked if she was making Cup Ramen or something, but she could have taken it back to her room and let it sit for a few minutes just fine.\n\nAside from many glaring setting and subject issues, as a person with severe social anxiety, this game didn't speak to me at all.","April 25","false","0.4"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Scrptrx/recommended/445130/","Scrptrx","Scrptrx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Scrptrx/","36 products in account","Okay, so I was shown this game because, guess what, I have generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and situational anxiety. AND guess what, I'm an American who lived in this exact kind of flat/dorm during my time in England. The only thing we shared was a kitchen, and everything was communal from the pots to the forks to the table and chairs. Of course, maybe not all flats were like this. I was in the graduate student housing. Maybe we were spoiled.\n\nWhile this short little thing does capture social anxiety pretty well (the fear a woman has, for many reasons, of not wanting to eat around other people [related to body image]; the fear of forced interaction with relative strangers; the fear of being seen at all), most things depicted in this little thing are just weird.\n\nI never played passed the "forgot my keys whoops" moment because I just couldn't take it anymore. The parameters of this situation are just, basically, ridiculous.\n\n1) Instant oatmeal is instant. It cooks instantly. Does this lady not know what boiling water looks like? Water boils. Poor on instant oatmeal. Voila, it's edible. No waiting needed! QUICK! Run back to the room and eat in solitude! Problem solved, right?? No, we have to wait for it to "cook". ????? No. I can understand that a person might be so out of their skull from anxiety that they are to the point of delusion and can't tell when INSTANT oatmeal is cooked... but is that even the norm?? Have mug. Have spoon. Can eat. SO, the issue of being locked out of her room is only an issue an hour or two AFTER she eats her oatmeal when she has to maybe use the loo, which is not communal, but in her locked room. She can still eat the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ oatmeal, which was cooked before she microwaved it.\n\n2) Why for the love of monkeys does this lady not have food INSIDE her room??? She is living on her own. Are there really rules against this? Unlikely. I have lived with anxiety for, well, ever, and I CHANGED MY ENVIRONMENT to cope. So what if she has to stock up on ready to eat, no-cook foods. If her SA is that bad, she'll have figured out how to cope. She'll have figured out long ago that eating in private is the way to go. Buy some Digestives, some pre-cooked Heinz beans, and have yourself a dinner. That's about as healthy as a pack of instant oatmeal anyway, if not healthier.\n\n3) I get that this sort of SA situation is probably new to this lady, but environmental adaptation can happen very quickly. What's more, if her SA was really so bad to the point of being incapable of adapting to her SA (i.e., changing her environment and keeping food in her room), then she probably would have never gone to England in the first place, or applied to a school that would not be even remotely cheap for her. I can understand a person may have reasons for wanting to go to another country (I mean, I did it, after all), but I also survived 3 years of US dormitory life, which is far, FAR worse than just having a communal kitchen!! Did this poor creature leave her high school life to immediately attend school in the UK? That's enough of a harsh situation (culture shock, even when it's the same language) to kick anyone's butt. Is this her first night in the flat? Didn't seem like it. Maybe it was? Maybe I missed that. Even so, the complete ineptitude of this person was alarming. Maybe that's the point.\n\n4) People with anxiety issues or OCD or any modicum of intelligence probably shouldn't play this little thing as it will just make them angry and want to throw things.\n\nI dunno. I'm rambling now. I just can't get over the fact that someone didn't have the wherewithal to keep food in their safe place (private room) and not know instant oatmeal is instant.","April 25","false","0.3"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","11","19","0","1"

The art is very eye catching and has a unique touch to it, maybe a bit too girly, but the story focuses on a girl after all. As Samantha, you're hungry and need to head to the kitchen. The only problem: you, because you're the biggest obstacle. The game aims to potray dealing with anxiety and anorexia. Daily duties can become a nightmare, which is exactly what this game nails.  I've had my fair share of mental disorders, and they are different for everyone. I see this as art, hence, I am giving this a thumbs up. The game doesn't potray anxiety in general terms, the game shows Samantha's anxiety. If you think Samantha herself is a likeable character or not depends on your own opinion. Play the game for free and enjoy the nice music. This is going to be a hard journey.","May 26","true","0.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A lot! And I hardly ever use exclamation points!\n\nI thought this was beautifully drawn, the music is pretty, and the story hits close to home... well, honestly, it hit my home dead on, really. I'm quite happy to have played it. :)\n\nIt's hard to explain why it pleased me, because it's not just that sense of shared trauma.  There's something a little bit surreal about the experience, which for some reason made me feel the way I feel when I watch my favorite movie, Amélie.  Perhaps it was the music, I'm not sure.  Whatever it was, I just felt good afterwards.\n\nRegarding some of the negative reviews: I think maybe some extroverts might not understand and just consider the story and decisions silly, as they often do about introverts and people with social or generalized anxiety.  If you're an outgoing person, you won't have the same experience people like me have when playing the game, but you still might find it interesting to see what it's like to be us.  It might sound silly or exaggerated, but please know that it's actually accurate.\n\nTwo notes:\n- As of this writing there is no way to adjust the volume within the game.  I suggest alt-tabbing out of the game, right clicking the speaker icon in the windows taskbar tray, and selecting Mixer.  The game will have its own volume slider, allowing you to adjust it relative to the rest of your system.\n- One achievement feels nigh impossible to obtain, but someone has posted a guide on getting it, so be sure to check it out if you get frustrated.","April 25","true","12.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

She wanted to eat an oatmeal for dinner, but the problem is she hate meeting with people. Now it's not your average introvert, she really couldn't handle with anybody, except for his boyfriend. You will pick food, walk stair, open door, doubt yourself, and many more.\n\nThe choice that the game gave can change the course of storyline, there are about 2 or 3 choice for each action you are going to do. Though the changes is not that significant and probably lead to another gameover because of your wrong action.\n\nThere is a gameover on visual novel?\nYes, for a game that focuses the on the narrative experience and the visual it self, the game is frustating. The consequences for each action sometime couldn't be seen and barely affect your story. That is until the ending. If you want to put choices, try to put an impact that can be seen by us. If you think about it, a game about an introvert is a great potential to play with action and consequences. But maybe it's just me wanting more content for the game.\n\nThe visual for me is great and I love the way where the face of Samantha Browne is hidden between her hair. It's a hint that she really is a shy girl.\n\nConclusion + Great artwork and drawing\n+ Interesting story\n- Action that barely changes the story\n- Ragequit\n\n8/10 A unique story about an introvert.\n\n\n\n\n","April 22","true","0.5"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

She's the sweetest thing, but really, really introverted. I've tried to understand how come she "makes" everything so damn difficult - I mean, everybody sometimes think "what do they think about me?" about other people, but I never understood just how much introverted people keep themselves under the magnifying glass. This game was not just a fun point-and-click story with cutesy drawings, but a real eye-opener about how it feels to be an introvert. I thank thee, creators, because not only does it help me to understand my friend better, but it also helps me to understand myself sometimes. As a game, it's actually quite addicting. You want to dig out every little secret there is to know. The title at first seemed a little too long and hard-thought (you know, "trying too hard to be catchy") for me, but after playing the game, it does really match the content. These are the everyday things that sometimes turn into adventures. Besides, there must've been something in this game, because hey, I downloaded it. I was gonna go to sleep but... I downloaded it. Really nicely done. Summa summarum: a game both fun and thoughful.\n\nEdit: I also noticed that some people whom suffer from SAD have interpreted Samantha as "mean" or "spiteful". I think I can relate to that. When you're scared, and hungry on top of that, you tend to think or even say things you don't really mean, or usually even have the guts to say. It's part of how adrenaline affects us. The "you may have your precious kitchen back" might not have been said with a spiteful tone, to add to that. Imagine her thinking/saying that with a sigh of relief... Mostly I'm saying this because I found Samantha very cute and easy to understand. Her spiteful remards to me came across more like that of a cat's, which hisses when it's slightly stressed out and scared.","May 16","true","0.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Eating in front of other people makes her uncomfortable, but parading in her underwear doesn't? And damn, I have huge anxiety issues, but if I cared as much about others' opinions as she does, I'd have gone ♥♥♥♥ing bonkers. Also I resent that I failed because of the keys. She could have eaten in the corridor, right on the floor like an animal, if she was really hungry. Or maybe she wasn't really hungry because apparently three packages is a portion for cows. And by the way how can anyone be wrong choosing what sort of oatmeal to make? How the hell are we supposed to know what she's into? Also I'm pretty sure I killed the Samantha chick when I accidentally made her return to the room empty-handed. Like there was literally some intense dimming of light going on. So dramatic.\n\nGenerally a very easy game. it was pretty obvious what answers you are supposed to choose in order to win.

Are they drawing awareness to social anxiety disorders?  Doubtful.  Are they perpetuating stereotypes?  Yes.  Most people I know with social anxiety are nice people who I'm glad I took the time to get to know.  Samantha Browne's character was poorly developed and the game designers did nothing to make me empathize her.

I don't like visual novels.\n2) This is about a milenial college girl. I don't like milenials.\n\nIf these opinions run similar to your own, I imagine you will probably also similarly dislike this game.\n\nTo give an alternative series of opinions:\nVisual Novels are a game as I define a game, and even if it weren't I still enjoy it as an experience regardless.\nSocial anxiety is a ♥♥♥♥♥. This game shows examples of this rather well.\nUniversity is a nightmare for people with social anxiety. This game also shows this.\nOatmeal as a means to avoid being in public is awesome. This game shows this is certainly the case.\nThis game is free. I like not having to pay money.\nThis game has cuteness written all over it. I like cute things.\nThe game is a short simple game. I like games that get to the point and don't overstay their welcome.\nForgetting keys is the worst.\nI really want to watch that show that Sam is watching, She clearly has great taste in TV.\nGreatest spoon ever since Broken Age.\nThe art style reminds me of bee and puppycat. I love that show and i love this visual novel.\nI like both gameplay heavy games and games with minimalist gameplay.\n\nIf any of the opinions sound similar to your own opinion, there's a good chance you will enjoy this game.","April 19","true","0.4"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","6","14","0","0"

Ah, yeah she insults other people because they hasn't disappeared all of a sudden. She is mean and so full of herself she thinks the world spins around her.\n\nI'd call it postmodernism in order to avoid calling it useless idiotic boring crap that tries too hard to be funny, fun or meaningful and recommend it to no one on steam. On Tumblr on the other hand... The game is a very detailed description of fake tumblr-style anxiety, with only missing part where she posts all that story on Tumblr with ton of hashtags.\n\nAlso the game shows what happens when you put quotas into education - the girl goes to college and yet can't operate a microwave (!) and even electric kettle (!!). Plus she's so full of herself she barely can go through a hall.

I then read the synopsis. I have suffered with anxiety since my late teens. I too lived in a dorm, Bradford, knew no one and I honestly would run to the kitchen at the other end of the hall late in the evening, make my dinner and run back to my room. I rarely went into the kitchen whilst it was full. I was dying of thirst one day and stumbled into a group of people, all chatting. They stopped and stared at me. It was horrific. When I hear people laughing, I instantly think its at me. Then a little voice has to remind me that IM not the centre of THEIR universe. And if they are laughing at me, well they're the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Not me.\n\nI wanted to get Sam the oatmeal so badly because it brought back so many memories. I dont like going to work most days and beg to work from home because I cant handle it. Playing as a person who faces the same struggles is refreshing. I was trying to encourage Sam as best I could so I wouldnt fill that meter and Im so glad I didnt.

This VN falls short in the writing, the part that sealed the deal for me was doing the actual oatmeal in the microwave. A tedious and underwelming experience that could have been pushed farther to explore more of the thought process of an anxious individual. The picking the spoon sequence does not work thematically and falls flat.\n\nPerspective is another weak point, having additional thoughts or perhaps more of an internal dialogue that showcased what the protagonist thinks the characters in the kitchen are going to react, perhaps through a cute animated sequence, would have really driven home more ways to showcase the anxiety and ruminating that happens with people with anxiety.\n\nThe anxiety could have been pushed further in the second half of the VN.\n\nSolid art style, I can see Reimena Yee moving onto grander projects. It's a good artist debut into the indie dev world.\n\nA recommend for people who are new to game development or Visual Novel making and needing to expand their repertoire of experiences outside of the industry standards.\n\nDon't stop making games.","April 20","true","0.4"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

I can finally act like an idiot and click through most of the dialogue boxes because they add completely nothing to to the story, I can also pick the worst choices a human can make such as picking up a hot mug with my bare ♥♥♥♥ing hands or use my T-shirt instead of waiting for it to call down. Truly these are choices anyone can make. ♥♥♥♥ing Major/Minor was better than this\n\nGraphics - 2/10\nIt's really bad. It never gets better. I may not be able to draw but I see better ♥♥♥♥ come from DeviantArt. I don't know who drew the game because I didn't want to hurt the people who made it even more.\n\nSound - 1/10\n*DING DONG DING DONG* That's all there is to it and it sounds terrible. Thankfully it goes away and goes into silence throughout the whole game. There's sound effects but they sound like ♥♥♥ too so that's all.\n\nStory - 0/10\nYou're getting Oat meal. No wait a certain oatmeal because you picked the wrong option (better explained below). She's also afraid of people because she acts like an idiot. You also drop a mug and people for some reason think it's hilarous, I don't understand why.\n\n(Anyway how would she know that they call it a flat if she never speaks to anyone and sits in her room for 6 hours?)\n\n\nGameupray - 1/10\nThis is not a interactive story because the choice isn't there. You pick something wrong the girl gets hungry and then you pick the correct one. I only played it like once or twice and I got bored really quickly. There's a scene where you need to pick Oatmeal, pick the wrong one and she gets hungry. Why they decided to do this? I don't know.\n\nOverall - 1/10\nThis game has a bad to no story, an unlikable protagonist. An unlikable art and horrible music on the menu. Major/Minor was a better game than this because at least the main character had a somewhat likable personality. Telltale had better impact on choices even though it changed little scenes. You can't even unironicly hate this game because it's bad. I played like 20 minutes, maybe even less and I already experienced the whole game and got all of the "achivements". At this point im just ranting on about the game; just don't play it, it's not worth your time.","April 19","false","0.2"," 6 of 16 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","6","16","0","0"

Through a Visual Novel format, you are tasked with guiding a young lady with social anxiety (or horrific shyness as it was known in the past) to make porridge. The problem is that she has to use the communal kitchen to do it, which is where her anxiety almost fells her attempts to make "dinner".\n\nThere's only one small mar, in my opinion, which is the snarky comment she gives to the girls upon leaving the kitchen. 'You can have your precious kitchen back.' They weren't waiting to use it, they hadn't said anything. If the main character is unpleasant to others, she's hardly going to endear herself to her compatriots. A nice option would have been 'nod and smile' because sometimes you don't need to talk to communicate.\n\nAlso, it highlights how some young adults are thrust into solo living without being prepared for it. Also, would any of her neighbours help her if they knew she was struggling? A simple game about making porridge, less than an hour long, made me think about all these facets, and I really like that.\n\nThere are a good few endings here, and they show you how one little missed detail can ruin someone's evening.\n\nBut I think this is a brilliant start for the developer, and it takes the Visual Novel game style in a novel (forgive the pun) direction. I'd really like more of these sorts of games.","April 19","true","0.6"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

If you feel like having a cup of oatmeal, you could probably leave it standing next to you and it would be just the right temperature to eat by the time you are done with a playthrough.\nThat being said, it is a fun little game. Sure, it's not an epic quest to slay dragons, but it is an adventure in its own right - a quest of delicious oatmeal to ward off starvation for another day.\nThe sole goal of the game is leaving your room, making some oatmeal and getting back safely. But the long and perilous journey is where you see the strong side of the game. By the way of Samantha's thoughts you are presented with some of the things people with social anxiety might go through every day.\nIf you make it to the very end: congratulations, you might just have learned something, or gained a little insight - and be it only insight into how to make oatmeal.\nOne last thing: Don't forget your keys!","April 19","true","0.3"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","4"

I see other reviews on this criticizing and moaning that Samantha is a whiny baby, but I really appreciate how the writing captures social anxiety. I really likes this so much because when you have social anxiety, everything you do that involves or could involve people really seems like a quest, and I think it makes for a great set-up for a game. It makes me sad that the neg reviewers can't understand that Sam isn't just whining over nothing. It might seem like just going down the hall to make yourself food isn't a big deal at all, but that's the point: to some people, socially anxious people, it can be.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RX149Thomas/recommended/445130/","RX149Thomas","RX149Thomas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RX149Thomas/","51 products in account","A really bad visual novel (and that's even stretching the term visual novel because this has less content than most) where a mentally handicapped person shows us just how mentally handicapped they are and are unable to perform basic human tasks. How they even got into a university in the first place is a good question to ask considering they would have had to talk to many different people to even get into a school. So the entire premise of this "visual novel" isn't even believable.\n\nYour choices barely matter because most of the time you end up forced doing something according to the story narrative, which means this isn't much of a visual novel to begin with since the point of visual novels is to let players decide how the narrative goes, not how the narrative tells what the player to do.\n\nAlso the game is 115 MBs. Why? Surely file compression isn't that unheard of for these people, and they surely at least tried to compress the images and audio in the game, right? Nope. The images folder takes up around 56 MBs, and the audio 86 MBs. There are ways to compress these things without loss and they simply didn't even try. Sure, this seems like a weird thing to complain about, but optimization and efficiency should be a number one priority for developers of all kinds. This shows sloppiness and lack of dedication to the art of programming.\n\nAnd speaking of art the art is the blandest and most uninspired stuff I've ever seen. The art style is something nearly everybody has probably seen if you even glance at one of those advice books for teenage girls, or spend a few minutes on tumblr.\n\nTo be honest, as someone with anxiety disorder myself, this thing paints people like me in a terrible light, as if we're unable to even perform basic tasks like getting food without anguish. The entirety of this thing screams "first world problems", which is pretty pretentious and shallow.\n\nAll in all you're better off making your own oatmeal in real life. Put some extra cinnamon and sugar on it, it'll help wash way the bad taste of this "interactive story".","April 19","false","0.3"," 7 of 19 people (37%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","37","7","19","0","0"

And I enjoyed this game. It's really visually cute, short, and sweet. I'm disappointed in the negative reviews it's getting. People seem to be missing the mark on what this game is about. It's not about Samantha being "pretentious" or "quirky and awkward", it's about her having social anxiety, especially within communal living. I, for one, like how it doesn't blow this fact out of proportion and shove it down your throat. If you know what to look for, the game's theme is pretty clear and I think elegantly displayed by the devs. Having social anxiety, yes, every average day is an adventure, because the outcomes are never clear to the person experiencing it, while others can simply stroll through the average day without much fuss or insecurity.\n\nI would recommend a play, even just for the experience of something not everyone experiences.

It ended up being awfully writen, very bad dialogue and also, it made me extremely uncomfortable, like experiencing second hand embarrasment.\n\nThe main character, Samantha, seems to have some anxiety disorder, and i assume the game tried to make awareness of how it feels to have it, but it ended falling flat on it's face. Samantha comes off as overly whiny, very self centered, nasty and, at times, unnecessarily cruel to people around her. Her holier than thou atittude is cringeworthy, not to mention how ridiculous is that she apparently can't make oatmeal and much less, handle a microwave. Considering she's already a young adult, and had a box of instant oatmeal in her room, it's not far fetched to think she has made oatmeal before without hassle and suddenly seems to forget how to prepare instant food. She makes a very nasty remark to the girls talking in the kitchen, which makes Samantha seem like a very bitter woman for no reason at all, and made me uncomfortable.\n\nSpeaking about game mechanics, it's just ''option'' after option, even though you're supposed to be in control, the game (in certain occasions) will force you to chose what samantha wants and override what you wanted, it's not like you're doing much, most of the supposed options are useless (Samantha talking to herself, i guess) and the ones that matter are often overrided, as above. This tendency tends to ruin the experience, it doesn't feel like a game anymore, it feels like someone's vanity project (which it is, pretty much). Also the music it's very loud and there's no option to mute it.\n\nThe only good thing is the artstyle, it's pretty cute and easy on the eyes.","April 23","false","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As a narrative about social anxiety, it's reasonable; a lot better than many depictions found in games and television. It gives a basic rundown and is sympathetic to the character.\n\nI can certainly empathize; as a kid who grew up hiding assignment papers and computer screens from supervising teachers, I have some idea of how irrationally cautious and/or anxious everyday things can be to people with anxiety disorders. To this day, I still occasionally avoid kitchens when there are other people in them. I also tend to choose my seats in cafeterias carefully so I can either see anybody approaching, or hide myself eating, depending on whether I'm more self-conscious or anxious that day. I also don't fix hair or apply deodorant in washrooms if anybody else is present. Sometimes people will go great lengths to avoid ordinary facts of life.\n\nHonestly, while I appreciate the depiction of the character, the game itself defies one of the unspoken rules of interaction: if the player gets a game over, it should be their fault. In this game, many of the ways to fail come from seemingly unrelated decisions. Your first playthrough of the game is blind and you will probably fail by no fault of your own. In games that follow this rule like Dark Souls, failing is a consequence of poor decisions. In this game, seemingly innocuous and ordinary decisions carry severe consequences. I would say that this is the major failing of the game.\n\nAs far as this goes, I'm inclined not to recommend it as a game. It's a cutesy story to experience for 10 minutes, but navigating the multiple endings isn't all that rewarding when most of them are failures. This game is an obstacle course of torture dressed up in a vibrant oatmeal-coloured package. For the price of free, by all means play it, but it's about as interesting as one might find a new meme to be.\n\nBefore this review becomes longer than the game, I bid Adieu.\n\nEDIT: And why in the world does this need a 2 GHz processor!?

However, I can't recommend it as someone else who suffers from anxiety.\n\nThe "adventure" Samantha goes through really hits home to me, as I felt the exact same things on occasion.  I definitely have gone to bed without dinner because it was too painful to leave the comfort of my room.  However, some of the decisions really bothered me.  Some, such as the decision to pick what flavor packet you want, felt trite to me.  The fact that they were there (and like everything else, had consequences for picking the "wrong" answer) didn't settle.  The game itself is lovely, but it just felt wrong in my personal opinions to include consequences for what you feel.

After playing it, I can honestly tell you the graphics aren't so cute to make it worth playing. Spoilers ahead, but please don't let that deter you from reading. You'll live.\n\nI don't understand how this game has anything to do with anxiety or any psychological disorder. The only image resembling mental distress was the hallway blurring. The empty hallway. The protagonist got upset when people were in the kitchen, but it didn't blur her vision or have any effect. She just walked into the room like they weren't there. So... people are what she fears and dislikes the most, but they don't bother her as much as an empty hallway?\n\nThe game is full of these charming little inconsistencies.\n\nAt two points, you're forced to watch grass grow a kettle warming up to boil. There is a timer on the screen forcing you to wait until it's done. Then there's another timer while you're "cleaning." Of all the things one might've chosen to skip in game design, they didn't choose to skip these? It adds absolutely nothing to the experience.\n\nThere's more waiting as the game forces you to stir the oatmeal intermittently, so it doesn't overflow in the microwave. So you're handling the cup, which is presumably getting warmer and warmer? Yet somehow, when it's done, she burns her hands on the hot cup. SHE'S BEEN HANDLING IT THIS WHOLE TIME.\n\nThen you return to the room, only to discover that you've locked yourself out.\n\nThis is where we reach another charming example of game design: if you restart from a bad end, it brings you back to the point at which you're just exiting the room. At first I thought, oh great, I don't have to play through the whole intro again. WRONG. Wrooooong.\n\nThe intro is where you're given the decision to take your key. But if you get to a dead end, the game automatically brings you back to a point AFTER you could've made this choice. Unless you do a full restart, you're doomed to keep coming back to a locked door...\n\nThe game doesn't have a save option, or any way to easily return to a previous choice-fork. You have to replay it from the beginning each time. You'd think it's not a big deal, but try sitting through two counters of watching grass grow more than once...\n\nThis is the most pointless game I've ever played. It's not cathartic, insightful, or engaging. It's not even that visually attractive, which I thought would be a saving grace. The main character is a lazy, under-socialized, privileged jerk. It has nothing to do with anxiety, and it's offensive that it tries to portray itself as if it did.","April 24","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kitsunay34/recommended/445130/","kitsunay34","Kitsunay","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kitsunay34/","36 products in account","As a game, it's... not bad. As a narrative about social anxiety, it's reasonable; a lot better than many depictions found in games and television. It gives a basic rundown and is sympathetic to the character.\n\nI can certainly empathize; as a kid who grew up hiding assignment papers and computer screens from supervising teachers, I have some idea of how irrationally cautious and/or anxious everyday things can be to people with anxiety disorders. To this day, I still occasionally avoid kitchens when there are other people in them. I also tend to choose my seats in cafeterias carefully so I can either see anybody approaching, or hide myself eating, depending on whether I'm more self-conscious or anxious that day. I also don't fix hair or apply deodorant in washrooms if anybody else is present. Sometimes people will go great lengths to avoid ordinary facts of life.\n\nHonestly, while I appreciate the depiction of the character, the game itself defies one of the unspoken rules of interaction: if the player gets a game over, it should be their fault. In this game, many of the ways to fail come from seemingly unrelated decisions. Your first playthrough of the game is blind and you will probably fail by no fault of your own. In games that follow this rule like Dark Souls, failing is a consequence of poor decisions. In this game, seemingly innocuous and ordinary decisions carry severe consequences. I would say that this is the major failing of the game.\n\nAs far as this goes, I'm inclined not to recommend it as a game. It's a cutesy story to experience for 10 minutes, but navigating the multiple endings isn't all that rewarding when most of them are failures. This game is an obstacle course of torture dressed up in a vibrant oatmeal-coloured package. For the price of free, by all means play it, but it's about as interesting as one might find a new meme to be.\n\nBefore this review becomes longer than the game, I bid Adieu.\n\nEDIT: And why in the world does this need a 2 GHz processor!?

Things that you think are easy to achieve aren't as simple to Samantha because she doesn't have the ability to tolerate social instances that are commonly simple. Almost everything she does feels like the wrong thing to do (Simulating that she is worried about every little thing no matter what; which perfectly expresses her anxiety) so it causes her to slide into anger and bitterness with herself. Your job is to make choices that make her feel comforted with doing a daily task.\n\nThis game places the player inside of the mind of a young girl who tries to avoid social conflict. It's an almost perfect simulation, for people who don't suffer with social anxiety, to experience the worried thoughts that can cross their mind over simple matters. In this instance, Samantha overcomplicates cooking herself a small meal because she is worried what others think.\n\nIf you have never felt social anxiety, this is basically it. "Will they think I'm weird" "should I talk to them, or ignore them, but will that make them think I'm awkward?". It doesn't put in a lot of factors, but it comes surprisingly close; and at the low cost of .00 cents I'd say this is a good "purchase" for a few hours of interesting dialogue and beautiful scenery. I'm serious, the art is fantastic and simply cute, how can you NOT love this game. The music also rises perfectly in certain instances that can induce the player to feel anxiety while Samantha feels anxiety, and it lowers down to a softer tune when she is comforted by being alone. It's all-together absolutely perfect.\n\n(Some of the other reviews make an opinion that social anxiety doesn't force you to be angry, but they missed the point that Samantha isn't angry at others- she is angry with herself for not being able to do things without worrying, therefore making her interactions a bit detached. In the scene where Samantha says to the girls at the kitchen that they could have their precious kitchen back, she didn't actually say that, she merely thought it in her head. She isn't angry or bitter towards them, she's just annoyed that she didn't get a proper response from them. The proper response probably being to leave politely. Which is a perfect representation of social anxiety; she can't examine the fact that they probably don't think anything of her being in the kitchen, so she worries that they think she is weird. Then she becomes annoyed that they think she is weird. Most of the people making reviews haven't taken into consideration that other people react to social anxiety in different ways, so don't pay too much attention to their opinion if they don't recommend the game because it's "A bad representation of social anxiety".)\n\nThanks for reading and I hope you enjoy the game as much as I do!","May 15","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also, Samantha reminds me a lot of myself--painfully shy and awkward. I could totally see myself doing/saying half the things she does in this game x'D Lastly, I really like the art style, it's really cute C: All in all, I'd say this game deserves 6 spoons out of 10 ^-^","June 3","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is literally about making oatmeal... how is that a good gameplay idea?  I don't want to be OVERLY negative, but the art isn't the best and some sound effects seem lazy.  I won't deny that I found the idea original, but I give this game a 3/10.  There are so many other great free games, like TF2 or Dota 2, and this specific one isn't really worth getting.","June 5","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
