"http://steamcommunity.com/id/StubbieTheZombie/recommended/12200/","StubbieTheZombie","Stubbs","http://steamcommunity.com/id/StubbieTheZombie/","102 products in account","Bully. It's GTA, but without blood and deadly weapons, and instead of playing as an adult man, you play as Jimmy Hopkins. A 15 year old kid who's aggressive and a fighter, but not truly malicious. He only gives people what they have coming to them.\n\nBully takes place in Bullworth, a town in New England. Your mom, well, Jimmy's mom, drops you off at Bullworth Academy. A boarding school. The school is full of bullies and corrupt teachers and it's up to you to put a stop to it.\n\nThe game's storyline will guide you through six chapters (There are 65 missions, the sixth chapter is an endless free-roam chapter, giving you the chance to complete non-storyline missions and to collect collectables.) Each of them takes place in a different weather season. The missions vary, it's never the same. One time you're cleaning a rat infested library and the next time you're helping a teacher escape from a psychiatric hospital. As Jimmy, your main goal is to bring peace to the school by helping and befriending the five school cliques: The Nerds, the Jocks, the Bullies and the Preppies.\n\nOf course you'll have to go to class. These classes are: English, gym, geography, math (ew), music, shop, art, photography and biology. They are simple mini-games which become noticeably harder every time you attend them and make progress. You'll also have to deal with a time schedule. You can skip class, but you won't get any rewards if you do so and prefects will chase you down and send you back to class if they catch you.\n\nJimmy, your character, is highly customizable. You can buy clothes, change your hairstyle and more. You can even buy a bike, a go-kart or a scooter if you save up enough cash. Money can be earned by either taking a paper route, doing missions for townies or students or by completing storyline missions.\n\nYou've got weapons. No, they are not guns and no you can't kill people. There's a super slingshot, you can use firecrackers, stink bombs, eggs, a bag of marbles, a bottle rocket launcher and so much more. You can also pick up one of the many objects around you (umbrella's, vases, bottles) and use them as a weapon.\n\nInteracting with your fellow students is fun too. You can talk to them, give cute presents, put them in trash bins or lockers, steal their books, take their pictures for the yearbook, punch them in their faces (aka bully them) and if you feel like it you can make out with a girl or a guy.\n\nThe game has a very impressive map size. You can explore the entire school, the school grounds, the town, a fully functional theme park, an industrial park and a few more awesome places. There are many collectables scattered around the map too.\n\nBully may be pretty good, but it's not perfect. The graphics are rather outdated, the sound isn't that amazing, the controls are a bit clunky at first and there are some bugs. But don't worry! It doesn't kill the fun. Bully is an amazing game and there's much to do. And for only $14.99 - £9.99 - €9.99, it's certainly worth it.\n\nI highly recommend this game.\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/12200","November 4, 2013","true","51.1"," 1,249 of 1,305 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","249","1","0","26"

You may not relate excatly to Jimmy but you will relate to him more than John Marston or any GTA character. Also the level of customization is something I havent really seen in any other Rockstar games, making Jimmy your Jimmy and interesting.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/captaintempest/recommended/12200/","captaintempest","CaptainTempest","http://steamcommunity.com/id/captaintempest/","218 products in account","One of the best sandbox-style games I've ever played! Bully beautifully weaves tweaked Grand Theft Auto gameplay with the universally relatable life story of young Jimmy Hopkins. The setting of a fictional New England boarding school and the nearby town of Bullworth are perfect for this kind of story, following Jimmy as he faces the same challenges that every kid faces growing up, like keeping up with schoolwork, fighting back against bullies, experiencing your first kiss, causing chaos through pranks and hijinks, and finding acceptance between various cliques and social groups.\n\nThe writing is brilliant, supplying a colorful cast of characters, missions, and story arcs. Including Jimmy himself, all of the NPCs seem practically handcrafted with the amount of personality and detail put into them. Each character has a unique model, and their own unique set of dialogues and animations. On top of these fantastically created characters, the plot is just as good. I was immersed into a world that I could have sworn was from an 80's Hollywood flick, drawing inspiration from coming-of-age tales like those of Sixteen Candles, The Breakfast Club, and Catcher in the Rye. With such a wonderfully realistic world full of jocks, preps, nerds, and other odd townfolk, I almost wish that my own school days growing up were as interesting as those of Bullworth Academy.\n\nThe gameplay is just as entertaining, using similar mechanics to GTA, such as a wanted system (called Truancy, of course), a combat system filled with a diverse array of punches, throws, and weapons at your disposal, different vehicles, mini-games, and other various activities and collectibles for completionists. As usual, there are missions given by various NPCs, some advancing the main story, and others being small side activities. Camera angles can be strange at times, but I've never experienced any gamebreaking issues with it. Overall, the gameplay has enough variance where it doesn't get too repetitive, and it strikes a nice balance that makes it both interesting and easy to pick up.\n\nCompared to other open-world games, Bully is by far my favorite. One of the few titles I've been compelled to complete 100%. If you're looking for something different in the same vein of games such as Grand Theft Auto, Saints Row, and the like, I highly recommend looking into Bully: Scholarship Edition. You won't be disappointed.","August 18, 2014","true","29.9"," 178 of 188 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","178","188","0","0"

You play as a 15 year old thug of a kid named Jimmy Hopkins in this third person open world beat-em-up. Sure you get plenty of weapons like the slingshot, eggs, stink bombs that prevent enemies from attacking, firecrackers, a potato cannon and even a bottle rocket launcher, but you'll be spending most of your time brawling. The game is Bully, but you're more of an avenging angel. Sticking up for the weak, but following missions from pervert teachers, and the local crazies. Its the characters in Bully that really make the game stand shoulder to shoulder with Grand Theft Auto games. There is also plenty to do outside of the story missions. Bike races, collect-a-thons, arcade games that are worthy of their own games, classes that are really mini games that will unlock things for you and even a camera so you can take photos of every dumb thing you'll see. Instead of mayhem and murder like the GTA franchise, Bully is more of criminal mischief and knocking people unconscious. You don't even brutally win fights, enemies just fall over. You can finish them off with a childish noogie, putting them in a headlock and spitting on them or one of the many other silly ways.\n\nThe game plays similar to Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas meets the Warriors. You have jump and run buttons. An attack that you can hold for a strong attack. A target lock on for projectile weapons. If you don't have one equipped, it becomes a block button when you're not attacking. A free aim button for your sling shots, eggs and so on. A grapple button for when enemies block. You can shove someone when grappled. A taunt button that you can also take them down if grappled. Its a nice simple combat system. A local bum will teach you better attacks when you find and bring him radio parts. Your wrestling coach will teach you grapples in class. The items in your inventory are easy to select on the fly. You can also pick up things like bats and bricks to use and throw. You can even make peace by talking or bribing your way out of things. When you need health, just drink a soda or find some food.\n\nThe game is broken up into chapters, the first chapter takes place exclusively in the academy, but chapter two opens the gates and lets you into the rich side of town. Chapter three unlocks the poor side of town and chapter five unlocks a large industrial side of town. There's not only a sense of progression from parts of the town opening up, but the game takes place over a year and you'll see the seasons change. You'll participate in Halloween, slide around in the winter and see spring return.\n\nEach chapter focuses on a faction and there are plenty of them. Nerds in green, bullies in white, greasers in leather jackets, preps in aqua berry and jocks in blue. Each faction has their own turf at the academy, and outside the academy as well. There are even factions outside of academy that will rise against you. All factions have a respect level for you. The less respect, the more likely the members will chase after you wanting a fight! Story missions will always change a faction's respect for you. Sometimes a little, sometimes a lot.\n\nSince this is an open world game you'll be doing a lot of traveling. The main way is by foot. You need to mash the run button to go fast. The enemies all run as fast as you do, but luckily they have stamina and Jimmy doesn't. You quickly unlock a skateboard that sits in your inventory. Its much quicker, but can't go upstairs without a sweet jump or over muddy terrain. There are also bikes, but the bikes feel few and far between. You can throw someone off a bike and steal it, or you can buy a bike, but then it sits in a garage, making it useless when you need to visit a garage in town when you're at the school most of the time. Other than that, you can ride lawn mowers and mopeds. It all feels like a balance. To get speed you button mash. If you're on a lawn mower you're stuck going slower than walking. If you're on a moped you need a helmet or the cops will be after you.\n\nSpeaking of laws, there are plenty. You have typical laws against violence, but there are also truancy and curfew laws too. The game lets you know what your offense is on a three step 'wanted' level. When your wanted level hits red, then you can't struggle against the authorities. When they catch you that's it. On campus there are perfects, that act like the police. They'll bring you to class if you're truant, chase you for a dress code violation like wearing a chicken head and stop you from bullying. Sometimes them bringing you to class is more efficient than running to it. When you're in violation, you'll see not only the authorities highlighted on the mini map, but their vision cones. The game makes use of stealth on some missions, but for the most part, its just avoiding the gaze of the cops and perfects. You can even hide in lockers, the trash or dressers in the girl's dorm.\n\nThe game is really set to a timetable that can sometimes break the flow. You wake up in the morning and have two classes in the day. You need to find a bed to sleep and if it gets too late, Jimmy will fall asleep where he is and wake up the next day. You can skip classes, but then the authorities will be after you. I felt stuck and forced to partake in the mini games. I want to point out that the class mini games are entertaining and some are educational, but having them forced upon you when I'm trying to do a mission seems a bit much. You can learn things from the game. Such as the flags to different countries in geography, a boggle like make a word with letters in English and even how to dissect animals in biology. I'm not saying this will replace schools by any means. There are also typical timed button press mini games that are less impressive. The game offers a wide array of mini games, even games that parody other games, such as Paperboy, Punch Out and dodge ball! There are even random people that will give you side jobs, like throw 3 nerds in lockers, deliver 3 fries, collect 5 crabs, and so on. All fluff.\n\nThe money feels useless. You can spend it on weapons, but why bother when he has an arsenal in his dorm room from completing mini games? There are expensive clothes to buy and tattoos, but why bother other than for cosmetic reasons? Sometimes the game forces you to dress a certain way or get your hair done at the barber shop. You can't buy real estate, even if you can clear out a gang hideout to make it a new save point safe house.\n\nThere are dozens of characters in the game. In fact every random person has a name and schedule. You can even take pictures of all of them for the yearbook. Most of the characters are downright evil with a few exceptions. Garry, the over the top villain with an eye scar that lies to cause trouble. Petey, the short effeminate best friend. The drunk Santa. The alcoholic English teacher. The two timing dame that uses men. Russell the big dullard so dumb he calls himself Russell. Its all done in a tongue in cheek 1950s stereotype. The game feels very 1950s even with its awful happy beach guitar riffs. It didn't take me long to turn turn the music down to 10%.\n\nI managed to sink around 17 hours into this game, but I've gotta be honest, I wanted to be done a long time ago. I just spend too much time traveling and wasting too much time doing mini games. At some point I stopped going to class just so I could grind through the missions efficiently. Then the missions started getting further and further. Consuming more precious time that Jimmy is awake during the day. Doing missions back to back so late just means that Jimmy would fall asleep on the street. There are also a few game breaking bugs that would cause the game to freeze or downright crash. Not frequent, but at specific points. I still recommend the game for an open world mischief sandbox that lets you do wedgies, throw firecrackers in toilet and slap kick me signs on people, then watch them get beat to a pulp.","January 8, 2015","true","17.7"," 156 of 172 people (91%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","91","156","172","16","3"

From a game back in 2006-2008 days it's not surprising though.\n\nThis game is very fun, it's refereshing compared to GTA, imagine GTA instead of Guns you have sling shots and stink bombs, and instead of car jacking you have bikes and skate boards.\n\nThe game is rich and very open world later on in the seasons of the game.\n\nThere are many fun interesting missions in the game just like GTA.\n\nThe premise of the game is a troubled kid was sent to a reeform school and is forced to take over and unite the school, removing all the "Clicks".\n\nEach season involves a click, from the bulies to nerds, to preps, its a long fun game that is well worth the money.\n\nThis falls under the old GTA system that requires a save after the missions no check points are really there, so failing a mission at the end means re-doing the entire mission.\n\nMusic used is fitting along with the sound effects.\n\nThis has controller support for the 360 and Xbox One as well.\n\nGraphically speaking this is the best version but its still aged, however pretty good for its time.\n\nOverall I would say definitely worth the money.

Think of it as a sort of GTA, but as a school. Sure, you don't jack cars and bang some hookers, but you do ride around on a radical skateboard and shove fat kids into lockers.\n\nPros: +Pretty good graphics, overall.\n+The classes (minigames) are totally awesome! Scholarship Edition adds some new ones, like Geography.\n+You never see ANY duplicated NPC's standing next to each other. Completely awesome.\n+Tons of depth. Every single NPC has a name. ALL OF THEM.\n+The characters are bright and colorful. Everyone loves Mr. Galloway, and everyone hates Mr. Hattrick.\n+The storyline is great! I love it, and it was very carefully written.\n+You can kiss girls (and boys, if you're into that) for health, which really gives an authentic high school feel.\n+RADICAL SOUNDTRACK! Shawn Lee is a beast!\n+Very lively city and school. You can see people getting chased down by cops/prefects, random fights, some kids pulling pranks. Very alive.\n\nSadly, with every game, there are cons. -Nerd Challenge for me is truly frustrating, as ConSumo is kinda difficult.\n-Frame rate is only capped to 30 frames.\n-Cameraman is obviously on drugs, as sometimes the camera freaks out. I literally failed a mission,  Comic Klepto,  just because the camera went spontaneously and very quickly kept flipping back and forth, left to right. I crashed into a wall and failed the mission. All within 20 seconds. Camera is a little janky.\n-Once you're done with all the classes, missions, and have everyone's respect to 100, it kinda feels bland and empty.\n-Having low/negative respect with a clique can get pretty annoying, as they always pummel you wherever you are.\n-Prefects will constantly yell at you for being tardy to class, even if it's 1 second (in game minute) off.\n\nBully, gets a  8/10!\n\nDefinitely worth picking up. Get it now!","May 4, 2015","true","14.0"," 61 of 63 people (97%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","97","61","63","3","3"

His mother and step father goes on a honeymoon leaving Jimmy to attend the Bullworth acedamy, meeting a kid named Gary who wants the school all to himself and of course hes gonna use you for his plan. Overall this game is great The combat feels smooth and the gun combat does feel smooth. The only real problems i found were sometimes the controls felt a bit stiff and the sound issues do ruin the game a bit. The game also has bonus collectibels, side quest, classes to go to, drivable bikes and skateboards and many more things in the world of Bully. Overall this game is fantastic just a few minor glitches but definatly you need this game in youre collection i give Bully 8.5/10\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","September 29, 2013","true","15.6"," 108 of 136 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","108","136","0","0"

One of the few sandboxes that I've actually finished.\n\nBully takes place in the town of Bullworth in New England, possibly in 1970-1980s. That's never been made clear but nevermind. You're a boy that's basically dumped into this boarding school by your mother. You have to gain respect among your new mates while avoiding getting to trouble with the teachers. Basically GTA with criminals replaced by nerds, jocks, greasers and rich inbreds and police replaced by teachers, but there's more.\n\nThe town itself is also part of the game world and it offers the player lots of optional missions and some larger story missions also take partly place there. Every day you have lessons according to your curriculum and it's up to you if you are to attend those or just play hooky, go have fun and risk the punishment. The lessons provide you some nice bonuses upon completion (especially chemistry), so it pays to take the classes and if you're quick, you have time to go downtown at the end of the day anyway.\n\nThe game is heavily story-driven, but it's a fun experience and you do have all the time in the world to grind yourself silly before advancing the story if that's your idea of fun. Only the end felt a bit rushed and way too much of wish-fulfillment fantasy, but it isn't a deal-breaker. Bully is a very fun romp that feels like a game version Animal House, if Animal House took place in a boarding school instead of university. The game also reminded me somewhat of the old Jennings book series, if that is at all familiar.\n\nBully is frequently on sale and for a couple of bucks/euros you really can't go wrong if you like sandbox games at all. The game is a console port, but it works fairly well. The controls may seem weird at first if you're using keyboard, but they're easy and responsive once you get used to them.","December 17, 2013","true","31.6"," 69 of 83 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","69","83","0","1"

For example, Bully is a open world with stuff to collect, bike races to do, arcade games to play and much more to just find and explorer. The mission structure is very similar to GTA, you do a bunch of work for one of the factions, like the Jocks or the Nerds, and the more you do with them, the more reputation you gain, which in turn effects how other people treat you around campus.\n\nThe combat is also very similar to GTA, but instead of machine guns and rocket lunches, you are playing with slingshots and stink bombs.\n\nThere are also lots of things different about Bully that really makes it feel like you are back in high school. It feels very structured, but that's not a bad thing at all. You have classes two times a day everyday until you pass the highest level of that class. All of the classes have their own perks, for instance, completing one class will show you where all of the collectibles are on the map.\n\nUnlike the protagonists in GTA, Jimmy is 15 and needs his sleep, so if you are out past 2AM, you just pass out on the spot which can make some nigh missions feel a little too time restrictive but adds to the challenge.\n\nI did't have any technical issues with Bully like a lot of people complain about on this port. Overall the game is well made but parts of it seem kind of repetitive, but I still think this is a fantastic game.","December 10, 2013","true","24.9"," 83 of 105 people (79%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","79","83","105","4","2"

One of the many differences with GTA and this game is that instead of having deadly weapons you'll get weapons to prank and bully every kid in the block, the violent is toned-down too which is quite understandable since the game is set in a school setting.\n\nThe game takes place at the fictional New England boarding school, Bullworth Academy and tells the story of mischievous 15-year-old Jimmy Hopkins as he goes through the hilarity and awkwardness of adolescence. Beat the jocks at dodge ball, play pranks on the preppies, save the nerds, kiss the girl and ultimately navigate the social hierarchy in the worst school around.\n\nBully is divided between six chapters and many different missions which takes place in certain weather season much like Mafia II. As Jimmy Hopskins, a 15 year old mean bully, you are free to roam around the school or complete your classes like what normal student do or do what you do best, skip class and bully.\n\nThere is no denying that the game is a console port but a well-made one. The controls is a bit weird but you'll get to it eventually once you get used to them. The game is a bit repititive but that's just a minor problem I had with the game.","February 20, 2014","true","6.5"," 56 of 67 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","56","67","0","1"

You play in third-person as Jimmy Hopkins, a scrappy, teenager who attends Bullworth Academy, a school of bullies. You join and fight for different groups such as; Jocks, Preppies, and Nerds, and complete missions and objectives  to help bring peace to the various factions within the school, as well as the town of Bullworth itself. The story is interesting and portrays Jimmy as a protagonist and at times antagonist as well. Bullworth is a fictional town, which is supposed to exist somewhere in the Rockstar created Grand Theft Auto Universe.\n\nThe game comes with a single player mode, competitive multiplayer, as well as various mini-games. The Scholarship Edition uses a newer game engine than the original, and feels a lot like a GTA game at times. Graphically speaking, it is a 2008 game, so it's 8-years-old right now, and it looks like it, but it is still fun to play. The PC port feels different than the original PS2 version, and seems a little off, but that could just be because of the different engine used on the port. It's still a fun game and if you enjoyed the original, you should enjoy the PC Port as well.","January 1","true","2.6"," 44 of 49 people (90%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","90","44","49","12","0"

It is Rockstar's most unappreciated game. It is brilliantly paced, has excellent writing, has surprisingly solid gameplay mechanics, looks decent for its age and has great characters and voice acting. It's splashed with Rockstar Games humour, and is more than mini-GTA.\n\nHowever, the PC version is a poor port. The PC controls are a mess, so you need a a game controller to have effective control in all situations. It's also locked at 30 FPS by default, although there is a crack that removes the frame limiter, but to use this, you need another method of keeping the frame rate below 60FPS, or else it will run too fast.\n\nAnd after all of that effort, if you have a new system, during some instances of running the game, it will stutter, and nothing can stop the stuttering other than restarting until you get lucky. My old system got had zero stutter after Patch 1.2, and the 60FPS fan patch, but my new, more powerful system almost always stutters, I have to restart and restart until it decides to not stutter. It can run with no stutter, but it's a matter of luck.\n\nBecause of this, I recommend buying it on console, specifically XBOX 360 or Wii for the additional content that is also on the PC version. This game is worth playing, but the efforts to optimise the game on PC are terrible.\n\nThis is a modern classic, but the awful porting drags the entire package.","June 22, 2014","false","25.4"," 286 of 488 people (59%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","59","286","488","3","24"

This game oozes character, charm and is an absolute classic by Rockstar Games, the lords of open world games such as GTA III, Vice City and San Andreas. The gameplay is fast, satisfying and the environment of Bullworth Academy and surrounding areas is seamless and very well constructed. The world is a perfect size and travelling on your skateboard or bike feels smooth and enjoyable without feeling like a chore at all. The soundtrack in Bully is simply sensational. I have almost 25 hours in the game and I still hear new tracks that come up in different missions and they capture the mood perfectly. The graphics aren't entirely horrible for a 10 year old game either - it has native 1440p support and there are excellent guides that help you remove the 30fps cap and add nice graphical overhauls like SweetFX. Crashes can happen although I didn't have many. Save when you can! Definitely a must play for any Rockstar enthusiasts or fans of old school open world games such as Psychonauts.

The controls are very clunky and counterintuitive at times, which is sorta to be expected from a Rockstar game ported to PC. Expect to tap the Alt key quite a bit to run. The game might get a little buggy at times, like getting stuck getting on bikes or in cutscenes. For some reason there's a 30 FPS cap, but there's a modded version of the .EXE that raises it to a nice smooth 60 FPS. But some missions get bugged in the 60 FPS version, which is annoying. That's the bad stuff.\n\nNow the GOOD stuff: Pretty much everything else. The in-game universe is very lively; no two students or people look exactly alike (even though you may see them repeat inexplicably), and they all have different personalities and voice actors. You get everything you'd expect out of a game that lets you play as a bully at school: wedgies, Chinese burns, stuffing peope in lockers, swirlies, "Kick Me" signs, stink bombs, you name it. There's a decently sized open town to explore outside the school as you progress, and a nice selection of weapons to unlock as you go. Once you get the hang of the controls, the combat is fun and satisfying. But I think the best thing about this game is all the awesome music you'll hear. The game even comes with the soundtrack. A good game overall, priced reasonably well, and definitely worth checking out.","November 30, 2013","true","63.3"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","20","25","0","3"

It doesn't quite have the length or scope as a Grand Theft Auto game but I think what it offers fits the style of game.\n\nThe porting job is really bad. And at times it almost makes it unplayable. The controls are very awkward to use. It's hard to target someone when you're trying to fight them. The mouse becomes way too responsive when you try to move the camera during certain activities like riding a bike. And the mini games in class are often cumbersome when using a keyboard. If you think you can't get over these problems then this game is probably not for you.

The PC port isn't that great: a controller is highly recommended for playing, but if you have one you shouldn't encounter any serious problems.\n\nThere is a very good variety in missions, keeping things from becoming stale. The combat is still fun, though not difficult, but the game doesn't lean on it too hard. The developers used their imagination not just for mission objectives, but also for the mechanics you'll use to accomplish them. There is very little one-and-done, with the developers instead first introducing you to concepts to make sure you know how to use them when the missions come along.\n\nThe school and the surrounding towns are very fun to explore, which is important to a sandbox. Each area has a distinct feel to it, and there are plenty of routes and vehicles to get around on. Customizing Jimmy's outfit is executed well, with a good selection of sensible outfits and zany articles of clothing to make an outfit to suit whatever mood you happen to be in. It would be better if you could store more than one custom outfit at a time, and scroll through the articles of clothing more quickly, but the end result is still great.\n\nI very much recommend Bully.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jadarma/recommended/12200/","Jadarma","Jadarma","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jadarma/","267 products in account","Overview:\nBully is a not so famous game from Rockstars repertoir, where you take the role of a teenager Jimmy Hopkins as he is transfered against his will at Bullworth Academy, after being abandoned by his mother as she goes in her honeymoon with her new husband. Labeled by many as "GTA, but in High School", and I can see why that happened. You could make connections between the two concepts, such as street gands being replaced by student factions, and you being free to cause as much mischief as you want, stealing cars becomes stealing bikes and so on. While this is an old game and unfortunately a not that well polished console port, it certainly has that Rockstar imprint on it and it is a worthwhile experience.\n\nThe Pros: Open World - The game features a small, but spacious town full of things to do, customizations to get, items to collect and so much more. All this while respecting the school schedule or suffering the concequences. You are also free to cause problems, fix them, just have fun or romancing with the ladies.\n\nCharacter Development and Great NPCs - I always expected from Rockstar this kind of character progression and NPCs. You start out as a social outcast, who hates everybody and eventually build your way up the social ladder and become everyones favorite. About the NPC's some would say they are quite bland and exagerated, though I think that was exactly what the developers aimed at.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jadarma/recommended/12200/","Jadarma","Jadarma","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jadarma/","267 products in account","Overview:\nBully is a not so famous game from Rockstars repertoir, where you take the role of a teenager Jimmy Hopkins as he is transfered against his will at Bullworth Academy, after being abandoned by his mother as she goes in her honeymoon with her new husband. Labeled by many as "GTA, but in High School", and I can see why that happened. You could make connections between the two concepts, such as street gands being replaced by student factions, and you being free to cause as much mischief as you want, stealing cars becomes stealing bikes and so on. While this is an old game and unfortunately a not that well polished console port, it certainly has that Rockstar imprint on it and it is a worthwhile experience.\n\nThe Pros: Open World - The game features a small, but spacious town full of things to do, customizations to get, items to collect and so much more. All this while respecting the school schedule or suffering the concequences. You are also free to cause problems, fix them, just have fun or romancing with the ladies.\n\nCharacter Development and Great NPCs - I always expected from Rockstar this kind of character progression and NPCs. You start out as a social outcast, who hates everybody and eventually build your way up the social ladder and become everyones favorite. About the NPC's some would say they are quite bland and exagerated, though I think that was exactly what the developers aimed at.

Rockstar Vancouver created a unique world where attending classes and spending time with your roommates and girlfriends is more important than owning a city or harassing opposing operations. By playing Bully you will have the chance to reminisce stories from your own childhood / school years. Of course, there are strong similarities to other Rockstar titles, but give the game a chance before judging it too harshly.\n\n+Narrative: From zero to school's most recognizable figure, our hero will rise to success through a clever script filled with some bold ideas. The game is divided into chapters with different events, weather conditions and rising adversaries.\n\n+Characters: A believable protagonist, an elite school, a carnival full of freaks, a drunk homeless Santa, Bullworth has them all. In addition to the town, Bullworth Academy is a bustling community housing different factions: from the dorky nerds and perverted teachers to the strict prefects and snooty cheerleaders. Some of them serve as companions, possible love interests or even chapter bosses!  Many of the characters will affect Jimmy's road to the riches in numerous ways. Feel free to run the rest over with yourscooter.\n\n+Rock around the clock: Bully features a time-based world. Different quests or characters may appear depending on the time so stay alert at all times. Just remember to return at your dormitory before 2:00 am lest you fall asleep on the pavement!\n\n+I own you: Feel free to expand around town and own different places. These save spots function aptly as bases for sleeping or hiding from the authorities.\n\n+I'm out of powder: Unique weaponry that suits Bully's atmosphere. Itching powder with a notorious stun effect, slingshot for taking care of business from afar, even a bottle rocket launcher for throwing... ehh... deadly glass at your enemies!\n\n+Know your body: Throughout the game you will have the opportunity of attending classes. They are not mandatory but passing them will grant you useful skills such as secret revelation on map or persuasion of girlfriends in order to... increase your overall vitality by 100% . Feel the power of love, baby.\n\n+Watch the trilby, boy: Many clothes to customize Jimmy with. Dress him like an elf, Christopher Columbus or mafia leader. Afterwards, pay a visit to the barber shop for taking care of that big head of yours.\n\n+Those yellow spots: Except for classes and random mayhem you will also have to complete quests in order to advance the game. I found the majority of them entertaining, novel and of normal difficulty. In addition to the main challenges, Bully features side quests and secrets scattered around town offering unique prizes: Lawn mowing, protecting nerds harassed by bullies, even cart racing.\n\n+Murder on the dance floor: Instead of songs or radio stations, Bully features different instrumental themes fitting for each occasion. Example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Rtrxf22ls\n+Length: Neither to long for gamers who get bored easily nor too short for those who cherish free roaming and secret hunting.\n\n+Full controller support\n\nWeaknesses\n-Jimmy is a beast: He possesses unlimited stamina, accuracy prowess and herculean strength. Kidding aside, you can run without having to stop to take a breath. I do not find it as a major weakness but certainly drops the difficulty a bit for some gamers.\n\n-”Adrian, I did it!”: You can still finish the game without passing any classes. This takes one of the strongest parts of Bully away, so invest some time on them just to fill more of a student and less of a petty criminal.\n\n-You missed a spot: I found out that a few quests are permanently lost if end-chapter missions are finished prior to them. Always make at least two save spots if you are a completionist.\n\n-Problematic adaptation: Before publishing this review, I played the original Bully on my PS2 to compare it to this version. Although Scholarship edition is an accurate port, many players complain about the frame rate being locked at 30 frames per second. I finished the game with no mods installed, on Windows 8.1 and I did not experience a single crash. Nevertheless, whether you experience any bugs or you just want to unlock the frame rate, there are mods to aid you.\n\nMy rating5/5\nDuring the Playstation 2 era certain games suffered from weak or limited advertising and weren't known to a broader audience. Glass Rose, Bully, Shadow of memories and Okami  are among them. Bully: Scholarship edition is an entertaining game with a novel plot in a notorious and addicting universe. Feel free to check it out whether you are an open world enthusiast or a casual gamer looking for some fun.","May 7, 2015","true","42.9"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","5"

And being a naughty little Jimmy will get you to do chores.\nBully's story is deep and great. It has some crude humor and some small laughs that make this game a gem.

I would often come home and play this game to take out my aggression. It felt REALLY good beating up some fat nerds, and even better beating up some dumb jocks, like the ones that beat me up. Although to be fair, they only beat my up because they were jealous of me and my SMOKING hot GF who had big boobies (she weighed 450 pounds, mostly because of boobage) and they would call me stuff like "Gay", "Weak", "Pony loving ♥♥♥♥♥♥" because sometimes I wore my super cool 20% cooler rainbow dash T. The jocks also called me a dumb gay ♥♥♥♥ because I would wear super-awesome-supreme-ultimate-ninja shirts like Naruto or some super-cool-awesome-beat-em-up Attack on Titan T shirts. One day I went home, and asked miku what I should do. She said I should challange them to a dance off. Long story short, I won. the dumb jocks cheated and tried to beat me up instead of dancing because of their super inferior dance moves, and their inability to pull off a fedora.\nAnyway, I'm a lot stronger now because I've been drinking a lot of diet coke (so im also skinnier) because I use to drink a lot of regular coke.\nGood game, I'd recommend it, especially to all of you enlightened by your own intelligence.","March 14, 2014","true","1.2"," 47 of 83 people (57%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","57","47","83","3","13"

Thanks to Rockstar!!!\n\nI recommend it to everyone who likes open world games, can play in third person perspective and who would like to try something new. Bully brings many hours of fun as you go through main story missions and some optional side missions. You can attend lessons at Bullworth Academy to unlock some extra items or skills.\n\nI really like how they made intro videos before start of story missions.They are very interesting to watch and if you fail some missions you are able to skip intros. I like how the story involves several groups of students - Bullies, Nerds, Preppies, Greasers and Jocks.\n\nIn Bully it matters in which period of the day are you doing your missions. It will be necessary not to be seen by authorities at times you should attend your lessons or at the nighttime. Don't forget to be in bed latest at 2 or.. I won't tell you what ;) No spoilers!\n\nLater on you can explore different areas, play mini games, bike race, swim, fight, have romantic relationships and kiss girls and more!\n\nEven though Bully: Scholarship Edition is one of my favourite open world games, I want to point at some cons. The game was impossible to play&enjoy with mouse and keyboard. With controller it's simply perfect! The second thing I don't like is the system of saving player's progression. You are not able to save when you have a mission running and it's possible to save only after finding a save book. The concept wouldn't be that bad, if the game was actually stable and wouldn't crash very often. But in the current state, it can be very disturbing.\n\n* * * RECOMMENDED * * * Now it's time to give us a sequel, Rockstar! :)","October 6, 2015","true","31.5"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","7","8","2","0"

Jimmy must gain the control of the cliques to become the king of the school, and does so through many ways, though primarily fighting. At the end of each chapter, there is a boss fight with a clique leader. When he defeats the leader, he gains the respect of that clique. Overall the game is very fun and worth a recommend, but it is warned that the game crashes a lot on Windows 10.\n\nPros:\nVery fun\nGood story\nAll the characters are unique, with their own fighting styles, appearances, and personalities\n6 different cliques\nCool weapons\nBikes!Cons\nVery easy\nThe game world is small, even though he transportation is much slower then GTA, the size is not proportional to a GTA game\nLocked at 30fps (can easily be fixed through here https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=121093956)\nCrashing problem on Windows 10","May 2","true","57.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","6"

It has the bugs and problems like all Rockstar games, but then you look past them because you are a Bully.\n\nYou get to do things that you normally do not think about in a game, you kinda get a free roam where you get go karts, bikes etc and ride around the local town terrorising so that part is enjoyable.\n\nThe way the game goes about the classes feel like a mini game in the game, so the design is good.\n\nI would actually like to see an updated version of Bully, like a Bully 2 with some nice graphics would be nice.\n\nWould I recommend this game?

If you are willing to deal with a GTA San Andreas engine from the original xbox during game play however, will be a whole different story.\n\nThe game starts out with you being a delinquent coming from a step-father sort of relationship. You get dropped off at this academy for behavioral correction and your journey starts there.\n\nThroughout completing the story, you are able to acquire new sort of weapons or skills (such as dynamite or a strong uppercut). When fighting, the player is able to make fun of that person. I'm not one for violence but when I got swung at by a jock I kept kicking and making fun of him while he was down. When not in combat options to down talk or up talk someone is also available. There are requirements to go to class and perform quick time events. Some classes or learning new knowledge allows the bully player to unlock more. When running around at night time or when engaging in a fight, supervisor teachers are around and will make it a case to chase you down if you cause enough ruckus.\n\nThe graphics are alright and will keep a veteran gamer happy as one grew up without HD. This may bug some to a point and may lead to a person putting down the game sooner rather than later.\n\nI like the game, but since it is bit out dated and having played more than my fair share of GTA's since the first I'll have to rate it is an average :\n\n7.1/10\n\nEDIT : Upon playing it more, I'm starting to play it simply for the experience (duhhh) but it's turning out to be quite enjoyable. Problem is I'm friends with a bunch of nerds and all the bullies want a piece of me.","March 6, 2015","true","2.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

It's been eight years since Scholarship Edition was released and the issues are still here.\n\nYou might not suffer from the god-awful glitches, but your game will crash unexpectedly a lot.\n\nI looked up so many different techniques and solutions to avoid getting your game crashed. I've tried them all, and there's always this small sense of panic and dread just waiting for the game to crash at any minute after trying the latest solution, and it never dissapoints in that regard!\n\nIt's a damn shame. For lots, Steam may be their only way to get to experience the greatness that is Bully, and while it is possible to finish the game's campaign on the constantly-crashing PC port, it will be a long, uphill battle to do so, and it shouldn't be that way.\n\nGreat game, awful port.","March 7","false","3.4"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","1"

It was clear Rockstar wanted to try something different compared to their uber violent and masochistic GTA/Manhunt franchises. So they created Bully, which is in essance a parody on the mass violence that goes on in their games.\n\nIn this game you play as a former high school bully, Jimmy Hopkins. Who is a major reference to coming of age protagonists like Holden Caulfield. The plot is actually fairly interesting and has a few nice twists here and there. It molds nicely with the gameplay, which is similar to San Andreas except your weapons are things like slingshots and bottle rockets.\n\nThe world itself is also unique, as the game goes on seasons change and the world reflects this nicely.\n\nBully is one of my favorite Rockstar games, and it comes highly recommended from me. It is well worth the price of admission.","November 10, 2012","true","24.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SJones/recommended/12200/","SJones","SagaciousJones","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SJones/","612 products in account","Bully is an open-world crime game that playfully twists the formula of its Grand Theft Auto cousins. Set in an unforgiving private school, you’re tasked with taking down the school’s feuding social cliques as a bully who fights bullies using any means necessary. Instead of firearms, you’re given the arsenal of a traditional schoolyard prankster (itching powder, stink bombs, slingshot, etc.) and follow a series of diverse missions that have you racing bikes, winning boxing matches, delivering papers, painting graffiti, and even playing rhythm games. This variety extends to a surplus of optional content in the surrounding town. The game favors density over volume, as the relatively small world feels expertly crafted. Most notably, every single student has a unique name, face, and voice, which helps the game succeed at building the “living world” that so many open-world games aspire to. You can watch these students go to class, kiss in the hallway, hang out with their cliques in the evening, and bully each other using the same pranks you pull on them. Bully’s attention to detail and gameplay variety make it a charming and unique open-world game.\n\n5/5 – Loved it.","September 23, 2014","true","28.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

If you're late for class and the guards catch you in the hallway they will chase you down unless you outsmart them and hide in a locker.\n\nThe graphics are outdated and the controls are awkward due to it being a console port, but that shouldn't prevent you from having a lot of fun with this game. It literally has everything. Slingshots, firecrackers, kick-me signs, trespassing, lock-picking, curfews, slippery bannana peels, bicycle-riding, stink bombs and much more.

Chances are if you wanted to play this game at some point you have by now. Coming back to this in 2016 was rough graphically and gameplay-wise. However, once you get past the rough edges, this is a game where the sheer lunacy of the tasks you are completing (such as beating up midgets dressed like Christmas elves, helping a drunk santa find his drugs, collecting panties for the peverted gym teacher) still makes this game playable. The story has major holes and meanders throughout, but the characters and setup for missions remain entertaining. The combat and skateboard/bike are fun if at times a little clunky. Last but not least, the soundtrack is pretty incredible (no hyperbole), though you'll hear the main theme over and over again. The only way I  can recommend this game in 2016 is if you somehow missed it in years past and care more about atmosphere and mood of a game than the mechanics itself. This is a really cool little offshoot that Rockstar has done aside from the GTA games. At the price you're likely to get it at nowadays, it's a cheap, laid back time if you missed out on this little piece of Rockstar's history. The obvious downside is the graphical fidelity that really makes you appreciate how good games look nowadays, in addition to audio bugs that take away from the overall presentation. If you don't play it, at least give the soundtrack a listen.","May 17","true","16.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

A school full of bullies, nerds and annoying teachers.\nYou go around helping people, going to classes, pulling pranks, bullying people, going to the carnaval and alot more!\n\nBully: Scholarship Edition uses a newer game engine than the original from 2006, it does look like a 2008 game but still has a really good school atmosphere.\nThere are some downsides though, the pc controls are verry clunky and can make it annoying to play at times. The game crashes alot and this can make it really frustrating when you haven't saved after doing a few missions. Altough there are fixes on the internet, they still don't prevent the game from crashing at all.\n\nOver all i would highly recommend Bully: Scholarship Edition, if you're a fan of openworld games with wide variety of content.

The PC version however is good but only if you buy it through steam. I was unfortunate to by my first copy through amazon. Its not amazon's fault the product didn't work right off the bat. So I go to rockstar.com and low and behold this game has little to no support. It has one patch and the patch from the site will not install correctly if you run from their website. I looked up some pc gameplay and all the vids I found where people playing it on steam. So I went ahead and waited for a sale and got the game on steam. The game works just fine now. On a different note this game is so much better with a controller than with mouse and keyboard. At least in my opinion. If you only played the Playstation 2 version when this first came out you will be a little suprised that they added a few classes. These classes only serve as to unlock new clothing they added for your character. Otherwise its the same game you loved when you got it on Playstation 2.

I loved the amount of content it brought and the amount of secrets it has.\nClasses are fun little minigames, some more irritating and precise than others (things like Geography are really hard if you don't know where every single states/countries exact location, and shop is hard to grasp at first)\n\nAlot of the missions are quirky, and the jokes about incest can be funny at times.\nThe game loves to poke fun at steriotypes about nerds, bullies and Jocks, so its very funny for everybody.\n\nAs there is alot of good things, the biggest flaw is the strictness, the game has less free-will than it likes to let on, missing a class you haven't passed means you will get pulled from where you are to that lesson if you get caught, and calling a teacher names or hitting a girl or adult is worse than stealing a bike from someone. (Theft isn't as bad as telling your teacher shes a charity case)\n\nIgnoring all of this, the game is fun, odviously some improvements are needed, but its fun nontheless.","March 26, 2014","true","18.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

Today is the first day of school at a new school.\nYour mother and stepfather will soon drop you off with hatred in their hearts at Bullworth Academy.\nThere you will fight your way to the top and have everyone shout your name when you pass them.\n"Bully: Scholarship Edition" they will shout repeatedly\nIt will be a wonderful journey and it begins now.\n\nBully: Scholarship Edition or more commonly nicknamed "Jimmy" is the main character of this video game and he's not afraid of showing it right away. The story is about him. The cutscenes star him. This is quite the problem for me because he shaves his head. This is something I do as well, for that reason I have trouble distinguishing fiction from reality and got into trouble with the police. Luckily we live in an age of mystery and magic, you don't need to play as Jimmy anymore. You can use technology called hacking to hack the video game and change the model you play as. I opted first in playing as one the adults as I thought maybe the lady folk around campus would be into more experienced men but no. No model would change the attitude they had against me, this made me sad. Hacking doesn't work on the people in the real world either.\n\nGameplay is "Beat the jocks at dodge ball, play pranks on the preppies, save the nerds, kiss the girl and ultimately navigate the social hierarchy in the worst school around. " and that pretty much catches it all using the umbrella method. Now, I've only played it for 55 minutes but what I experienced during that time was wonderful. I hit people, threw books at people, hit on people, talked to people(thumps up edition), talked to people(thumbsdown edition), bought soda and meeting some kind of creature called a prefect you can easily avoid by just jumping all the time.\nThe gameplay mechanics is what you would expect from a Rockstar PC port, somewhat clunky but generally okay. The game also features all kinds of education based mini games like chemistry, english, math, geography etc. All these subjects and their mechanics are highly representative of the American education system.\n\nIn conclusion, it’s a beautiful sandbox-style game with beautiful characters and beautiful gameplay.\n\n3/10","December 30, 2014","true","0.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Sarcastic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/docsarcastic/","359 products in account","Personal Rating: 7/10\n\nAh Bully. This games getting a sequel in 2016 so hopefully people can get hyped for that after they've stopped ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ themselves about Fallout 4. However let's take a look at the first game.\n\nBully is an open world game set in a school. You play as Jimmy Hopkins who is arguabley the biggest ♥♥♥♥ on earth at the beginning of the game. Much like Rockstar's other games, you do quests located around the map to advance the story. Very GTA IV like but without any of those silly cars or mass genocides, carried out by helicopters and bowling.\n\nGameplay wise, it's honestly nothing special to be honest. I can't feel connected to Hopkins because he's a ♥♥♥♥, and I can't feel any sympathy for him or any bullies for that matter. I mean, I'm a nerd, in this game you're basically asking me to steal my own lunch money. But the jokes on him, I make my own lunch and bring it with me *pushes glasses up nose*. But nah, it's not fresh. There's nothing convincing me to do any of these actions apart from to advance the story.\n\nOne new thing they added into this game is classes. No, not Call of Duty classes. As in, actual learning classes like Art, English and Science. You might be thinking "Well what's the point in going to classes? I live the thug life". Well, these classes can eventually give you upgrades and weapons such as stinkbombs, clothing and even a bike (which I never got, apparently my lack of skills in production and art carried over into this game). Each class revolves around a minigame, like in English for example, you have to make as many possible words out of a jumble of letters, or in Art where you have to avoid pencils and stuff to draw a picture? I don't know what they were thinking but it works I suppose.\n\nObviously a big part of the game is combat. But it lacks a certain something. Beat 'em ups and Fighting games have never appealed to me, and Bully is basically a beat 'em up with a couple of minigames slapped on the top, with an unrelatable character and numerous little cracks in this game.\n\nHowever, it's still great. As much as I've complained about this game, it really is a very good game. Graphically wise it might not stand up to today's standards, however they were good for it's time. Some of the characters like the Principal and the Homeless Bloke are well made and I enjoyed the parts of the game they were in. Now obviously I haven't played all of this game, I finished it on my Xbox 360 though so that can sort of give you an idea.\n\nThe one big problem with the Steam version is that if you try and change the options, such as the size of the screen, the game will crash. Well, it did in my case, so I'm playing the game in a 4:3 window. The game's options are full of bugs that may crash the game, so be careful.","October 27, 2015","true","1.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

The graphics are mediocre by this time, but it's nothing to scoff at either. While the game is buggy and has some issues with AI, it's not usually game-breaking and you'll be too busy beating people up to care.\nThe character depth is great, especially due to the fact that no two characters in Bully are the same, they each have their own\npersonalities and traits, and if you don't think so, just stop to listen to them and maybe you'll see what I mean.\nThe music is suitable and, for the most part, sets the emotion of the scene adequately.\nBully is a great game and well worth the price.\n(P.S.

Characters and story are memorable and clearly intended as exaggeration of high-school stereotypes, although many come as 1-shots for some reason. One can't help but praise out-of-nowhere dramatic final confrontation which ends up being EXTREMELY satisfying and just, though. Only really negative side I can think of is the fact that this isn't such a great port.","December 5, 2011","true","17.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/willooi/recommended/12200/","willooi","willooi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/willooi/","296 products in account","Bully on PS2 was one of my favourite games in the Rockstar catalogue back in the day, and so I was excited to get my hands on the Scholarship Edition which promised to bring the world of Bullworth Academy and its surrounding towns into glorious HD life. And whilst textures and draw distance have been improved, B:SE isn't without its issues.\n\nThe game is noticeably buggy, more so than the original and especially prevalent with the AI behaviour, particularly as you have a whole school's worth of NPCs running about. The new classes/minigames feel tacked on and are of poor quality, with the bonuses you gain in completing them utterly pointless. And call me vain, but I also dislike main character Jimmy Hopkins' new face; I mean, the kid wasn't exactly going to win any male model prizes back in 2006, but his makeover makes it seem like you're now controlling a middle-school aged Wayne Rooney who, in case you don't know, *definitely* isn't a looker. If you need to, give him a quick Google Image Search, and shield your eyes. One of the appeals of the original was saving up enough pocket money to buy new clothing for Jimmy, constantly dressing him up in just enough school uniform mixed with casual items so as to not get busted by prefects for violating the dress code, and so I don't think this demand for superficial consistency is too much of an ask.\n\nDespite these complaints, I'd recommend B:SE for any newcomers who never had the chance to play it before. The game is full of charm and accompanied by a brilliant soundtrack, finding a great balance between Rockstar's GTA formula with just enough new ideas to make it seem like a fresh enough experience for both GTA fans as well as those who've begun to grow tired with that series. However if you've already played Bully before, there isn't enough here to live up to the nostalgia, and I'd recommend investing on the PSN version of the original instead. For all its muddy graphics and atrocious framerate, particularly when the outside-school environments open up, the game was perfectly balanced in its original incarnation, without the out of place classes and, certainly, with a much better designed main character.\n\n7/10.","June 7, 2014","true","14.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's GTA, but without blood and deadly weapons, and instead of playing as an adult man, you play as Jimmy Hopkins. A 15 year old kid who's aggressive and a fighter, but not truly malicious. He only gives people what they have coming to them.\n\nBully takes place in Bullworth, a town in New England. Your mom, well, Jimmy's mom, drops you off at Bullworth Academy. A boarding school. The school is full of bullies and corrupt teachers and it's up to you to put a stop to it.\n\nThe game's storyline will guide you through six chapters (There are 65 missions, the sixth chapter is an endless free-roam chapter, giving you the chance to complete non-storyline missions and to collect collectables.) Each of them takes place in a different weather season. The missions vary, it's never the same. One time you're cleaning a rat infested library and the next time you're helping a teacher escape from a psychiatric hospital. As Jimmy, your main goal is to bring peace to the school by helping and befriending the five school cliques: The Nerds, the Jocks, the Bullies and the Preppies.\n\nOf course you'll have to go to class. These classes are: English, gym, geography, math (ew), music, shop, art, photography and biology. They are simple mini-games which become noticeably harder every time you attend them and make progress. You'll also have to deal with a time schedule. You can skip class, but you won't get any rewards if you do so and prefects will catch you if they see you outside of class.\n\nJimmy, your character, is highly customizable. You can buy clothes, change your hairstyle and more. You can even buy a bike, a go-kart or a scooter if you saved up enough cash. Money can be earned by either taking a paper route, doing missions for townies or students or by completing storyline missions.\n\nYou've got weapons. No, they are not guns and no you can't kill people. There's a super slingshot, you can use firecrackers, stink bombs, eggs, a bag of marbles, a bottle rocket launcher and so much more. You can also pick up one of the many objects around you (umbrella's, vases, bottles) and use them as a weapon.\n\nInteracting with your fellow students is fun too. You can talk to them, give them presents, put them in trash bins, punch them in the face (aka bully them) and even kiss them. (This only applies to several girls and yes, you can kiss some guys too if you're into that.)\n\nThe game has a very impressive map size. You can explore the entire school, the school grounds, the town, a fully functional theme park, an industrial park and a few more awesome places. There are many collectables scattered around the map too.\n\nBully may be pretty good, but it's not perfect. The graphics are rather outdated, the sound isn't that amazing and you will have to deal with odd controls and some bugs. But don't worry! It doesn't kill the fun. Bully is an amazing game and there's much to do. And for only $14.99 - £9.99 - €9.99, it's certainly worth it.\n\nGo buy it!\n\nI recommend you it!","March 27, 2014","true","0.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/syrsly/recommended/12200/","syrsly","Syrsly","http://steamcommunity.com/id/syrsly/","745 products in account","WARNING: VERY BAD CONTROL SCHEME!  There is partial controller support, meaning it supports controllers but has a lot of problems with them.  Xbox 360 controllers are not plug-and-play, but they work as long as you enable them within the in-game options menu.  The game's default keyboard controls are terrible, and while the game is best played with a controller, it sometimes requires you to use a more accurate aiming tool, like a mouse or tablet, to play the minigames... well, you could probably do the minigames with your joysticks, but it would be unnecessarily difficult.  The minigames are clearly designed for a mouse.\n\nThat aside, Bully is a nice game for how old it is.  It has decent visuals (nothing special), similar to GTA3 with characters closer to the style of Fable (sort of, see screenshots), and it plays fairly well.  The story has a lot of hilarious moments and some good laughs for people who like absurd phrases.  There are some gross-out moments, as well, so the game may not be for the squeamish.  Immature, snot-nosed brats should love it, though!  ;D\n\nThe only gripe I have besides the controls is that the AI is absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  The characters will just stand around doing the same behavior, even saying the same phrase, non-stop for the entire time you're near them.  I wish the devs would have given NPCs more believable behavior patterns.  That said, if you run through the levels very fast, you will not notice that issue.\n\nYou can play a bunch of metagames which help progress the story, but there is not much replay value, because the game really isn't that open and offers very few distractions to keep you occupied.  There is very little challenge to the game, but that may be a good thing for some players.\n\nOverall, my opinion allows the game a 3/5.  Get it if it's cheap.","July 31, 2013","true","2.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While Jimmy attempts to fit in, he does various jobs for each of the cliques at the School to gain their favour. Whether its getting som D&D pages back for the Nerds, beating up the Jocks for the Preps, or roughing up the Preps for the Greasers, Jimmy does pretty much everything possible to just survive.\n\nGameplay wise, this is a text-book R* sandbox game with its own unique touches. You can go to class where you play mini-games to unlock new abilities, start fights with the various cliques of the school, or just be a delinquent and destroy everything.\n\nBully was one of the most unique R* games in it's gameplay feel. Sure it plays pretty close to the Renderware Grand Theft Auto games (GTA III, Vice City, San Andreas), it has its own unique feel with a pretty interesting plot, some great voice acting, and missions and activities that are fun to play. It's 14.99 and the game is pretty long, so you do get your money's worth.","November 29, 2013","true","3.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This time, instead of a space age, or an urban enviroment, a school. Bully takes place in Bullsworth Acadamy, and is about a young boy, who has been dropped off at this boarding school because of his wreckless behaviour in the past.\n\nAlong the way you'll meet crazy characters such as a hobo that teaches you kung-fu, nerds, jocks, and of course, the headmaster.\n\nIt is and open world game, but the world isn't as big as Liberty City, Vice City or San Andreas. However, the world has personality in the character dialouge, and the charm in the enviroments, like graphiti, the carnival and the school corridors. Lessons are fun mini-games, and detentions also have their own mini-games, like lawn mowing or snow shoveling.\n\nThis game deserves a sequel, and with recent news of Bully getting trademarked, we may have a glimmer of hope for Bully 2.\nThat or it's a moblie port.\n\nRating: 9.5/10","November 26, 2013","true","8.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While Jimmy attempts to fit in, he does various jobs for each of the cliques at the School to gain their favour. Whether its getting som D&D pages back for the Nerds, beating up the Jocks for the Preps, or roughing up the Preps for the Greasers, Jimmy does pretty much everything possible to just survive.\n\nGameplay wise, this is a text-book R* sandbox game with its own unique touches. You can go to class where you play mini-games to unlock new abilities, start fights with the various cliques of the school, or just be a delinquent and destroy everything.\n\nBully was one of the most unique R* games in it's gameplay feel. Sure it plays pretty close to the Renderware Grand Theft Auto games (GTA III, Vice City, San Andreas), it has its own unique feel with a pretty interesting plot, some great voice acting, and missions and activities that are fun to play. It's 14.99 and the game is pretty long, so you do get your money's worth.","November 29, 2013","true","3.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

(BTW, LORD GABEN BETTER PUT IT ON STEAM.)\n\nBully revolves around the daily academy life of Jimmy Hopkins, a fifteen year old troublemaker and an all-around badass.\n\nThe game is really cool because it's open world on the campus of Bullworth Academy. Now, this can be great for the 2 kinds of game players that exist. The ones that actually play a storyline and are afraid to be a ♥♥♥♥ in a videogame (Me), or someone who doesn't give a damn and just screws around hitting girls and giving prefects the wedgie of their life (Also Me).\n\nPros:\n+Humor. LOTS of humor\n+Likeable Hero\n+Classroom Aspect\n+Voice acting (GOLD)\n+Not restricted to just the campus\n+Nonrepetetive storyline\n+Intresting story about betrayal and, well, BULLIES!\n+Antagonist is a ♥♥♥♥. (I like that)\n+YOU choose the way you play. Lover or Hater kind of thing\n+Unlockables\n+Character Customization\n+Interesting soundtrack\n+Fun Gameplay\n+Easy Achievements, sorta, on console\n+A Pretty lengthy storyline\n+Crime and punishment system is realistic-ish and is reasonable\n+Lenient Prefect escape system\n\nCons:\n-Vague respect system\n-Graphics are a little painful to look at, but for it's time it's alright\n-Controls are something special\n-No Achievements\n\nThe game is very good, and I give it an 89/100. This is also the first game I got all achievements on (LONG weekend).\nAn underrated game that you should buy.\n\nHave fun hiding in trashcans, shoving Algie into a locker, beating up Tad, and making out with Mandy (or Eunice... if you're into that).","December 18, 2014","true","21.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I remember one time I invited a few other people that never played it before to play it and they loved it too! The story is amazing, the graphics are beautiful but not hard on a CPU, and gameplay is, good, I say that because some of the controls are bad and well, sometimes things work in weird ways that seem glitchy compared to certain things in Grand Theft Auto III, which came out a while before this. But either way, here are my ratings for the game:\nGame itself: 9/10\nConcept: 10/10 just for originality,\nStory: 10/10, some offensive stuff but that's one reason it's awesome,\nControls (for PC): 4/10, aim mode is Up Arrow and to look around you use the mouse, and to move you use the WASD keys, when do you have time in like a boss battle or something to press Up?\nPhysics (among other things): 5/10, you drop an item, it falls straight down. You jump off something with the Skateboard Bucky gives you early on in the game, you lose a lot of speed and sometimes just comepletely stop. Worst of all when you throw someone onto a street curb in such a way, and this is often, they will have gravity to that spot, meaning, they will be able to stand at a full 45 degree angle and not have to balance or anything.\nOverall: 8/10, this would have to be my favorite game on PS2 besides Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and that underrated game called Gun.\nThanks for reading this long review!","August 13, 2015","true","16.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Damn must have I been high, erm.\n\nBully:Scholarship Edition is a third person game that takes place in a VERY stereotypical american high-school, if you're looking to do a Columbine this isn't for you unless you want to substitute with a slingshot or spud gun.\n\nIn one mission you break into the girls dorm and steal panties.\n\nThe game is full of fun minigames, hell some of the classes are minigames in themselves. (I don't count Maths and English as minigames, ok.)\n\nYou can basically do whatever you want in a school-themed game and not have any real life consequences, go ahead and shoot that fat nerd with the spud gun.\n\nYou've got the Nerds, the Preppies, the Greasers and i'm pretty sure everyone would know there would be Jocks in this kind of game, each with their own theme whenever you're fighting someone a part of their faction, speaking of themes, when you get the game you get the soundtrack too for free, some of the soundtrack (like the theme that plays when a prefect chases you down) sounds like 80s cop music and it's just so memorable it's no surprise that it may get stuck in your head quickly.\n\nLet's just get to the most fun parts, you can beat people up of course, you could throw itching powder at people and watch them thoughtlessly scratch themselves, you can throw stinkbombs and firecrackers, shoot a slingshot, bottle rocket launcher (kinda like fireworks), and spud gun, make out with several different girls (Or guys, don't talk about that seriously.).\n\nThe game offers at least 15 hours of gameplay unless you just speedrun it and have no fun at all outside of the main storyline.\n\nConclusion: 8.5/10, I absolutely wish for a sequel, and a sequel with many more hours of gameplay, Happy nerd hunting, gamers!","February 7, 2015","true","40.4"," 1 person found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","0","1","1","2","0"

There are many moves and techniques Jimmy can learn such as sweeping under someones legs to knock them over or uppercuts.\nWhen using a grapple on another student Jimmy is able to "bully" them in various ways.\n\nOverall I'd say this is one of Rockstars best releases to date, and one of the few games released by them that I still fully enjoy.\nIf you enjoy GTA you're pretty much guaranteed to enjoy this.\n","February 28","true","16.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The side quests for NPCs are great fun, though there were times when I really wanted to punch the quest giver (which I eventually did). Even at a school there is a wide range of fun weapons to play with and a reasonable sized open world to explore.\n\nOverall I found this game throughrally enjoyable.

Give this a go if you like GTA. I also recommend it for those who like GTA games but often find the story missions too difficult. Bully's missions are a lot easier than those found in most GTA games. There's a lot to do outside of the main story too, with countless side-missions, minigames, secrets and unlockables to find. The game's soundtrack is awesome, by the way, composed by Shawn Lee. If you play this game for more than ten minutes the music will have already been stuck in your head.\n\nCons:\n\nIf you're playing this on Windows 10 you may encounter crashes a fair few times, there are steps that can be taken to minimise the frequency of these crashes. I took these steps but I couldn't eradicate the crashes completely, I may have missed something however. Also, the game is locked at 30 FPS if you're worried about that. It can be brought up to 60 FPS with some tinkering if you like, I didn't mind it all that much. Another issue I had was the audio, outside of cutscenes I thought the characters' voices were too quiet and they were overpowered by the music, even though I had the speech option at max.\n\nTo sum up, Bully is a unique, funny game with a great story, a fantastic soundtrack, a ton of side missions, a lot of pranks to pull and a lot of characters to interact with.

The interface is terribly clunky, and while I understand that this is supposed to be a "bad" school and kids are noisy, I have never once been in a place where there are two hundred people shouting the same six lines at the top of their lungs at all times. The sheer amount of loud, grating, poorly voiced "children" in this game is a marvel of auditory annoyance.\n\nIn addition, the game makes a big deal about the choices you can make in dealing with the other students, however the pre-scripted events have no options whatsoever. Someone hits you with a slingshot and you have no option but to chase them down and beat them up, instead of having an option to simply wait and get revenge later, or ignore it entirely (with whatever penalties are appropriate).\n\nThe graphics range from not impressive to abysmal and I don't know how Rockstar managed to screw up the controls and user interface so badly. Bully is probably the worst console port I've played in a very long time and about the only redeeming value to this game is it is a bit of gaming history, as a shining example of people freaking out about a "violent video game" that's incredibly bad.","July 21, 2013","false","0.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are many moves and techniques Jimmy can learn such as sweeping under someones legs to knock them over or uppercuts.\nWhen using a grapple on another student Jimmy is able to "bully" them in various ways.\n\nOverall I'd say this is one of Rockstars best releases to date, and one of the few games released by them that I still fully enjoy.\nIf you enjoy GTA you're pretty much guaranteed to enjoy this.\n","February 28","true","16.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I remember one time I invited a few other people that never played it before to play it and they loved it too! The story is amazing, the graphics are beautiful but not hard on a CPU, and gameplay is, good, I say that because some of the controls are bad and well, sometimes things work in weird ways that seem glitchy compared to certain things in Grand Theft Auto III, which came out a while before this. But either way, here are my ratings for the game:\nGame itself: 9/10\nConcept: 10/10 just for originality,\nStory: 10/10, some offensive stuff but that's one reason it's awesome,\nControls (for PC): 4/10, aim mode is Up Arrow and to look around you use the mouse, and to move you use the WASD keys, when do you have time in like a boss battle or something to press Up?\nPhysics (among other things): 5/10, you drop an item, it falls straight down. You jump off something with the Skateboard Bucky gives you early on in the game, you lose a lot of speed and sometimes just comepletely stop. Worst of all when you throw someone onto a street curb in such a way, and this is often, they will have gravity to that spot, meaning, they will be able to stand at a full 45 degree angle and not have to balance or anything.\nOverall: 8/10, this would have to be my favorite game on PS2 besides Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and that underrated game called Gun.\nThanks for reading this long review!","August 13, 2015","true","16.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It wasn't the best and I found the it to be something like GTA's The Lost and Damned, but not entirely. All in all, I enjoyed it and found it hard at points to stop playing because of it.\n\nGameplay/Controls Gameplay is pretty solid, but using keyboard and mouse can be quite infuriating at at times.\nFighting was pain for me at the begining, sometimes I would end up hurting friendly NPC's, because they were in the way of an enemy NPC and using your mouse is how you switch between targets which would cause me to accidently switch to a friendly NPC.\nRiding your skateboard and bike with WASD can cause you to wreck... quite a bit. It becomes stressful when you are doing a race or an objective that requires you to use your bike.\nThere are 'minigames' so to speak; you can take a side job missions to earn extra cash, go to the carnival, take a trip to a skate park and compete in bike races.\nTheir are collectables such as rubber bands and G&G Cards to snag.\nI would add tag spots, but they didn't seem perminant but I could be wrong.\nYou also have classes and they are used to give your character upgrades. Example, you complete a Class One Art and you'll get 25% Health Bonus when you kiss a girl. You are not forced to go to class, but the school guards and police officers will chase and attempt to take you to class.\n\nPros:\nGood Story\nLikable Characters\nEnjoyable Gameplay\nDifferent From Most Games (That I've played)\n\nCons:\nBad Port\nClucnky Controls\nFeels Slightly Dated\n\n\nSummaryI know most people don't recommend it do to it being a bad port, but it is still fully playable.\n$15 price is not bad at all, I got 20 hours out of it and possibly more if I decide to 100%.\nI would say, try to get it when there is a Rock Star Publisher Sale going on, then you can probably\nget it for around $5 - $10.\nAll in all, well rounded game and sadly it doesn't seem to get the recognition that it deserves.

There's a lot to do outside of the main story too, with countless side-missions, minigames, secrets and unlockables to find. The game's soundtrack is awesome, by the way, composed by Shawn Lee. If you play this game for more than ten minutes the music will have already been stuck in your head.\n\nCons:\n\nIf you're playing this on Windows 10 you may encounter crashes a fair few times, there are steps that can be taken to minimise the frequency of these crashes. I took these steps but I couldn't eradicate the crashes completely, I may have missed something however. Also, the game is locked at 30 FPS if you're worried about that. It can be brought up to 60 FPS with some tinkering if you like, I didn't mind it all that much. Another issue I had was the audio, outside of cutscenes I thought the characters' voices were too quiet and they were overpowered by the music, even though I had the speech option at max.\n\nTo sum up, Bully is a unique, funny game with a great story, a fantastic soundtrack, a ton of side missions, a lot of pranks to pull and a lot of characters to interact with. The few technical problems I mentioned are outweighed by this game's qualities.","January 22","true","34.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The controls are a bit awkward using the mouse & keyboard, especially riding on bikes or skateboards but it's still managable.

Obviously, the game is about bullying and fighting your way through the ranks only to try and bring peace to the school. While the plot may not be as strong as other Rockstar titles, it's certainly more fun than others for the exploration of the school and outside areas, including the town, carnival, and industrial park. Overall, it's an exceptional game.\n\nYou are Jimmy Hopkins, all around average teen that is sent to a private school in the New England area. Jimmy eventually befriends the idealist Gary Smith, and Pete Kowalski, the resident dweeb. Jimmy is able to attend classes, make friends, have a relationship, and fight bullies. The main enemies are the preps and jocks, but there's an underlying story here as the game takes place throughout the school year.\n\nI have to say, watching Bully's story unfold was exciting and exhilerating as I was fondly reminded of Harry Potter.\n\n9.0/10","November 5, 2013","true","22.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Bully has what I consider a great storyline, plenty of weapons and perks, great AI, good replayablility (I've beaten the story, so I loaded a save file and have just been free roaming this whole time. You can unlock a moped, and eventually a go-kart along with a bunch of different weapons from bags of marbles to potato guns. When you first arrive at the school, you are hated for being the dumb new kid. As the game goes on, you gain respect for doing multiple missions, which is how you are treated. I'd say this game is worth $15 but during sales its gone down to $3 or $7. This is a must have in my opinion, after you complete the first chapter you get to go into the local town and cause mayhem, and with a developer such as rockstar you really can't go wrong.\n\nThe modding community is not what is could(should) be, I was able to download a mod to put the super spudgun into the game but I've only found a few others (One that added cars, different outfits, etc) OverallI'd give this a 10/10.","June 23, 2014","true","31.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","5"

If you are using an Windows 10, according to others you MAY experience frequent crashes. I've played this on Windows 7 and 8, and I was actually able to complete the full story without any crashes. It's a heavy game however. If you want max settings PLUS a solid framerate, you're definitely going to need pretty high specs. I'm using GTX 960 and I'm getting 60 FPS on max settings. Mind you there is a released executable which replaces the original one, removing the 30 FPS limit. I'd only recommend getting that if you have 8 or more GB of ram. Other than that, it's a really juicy story, lots of fun, and can easily be modded. 10/10.","March 8","true","24.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","2","3","2","0"

To making a game about a high school kid who moves to a school for child delinquents and socially challenged kids, but in a lot of ways Bully is like a GTA. For example Bully is a giant open world with stuff to collect, bike races to do, arcade games to play, and much more to just kind of find.The mission structure is very similar to GTA, you do a bunch of work for one of the factions;like the jocks or the nerds, and the more the more you do work for one faction it can effect your standing with others. Which in turn can effect the way some of the people treat you at school. The combat is very similar but instead of machine guns and rocket launches. Your playing with slingshots and stink bombs. There are also a lot of things that are different about Bully that really makes it feel like your in high school it feel very structured, but that's not a bad thing at all. Like you have classes two times a day everyday until you pass the highest level of that class, and of you don't go the prefects or any adult of authority. All the classes have there own perks like one of the classes shows you where all the collectibles, and unlike the protagonists in GTA jimmy is 15 and needs his sleep so if your out past 2 you just pass out on the spot which can make some night missions feel a little too time restrictive.\nThe story starts you out in a car ride with you and your mom and what seems to be your new stepdad. They then drop you off in the front of Bullyworth academy where you meet the principle and some of the teacher, but the fun starts to come in when you go to your dorm room and meet your new friend Gary, who is a sociopath, i don't know how else to put it.You soon start to become manipulated by him, and you two soon go your separate ways and you start to see less and less of him. You then start to do work for the other factions of the school. Playing Bully it kind of puts you back and makes you think about your time in high school, I know the archetypes aren't as plain and simple as they are in Bully but it does a great job of boiling a lot of the high school experience down to a 20 hour game.\nThen there are a few technical issues with bully I didn't really have too many other then the game crash on me a couple of times, and that just sucks after that happened for the first time a started saving much more frequently. I can't really say definitely how the game will turn out for you, but it didn't seem to bad. From my experience with it. Over all the game is well made but parts of it just seem kind of repetitive and broken;overall though I think it's a great game.","December 9, 2014","true","15.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/polly_s_hate/recommended/12200/","polly_s_hate","Polly","http://steamcommunity.com/id/polly_s_hate/","407 products in account","Two quick things to note before you purchase Bully: Scholarship Edition:\n1. The game runs at 30fps natively (Whoop de doo, but apparently this is an issue for some people.)\n2.  An XBox 360 pad or 360 pad emulating software is highly recommended to play this game properly. Other configurations can work, but it works best with 360-styled controls.\n\nAnyway...Bully: Scholarship Edition is a 2008 upgrade of the 2006 PS2 game, so don't expect a lot of the bells and whistles that open world games of today have, and even in scale it's much smaller than Rockstar's other PS2 offerings. The smaller scale works in Bully's favor however, as the world is much easier to navigate and able to breathe a bit more.\n\nIn the game you'll spend your time juggling your school studies alongside completing various missions to advance the story and curry favor with the various cliques around campus. Mission structures are fairly simple and easy to execute and have a certain charm to them given the high school setting. Blowing up toilets with firecrackers, dropping stink bombs in lockers, and rolling teachers down a hill an a locked porta potty are a lot more charming than the typical Rockstar fare of "Go here, shoot dudes, now go here." There's still a bit of open-world repetition to the process, but the story missions are varied enough and the scholastic mini-games fun enough that tedium rarely sets in.\n\nNarratively, Bully is more a comedy than most open-world games. There are quite a few genuine laugh oud loud lines and moments that make seeing the story through a worthwhile endeavor. Though the story and characters are brilliantly acted, they're unfortunately not written quite as well as they should be and the overall narrative and anti-bullying messages end up muddled. The main antagonist only appears in the opening and final chapters and the climax feels very slapdash and out of nowhere. With as strong as the Grand Theft Auto PS2 games were in this department, it's a bit of a bummer that Bully ended up getting a bit of a short stick.\n\nAll that said, if you missed Bully the first time around, it's certainly worth a look. There's enough charm, comedy, fun things to get into, and great acting to keep the tedium of an overworld game from creeping up too often, just be aware that the payoff might not be exactly what you were hoping for.","October 11, 2013","true","23.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CoderJet/recommended/12200/","CoderJet","Coder Jet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CoderJet/","667 products in account","This was a fantastic game back in the day of the PS2 era, still is to be honest. It's great when Rock star bring their games to pc, *Cough* Red Dead Redemption *Cough*.\n\nSo with Bully being developed by beloved RockStar, it was designed from the same vein as GTA...but with kids...and no guns...or killing. Not necessary a major drag, you just get to run around with a super powered slingshot, stink bombs and fire crackers to really annoy people.\n\nThe game is based around a 15 year kid called Jimmy Hopkins, who is transferred to a boarding school because his mum wanted to go on a 12+ month holiday. Lucky her, eh? So you're the new kid, and you need to work your way up the ranks to be at the top of the school. So naturally no one respects or fears you to start with, even the nerds of the school. So you do the usual mission progression and go through the chapters, which are pretty much like school terms, and you work for different school groups to gain their respect and trust.\n\nThat's pretty much the jist of the game, other than that it's got you're typical collectables hunt, garage full of vehicles (in this case it's push bikes), shops selling you goods to help you with your carnage, and mini games to help you earn extra cash / abilities.\n\nThe mini games are kinda fun and can completed fairly quickly. You've got your class room mini games and your 'earn some do$h' mini games. The cash ones are typical teenager jobs, such as a paper route or mowing lawns. But with the class room mini games they help improve Jimmy's abilities, such as chemistry lessons help buff up your chemistry set to create more useful and powerful prank tools. Auto shop gives you better push bikes, English helps you pick up the ladies ;D and so on. The class room mini games can essentially be completed in the first chapter, so no more lessons for the whole year! If only...*Sigh*\n\nQuite a lengthy game, if you go for 100% completion. The story is a bit meh and generic, like it's been done in a way before in previous RockStar game. Not going to give too many spoilers now! You'll just have to play and find out ;)  Then again, I could be completely getting one of the GTA games plots all wrong in my head, I hope not.\n\nBut there are some good moments in the story with memorable, and stereo typical, characters you expect from a US school. Can't say I can really relate to be honest, British high school life is waaaaaaaay different. Thanks for butchering the spirit of The Inbetweeners, USA...\n\nAn annoying factor to the game is the restriction at night where you can't be out of your dorm past 8 pm, other wise you get chased by the never sleeping prefects and police. If you're out after 2 or 3 am, you automatically get knocked out and appear in your dorm for 8 am. So you can't be a crazy kid and never sleep, ever.\n\nI do have to you warn you though, since this was a console port to the PC the controls aren't 100% perfect. So I recommend playing with a controller. Not the keyboard & Mouse!\n\nOver all the game isn't too bad, defiantly worth picking up if you have nostalgic feelings towards this game. I know I did, and didn't regret it! :D\n\nIn conclusion:\nFairly decent graphics from the PS2 era.\nGood story, the game is quite lengthy if you also do the side content.\nExcellent alternative to the GTA series, if you're looking for a less violent game.\nPlenty of side content to keep a completionist busy for a few hours.\nFun character clothing customising. Make Jimmy look like a right ponce.\nFairly big open world.\nIrritating in game hours, in which you have only so many to do stuff in.\nPoor port to PC, use a game pad rather than a keyboard & mouse.\n7 / 10 Get the Go-Kart asap, other wise you won't be able to run the old ladies over fast enough before they dive out of the way.","August 29, 2014","true","21.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The game runs at 30fps natively (Whoop de doo, but apparently this is an issue for some people.)\n2.  An XBox 360 pad or 360 pad emulating software is highly recommended to play this game properly. Other configurations can work, but it works best with 360-styled controls.\n\nAnyway...Bully: Scholarship Edition is a 2008 upgrade of the 2006 PS2 game, so don't expect a lot of the bells and whistles that open world games of today have, and even in scale it's much smaller than Rockstar's other PS2 offerings. The smaller scale works in Bully's favor however, as the world is much easier to navigate and able to breathe a bit more.\n\nIn the game you'll spend your time juggling your school studies alongside completing various missions to advance the story and curry favor with the various cliques around campus. Mission structures are fairly simple and easy to execute and have a certain charm to them given the high school setting. Blowing up toilets with firecrackers, dropping stink bombs in lockers, and rolling teachers down a hill an a locked porta potty are a lot more charming than the typical Rockstar fare of "Go here, shoot dudes, now go here." There's still a bit of open-world repetition to the process, but the story missions are varied enough and the scholastic mini-games fun enough that tedium rarely sets in.\n\nNarratively, Bully is more a comedy than most open-world games. There are quite a few genuine laugh oud loud lines and moments that make seeing the story through a worthwhile endeavor. Though the story and characters are brilliantly acted, they're unfortunately not written quite as well as they should be and the overall narrative and anti-bullying messages end up muddled. The main antagonist only appears in the opening and final chapters and the climax feels very slapdash and out of nowhere. With as strong as the Grand Theft Auto PS2 games were in this department, it's a bit of a bummer that Bully ended up getting a bit of a short stick.\n\nAll that said, if you missed Bully the first time around, it's certainly worth a look. There's enough charm, comedy, fun things to get into, and great acting to keep the tedium of an overworld game from creeping up too often, just be aware that the payoff might not be exactly what you were hoping for.","October 11, 2013","true","23.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

It surely is not a perfect game, but still worth playing in my oppinion, because of its unique scenario and storyline. If you want to try it, pick it up at a sale, it is often available at very low prices.\n\nOverall the story was nice, very unrealistic at times, but still nice. It features some very odd humor and a highly stereotypical view at US school environments. The mission design seemed to me to be a lot easier on the player than the GTA 3 and IV series of games (which were frustratingly hard and unforgiving at times). I think of this as a mostly positive thing, but some missions like most of the races just felt a bit too easy. The game has five story chapters including a lot of separate missions and additionally has a bunch of minigames called classes which can be accessed at specific day times or are forced upon you if the school agents catch you while classes are running. Most of these classes were quite OK and revolve around pressing the right buttons when signalled or dragging icons to marked places. One of the classes on the other hand was so hard that I skipped it all along after three retries.\n\nThe game was first released in 2006 and was ported to PC in 2008, a few months before GTA IV was released. The graphics level more resembles GTA San Andreas than GTA IV and looks quite ugly by 2013 standards. There are also quite a lot of rendering and texture glitches and a 30 frames per second limit in the PC version. The latter can be solved by a modified executable file (check the Steam guides) which works mostly fine but breaks one mission. Even if the PC port was overly hungry for resources (I do not know, but most Rockstar ports are) this didn't affect me much anymore because the game ran very smooth on the highest settings on hardware from 2013.\n\nI cannot state much about the keyboard/mouse control scheme, which other commentators stated to be horrific (which would resemble the situation of the GTA 3 and IV series ports) because I played the game with an Xbox 360 wireless controller through the PC adapter. Played with the controller the game's handling didn't feel so bad, but could have been done a bit better at times. The combat, even though there were quite a lot of moves to be acquired throughout the game, most of the times felt quite annoying. The vehicle mechanics like skateboard, bikes and go-carts didn't feel bad at all.","December 31, 2013","true","20.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It never feels like a chore to play, with more varied missions that keep it interesting long after you'd usually get bored with a GTA campaign. When I saw it on the Summer Sale, I got without hesitation and started my journey through Bullworth Academy for my 4th time. The only complaint I have with the game is that the towns outside of the school never feel as fleshed out or interesting. But that and minor glitches aside, Bully is a fenominal game. And if you have a controller nearby to use, Bully: Scholarship Edition is a fenominal port.","June 18, 2015","true","10.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The graphics have certainly aged, though they were good for their time. The gameplay itself is very unique, you get weapons which you'd expect a schoolyard deviant to have, like a slingshot, spud gun, etc. Plus, you have to perform minigames to do well in your classes. Despite your character's deviant nature, it actually will help you to advance in each class, giving you things like new ways to interact with people socially, new outfits, eventually new bikes, and in the science class, new, unique weapons.\n\nThe Story is pretty long and you'll find yourself having a good, lengthy gameplay expirience, not to even begin with all the side-stuff and optional stuff you can do. But basically, as a new kid, you're trying to make as many allies as possible with all of the social groups at bullworth academy. I'm not going to say more because I don't want to spoil anything, but it's a good story nonetheless and one to be expected from a dysfunctional academy of sorts.\n\nAt first the world feels a bit limited, but that's only as you're getting the ropes of things, once the town opens up, the world is actually a pretty good size, and like I said before, there is a fair amount to do, especially when the town opens up. There also is a curfew, if you're not back in your dorm by a certain time, you can get in trouble with the prefects or the police, and if you don't get back to school in time, you can even pass out and lose your shoes or some other items.\n\nWhile the game is good, the PC port is very lacking, I can't even get it to do 1080p right on one monitor without part of the picture disappearing and/or stretching out to the other monitor. There's also a pretty limited amount of graphics options, however, one thing to keep in mind too is that this game is several years old, and computers back then couldn't handle what the ones of today can.\n\nOverall, if you still after all these years haven't tried it, I would highly reccomend it, it's a great, full game that has a lot on offer and you will likely not be dissappointed. 8.5/10","July 12, 2015","true","0.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

But boy was I happy that I was wrong. Everything about Bully, whether it be its characters, atmosphere, or even its soundtrack, just gives it way more personality than some Grand Theft Autos. It never feels like a chore to play, with more varied missions that keep it interesting long after you'd usually get bored with a GTA campaign. When I saw it on the Summer Sale, I got without hesitation and started my journey through Bullworth Academy for my 4th time. The only complaint I have with the game is that the towns outside of the school never feel as fleshed out or interesting. But that and minor glitches aside, Bully is a fenominal game. And if you have a controller nearby to use, Bully: Scholarship Edition is a fenominal port.","June 18, 2015","true","10.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The controls IMO were quite easy to get accustomed to if you edited them to your liking, played it with keyboard and mouse and persoanlly loved the experience.\n\nThe world is filled with small interactions and stuff that'll make your stance between missions enjoyable and not make you feel like you are running around in circles in an open world made just for the sake of padding hours in it. It has a great variety of really chrming "weapons" that fit completly with the school setting.\nThey managed to make classes incredibly fun, which it's a merit on it's own, from dissecting frogs to cranking a bike the enjoyment of them is quite great, although some do get a little bit tedious over time. Got almost all the classes completed in a single playthrough, but you'll miss a few unless you keep playing after endgame.\n\nCustomization is alright, but if you change hairstyles you change jimmy's whole face quality/shading/structure which is kinda weird but passable considering the age of the game. Clothes are pretty varied and fun.\n\nStory and characters are cliché to a humorous extent, but it's what gives it al lot of the charm this game has. The dialogue is hilarious in most of the cases, mocking everything high school represents and every person you can find in one in a sometimes subtle and sometimes in your face humor that rarely fails to deliver chcukles. Even with all the hilarious, this game does not fail to deliver a great story that let's you taste progression in every part of it. The game did get incredibly easy midway through tho, but was still fun just over how much you can ♥♥♥♥ around the school, the city and the amusment park.\n\nSide activities pop up while riding your bike/skateboard/running around town and sometimes on the map if they are "story-ish" related, but the non story or "story-ish" ones get a little bit repetitive and you'll most likely end up not caring about them because you'll be bathing in money in no time even without doing them.\n\nGot 22 hours in it while doing all of the sidequests but 2, almost all the classes, and ♥♥♥♥ing around town very little, if you like collectibles and stuff it will take you quite a while more as there are 2 types of collectibles that are quite large in number. So you'll definetely get a bang for your buck with this game.\n\nDefinitely my favorite rockstar game, couldn't recommend it enough!","June 14, 2015","true","21.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The characters are colorful and the little quests you have to do are never too easy or too difficult. If it was re-released with a new, HD polish, I can only imagine how it would top the sales charts.\n\nThe gamepad works fantastically with this game. Absolutely worth a purchase-- especially when it's on sale!\nImagine GTA, except way less gritty, violent, and dark.\n\nAnother major plus of this game is the progtagonist. He's extemely likable and honorable, but not in a goody-two-shoes kind of way. It's easy to connect with him as a character, which is important (given you play AS him). The school itself is the prison of legends, and it's really satisfying to screw it all up by egging your principals house while you monopolize all four factions in the little city.","November 27, 2015","true","15.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/brainwashguy/recommended/12200/","brainwashguy","Jefferson Davis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/brainwashguy/","158 products in account","Probably Rockstar's best game. There isn't anything that really needs to be said about this game other than that it's just game, no stupid tutorials, no unnecessary features, it is just done well with just the right amount of stuff. Not only that, it follows a really unique gameplay style (more kid friendly than their edgy Manhunt too) which is pretty fun to play, a nice story that actually shows how bad bullying is and shows Jimmy being rewarded for being a "good" character, and a great port to the PC. This doesn't really need to be mentioned, but there isn't any problem with controls, or any bugs, or any problems at all, it does every really well and it feels really nice on PC. If you need me to describe what makes this game so good I will easily describe what makes this game so good (since there is a lot).\n\nThis game's story is just great. There is so much to it and it is so great. It's all about characterization, but still manages to focus on gameplay and problems in the game world. Each chapter shows you gaining the respect of each clique, while showing you not only what their stereotypical clique is, but what each character there is like, which can be pretty funny, or if not, interesting to listen to. I don't think there is any part where I was really bored, which is great. There are also side missions which typically are teachers asking you to do things for them, and are actually somewhat linear themselves. These missions really give you an idea of what the people are like in this game in the background, and gives you a whole world to immerse yourself in. It really does well with the immersion, especially with just how humorous the world is (it's showing that the whole world is almost literally out to get him, and that not only are the teachers idiots, drunks, or evil, but the kids are essentially stereotypes who aren't interesting, but interesting at the same time, something you have to love about this game). Overall, it's really a great experience that you'd have to see for yourself on why it's so great.\n\nThe gameplay style is pretty interesting too since you play as a 15 year old in a really bad school and neighborhood. There isn't any killing or weapons, and because of that, it focuses more on melee combat and combos, and special stuff like eggs and stink bombs. Other than the combat, there are still stores and an open world like GTA, just a lot smaller, so you focus more on using the map to your advantage and experiencing the importance of each area. Also, there are fun minigames like the Challenges for save points and the Carnival, which both reward you with cool stuff. If nothing else, it's a pretty worthwhile experience just because it's something new, but it's a lot more than that.\n\nOverall, this game is a lot of fun and definitely worth paying even full price for. You'll definitely get your money out of this and more. I really can't describe anything more than that so for the best idea of what this game is about you'll have to play it.","August 10, 2015","true","34.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

These are things like bike races, playing tricks on the other pupils, going to class and tons of other stuff. If you are a fan of open-world games I can highly recommend you to buy and play this game.

I first got Bully back in hmm i think 2006 for my PS2, when I had a PS2 then I got it for xbox360, still waiting for them to put Bully on XboxONE, so you can tell I am a pretty hardcore Bully fan. The game's map is not as big the maps we see in any of the GTA games, hell, its pretty small. The combat system is okay, the thing that really got to me though, was the little bits of dialogue that went up in volume astronamically (<- not sure if I spelled that right) high, kinda like the one mission where you have to go out with Candy, and take her to the carnival. Although there are little errors every now and then, the game is loads of fun and hilarious.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CharlieLima79/recommended/12200/","CharlieLima79","CharlieLima79","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CharlieLima79/","121 products in account","I've enjoyed Rockstar Games' 'Grand Theft Auto' series ever since the release of 'Grand Theft Auto: Vice City'. I thought they did a great job technically with their game engines and stylistically with the visual designs. Plus, 'Grand Theft Auto' games are great satire of the crime film/game genre and of contemporary society for the most part. While aware of the negative impact the games can have on society and the younger generation of gamers, I still defend the merits of 'Grand Theft Auto' games.\n\nI was pretty stoked when I first read about 'Bully' back in 2005/2006, but was disappointed that the first iteration would not come to the PC platform. About a decade later, I finally got my hands on the remastered version of the game, thinking that Rockstar had injected similar type of technical and stylistic mastery, and social acuity into crafting this game as they did with 'Grand Theft Auto'. Was I wrong. True, in the year 2015, the game engine that runs 'Bully' will definitely show its age; I can accept that. However, 'Bully: Scholarship Edition' looks and sounds very uneven in spite of the remastering. The keyboard and mouse controls for the PC also feel unoptimized.\n\nThe truth is, I just can't recommend 'Bully: Scholarship Edition'. It simply lacks the energy, fire and humour that I enjoy in 'Grand Theft Auto' games. The setting of Bullworth Academy, while well-designed, just doesn't seem to allow for much exploration. It feels too confined and claustrophobic even when compared to 'Grand Theft Auto: Vice City', which was released in 2002. Most importantly, 'Bully' doesn't play or feel like a satire. It is pretty much a straight-up (private) school simulator full of cliques and stereotypes with uninspired early missions.\n\nWhile you may approach 'Bully' and complete missions with good intentions, and that your character implicitly dislikes being bullied, you ironically need to be a bully to accomplish your goals. The unsatirical tone of 'Bully' actually makes me feel horrible for my heinous actions in the game. While I can find some reason to justify my undertaking of violent acts in 'Grand Theft Auto', I find my actions and bullying in 'Bully' to be distasteful.\n\nIn the end, I guess where 'Bully' fails is that it is too real. Whereas the action sequences, violence and set pieces in 'Grand Theft Auto' were designed to be cinematic, grandiose and hyperbolic -- making the games rather hyper-realistic, all the bullying and hijinx in 'Bully' are mostly possible and hit too close to home for comfort. Given the well documented negative impacts of bullying on people of all ages, I cannot in good conscience recommend 'Bully: Scholarship Edition'.","January 25, 2015","false","2.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"
