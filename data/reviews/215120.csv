NO. If you are still looking for an anime style mmo try out Dragon Nest, Tera: Rising, Phantasy Star Online 2 JP (English patch and Ship 2 or 10) or upcoming Blade&Soul NA release. Read on if you want to know the full story.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRose Online used to be one of the most enjoyable and biggest games out there when it was first released. This was my childhood game and the memories will last forever.\n\nUnfortunately, the game has fallen on it's knees in my opinion. Rose online used to be about the community and leveling experience. Nowadays, there is simply not enough active people on rose to make it interesting because people have left. Junon is the only place in the whole game that is filled with players and 90% of them are afk vending. The leveling system is terrible compared to old school rose. 95% of players (I kid you not) use AUTO BOT programs to level. From level 40 upwards all you see is people multiclienting and botting with area of effect abilities. They don't move from the spot at all and just afk to level. This is the sad reality of the game (and it is actually allowed according to the game rules as long as you are 'present' to babysit the aoe bot)\n\nGame development has also stalled. The original game developers are not around so the new 3 person team is just adding small updates here and there. Only 3.5 of the originally planned 7 planets have been released. No new proper content has been released in years, it is basically going around in circles with skill changes. The game direction is highly questionable as well. Did I mention you can basically pay2win in this game when it comes to the best gear?\n\nI love rose but I would not recommend it to anyone anymore =(\n\nEdit: This review was initially posted in July and it is now November - nothing has changed. In fact it is worse. Don't be fooled by my 90 hours gameplay - I used non steam client for 90% of my gameplay. I recently re-entered the game to see how things have changed and the game is even more dead than before. Not to mention the lag and DCs. Current development is as always going around in circles a.k.a nowhere. One of the community developers also left the team. The recent patch decisions are imo irrelevant and opposite to what needs to be implemented to keep the game alive by enticing new players and keeping veteran players happy.\n\nPopulation is dwindling and there is still nothing new to do in the game other than spend real life money on Item Mall. There have even been talks of a server merge because it is so bad! But really this won't save the game when the development is in the wrong direction. Bots are still rampant - still AFK Aoe Bot Online.\n\nThis may sound harsh but it is my and many others honest opinion. I can only voice my honest thoughts here because of the fact that on the Rose forums any negative feelings are promptly deleted and swept under the rug. It really is that bad. If you wanted the truth, here it is. Please vote this as helpful so others don't waste their time and money.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nResponse to Developer:\n\nSo I would like to offer you some real ‘insight’ and feedback, in response to some of issues that have been discussed in this review.\n\nEDIT: The funny thing is that I typed/saved all before you created your recent ‘we are trying to monitor bots!’ thread. Lo and behold, instead of fixing and removing botting spots you are still bashing your head against the wall and doing exactly what you shouldn’t do – trying to monitor them when the game design inherently supports botting. It simply astounds me that the developers have been so short sighted.\n\nAnd whenever a post tells you the solution it is swept nicely under that rug of yours. That is exactly why I feel prompted to respond to your response which is filled with propaganda. It is misleading and luring players into believing your game is worth playing in its current state. A polished turd is still a turd.\n\nOn levelling and Botting:\n\nWhile levelling is faster, that doesn't mean better. Nor does it reflect the flawed nature of the levelling system which is of greater concern. The real kicker is that botting is ok as long as it is 'supervised'. This lax rule isn't even a countermeasure and only in place because you simply cannot monitor or stop botting. Understandably this is because of your small team. However, even if you had the manpower it wouldn't matter.\n\nThe only real solution would be revamping the system to focus more on active participation, requiring movement/timing/skill and less reliance on clerics/aoe classes and standing in one spot. But you will continue to ignore what needs to be done.\n\nA class representative even had to make a thread about botting!! For your team to actually ask for where botting spots are is an absolute joke – it just shows that you don’t even play your own game. I’m just trying to uncover the blindfold that you are trying to put onto potential players that come looking for a worthwhile mmorpg on steam. Better now than later.\n\nOn Population and distribution:\n\nIt is nice to see that the server merge happened. But what of it? Just as I predicted a year ago, your population is still in decline. Merging indeed did not fix the massive inherent problems with Rose.\n\n90% of your players may not be AFK vending, I never said that. But I can say that 90% of people in Junon AFK vend or multiclient. It is saddening to see that the majority of Rose's maps are now complete ghost towns. Junon is the only major planet city that is 'active'. Luna is dead. Eldeon is dead. Orlo is dead. On that note, have you introduced another planet yet? No. That makes it almost 7 years since new planet content right?\n\nWhy has it come to this? Low population and mature population firstly. Secondly, faster levelling means new players breeze past these levels and don't stay. Thirdly, even if levelling was slowed, players wouldn’t even bother visiting these planets at all because other levelling spots (eg: oblivion temple where players generally stay from 80-170...over 90 levels in the same area which is simply ridiculous) are better. Thus, out of like a hundred maps over 4 planets, this is why you only see players actively use less than 6 of them. Is this how you envisioned your game? Full of lazy botters aoeing their way to max level in a few maps?\n\nI won’t ever be returning since I already know what is in store for me. More disappointment. I continue to encourage everyone to stay well away from Rose. Don't be fooled or enticed by false words.","July 6, 2014","false","90.0"," 155 of 168 people (92%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","92","155","168","9","7"

Of course, it most likely won't be for practically anyone who will play this game in this day and age, because the strengths of this MMORPG to new players now only revolves around the history and idea that it is a classic. If you played this game in it's prime, you would feel totally immersed in the world of ROSE and probably never forget the ride. It really felt like an adventure. An adventure that made me believe that this game would might aswell be a RPG that loved me in it's world. There are plenty reasons why this game would irritate, annoy or even anger an audience of modern gamers through it's art style, UI, stability and overall simple gameplay, but considering that this game was a free-to-play (not pay to win) MMORPG that was introduced at the time when the World of Warcraft began, it really was a nolstagic game that contained plenty of down-to-earth players that at the end of the day, you would never see again. I have picked up and dropped this game HEAPS of times and everytime I remember what made my weekends an adventure. I'm not saying it will make any of you feel that way, or if you will even get by 10 minutes of this game without poking fun at it for being last generation, but sadly, it is what it is and if you cannot accept that this game was one of the best in it's time than you haven't REALLY experienced the vast worlds of MMORPGs. This game ties with Dragonica on my favourites list and I would love to play it again, but year by year the community dies. Out of the several hundred hours I've poored into this game during my childhood, I've never regretted it one bit. I'm not telling you to try it or waste your time on a game that you won't ever enjoy, but atleast respect this game for what it is or even what it was. If you do try it, I reccommend downloading it from the main client. Seriously though, LISTEN TO THE SOUNDTRACK!","February 17, 2014","true","5.1"," 44 of 57 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","44","57","2","6"

I played this game on and off since 2006, long before this game was put on steam and have continued playing it without steam)\n\nThis is one of the best games out there in the mmo genre, could be considered the single best mmo when it comes to this type of graphical style, it's been around since  2006 and there are still a ton of people in the game and the developers have consistently added more to the game since then. The game has regular events, like Christmas, saint Patrick's day, World cup to name a few.\n\nThe game is supported by a item shop, but realistically you could play the whole game without ever spending any money in it, most of what is sold on the item shop is cosmetic and the things that are not are mostly things that speed up your process in the game, like for example Exp boost. The item shop does sell a few skills, but you do not really have to get these and you won't feel gimped if you don't have them, that is the only thing you could consider needing to spend money on, but it is not required. A great thing about how Rose Online does the item shop however is that everything that is sold in the item shop can be given or resold to other players, so if you really did not want to spend money in the item shop but still wanted an item from the item shop you could easily buy it from another player who is selling it for in game money, be aware though that you probably won't be able to do this early on in the game, because the prices of item shop objects are not cheap.\n\nThe game has an amazing crafting system, it may not be in depth as other games and may not feel as satisfying when you craft objects but it's massive. Nearly ever single drop in the game (like 90%) is used as a crafting component, the rest of the things that are not are gear, health/mana pickups, vendor trash or a gift box, which there are different types and contain something in it when you open it, like having a random chance of getting a crafting component out of 5 types, basically it's a dirty crystal and when you open it you find out what color crystal it is and crystals are used to craft objects.\n\nCAUTION, it is not recommended you sell your loot to the first few shops you find, there are a few people in the game that try to take advantage of new players lack of knowledge and will pay you very little for your loot (some people may call them scammers,me included, but they are not really, as a new player you should be cautious of things like this in any game) , it may look like a lot when you only have 200G and a player offers you 2.000G for a object you picked up 7 of, but you will kick yourself when you get to the second city and find out the average price you could have gotten for that item was 40.000G. Do NO sell any of your materials before you get to the second main city in the game called City of Junon Polis. When you get to this city take some time and look around at a bunch of shops, there are many players shops set up here, take your time go around and look at the prices of stuff when you have looked at a good selection of shops, you will have a better idea what stuff is worth and can make a better decision on how much to let things go at.\n\nIf you want to craft your own objects, you will have to roll a Dealer, which is the only class that can craft objects. If you do choose to craft objects, do not go and pick up every crafting skill there is as doing so will make your character at killing stuff and thus be very slow at leveling. Crafting skills are part of your normal skills and putting a point into crafting means one less point into a damage dealing ability. Usually just pick one or two crafting discipline, and get a few combat skills and save the rest for your advanced job. Also to help you if you choose to become a crafter CON (concentration) increases your chance at succesfully crafting and objects and SEN (sense) increases your chance of getting extra stats on the crafted object. Carts,Castle Gear and Gems can't have extra stats so, sense is less useful if you want to craft these items\n\nThere are 4 basic classes and 8 advanced classes in the game, everyone starts out as a visitor and when you reach level 10 you can choose on of the basic classes, the basic classes each have two main trees, Muse (mage) has a healing tree and a damage tree. Soldier (Warrior) has a 1 handed tree and a 2 handed tree (1 handed is more for tanking and 2 more for dealing damage). Hawker (rogue/assassin) has a Melee tree and a Range Tree (and then melee has two types, Katar (firstweapon) and dual swords). Dealer has an offensive tree and a crafting tree (crafting tree has some offensive abilities but for the most part it's crafting focused). Each of the basic classes has a basic tree, which help them no matter what they side they go, Muse has increased INT, mana  and mana regen. Soldier has increased Strength, increased damage and increased health. Hawker has increased Dex, increased attack power and increased attack speed. Dealer has Increased CON (Con increases their damage also), increased SEN and increased movement speed.\n\nTry to always be in a party, Rose Online rewards you for being in a party, it has this system called Party Level, it starts at and can go all the way to 50. Party level gives you bonus EXP, the higher the party level the higher the bonus EXP is, this rewards people for grouping up. Some people even leave their game on to save their party level when it gets really high and then when they come back to play tomorrow they don't have to rebuild the party level and get increased bonus EXP from the start  You can be in a party and gain exp as long as nobody in the party is more then 20 levels apart from each other. Getting an AOE skill is highly advisable, what many groups do is go to a location on the map where there are a good amount of mobs, have someone pull a group of mobs and that that person brings the group of mobs the the party and then everyone AOE's the enemies down, this way you speed up your leveling by a lot.\n\nHope this extended review helped you and have fun in Rose Online.","December 31, 2013","true","1.5"," 18 of 26 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","18","26","0","0"

I played the heck out of this game back when I was a kid and had nothing better to do.  ROSE ties with Silkroad for my most nostalgic MMO's.  I have so many great memories of these games.  I also bring this up for a reason, however.  The reason I enjoy ROSE is mostly thanks to those nostalgic memories.  I somewhat doubt this game will appeal to the newer generation of MMO players.  The grind is heavy (used to be much worse) and the economy is pretty terrible but is certainly reminiscent of any older MMO's where economies were generally left unchecked.  With most MMO's there a clear dividing line of prosperity between players.  So why do I recommend this game?  If you can get passed the old school MMO aesthetics, you're going to be able to find a ton of enjoyment from it.  It's a simple MMO with simple goals.  You may or may not sink thousands of hours into ROSE, but the time you spend in it should give you lasting memories.

If there were an in between answer, I'd have chosen it...And I will explain why.\n\nFor the pros, the game has a fairly cute look and an enchanting world to me. I find the graphics to be overall quite nice, and story concept to be pretty neat. As well, the monsters are fun. I mean...I wanna just hit all the jelly beans so I can put them in my mouth!\n\nHowever, as for cons...The controls are a bit slippery to work with. if I move my mouse just the wrong way while I'm trying to do something, I suddenly don't see properly. It's also difficult to aim sometimes with the monsters for me...And my character just moves way too slow. If a worm monster mount can move triple my speed in my head, that's a problem. Mounts are supposed to be fast, and that's good- but my running speed is horrible. Also, my worm can't seem to cross a bridge.","September 20, 2014","false","1.8"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

The aesthetic is somewhat a crossover between the kawaii nature of Ragnarok and the disney styled Spiral Knights. Although this was something I'd never seen before and seemed to be an original idea, I couldn't help but dislike it the more I was exposed to it. The short amount of gameplay I experienced (due to the agonising patching process beforehand) played just like any other mmo, but failed to have any features that caught my attention. And after just over an hour I found myself wanting to switch to RO2, or atleast try to fix the client instead of playing ROSE Online.\nGranted some may like the art style and there seemed to be a fair amount of players, with no noticable p2w features being advertised. Which from past experience signify a promising game, but for myself this wasn't to my tastes and left me underwhelmed. I can't recommend this game due to my own enjoyment and so it gets a negative review, but at the same time I'm sure people would and do enjoy playing this mmo as it doesn't seem to have any major flaws.\nIn the end its all about personal taste, and so I'd say this game gets a 3.5/10 due to its failure to grab my attention and its irritating aesthetic.","May 15, 2014","false","1.6"," 15 of 30 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","15","30","0","0"

Added with the lack of in game support and very slow ticket response times I would not recomend you wasting your time going back to it or even starting this game.

The skills, builds, and avatar itemization can be fun, but the characters themselves feel a bit limited. The controls can be VERY wonky and hard to use, but overall is made up for with its simplistic style in the end. Its also a great game to make friends in and learn the ropes with other new players. Without the tutorial some newer players may feel like a challenge is thrown at them right away, but with time given, it can become much more easy to learn and quick to master. Overall, I'd give this game at 8/10, definitely a Free to play game worth trying.","May 14","true","217.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SpookRooster/recommended/215120/","SpookRooster","Spook Rooster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SpookRooster/","437 products in account","ROSE Online is one of those games I wanted to try for a while but never gathered the nerve to - the childish graphics and chibi-like art style were both major factors in chasing me away. The other factor was that no MMO is worth playing for more than a while. This one didn't last nearly as long.\n\nSo, what are the good factors?\n\n-Fast levelling...?\n-Long draw distance for easy targetting?\n\nOk, not so many pros. Where does this game go really wrong? Well, upon starting the game up, you are greated by Zidane Tribal from Final Fantasy IX. Hello, Zindane. Didn't expect to see you here. Then again, I didn't really expect to see blatant Chocobo clones in Elsword. These manga/anime MMOs love their plagiarism. What else does this game do wrong? You can place several points into your strength attribute and it will make about a 1-damage difference when you strike. Did I mention you begin using a wooden plank sharpened into a spike? Yeah, mix that with your terrifying pink fairy wings you get as a stardard issue, and you have one hell of a warrior. Why, he's so good, he fights beasts that match equally his stoic stature...jelly beans.\n\nWhat could top such absurdity? Not too much, but there seems to be a pretty big problem with the enemies having HP pools deeper than the Ocean. You can hit a wasp so many times, you swear it had over a hundred health. You do, what? 10-20 right now? It definitely has more than a hundred...it has hundreds.\n\nTime to do what we came here for! Time for adventure! Time for exploration! Time to take a stroll down the grassy lands of Whateveria where there are some trees, lots of paths and...wow. This IS empty. The first town you enter has a few NPCs. There isn't a thing you can buy. Really. The equipment is too expensive and I got to level 5 or so killing beans n bees and I didn't gain any money. Sure, I could sell a few things, but that's just it - a few things. Enemy drops are very few.\n\nI couldn't find any quests. The first town has some NPCs, sure, and there's a guard who looks like he might have a job for you near a bridge, but no. They say something and the player responds with a short line and walks away. Same with this lone boy who appears to be lost and with a lot of goods. He HAS to have a quest. Maybe a bandit problem. Nah. He says some useless fluff and your character says "Good for you".\n\nGood for you? It's like your character KNOWS how useless these people are and is just annoyed to not be doing anything.\n\nWait, what's this? A free mount! Kickass! I can go so many places! Maybe a bustling city full of quests!\n\nWhat's that? A little green worm that looks like he should be in A Bug's Life? Yeah, he's quick and all, but I'm hanging to the ground riding a juicy green bug. I can't even fight while I'm riding. Why would I use this thing? I have pink fairy wings and a wooden plank. I'm a warrior of great respect, not a child!\n\nOk, I jest. Looks like everyone here is. Not the bear though...he's a bear.

It's completely free to play and has several aspects to appeal to many different types of players; player versus monster, player versus player, a cooperative party system, a game arena, quests, dungeons, and more. If, by chance, you've played ROSE in the past, you might want to take a look at this game again.

For me, I got into it thanks to a friend who played it a lot and I got to play with them for practically every step of the way until I met other people. However, in my own opinion this game isn't too great if you wanted to play through it on your own where in most other MMORPG's where it was still fun if you wanted to try and solo it. Regardless, with a few friends to start with or making some new ones in your adventures, this game can be a great value for your time.","June 4, 2013","true","43.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This was a completely fail, from what i've seen they reached the completely opposite of what they was trying with the update. Old loyal players left, even less new players are staying. Fail.\n\nKeeping in mind that they scared away a lot of players over the years before already (because pretty EVERYONE is using bot's there, because all the bugs, because no developement, because no new content, because more and more restrictions in game play, because ruining re-designs of some maps, etc.), this is the End for me at ROSE (and also for most of my friends i had there).\n\nBye ROSE. :(\n","May 16, 2015","false","864.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Going past the chibi characters. The customization is pretty decent with virtually any item taking over for graphical enhancement (cosmetically) while having the option for just cosmetical clothing to be worn over the usual equipment. The gameplay is decent. If you like this sort of chibi final fantasy style games. This is definitely worth checking out. The community is alright too.","October 15, 2015","true","42.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This was a completely fail, from what i've seen they reached the completely opposite of what they was trying with the update. Old loyal players left, even less new players are staying. Fail.\n\nKeeping in mind that they scared away a lot of players over the years before already (because pretty EVERYONE is using bot's there, because all the bugs, because no developement, because no new content, because more and more restrictions in game play, because ruining re-designs of some maps, etc.), this is the End for me at ROSE (and also for most of my friends i had there).\n\nBye ROSE. :(\n","May 16, 2015","false","864.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have played ROSE Online for Thousands of hours before Warp Portal Acquired the game.  It has an awesome art style, the gameplay mechanics are great but funky and the music is also great.\n\nThere are several worlds to explore and many upgrades and vehicles to try.
