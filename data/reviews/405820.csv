"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeliveryGodNoah/recommended/405820/","DeliveryGodNoah","DeliveryGodNoah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeliveryGodNoah/","363 products in account","I've been a VERY LONG and dedicated fan to the Turok franchise since I was a child. Turok and Turok 2 were my first FPS games I have ever played, and I played them repeatedly as a child and into adulthood.\nI have every N64 game, PC port, Gameboy game, Turok Evolution, and even the incredibly average Turok 2008 on PS3 and PC. I even dabbled in the comics, toys, and collectables.\n\nYou're, most likely, coming here from the N64 version of Turok, and that's fine. To be honest, there were few differences, even visually, from the original PC port and the N64 port of Turok: The Dinosaur Hunter. On modern systems, there were a few glitches with the PC port, such as the music randomly cutting off entirely, and some visual hiccups.\n\nThis PC version actually has some dramatic differences from the original game. First off, visually, it's certainly improved in most areas, and unnecessary in others.\nThe most important visual difference is the increased draw distance. HOLY CRAP was I surprised to see the game with increased view distance.\nDon't misunderstand, there's still fog, but it's almost doubled in the amount you can see in front of you. There was so much environmental detail obscured by the N64 fog that has now been opened for everyone to see in this PC port.\n\nAs someone who has played Turok more times than I can even hope to remember, for possibly hundreds of hours total, I actually felt like I was playing a different game entirely for a moment. To new players, you won't be at all impressed. In fact, you will for a fact say that the game looks ugly and the level design is terrible. But for long-time fans of the game, this will rebreathe life into the game visually.\n\nThe next major change is the added on visual effects. This was mostly unnecessary, but I don't dislike any of it. There's now God Rays, Bloom, real-time reflections on water, and other visual effects. Sometimes they all clutter together in a bit of a mess, other times it looks rather appealing and colorful.\nLuckily, love it or hate it, these options are toggleable. You can turn off what you want and leave on what you want. You can make the game look as close to the original PC/N64 port as you want, even as far as turning the screen resolution down to good old 1997 graphics.\n\nThe next major change is in gameplay. The original game, on N64 at least, made use of slightly clunky controls that resulted in making it impossible to do any precise aiming. To alleviate this, auto-aim was present, with no on-screen crosshair.\nIn this PC port, there's still auto-aim, but I believe you can turn it off, and even put an on-screen crosshair. Since you'll likely be using a KB+M setup, this means you can finally aim (mostly) accurately with a typical modern FPS WASD setup.\n\nAlso, thanks to the VASTLY improved framerate (as this is on PC), moving, jumping, and shooting all feels responsive, and those first person platforming sections feel more possible than ever!\n\nThere is this horribly exaggerated headbob/sway. I know the original game certainly had headbob, but with the increased control and FOV it makes the sway dizzying to a degree. Strafing left of right has Turok fling his body and perspective by almost 45 degrees. Luckily, NightDive Studios provided and made the ability to turn this option off! Barely a couple days later they released a patch and now the headbob is completely toggleable, making the game much more playable to those who get sick from dramatic perspective shifts.\n\nFinally however, there is the game environment itself. In the first level alone so far, there have been pretty sizable changes to enemy placements, environment positions, and even entire new sections of the level. Seeing these new areas made my head spin. It's mostly what you might remember, but certainly changed. I can't say if I entirely like this or not. On one hand, it's a nice change of pace, almost like I'm playing the game for the first time again. On the other, it does seem to mean that a lot I thought I knew about Turok is mostly useless. It hasn't been too drastic yet, however, but we will see how that changes as I progress in the game.\n\nThe music is still fantastic, easily my favourite percussion based soundtrack in any game EVER, fitting each level perfectly. Textures and character models are sharper and cleaner, but are exactly the same from 1997. Sound effects are also the same, though the sound design as a whole has been tweaked for the better to be more crisp.\n\nI do have a few nitpicks:\n1. No walk toggle. This was crucial in some of the platforming sections, and it seem Turok's movement speed has been slightly increased otherwise.\n2. The earlier mentioned headbob/sway.\n3. Gamepad controls feel floaty and imprecise.\n4. The map overlay shows in areas that in the previous port didn't. For examples, in the original port there were certain areas where the map did not draw, forcing you to explore, mostly in maze like areas. To 98% of players, this might be a great change, but for the 2% that have brain damage like myself, we might prefer the areas where we couldn't rely on the map.\n\nOverall, this is still Turok, one of the greatest old-school first person shooters I've ever played, and can only be topped by it's sequel, Turok 2: Seeds of Evil (Please be swift Nightdive Studios!!!)\n\nI WANT to recommend this game to newcomers, but I'm afraid most of them will ♥♥♥♥ all over it for being old and outdated.\nThis is really meant to be a game for the fans and nostalgic players, of which there are many.\n\nEdit about Price (12/17/2015): A friend of mine mentioned about the price. Currently, on release, it's sitting at $16 on sale, and $20 normally.\nPersonally, I find that $15 should be the standard price, and they could have done $10 on sale. Other people would disagree and say $10 should be the base price.\nI feel $15 is fair, for a couple reasons.\n1. The original PC port of Turok is sitting between $20-40 depending on where you look. There are a few areas where it's cheaper, but the only one I found was from Italy.\n2. The original PC port isn't guaranteed to work. I know personally I had issues getting the soundtrack to keep playing during gameplay\n3. This isn't using the original engine, meaning some work had to be put in, especially to slap on those graphical effects and the change things around. This isn't a simple updated port, there are things literally changed from the source material.","December 17, 2015","true","1.9"," 603 of 662 people (91%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","91","603","662","26","34"

The common two mistakes I see is complete laziness where DOSBox\ScummVM is used and nothing more or a game gets the Fable Anniversary treatment with new and improved graphics, but plays like crap. I personally only care about reliving the original Turok experience with all the bells and whistles this version offers (read the About This Game and Update History to learn more). To any Turok fan criticizing the price because the game was released in 1997, I invite you to play both (N64+PC Classic) then try this version out because I promise you you'll never consider going back. For any non-Turok fans I recommend buying this game at $10.00 USD. There's really not much else for me to elaborate on other than saying checkout the Update History for this game because it's clear the developers really do love Turok.\n\nEdit: A Level Editor + Workshop Support was just incorporated and I wouldn't be shocked if Multiplayer is one day added since Turok 2 is being built from scratch (as this version of Turok was) on the same custom engine.\n\nRating:\n9.7/10\n\nPros:  No DOSBox\ScummVM nonsense.\nI got to relive the original Turok experience with tons of new game settings.\nA level editor is on the way.\nMod Support\nThe game has a fog reduction setting. This drove me crazy in the N64+Classic PC Versions\nI finally got to play Turok in 1080p!\nCons:  The price might be a deal breaker for non-Turok fans. If this is the case wait until the game goes on sale for $10.00\nEveryone has a different vision of how a game should be remastered. Thankfully it was remastered precisely to my expectations, but this might not be the case for you.\nHardware Information\n\nHardware Type   Monitor Samsung 27 inch 1ms   Headphones Logitech G230   Keyboard Logitech G710 Mechanical Gaming Keyboard   Controller No Controller   Mouse Steelseries rival   Microphone Logitech G230   OS Debian Jessie Linux","February 11","true","15.8"," 167 of 181 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","167","181","3","14"

I've always been a Turok 2 fan, and I gotta say, with modern control schemes It's a lot more enjoyable and killing enemies is still really satisfying. Graphically it has aged gracefully. Even the platforming sections are not as annoying as they were before but are still really bad. The keys to unlock new levels are hidden in some sadistic areas at times, and replaying the levels over and over again is frustrating. The difficulty is somewhat lower than the original, mainly because of the modern control scheme. Dying to an enemy is actually really rare and most death will be mainly due to bad platforming sections.\n\nThe pricetag of 14.99 is honest, but when the sales are over, the game will raise it's pricetag to a less honest 19.99. The game is still great, and it definitely deserves 19.99 but it will be hard to convince someone to purchase Turok over, let's say, Resident Evil Rebirth.\n\nThe gameplay shows it's age at times, but when you blast an enemy with the automatic shotgun and seeing him coughing up blood will never get old. The game is gory and it is absolutely satisfying to kill people in this game. Being lost in this huge map, looking for the key that is hidden on a hidden platform can be really frustrating but when you kill enemies, that's where the game really hits the spot.\n\nI recommend this game, but I recommend even more it's sequel, Turok 2. Since it's Turok 1 but better at every point. No more key hunting but objectives to do, you can dismember enemies (which is really awesome), a ridiculous amount of weapons etc...\n\nThe port runs great, has tons of graphical settings and is very nice to look at.\n\nI can't thank enough Kaiser and the guys at Night Dive Studios for what they do.","December 17, 2015","true","8.1"," 231 of 276 people (84%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","84","231","276","6","23"

Turok feels completely otherworldly, playing through it's large and complex levels gives a huge feeling of adventure, like having an epic dream, the imagination and creativity behind them is astounding to say the least and they flow incredibly well.\n\nTurok also uses a checkpoint and lives system, which I think is great despite what other people say as it forces you to play the damn game instead of frequently using quicksaving and loading.\n\nAlthough this is a fine remaster, some may want to wait for a sale to come around but for me this is worth every cent, mops the floor with all bland, slow paced, railway shooters and other modern filth people call 'Videogames' these days.","December 18, 2015","true","16.7"," 126 of 157 people (80%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","80","126","157","9","18"

Dinosaurs and you are already hooked, but I shall get into detail.\n\nYou play as Turok, a Native American warrior, and the story simply revolves around you going through 8 levels of action to defeat the Campaigner from taking over the world with a legendary weapon.\nIn those 8 levels is nothing but pure and non stop with a whole assortment of gun after gun after ♥♥♥-pounding gun.\nIncluded with this levels you also get a variety of enemies that range from tribal warriors, aliens, and my favorite...dinosaurs..and dinosaurs with machine guns strapped to their backs and laser cannons for arms!\nEnough to make a kid from the 90's wet themselves.\n\nAs said the weapons arrange from the usual knives, shotguns, to rocket launchers and weapons that still to this day I have no earthly balls of a clue, all these weapons you are death incarnate.\nWhile you travel through the levels, your main goal is to collect the levels keys to advance and you also collect doritos to get a extra life once you hit 100.\n\nThe levels are really diverse as it will take time to get use to finding all the secret areas, keys, and collectables.\nLuckily you have a map to guide you through.\nControls are fast and smoothe, and sorry COD kiddies but this is an old school gem so do not expect to aim down your sights and get kills so easily, this game comes with no crosshair so you will have to settle with nothing but skill and destruction through the later levels as enemies will be harder to strike.\nGraphics for it's time are great and still hold up in my opinion, nothing to most people today...but still better than Duke Nukem Forever!\n\nMusic and sound effects are of course as awesome as ever, yeah..no complaints.\n\nOverall the game is a great throwback and addition to Steam, thank you Iguana Entertainment for this badass memory.\nRecommended? ♥♥♥♥ yes I do!\nLick it, smell it, buy it..whatever you guys want to do!\nJust play this sexy son-of-a-♥♥♥♥♥!","December 24, 2015","true","6.6"," 66 of 77 people (86%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","86","66","77","13","10"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/alicesakurai/recommended/405820/","alicesakurai","Alice Sakurai","http://steamcommunity.com/id/alicesakurai/","217 products in account","This review contains minor spoilers and self opinions.\n\nAs one of the first FPS of its generation, Turok surprised us with big enemies, big guns, big levels, lots of secrets to find and nice graphics back in early 1997. Turok has shown that the FPS genre is not limited to the Quake formula, expanding its genre with big open levels, keys, lives and a HUB, for exemple.\nGAMEPLAY:  In Turok, you are first presented in a forest. No intro, no cutscenes. The only story known is some great evil is taking the forest apart and you the Dinosaur Hunter should stop it. And that's about it.\nIn 10-30 minutes of progress through the first forest, you find out a place called The HUB where you can access any level at any time, go back to past levels and search for secrets that he left behind or keys to proceed to the future levels. This system may be nice, forcing the player to explore the level instead of just go through corridors which is very common in today's FPS, but if you miss a single key in a level you have to try the level again and again and again until you find it. It happened only once to me and believe me, it's annoying.\nYou can't save the game everywhere. Instead you find especific places to save through the levels.\nThe weapon variety is great. You start the game with a single knife and a bow. As you proceed the levels you have access to better weapons such as the pistol, the shotgun and weapons go all the way to high tech plasma rifles. The Chronoscepter is the ultimate weapon of the game that you can acquire it collecting its pieces throughout the levels of the game. Turok has a great balance with its weapons even as you proceed to the end of the game, making the player use almost every weapon he has until the end. It's fun and it works pretty well.\nThe enemies are the weak point of the game. Turok has a low variety of enemies through its levels. The enemies change while you progress, yes, but their attacks are exactly the same even if the models are different, which is unpleasent and sometimes boring. The boss' battles are weak too. If you are expecting a intense and hard experience against the bosses, you chose the wrong game to play. Their attacks have a clear pattern and the boss get very easy when you find out its patterns. Running around in circles and shooting them until the end works well with every boss.\nStill, the level design of the game is very well made. The levels are big. Not only that, they also have nice challenges with plataforms, lava, holes, fake holes, buttons to access secret passages, portals, fire, water and until the end of the game you will discovering new challenges which make the levels very interesting and different from each other. Overall, the level design is what highlight the game into a satisfying experience.\n\nGRAPHICS: Back in 1997, the graphics were great. The jungle, the animals, the fire, the water, the terrain, the weapons design, the animations, everything was made to turn Turok into a realistic and intense experience. So much that, that the Nintendo 64 had a close fog to the player and had problems with lag when the screen was full of enemies which could be annoying sometimes. Still, the enemies models are ugly with a single expression and their animations are very simple. This didn't bother me at all though, since it's still a 1997 game and I wasn't expecting much from it since most games from its time was like this. However, the weapons are very well designed and works nice together with the glowing, colored and sometimes realistic sprites. The textures have a decent resolution and it's not much detailed, I could point it as a passive point of the game's graphics.\n\nSOUND: The sounds are okay. The sound effects are not bad at all but it's not something to notice much through the game. The weak point is that the enemies voices get really repetitive as you progress but it's not much to be bothered though.\nThe music of the entire game is a bit intense with beat and drums that changes with every level you progress. They are not that memorable though.\n\nLASTING APPEAL: Since you need keys to progress the game, you will find yourself searching for every key through every level in the game if you want to get to the end of it. If you want to take the game a little further, you can search for every Chronoscepter piece too and unlock the ~ultimate weapon~ of the game. It took me 6 hours to finish the game, find every Chronoscepter piece and find half of the secrets. If you progress a little slower you can take up to 8 hours to do all this but not much more than this. The game offers cheats and about 20 secrets to find to extend the lasting appeal, but, unlike its successor, the lack of multiplayer can be unsatisfying to some people like me that likes to enjoy this kind of game with friends. All of this shouldn't go much more than 8-10 hours of playing time, but thankfully we're not paying a full price for this like back in the day.\n\nPORT: Night Dive Studios made an excelent job reviving Turok. The game features new graphics enhancements like bloom, light shafts, reflections and SSAO which can be weird for some (I personally disable them) and pleasent to others. It works fluid 60 FPS everytime in HD resolution on my GTX 460 with no problems and no patches needed. The fog are way extended and if you don't like it you can use the old N64 fog too. The keyboard + mouse works exactly the way you expect them to work and the gamepad is now adapted to be modern-like FPS, making the Turok experience even better than the Nintendo 64 one. CONCLUSION: Turok is a great shooter even for today's standards. The variety of weapons, levels and challenges sums up to make Turok a nice and intense experience. The graphics are simple and not much something to notice to, but Night Dive Studios remaster brings new graphics features which can make Turok an entirely new experience from before without lag, HD resolution and fluid animations. The controls are simple and work exactly the way you expect them to with gamepad support. If you don't like them you can change it anytime in the pause/input menu. The game is about 7-10 hours long with every secret found. The price is just about right too. If you liked the old 1997 Turok, buy and enjoy this great remastered version.\n\ntl;dr: Great remaster of the 1997 classic. If you enjoy fast-paced action, lots of guns and challenging levels, buy this.","January 7","true","5.9"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","24","26","0","0"

This was something I had hoped for a long time but never thought would happen. The original Turok games are some of the most nostalgic games from my childhood and I really couldn’t have asked for a better re-release. I have never played the PC version of this game before, so any comparisons I make will be based on my time with the N64 version.\n\nThere are a multitude of options to choose from ranging from visual to simple convenience options including things you’d usually have to edit an .ini for in almost every other game.\n\nThe game runs smooth and controls amazingly well. I doubt I could go back to playing this game with an N64 controller again after playing the remastered PC version with mouse and keyboard. The platforming and aiming in particular are far improved.\n\nGraphically there are some improvements, though the look of the game is still very much the same. The improved draw distance is definitely one of the better improvements. There is still distance fog but it is nowhere near what it was on the N64. Another one of the more noticeable additions to me was god rays, which were very surprising to see in an old N64 game. They look really nice though. A bloom effect has also been added and it looks nice, and is definitely noticeable. There are some added water effects like reflection and refraction, though the reflection effect looked pretty weird, so I disabled that one. The game comes ready for HD resolutions and automatically detects your display settings. The game immediately started for me in 1920x1080(144hz), though I did have to disable windowed mode.\n\nAnother addition to this release of the game is achievements. Definitely a welcome addition in my book, even if they are rather simple and there are only 8 of them. Hopefully trading cards will be implemented eventually also as a Turok background could be pretty cool.\n\nThere are some small glitches like blood sticking to invisible surfaces, or occasionally being able to see through a wall as you’re falling or moving in a weird way, but these are very minor and for me they don’t detract from the game at all.\n\nThe price tag seems pretty high for an old game like this especially if you’ve never played the game before and it holds no nostalgia value for you. For me this was definitely worth getting though since I have been hoping for this for so long and I’ve always loved the game.\n\n\n\nNow I just wait for Turok 2, and when that releases my life will be complete.","December 19, 2015","true","7.0"," 32 of 41 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","32","41","0","7"

Delicious old-school fun this game is: you're running around in mostly maze like levels looking for keys to open later levels while shooting everything that moves (including dinosaurs) in a captivating prehistoric(ish) environment.\n\nThe controls of this game are incredibly tight, it's absolutely spot on with all the additonal animated camera movements as it only adds to the gameplay's "actiony" feel as if I'm part of some neverending upbeat chase and the best of all that I actually am (some people might get physically sick of it, because of all the not-so-mainstream camera movements but I'm loving it)!\n\nThe almost continuously respawning enemies will make sure to never give you the time to get bored, so be sure to get those ammo supplies when you see'em!\nThe only negative thing I can name is the finalest level's random hardcore length increase. It's tolerable, but it can get annoying quickly, mostly because of the combination of overall blandness and having to listen to the final level's not so amazing music (the rest of the game's soundtrack is pretty awesome though) for 30 minutes straight (I'm not kidding).\n\nAll in all it's a very awesome game, definitely worth trying if you're into more classic games like Serious Sam or Wolfenstein.\n\nP.S.: Thunder should have been the final boss. That other guy after him may look intriguing, but he's actually MUCH easier to defeat than Thunder. I had a very cool fight with "little" Thunder there only to have my ♥♥♥ laughed off when the super dangerous final boss after him almost literally teleported into my fired rockets continuously only to have himself killed off in less than a minute. xD\n\nAlso I AM TUROK!

And now with the N64 taken out of the picture, this game feels completely different and improved in every possible way.\n\nIn fact, it kinda feels like what Doom 3 should have been ...\n\nTop-to-bottom this is an absolutely stellar PC port. There are occasional small frame rate drops in unexpected areas, but it won't hamper you in any way. This is unquestionably excellent, and you owe it to yourself to try this, even if you skipped the N64 or if you weren't around at the time of the console's tenure (and I won't judge you for either).\n\nI'm tingling at the base wondering what this could mean for Turok 2, and that was a game that sold the N64 - the game they'd always demo in the stores when showcasing the console. If Turok Dinosaur Hunter alone can be considered excellent on Steam, I have the suspicion Turok 2's going to be rocking the foundations and be considered for 2016's game of the year in the hearts of many.","December 26, 2015","true","8.9"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","20","24","0","0"

So i've never really played the originals, with that being said, i must say that if you're planning to play this game, you really need to get into the mindset of the time, a lot has change ever since then, and despite this being the best Turok  version that you can get, the game definitley shows it's ruff edges, the wonky camera that moves all over the place, the repetitive attacks and looks of different enemies, and the similarities between the atmosfere of certain levels, but it's a game from 1997 so im not really too annoyed by those things, the real annoying things for me when it comes to this version are two, the first one has to do with the relationship that the developer has stablished with the game, the price, the review of a man that has clocked in 160+ hours into the game, it's just sad to do things like that, and the irony it's that the game doesn't need a nice review, they did a good job with what they had, Night Dive studios that is.\n\nI just feel as if the complains that some people have about the graphics are not that reasonable, i get the fact that the game didn't really change that much visually, but what matters it's the fact that the freaking thing works, it's playable. As matter of fact, you can play the game at 4k resolution if you want, with fov support up to 120, so i don't get where the complains lie. If the developers had changed the graphics then you'd probrably had an amass of people complaining about that too.\nIn all in all im just happy, happy that im able to play this game, that there's actual support in the realm of pc gaming for games that i've always wanted to play but couldn't, because of my ignorance, or just simply because i didn't have any opportunity, the game runs, and looks fine for a game of it's time, and there are changes that are implented here, changes that go beyond further how the game superficially looks, or works, the a.i. has been improved, it's vicious in some cases, you can customize the level of difficulty in game options, you can also change other things, heck you can even disable or enable the weapon "bobbing", so in my opininon this guys did a neat job, the only problem it's the price, for what i've heard they first were asking for 10$, and now out of nowhere they want 20$, again as i said, that's the only issue that i have, each and every other thing seems fine to me, just rememeber, Turok it's a game about going through levels getting keys, in order to get to other levels, if you miss some the first time you play through a level, then you have to go back and get them, but i can't really blame Night Dive studios for this, as i said...

Night Dive has put a lot of love and affection into this remaster, combining the best aspects of the N64 and PC versions, and adding some improvements of their own thanks to a custom engine. It looks better, plays better, sounds better.\n\nIf you've never played Turok: Dinosaur Hunter before, I wholeheartedly recommend it, it's pretty unique among shooters. Half Quake-style fragfest, half Tomb Raider-style adventure hunt; exploring the environment is just as important as shooting the baddies, if not downright essential to progressing.

This is not to be confused with a reimagining or a remake; Night Dive Studios' mission was to clean up, repackage, and preserve the original game, and in this modest but noble goal they have succeeded.  Turok Remastered is a faithful reproduction of the retro classic, which includes all of the charming glitches from the original but none of the technical flaws.  The game is optimized for modern platforms and has never looked better on an HD display.  Minor graphical touch-ups have been added, although they are very subtle.  All in all, this is now the definitive version of the game.\n\nGameplayThere are three major elements to Turok's gameplay: combat, platforming, and exploration.\n\nCombat moves at a fast clip, as most areas of the game feature at least one respawn wave of enemies who will flank you if you backpedal from the enemies which lie ahead of you.  The enemy respawns are sometimes quick and occasionally relentless, but it never feels unfair since there are clear audio/visual cues associated with the spawn-in.  Adding to the frenetic pace is a very quick character movement speed.  Enemies can close distance in seconds and the player-character is equally agile and responsive.\n\nThe gunplay itself focuses on the player amassing an arsenal of weapons (found through exploration) and then frequently switching through the inventory wheel to pick the right tool for the job.  Unlike many modern First Person Shooters, Turok places no limit on the number of weapons that can be in the player's possession at any given time.  Additionally, unlike many of its contemporaries, Turok does not reset the player's inventory after each mission.  As a result, there's a continuous sense of character progression / growing strength.  Yet, the game also manages to gradually become more challenging as spongier, heavier-hitting enemies are introduced later in the game.  Gunplay in Turok is just as much about being accurate as it is about managing and conserving ammo; if you use too many rockets on the middle-tier enemies, you won't have them when you really need them to deal with the bigger baddies.\n\nPlatforming in Turok can be a particularly vexing mechanic, especially for newcomers.  If you haven't done a lot of platforming from a first-person perspective, get ready to learn the hard way.  Missing a jump usually means instant-death, and there is a whole lot of unskippable jumping in this game.  Not even cheat codes can help you get past these segments, so it's a skill you must be committed to mastering if you plan to play the game to completion.\n\nExploration is a large part of the game, and it's one of the most-rewarding.  Turok's level design is smarter than meets the eye, often employing subtle environmental clues to lead the player in unexpected directions.  Some levels are more linear than others, but all of the game's eight major regions are full of secret areas off the beaten path.  Diligent exploration is rewarded with upgraded-ammo, extra life tokens, keys to open new levels, and early access to more-powerful weapons.  The trickiest and most-rewarding collectables of all are the hidden pieces of the game's ultimate weapon: The Chronosceptor.  It should also be noted that, while some of the mandatory pickups (namely: level keys) are easy to miss, backtracking hardly takes any time thanks to the extremely fast player movement speed.\n\nAestheticsTurok was originally released towards the beginning of the N64's lifecycle when 3D gaming was still relatively new to the masses.  Turok was one of the better-looking 3D games of its time, but to virgin eyes I imagine that it must look really rough around its sharp, polygonal edges.  Luckily, Night Dive Studios has cleaned up some of the original game's glaring technical flaws.  Most apparent among them are the oppressive fog and draw distance.  If you remember the N64 game fondly then you'll definitely appreciate how much easier it is to see where you're going in the remastered version.  No longer does the fog hide enemies standing five feet in front of your face.  However, Night Dive has tastefully decided not to eliminate the fog completely, preserving the some of the mysterious, haunting aesthetic of the original without compromising playability.\n\nTrue to the original, the music is serviceable enough but doesn't stand out.  It's thematically appropriate but not very interesting.  There's a lot of minimalist, primitive-sounding percussion, but the music loops too frequently and conspicuously to effectively blend into a subtle, immersive, atmospheric texture.  The sound effects are actually rather humorous at times, which breaks the mood a little but is generally joyful.\n\nFinal ThoughtsThis is a solid game.  And the remaster-- price not considered in this review-- doesn't come across as a simple cash-grab, in my opinion.  True, very little has been added to the game.  But Night Dive Studios has made too many considerate, tasteful decisions for me to be cynical about it.  Turok Remastered is a technically flawless, unadulterated, minimally upgraded port of one of the great N64 shooters, and I recommend it to anyone who still occasionally revisits and enjoys playing the classics.","April 18","true","9.7"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","1"

Brings a tear to my eye and hope for the future of Turok. As for this game, don't even get me started. Night Dive Studios did an amazing job porting this game to PC the right way. Everything that a PC game should have, is there. Mind you, this game is old, N64 old. So they could only do so much for the graphics, although there's a handful of options, more than you would expect from a game this old. The game plays like a charm. Super responsive controls unlike the original PC/N64 version. My only gripe is that they didn't add a "save anytime/anywhere" function. It's vanilla as can be as only being able to save between levels, just like the Original. That's both a bad and good thing; Bad, because these levels are HUGE and not everybody has the patience to beat a level in one sitting and good, because it adds to the challenge.\n\nTurok is an amazing game and the steep price shouldn't hold you back. There's idiots out there that pay $120 for a game with little content. *cough*Star Wars Battlefront *cough* I can't wait to see how they fix the FPS issue with Turok 2: Seeds of Evil because that game suffered from very bad frame drops in the N64 and PC port.\n\nI highly recommend this game!\n","January 6","true","10.6"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Turok really feels like a product of its time and that isn't necessarily a bad thing. It might not be as widely remembered from the 90s like other games such as Doom, Quake, Half-Life etc. but it still very much is an enjoyable shooter. What this enhancement offers is a much farther draw distance than the original PC port which was nearly untouched from the N64 version, some modern PC options like antialiasing, bloom, as well as some others. Gameplay is very satisfying with an excellent arsenal that really ranks up there with games like Unreal for pure gun porn. As far as negatives go the platforming is just downright sadistic with very little room for failure and it can be very easy to get lost in the giant levels. I also don't think many of us really understand how spoiled we are with autosaving since it isn't here instead with limited save points and checkpoints. In all reality though it is hard to blame a product of the time era that was built with the N64 in mind and it wasn't enough to detract from the experience for me and I would would highly recommend it.","April 15","true","10.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

I have played around a bit with it as a child, but never really played it seriously. Instead, I had a lot of fun back then just putting in the cheat codes, unlock all weapons and cause some havok on the enemies. Seeing this gem back on modern systems with improved handling and support for modern screen resolution is great. The game still plays like a charm and has an odd but lovely personality to it. The game world seems to be one giant drug trip, which is quite entertaining to experience. The fluid movement, the iconic and - later in the game - extremely powerful weapons are still fun these days. Some of those weapons are just ridiculous, filling the entire screen with satisfying gigantic explosions. :D\nThe levels contain secrets to find and encourage exploration. The soundtrack with jungle drums keeps you at a good pace.\n\nTalking about the value for the price: I think that this refresh is quite overpriced, given that the game just needed a few adjustments to work well on modern machines. I can see that aquiring the license might have had its price for the studio and that the audience is quite small, so the price can't be super cheap. Anyway: the game is super fun and I would definitely recommend to buy and play it. If the price tag is too high for you, wait for a sale - but Turok definitely deserves a place on your wishlist.","May 18","true","3.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

The added lighting is nice, the ability  to remap the controls to whatever you want is a much needed addition, as is the ability  to change the F.O.V. (though this  could use a little work but definitely glad it's there!)the new water effects and godrays are very  nice And the game  overall as a whole runs beautifully (can't say  this for the original release outside of period specific hardware!)\n\nAnd now for the  "less than expected" change the  secrets are not all in the same location so if you're a completionist of the original or a speedrunner this will throw you for a loop.\n\nJust about almost all of the game had to be re-written using the original source code. ( This must have been a hell of a task.)\nAs someone whom owns the original release of this on the N64 and the  PC CD rom release  yeah  getting even the installer to  work on anything  past a Windows 95 machine is a  total  NIGHTMARE.\nAnd even if you got that release to  work on that hardware I  hope ya  got a 3DFX Voodoo 3 or better installed.\n\nThe original PC CD rom release is almost completely incompatable with newer hardware and well anything under that mentioned spec back in the day and  you could count the frames of animation.\n\nI've been seeing a  LOT of people  whining  "The Steam version of  Turok is too expensive."\nTo this I retort " Shut it  ya ungratful,entitled, spoiled, self centered Millenial brats. Try getting an N64, working controller and a copy of this game for less...let me know  how that works out for you."\n\nSadly most of this new generation will not appreciate games that don't hold their hand or first person shooters which aren't some  crappy yearly sequel to  CoD.\n\nIf ya dug this game during it's original  pc release or it's N64 cart release and "get it" just buy it.  It's mostly  unchanged barring optimization and function . It's a wonderful  game.\nIf ya don't  get it.. then quit your ♥♥♥♥♥in' and go do something positive with your lives.\n\nAnd for those of us  whom really dig it, well Turok 2 will be right around the corner!

I've secretly loved this series from the sidelines for awhile now but now have a new revamped nostaglia to give this series a try.\n\nI hope that Night Dive Studios continues in their pursuits of revitalizing this wonderful series. Like some of my fellow steam users, I have the option of playing this on the Nintendo 64 for about ("$12.00") on eBay +shipping ("$13.00") or simply playing the existing copy of Seeds of Evil that I currently own and the thought had crossed my mind and  I assume yours as well. Although, I much prefer my computer over most consoles these days. For that extra $13.00. I want to believe it's worth more to support Night Dive Studios.\n\nWhat you are paying for is another copy of Turok: Dinosaur Hunter with enhanced graphics and gameplay mechanics. What your purchase means though. It is a contribution, that will help Night Dive Studio's continue to remaster the turok series possibly. Depending, upon the sales of Turok: Dinosaur Hunter and Turok: Seeds Of Evil. With wishful thinking may lead to another project in which there is a new turok experience. Say 2018. Feeling nostalgic, this game is for you.\n\nA young friend of mine, I was talking to him the other day about how great this game was and still is after 18 years.. What's Turok. So I barried him out backyard with my trusty shovel, no seriously this is a great opportunity to both preserve and showcase to the newer generations. Preservation of an "Old but not obselete" piece of gaming history. - Terminator Genisys\n\nGameplay Final Review: Normal Mode\n\nA fun enjoyable experience to remember, old school mechanics, no reloading firearms, ammunition and health a plenty, remember to save often at the hub and or during levels as they are pretty lengthy, lots of high jumps off of ledges and walking along cliffsides, simple yet sometimes surprisingly clever puzzles, step-on-that, step-on-this, collect that and secret areas. Swimming was an interesting mechanic that I thoroughly enjoyed. Loved shooting just about everything, tribesmen, the variety of dinosaurs in this game. Lots of enemy varieties so you will not be bored by repetition. Was surprised by the fact that the raptors regenerate. Collecting the Chronoscepter pieces is a nice little sidequest that pays off in the end.\n\nAsk me, is it still worth $22. I am satisfied with my purchase and have played at least 12.8 dedicated hours of this title, however there was an issue with the sound and was not available to me during my experience from the start to end. Which in all honesty was a little upsetting and disapointing after waiting 18 years to play this but overall a great experience. Bearing this in mind,  I am looking forward to the entire series being remastered, as well the next remastered sequel Turok: Seeds of Evil, I still have not passed Level 2 after all these years. Help me out Night Dive Studios with sound this time.\n\nI want to believe, what do you believe in Steam users? X-Files :)\n\nNote-worthy issue:\n\n- Sound cuts out for some reason? Quick fix, listen to the Original Soundtrack on youtube using your phone while you play. Although you will miss out on SFX of firearms, cutscenes and creatures as you watch them go through their scripted death rattles lol.\n\n- Night Dive Studios, released this title on steam as of December last year.

When Turok was a new title I only had access to a Playstation 1. As a result I'm confident that I hold no real nostalgia for the series. The only reason I bought this Steam release of Turok was from the suggestion of a friend and that I like Night Dive Studios who thankfully rescued System Shock 1 and 2 from being abandonware. For me the worst case scenario would be getting my money back through a refund.\n\nI am happy to say that I've enjoyed my first hour and the first level of Turok and I'm certain I'll be coming back for more if not completing the full game. If you're like me and miss the days of FPS being "Doom-Clones" I am certain you will like Turok. The weapons are satifying to shoot, the enemies (ranging from Beasts to Humanoids who look like Scarecrows) all have lovely littlle death animations. The level design itself is one of the most interesting features. Whereas Doom and Quake had bitesized levels Turok has 8 levels. If each one is as big as Level 1 this is a fairly large game to explore. Much like Doom you're given a map and I personally find it enjoyable to see a blank map become filled out as you run around and kill everything that moves. I don't think you have to rely on a map much in this version but I'm sure it was a godsend for the console release with incredibly small draw distances the N64 version featured. To break up what could be a very repetitive game you have bits of platforming that I find enjoyable, only once or twice did I fall to my death so far.\n\nThere's some story about your lead character being a Time Traveller who has to stop some weapon from falling into the wrong hands but make no mistake you're just a Doomguy with a Indian Headress on. You're just going to be killing every monster in sight.\n\nLike most action games with simple controls this game has aged very well, the primitive graphics are colorful and the game feels silky smooth in 1080p. The only thing I'm not digging is the music as at least in Level 1 it's just a repetitive jungle beat MIDI playing constantly. Sadly not every game can have a soundtrack composed by Trent Reznor.\n\nThe price is a tad bit steep, I'm used to paying only $10 for rereleases of 5th Gen games but when you consider Night Dive Studios made a brand new engine the extra $5 doesn't seem so bad for the work put into it. I say if you like an old school shooter get it and party like it's 1997.","December 20, 2015","true","2.8"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","69","11","16","5","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/midniteneon/recommended/405820/","midniteneon","midniteneon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/midniteneon/","288 products in account","[TL;DR AT BOTTOM]\n\nThis game brings me back to the summers of 1998 to 2001. I would fly down with my family to Florida to spend a few weeks at our condo. I always remember looking forward to seeing my cousin every summer because of the endless nights of gaming on the N64 and PS1 with no bedtime with him. I forgot how many hours we ended up spending on classics like Shadows of the Empire, Goldeneye, Dino Crisis... You name it! The one game that sticks out most to me from this time period is none other than Turok.\n\n18 years later this game is as much of a masterpiece now as it was then, but I would wager that it takes an older breed of gamer to truly appreciate the admittedly clunky mechanics of what made Turok so great in 1997.\n\nThis is a great re-release/remaster of the 1997 Acclaim title done by Night Dive Studios. They are more known for what they have done to the System Shock series, first porting them over to modern PC systems, and then announcing they will be working on a remake of the original. I would say that this is a proper re-release, but I have no doubt that others will clearly disagree with me.\n\nYes, this is a game that begs for nostalgia goggles to be worn-- but then again, this is the game as we imagined it in our young(er) heads after all, is it not? Coming back to play classic titles can sometimes be a depressing experience, as we notice flaws formerly looked over, or things that in general, just don't hold up. This is not the case here.\n\nFor starters, this game got a graphical overhaul. It runs on, reportedly, an entirely new engine. While most of the textures look primarily the same, it is a bit refreshed. Probably the biggest fix is the draw distance fog-- it hardly exists anymore and you can see heaps more of the game as it was intended to be seen. There are tons of graphical options to tinker with in-game, but this is hardly a taxing game by any standards. I am running the game at 1080P and it never dips below 60FPS. The "enhanced" graphics might not appeal to some, and may not impress others, but this was one thing the game sorely needed.\n\nAs far as I can recall this is about the same game we got in '97, I don't believe anything was added or removed story-wise. Gameplay however is much smoother. No more fiddling around with an N64 controller anymore, praize da lawd. Platforming is a breeze now.\n\nI would like to say that this game and its playstyle will likely polarize modern gamers. This is probably not something the COD/Rocket League crowd would enjoy. It's a slow burn you have to grind your way through, similar to Dark Souls, but not as difficult, and more rewarding.\n\nThe sound design is notably improved, with a higher fidelity soundtrack, and better quality sound effects.\n\nNative controller support is very comfortable and all the controls are totally mappable to whichever configuration you prefer.\n\nIf you want a great, classic single player FPS game to play, look no further, but just bear in mind this is probably not for everybody!\n\nI would like to express my thanks to Night Dive Studios for not merely pushing out a product that was not touched in 18 years, but instead, putting hard work into bringing back the glory of the 1990s with Turok's remaster. Thank you!\n\nTL;DR Section\n\nPros:\n-Vastly improved graphics and gameplay mechanics\n-Native controller support\n-Well written, self-contained storyline\n-Nice 21st century touches such as updated HUD\n-Difficult, but rewarding and fun gameplay\n-Dinosaurs\n-Huge levels with emphasis on collecting everything\n-Did I mention dinosaurs?\n\nCons:\n-Textures do not hold up well at all. I would have enjoyed some refreshed textures\n-No mod support (yet)\n-No force feedback for controllers\n-AI is hit or miss\n-No online play/co-op\n-High price point probably a turn off to most\n-Difficulty/playstyle not for everyone\n\n\n9/10","December 17, 2015","true","4.1"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

We meet again.\n\nMy first ever FPS! From my younger days of Christmas time, unwrapping my parents gift to me. Nintendo 64 along with Mario 64! What a great Christmas.. I later purchased Turok and Turok 2 after falling in love with Acclaim and their incredible dinosaur hunter game. Clunking around with the (at the time) state of the art nintendo joystick controller. What can I say. This game has nostalgia written allover it!\n\nThe review.\n\nIts Turok for ♥♥♥♥s sake. This game is absolutely incredible and what I have been asking for, for the past 10 years.. Myself-"Oh hey. I wish someone would buy Acclaim's rights and pick up the old Turok games" ......Friend-"oh yeah that would be awesome!"...Myself-"Yeah, I hope they include PC, that would be amazing!"\n\nAfter all of these years, I am so glad to find that someone has decided to bring this game back to life.\nThe game play itself is somewhat linear, yet it leaves room for exploration. There is much more than dinosaurs here. Awesome weapons and very fluid controls. There are a few graphical improvemenets, such as light rays, increased view distance and FOV. The gameplay is the same... Which is all I could ask for.\n\nIf you have never dabbled in the Turok line of games. This may be a hard pill to swallow. The price is absolutely ridiculous for such a dated title.. I paid $14.99 usd for this game on sale from $19.99. I would have never paid that price, however I was overcome by excitement and nostalgia.. I think, In fairness someting along the lines of $9.99 with a $4.99 sale price would fit well. Nevertheless.. This game is absolutely worth a play!\n\nIf you have played the Turok games and are like myself. This was a no brainer. Turok on steam.. What a beatiful thing! The game plays absolutely beautifully on just a modest computer. I wish the price was a little lower, however. This team has resurrected one of my most favorite titles, in a flwaless manor,  and is working on Turok 2 Seeds of Evil. I am actually proud to fund them on their venture, and I cant wait to play the second title.","December 26, 2015","true","2.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/geoluz/recommended/405820/","geoluz","GeoLuz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/geoluz/","180 products in account","I never played Turok: Dinosaur Hunter when it first came out in 1997. I remember that it was considered a classic adventure game in first person and a technological breakthrough. Turok has been remastered nearly 20 years later. While the remastered version has graphically improved, it still is not up to today’s graphics standards.\n\nThe basic plot of the game is cliché and ordinary. The game stars a Native American who is up against an extraterrestrial villain named the Campaigner, who steals the Chronoscepter and ends up being scattered throughout the 8 levels. Turok must fight against dinosaurs and ancient people throughout the various levels which consists of temples and villages, but later levels look like sci-fi sectors.\n\nIn the beginning Turok may look like an FPS game, but it is truly a first person adventure game. It requires plenty of platform jumping in order to navigate each level. If you’re looking for the many secrets in the game you will have to do even more jumping such as jumping long gaps and many pillars. The gameplay and the environments feel old school and can provide nostalgia to those who play the 1997 version of the game.\n\nThe enemies feel old school and consist of velociraptors and mercenaries. The violence in this game is palpable, as you can see blood squirting out of the mercenaries as they die at your hands using the arsenal of shotguns, assault rifle, minigun, and rocket launcher. The enemy A.I. is good, but not great. Sometimes a mercenary will circle around you to hit you, but at other times it won’t.\n\nOther old school elements include the health pickups and ammo scattered across each level. There are keys to pick up in order to access subsequent levels. This means you can return to previous levels to find keys that you may have missed. The save stations are far between each other throughout each level. This means you will have to dedicate some time to the game before finally reaching a save point. There is no quick save feature to help you. Yes, there are checkpoints but they are only good if you die. Upon dying you will be returned to the last checkpoint you crossed. There is the old number of lives system showing how many lives Turok has left. This lives system feels quite archaic.\n\nWhile this game is not up to today’s graphics standards, I do give Night Dive Studios credit for putting forth the decent effort for improving Turok’s graphics. The frame rate has occasional stuttering that can be a little bothersome at times. My FPS instantly decrease from 60 to 35, then increase to 47 and back to 60. It is a minor annoyance, but I think this problem could have been addressed in a patch.\n\nI think Turok is worth playing again for those who played this game back in the late 1990s. The game is technically smoothed out and optimized for modern hardware. I think Night Dive Studios is on the right track when it comes to making remastered versions of games. At 20 bucks or on a future sale Turok would be a decent game to buy if you love first person platform jumping and exploration.\n\nMy Score: 7/10\n","May 22","true","23.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","2"

I reccomend anybody to download this and play it. Why? This game was one of the best shooters for its time, and it changed FPS for the better. Same with Turok 2:Seeds of Evil. This is a game where you can sit down and run through it, and then run through it over and over, with the same enjoyment.\n\nYou will not be dissapointed, especially with the draw distance the way it is. Now, lets get into some things you might run into you don't like.\n\nThere is a difficulty setting, easy, normal, hard, harcore. Hard and Hardcore are a little buggy, considering what changes are the enemies basically sliding across the loor like its an ice rink, making them hard to hit. I don't reccomend you try hardcore until the next update.\n\nDying by enemies such as soldiers, or raptors, low level enemies, is extremly rare considering you will have weapons that WILL kill them fast. Bad platforming actions or decissions usually land you a reload or losing a life.\n\nBosses are exceptionally easy if you are used to strafing and shooting.\n\nIf you are looking for a good adventure, first-person shooter and puzzle game, all meshed up into one video game, this is the game for you. If Turok 2 comes out, thats even better, because for its time, these games, changed FPS. As said above.\n\nGreatest tip: Check around THE ENTIRE ROOM when you enter it. If you are looking for something, it can be sadistically crammed into a spot.

I can not recommend this any more for those people that enjoyed the original N64 version. I will have to mention i did notice a few new things that changed... they are minor things but they help out the game i feel for the better.\n\nFirst thing... some level layouts have been changed just slightly to give a better chance of finding the things you need... no more obscure "must climb this almost hidden wall to get the 2nd key in level 1" they changed that area a bit to have the key in a much more obvious and harder to miss spot... and honestly it confused me a bit when i came around the corner to see the new area... things like this happen maybe once every level or two... its very subtle but helps with the flow of the game alot more.\n\nSecond thing i noticed.. and i could be wrong... but in the original N64 version of the game when you hit 9 lives and 99 life force... and tried to pick up another.. it would roll the lifeforce over to 0 without giving an aditional life. This version rectifies it by preventing you from ever picking up a life force if you are at maximum... you will never waste those Triangles anymore!\n\nI find these two subtle but very useful fixes made the game even better for me... and seeing the game running at 60 fps on even my potatoe of a system is a possitive. even with all the settings on i got little frame drops when looking at the sun but that is because of the new optional bloom and sunray effects they added to try and make it feel a bit better.\n\nin my oppinion.. this game is perfect... and hearing this company is going to be releasing turok 2 as well.. ooooo i am excited for this... definately pick this up when you can... the price is a bit steep especially compared to the console version used ... but its better than buying it new... this game goes for $400 on online auctions for the console... and this version is far far supieriour to the half baked port we got when it originally came out in 1997. If you really want the authetic feel.... grab a USB N64 controller online and hook it up... from the looks of it its compatible with gamepad rebindings so you can get an authetic feel of the game.","December 24, 2015","true","15.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/marukyuutie/recommended/405820/","marukyuutie","Marukyuu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/marukyuutie/","480 products in account","IntroductionLet me just start this off by saying that I've never played this game before it was released on Steam, so this review won't be from the perspective of a guy with nostalgia goggles, however I believe that my love for Turok is partially fuelled by the fact that I've always been a huge fan of the Quake series. I had heard of Turok before, but I never batted an eye until I saw that it was released on Steam. I took the plunge and bought it, and I'm so glad I did.\n\nHow well does the game play?The gameplay in Turok is sort of what you'd expect from a mid-to-late 90s, no-nonsense first person shooter. Turok's gunplay is fast-paced and feels fairly fluid, however Turok isn't all about gunplay. Turok will put you at platforming segments or require you to explore in order to find certain keys. If heights aren't your thing then Turok may or may not be a game you want to play, especially in one of the later levels, and while Turok may not be as fast paced as Quake, it's definitely a game that will require you to be aware at all times.\n\nYou may die a few times in Turok, or even more than a few times. In other games, it'd be like "Oh no I forgot to save/quicksave and now I have to go back ages!" or "Oh no, it saved automatically at this boss and I have little to no HP left!" However, in Turok, there are checkpoints in the levels (and savepoints, don't forget those!) but when you die, you will respawn at that checkpoint with all of your health, but that's dependent on whether you have extra lives or not.\n\nWhat about the graphics?You see, this is where the game sort of falls short, because even with the enhancements made to the visuals, it still doesn't hold up as well. However, it was mentioned that they improved the water visuals, adding reflections and refraction, and it blends in with the old-school visuals that the game provides. The draw distance is a minor interference but in Turok's case it can add to the tension with the platforming sections.\n\nAnd opinions on the sound design?Meh, it's something that could have been done better. I hate having to hear obnoxiously loud grunting while my character climbs up vines and transitions between caves and the outside aren't too great either, however other than that the sound design for Turok isn't too bad and it's passable.\n\nYour overall opinion on Turok?If you're a fan of fast paced, no nonsense first person shooters such as Quake, then Turok is definitely for you. This game is as old-school as old-school gets. It's a game that all first person shooter fanatics should play at least once. While the visuals don't hold up, the gameplay itself is the real deal. Though for a game as old as Turok, I would advise waiting for the price to lower. £14.99/$19.99 is quite a lot to pay for a game from 1997, but if you're new to the franchise it may seem reasonable.

The developers have excellent communication on the forums and the game even just had a patch today to fix a few issues. Beyond reliving a forgotten legend in a land before time I also feel good knowing this game is being taken care of by people with a geniune love for classics such as this. Even if the price feels a bit steep, I am going to be having a lot of fun modding the game and making new levels and enjoying the new ones made by other people.\n\n\nA classic piece of gaming history, one of the most influential console shooters that had its release date become known as "Turok Tuesday". Featuring over a dozen of high tech awesome weaponry across 8 huge and varied levels battling foes ranging from disposable mercenaries to killer cyborgs it can easily be said that Turok has lost none of its attitude in the decades gone by.\n\nIf you can justify the price, there is no regrets with jumping in. I've already had a blast reliving my childhood and modding the hell out of the game, what are you waiting for? This makes the N64 version and even the 1997 PC version look like a complete joke.\n\nNightdive has done it, Turok wasn't happy with just Tuesday, he has Thursday now too.","December 18, 2015","true","8.8"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","1"

Feels like Turok, Plays like Turok, and sounds even better than the original.I do wear nostalgic glasses but Iam not high.\n\nBought it and now iam returning it but why? - The fact that I saw 160 hours on his review, has one before the game with achievements and time is out just begs for a slam and seems fishy and people are calling him out for it. Updated : Just found out hes a dev/beta tester/ shill, No that is an AUTOMATIC THUMBS DOWN from me and just raises red flags big time so I returned it instead because i felt I bought into something really shady, hence why. Would had kept the thumbs up and keep the copy if they were more HONEST.\n\nDo I hate it? Nope, Is it pretty good? Yep. Would I recommend you buying it? Why not, sure. Would I buy it again? Yes when its on sale. Am I too poor that I can't afford the price? Nope I own thousands of video games on steam and on consoles so my stance is quite different.\n\n\nReasons to buy? Buy it if you must own Turok again huge Turok fan or think 20 price is reasonable.\nIf you think the price is steep wait for sale.\n\n\n\nIf you post on the bottom mad at someone who made an opinion about the product even though I recommend it? I'am sorry for killing your childhood with a thumbs down for being a consumer or that you failed to understand the issue of why I thumbed it down. You know you can do me a favor about it right? Start telling Steam to rework thier review system in general on how it works. and also I'll be rebuying this game at a later date when it is at the sale price which doesn't count as abuse.\nThis review is just an opinion, so don't like it or you don't get the point? Move on theres plenty of others to read.\n\nThink of it this way, Game is labled at 20 dollars\ngoes on sale first day 15.99, till dec 25th\nnow being extended to jan 5th\nget the picture?

If you like older, Doom style games, you'll most likely enjoy Turok.\n\nThe story of Turok is very simple. You are Turok, and you hunt dinosaurs. The game starts you off right into the action with very little context on what is actually going on. This could annoy some people, but it doesn't pull away from the immersion at all. Although this lack of story can make the latter half of the game make little to no sense storywise.\n\nTurok has a very fast movement speed which is a nice change from the sluggish sharpshooters from today. This makes the game playable at any pace you would like, whether you want to speed through or explore the levels.\n\nWhen it comes to the levels themselves, many of them are fairly forgettable in design, but some have a genuinly interesting theme and layout. Either way, they are all fun to explore, with tons of secrets in every level.\n\nThe combat is responsive, and very satisfying with a large variety of weapons to find and use. As an added bonus, none of the weapons feel redundant or outshined by others (with the exception of a few), which allows a lot more options when you're tackling either a boss, a particularly beefy mob, or your average joe of an enemy. Turok also does a good job when it comes to ammunition drops, which seems like a weird thing to think about, but it manages to sit on a fine line, where i needed to be mindful of my ammo, but at the same time I didn't feel the need to be overly conservative with the weapons that I used.\n\nWhile you will be seeing some of the same mobs a lot, there is a nice variety of enemies that keeps the combat from getting too stale and repetative, especially in the last few levels.\n\nOne problem I had with the game however, was that I wasn't %100 certain on what I was actually supposed to be doing. The game does a pretty poor job of telling you what you need to do in the beginning, and you can easily get lost on the first level. If you can get past this however, then it should be easy to figure out what you need to be doing for the rest of the game.\n\nIf you have played a lot of games like doom, then you will not be disappointed with Turok. If you are new to this style of gameplay, then Turok is an excellent introduction to other games like it. While Turok is not necessarily an innovative game, it is a fun one that does what it does well and is definatly worth the $20.","February 21","true","6.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

In an age where graphics are pristine and beautiful, this game definately is dated. I mean, it did come out in 1997 after all. But the gameplay is so addicting and even though the jumping puzzles are infuriating at times, it always leaves me trying again and again and wanting more.

It's such an honour to be able to play this game on Steam. I have grown up with Turok: Dinosaur Hunter as well as Turok 2: Seeds of Evil. I feel that someone picking up the game for the first time won't appreciate this masterpiece. I am more than impressed with Night Dive Studios and all their hard work and dedication to this franchise, so I say thank you! Thank you for giving life back to this 18 year old treasure! Please don't be discouraged about the price of this game, yes it's a little on the high end but that gives no reason to hate on it. I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes retro shooters and dinosaurs! Let's not forget the achievements that came with it! :)\n\nOther Notes: Runs perfect at 1080p 60 fps with no hickup on my GTX 750 Ti.","December 18, 2015","true","11.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

AM TUROK!"\n\n*ALSO TL;DR: 9/10 game, GO PLAY IT! SO SAYS TUROK! SON OF STONE! *And so also says some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on the internet**\n\nThis game is amazing, and also pretty surprising...It is hard as hell yet its never super unfair, Secrets, save points, a good progression of threats as you go through each and every level. Eventually culminating in the final showdown, and how easy or hard it is well and truely depends not just on skill, but also on how well you know of secrets *The ultimate weapon *which only has 3 shots* Can only be used if you find all the pieces of the Chronoscepter* Though on the other hand you can cheat like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and get the Ultimate weapon with unlimited ammo...and watch the game's difficulty suddenly just shatter like a wine glass.\n\nAlso knifing dinosaurs is pretty satisfying, even though everyone pretty much just autotracks you, they are pretty fragile, unlike you but they can stack up damage, it forces you to use every single gun in your arsenal even in the later levels because ammo starts getting scarce.\n\nIf I had any complaints, its more the feeling of some cheap deaths but if you know just what to look for, you actually can avoid that. *Also you can remove the Fog of War which helps LOADS especially in the final levels.*\n\nOverall I give this game a 9/10 in my opinion.","April 7","true","11.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

While the last two levels have a huge difficulty spike and the earlier ones are kinda easy, the game is enganging from beginning to end.\nThe level design is also more elaborate and complex than in many of today's shooters, especially if you consider how many (well hidden) secrets this game has.\nBesides the kinda uneven difficulty balancing, the only downside of this game comes with some weird technical hiccups. Eventhough I'm running it off an SSD, there are is some occasional stuttering when it loads some sound clips. The public beta patch fixed it to some degree, but not completely.\n\nI hope Night dive studios goes ahead and gives Turok 2 a similar treatment, but without the mostly minor technical difficulties.\n\n\nJust, don't play it if you REALLY hate fist person platforming.","May 13","true","11.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Most everything else remains the same blurry texture outside of bloom and a few other options.\n▼ The biggest change is the controls ▼\n• Mouse and Keyboard feels best, but even the controller support gets an update with duel joystick.\n• Platforming is a LOT easier due to the tighter controls. The jumps can still be tricky, but you won't be fighting with the camera like with the original game.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS:\nIf you're a fan of the original Turok, you won't regret this purchase. If you're new to the game, it's a harder decision. I think the game speaks for itself so here's a First Look video to see the game in action.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIsBrvqDkDM","December 19, 2015","true","6.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

No horrid mouse input here.  In addition, there are many new gameplay and input options, the UI has been redesigned slightly, there are new graphics features as the description says, and the levels have been redesigned in a few areas (for better or worse).  The more modern draw distance actually makes some parts much easier, but it's good to have acceptable draw distance.\n\nWidescreen support is fine.  I run it at 2560 x 1440 144 Hz with no issues related to this, however\n\nFor those who never played Turok, know that this game is known primarily for two things: setting and weapons.  The setting is distinct; The Lost Land, a place that looks ancient in some areas with its ancient ruins, overgrown jungles and dinosaurs.  Fast forward to levels 7 and 8 which are filled with aliens and massive Sci-Fi constructs.  Like other classic FPS games, Turok is filled with hidden areas so be sure to explore.\n\nAnd the weapons... the Turok franchise has always had some of the coolest weapons you'll find in FPS gaming, although the sequels are better in this regard.\n\nThis remake has some bugs though.  Sound is glitchy like the original PC version and unlike the N64 version, and setting projectile collision to Precise just crashes my game.  It also has only preset FOV values but you can edit them yourself in config.cfg with any text editor.  Likewise an FPS cap is in place (60); you can try removing it but do so at your own risk.  I haven't tested it myself but the originals get insane when the frame rate is too high, since game logic was tied to frame rate.\n\nMost of the original cheat codes still work, although the gallery cheat (THBST) seems to be gone.","December 17, 2015","true","6.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is a great WASD/mouse keyboard game but if you want to, you can bind a controller to it. Personally, i feel the mouse works just fine for the type of game this is.\n\nTurok is loaded with secret areas, hilarious AI and a nice variety of weapons. One play through i am guessing takes about 5-6 hours depending on how quickly you move through the levels. Ammo conservation is key to winning this. It can be challenging to learn how to aim at first but do the tutorial and you can get the hang of it quickly.\n\nThe levels are expansive, and often provide multiple paths.

He is the inheritor of a familial mantle that both compels and empowers him to -- well, you know what. None of that is actually important right now, because it's hardly mentioned in the game. And that's for the better, really. The comic books that inspired the game were absolutely all over the place in terms of tone and setting, as seems to be the standard for the medium.\n\nSuffice it to say, you play the role of an awesome Native American warrior who handles ultra high-tech future weapons just as well as he does the bows and knives of his heritage. You travel the Lost Land - a realm parallel to our own in which time has no conventional meaning, and creatures and technologies from countless other universes coexist - in a quest to assemble a forbidden superweapon and use it to take down the evil Campaigner. The Campaigner is like a cybernetic Genghis Khan, only worse, and he's raised a bloodthirsty army to wreak havoc upon the Lost Land and beyond.\n\nTurok was a technological marvel in its time. It's got wide-open spaces like Unreal and it sports the fast-and-furious run-and-gun of Quake, and it blends the best of those two games together. The result remains unique still today because nothing else out there plays quite like Turok does. It's not your typical shooter. Turok requires an adventurer's touch, as the game is just as much about exploring massive, mysterious hand-built environments as it is shooting velociraptors in the face with explosive arrows.\n\nTherein lies the problem most modern gamers are likely to encounter playing this game. Turok is linear to a point, but the action takes place in fairly large, often vertical, outdoor areas, and it's easy to get lost if you don't pay attention. The game doesn't lead you around with big glowing waypoints, either, and uncovering the sprawling environs' many secrets is crucial to getting through the game without cheating. The game utilizes an atypical hub system that links all its levels together. Teleporters to the various lands are opened using keys Turok must uncover along the way. You'll need to find the keys that are scattered throughout the levels in order to proceed through the game.\n\nIf you lack the patience to explore - and you like your games on a leash - then you should know up front that Turok is probably not for you. But if you're anything like me, you're sick of modern shooters and their over-reliance on scripted set-pieces. I find Turok's open-ended, "archaic" approach to be a breath of fresh air so many years after playing it last. Exploring the world and finding a well-hidden secret brings a real, palpable sense of accomplishment, the kind of breath-stealing "eureka!" moment that very few recent titles manage to evoke even once.\n\nThe various levels are varied and interesting, and are underscored with an abundance of ambient sound effects and a truly bizarre drums-and-synths soundtrack that stands out on its own and is instantly recognizable. Though it began life as an early N64 game, Turok has atmosphere in spades. Its enemy design can only be described as eclectic. Velociraptors with cybernetic gun arms are awesome. Insectoid aliens with plasma rifles? Those are great, too. Sometimes, their armor malfunctions when you kill them, and they struggle against their inevitable explosive demise. Even better. Killer plants, overgrown bugs, armor-clad mercenaries with pulse rifles and tank-top wearing grunts with machetes - your opponents are always varied and never boring.\n\nThe entire experience has a hand-crafted feel, and everything is in its proper place. Though a shooter at heart, the feeling of adventuring in a bizarre otherworld is prevalent throughout, and the architecture occasionally reminds me of adventure games like Myst. Perhaps the rooftop village just reminds me of the Channelwood Age or something.\n\nIt's not all exploration, though. The action is fast and fluid with mouse and keyboard controls, and is super-responsive. It's a blast to blast away while staying on the move. Turok plodded a bit with the flaky N64 controller, but now the game is blazing-fast like Quake on the PC and somehow the game manages to handle the player's faster input very well. Especially if you bump things up to Hard - the setting has obviously been tweaked to be *quite* difficult in order to compensate for the player's better aim. Things get very tough, very fast on Hard, though easy and normal are just as I remembered them back in the day.\n\nThere's a respectable arsenal of exotic weaponry, which Turok literally stores in his magical Bag of Holding. No weapon swapping here. When I was a kid, my circle of friends derived much amusement from the over-the-top excess of some of the later weapons, what with their elaborate folding/unfolding deployment animations and sound effects. Whenever we thought of crazy, overblown weapons or machines, we thought of Turok and laughed. One of those weapons is essentially a portable nuke, and really has to be seen to be believed. Oh, boy, did that ever rock our worlds back then. Watching it blow over trees was exquisite. And of course there's a minigun, which you can unleash into the brush to reenact everyone's favorite scene in the Predator movie. And the ridiculousness of the more advanced weaponry actually serves to make the conventional all the more compelling somehow. Running around with an AK47 and blasting human commandos in the face keeps things feeling real, know what I'm sayin'?\n\nThis is a source port of the PC original by Samual Villareal. If you're a Doomer like me, the name will be familiar. If you're not, suffice it to say that the man is well-appreciated for his work on other source ports, and his involvement in the Doom community. Turok runs wonderfully well on modern PCs, and features some nice, subtle visual improvements that fit in perfectly with the style of the graphics. No ridiculous bloom or lens flares or anything like that - what's here is good enough to highlight that Turok never really looked that bad to begin with. Honestly, I'm surprised just how well it holds up, though the reflective water and atmospheric lighting really does add to the atmosphere. In high resolutions with anti-aliasing, it's a treat to look at. With about 500% of the colors present in Battlefield 4, my eyes almost couldn't handle all the sensory information.\n\nSo is it worth your time and money? Yes, absolutely. There's plenty to see and shoot in Turok's eye-catching, lovingly hand-crafted world, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. And yes, I bought this game years after completing the original multiple times. It stuck with me, certainly. I'm beyond excited for Night Dive's rerelease of Turok 2. As much as I love the original, the sequel is even better. They're noticeably different, though, in terms of style and execution. I highly recommend anyone to get both.","February 9","true","8.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

When I heard Night Dive had obtained the rights and planned to rework and release the unreleased PC versions, I couldn't contain my excitement. Night Dive didn't disappoint! The graphics are a simple spit polish, features have been both maintained and improved, the game runs smooth as silk, but where it really shines is the controls. Anyone that has played the N64 originals knows that half of the game's challenge was the delayed response and awkward configuration on a controller that just wasn't meant for the FPS genre, but here, this release not only supports a wide variety of inputs from keyboard and mouse all the way up to the xbox one controller, they're all fully customizable. Anyone looking for a nostalgia trip needs this game in their library! Great job, Night Dive!

Now, we finally have a remastered version of it up on steam.  This game is still extremely fun even today, especially now that we can play using the good old WASD + Mouse setup.  The game is set in the Lost Lands, a place where time has no meaning.  You play as Tal'Set, a Native American warrior fighting many enemies, ranging from dinosaurs to robots to these weird alien beings.  There are eight levels in the game.  Each level has a certain number of keys to find and a chronosceptor piece.  The goal of the game is to find all the pieces of the chronosceptor and kill the Campaigner.  The leves in this game are huge and there are many hidden areas to find.  The gameplay is extremely fun and very fast-paced, similar to games like Doom.  Also, this game has some of the coolest guns, including a fusion cannon and pulse rifle.  This game is extremely creative and you should defnitely check it out if you like retro shooters or shooters in general.","December 29, 2015","true","80.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Well let’s see, they have added graphics options including some FOV options (default is 74), and a much better key binding system than the original pc release which did the key bindings outside of the game although the sub sections might be a little annoying to me but others might like them. There’s also a thing in the graphics options called saturation. Really this is just the brightness slider but there are other sliders there that let you give the game a bit of a colored tint to it. I don’t see much use in it but it seems like a nice little feature if you like to see the game in red or something\n\nAs mentioned before their is a new difficulty level called hardcore. I went straight for it and its kinda like a doom nightmare difficulty for Turok. Enemies do more damage move a helluva lot faster, fire faster and in this games case respawn faster (this they respawn already) although i'm pretty sure it does not affect bosses. Did i rage? A little of course because of the difficulty i chose. Did i still enjoy the game? The answer is hell yes.\n\nThe game runs much smoother than its original counter parts it runs at 60 fps and doesn’t seem to have the slowdown effects that the N64 had when many enemies were on the screen or too much gunfire going round etc. If some people are sticklers for the old fog there is an option ingame under gameplay options called extend draw distance. Turning it off switches the fog back to the classic Turok style.  Turning it on doubles the distance so you see further. Honestly up to you how you play.\n\nTheres a load of enemies to deal with from knife and staff wielding ancient soldiers to dinosaurs with weapons attached to their arms. Dunno what more you could ask for from that!\n\nI did have a crash once in game and once when closing but they seemed to have been fixed extremely quickly.\n\nHonestly if you’re a fan of old shooters especially exploration ones. Pick this game up.  This port is much better than the original, the music doesn’t cut out, increased view distance, much smoother gameplay and a variety of options to edit makes this a great pick up.\n\nNow alot of people are complaining about the price and im pretty sick of this little argument. This wasnt just a remaster of the PC port of Turok. They did this on a new engine, had to change a few things and redo all the stuff from scratch. Its not like they can just copy it over and it works. It takes time and money. Since this game is much more polished than most of todays AAA titles (im looking at BO3  which i played over the free weekend and the latest batman), it crashed less, it runs fine, doesn't need a top of the line system and for 20 USD is an excellent purchase for a single player game.","December 21, 2015","true","10.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Well, aside from constantly respawing enemies, similar looking levels, dated AI, scattered save points, and hard to find keys that get even more confusing to locate once the player has explored all regions of the map. Turok2 is an improvement over this game, but also suffers from confusing level design where you can't remember if you explored certain sections or not. This becomes a problem even more if you take a break from the game and try to come back.\n\nThis version is very well put together. The controls and HD texture enhancements make it easier to play.

Your movement speed is rather fast, so is some enemies' speed, a lot of them shoot projectiles that are still a challenge to dodge, and most enemies respawn constantly! It's not so quick that clearing areas out loses its purpose, but its quick enough to constantly keep you on your toes.\n\nThere is also a satisfying exploration aspect. There are a lot of secrets which yield useful goodies as well as pieces of the Ultimate Weapon. In every level you don't just have to run to the exit: you need to grab three keys to unlock the next levels (with some minor exceptions). The exploration sometimes verges on overwhelming but as soon as you gather the willpower and start mapping a level out passage by passage, it usually becomes very simple. Heck, the only truly exploratory level is level 5, although there's room to wander around in the other levels too.\n\nThe graphics are really outdated, but you can judge them from the screenshots. I can just say that unless you are really sensitive about amazing graphics (in which case why are you even reading this?) you won't mind because it is perfectly functional and depicts the game's environments adequately.\n\nThe music is nothing special, but it excels at making you feel pumped and ready for action, as well as creating the atmosphere of the Lost Land.\n\nNow, lastly, the port's quaity. The controls are pretty much flawless. There's all sorts of options like head bob, FOV, extended draw distance, crosshair, bindable keys, etc. Apart from a few minor things that might as well end up added after this review is written, I don't know if I can think of anything I would've expected out of this as a port that it doesn't have. It'll also get extensive modding support and level editor, so there's that. If the community engages in making levels, this game's humble length won't matter at all! And someone might make, say, HD textures and models and whatnot. But that's all hypotheticals.\n\nSumming up, if you are at all interested in a good action FPS and aren't afraid of levels that are more open than a narrow corridor, you'd be doing yourself a huge disservise by not getting this game.

This is a classic amongst the FPS genre. It is surreal to see this game on steam working the way it works with nice set of options. To be honest, it makes the game look upscale and more polished than the N64 counterpart which is muddy, foggy and even slow!\n\nPlaying the 1st level, I am enjoying it again and I can not see why you would not want to buy this FPS. Health bar, weapon pick ups, secrets, platform levels, and nice variety of enemies. I will say that the price is a little too much.

Honestly this is one of those games that has aged very well. The game is fast paced, has a decent difficulty, and has a good amount of replay value. In addition the game is vastly more enjoyable with a modern controller compared to the old N64 one. In terms of graphics there are some nice new additions like reflections on water but not alot else. The only down side really is the hefty price but to me its still worth it to get to play this again. Overall, I would strongly recommend this game especially to people like me that still like to go back and play classic games. Im very excited to see Night Dive rerelease Seeds of Evil and I kind of hope they take a look at some other N64 classics like Shadows of the Empire.","December 18, 2015","true","9.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Its levels were expansive, graphics great, the animation was fantastic, the weapons were badass, and it took place in the universe of the already awesome Turok comic series. The game was a system seller, and boosted the sales of the N64 console. Its PC release was a good port, but was not as well recieved as the console version, and unfortunately has not aged very well (the code it runs off of has a hard time with modern setups).\n\nSkip foreward to late 2015, and Night Dive studios has brought this fantastic classic back from the grave, with tons of nice new graphics options, gamepad support, steam integration/achievements, and supposedly mod support is to come; something that the original would have from benefited greatly.\n\nAll in all, this is a great and solid rerelease, and I can not wait for them to do Turok 2: Seeds of Evil","December 17, 2015","true","6.0"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

Not many games were as continous as this back in the day, allowing you (or requireing in some cases) to go back to other levels to reach areas you werent previously able to.

The game has been "cleaned up" as I like to call it; upscaling everything to modern resolutions, increased draw distance, optimized for smooth 60fps, and modernized the controls to the familiar WASD scheme. Even the menu feels right at home, with the same look and feel, albeit a few new options for PC specific settings. All of the classic music and sounds return. The precision of the mouse is a godsend from what I remember as horrificly cumbersome N64 analog stick aiming.\n\nLiterally my only complaint would be that the audio side of things doesn't match up with the visual upkeep; everything is still low bitrate sound clips and music.

The ability to use a keyboard and mouse makes this game much easier and to have to have any real challange you will have to play at the highest difficulty. The view distance is still very short and you can't see very far due to the fog which is annoying. There are minor glitches like when you look into water you see a poor attempt of replication a relection and it just looks like your seeing whats underwater. Some of the hitboxes are a little wierd still but overall it's pretty good. This is the best version of Turok by far, the only problem is that it's $20 at full price. The 15 dollars is the most I am willing to pay for a game made in 1997. It's not a remake, it's a remaster and I feel like the developer is trying to make extra cash over nostalgia. Unless you really like Turok or old school FPS games like me then I highly recommend you wait for a sale to bring it down to $10. Turok still has almost no story and doesn't hold up as well as other old school FPS game. Even with all its flaws It still is a enjoyable experience 18 years later.

Ele marcou minha infancia com a sua saga no Nintendo 64. Agora seus graficos obtiveram uma melhoria que mesmo assim continua com seu mesmo aspecto grandioso. Turok foi o melhor FPS aventureiro que joguei, eu recomendo para aqueles que ja o jogaram. Espero que esse mesmo fornecedor produza tambem os outros 2 games da saga. Estou no Aguardo.\n\nA jogabilidade eh excelente, testei em ambos teclado e gamepad. Graficos tambem excelentes e sem bugs. Notei algumas partes do mapa que foram redesenhas, o que ficou muito bom.

I have Turok, and Turok 2 on N64, and it's nice to play them with my desired control method.\n\nWhat draws me to these games is their originality (native americans fighting dinosaurs, aliens, cosmic horrors.) and the colourful and epic weapons. The levels are pretty big and fairly linear, so you won't find yourself getting too lost, the enemies have decent AI (they roll to the side to dodge bullets etc etc) and if you shoot them in the right way they clasp at their neck gasping for air before dying.\n\nThe platform sections can be a bit irritating, but, they had those back in the halcyon days of FPS games, so I can't grumble too much about it.\n\nAll in all, a must buy if you loved the originals. and for those who haven't played a Turok game, give it a whirl if you're sick of the same cookie cutter 'realistic' modern military shooters.","January 6","true","6.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Paddles93/recommended/405820/","Paddles93","[TPZ] Cereal Killer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Paddles93/","219 products in account","A true classic from the 90's & the greatest era of video gaming. The just released update of the classic Turok: Dinosaur Hunter gives you the feeling of nostalgia from the classical graphics that the original title had with the added bonus of greatly improved controls.\nAbout The Game:Turok: Dinosaur Hunter was originally released on the Nintendo 64 back in 1997 by Acclaim Studios (R.I.P) and was a staple of FPS & platform gaming. The recently released PC version of Turok has been developed by Night Dive Studios and is pretty much identical to the original version except with updated and better controls & less blocky but still classic 90's visuals.\n\nThe Story:What little story there is, Turok is a Cherokee Dinosaur Hunter that goes around and fights Dinosaurs, Mercinaries & Aliens in a somewhat modern era. Not only do you use Bows & Knifes but have access to firearms such as Handguns, Shotguns & even some very futuristic weaponry.\n\nAlong the way Turok has to stop the aliens from attacking and destroying human kind, Aliens have become a real problem, along with the Dinosaurs and it's up to you to save mankind from them.\n\nThe Gameplay:The game operates mainly as a fast paced FPS with somewhat moderate platforming elements to frustrate and divert your attention.\n\nThe controls are fluent, (especially compaired to the original games) but feel very fast for a game that was designed to be played on about 20FPS, the extra 40 FPS certainly feel very fast for a game of this age and can be somewhat disorienting for lovers of the classic game.\n\nThe gunplay is fun but certainly feels very dated & could have used a bit more attention in the development process, however this certainly does not ruin the experience. (Especially if you're a fan of the originals, you will not be let down).\n\nTurok has certainly stood the test of time, graphics wise this game is certainly nothing special & the developers didn't change any of the visuals except for the addition of standard PC settings such as, resolution, bloom effects and texture smoothing, other than that this is the same game from 1997.\n\nThe Verdict:Turok: Dinosaur Hunter is and always will be, (in my eyes) a classic title and a must own title for those from the Nintendo 64 era of gaming. If you had a Nintendo 64 then you already know exactly why you must own this game, for those who didn't own a Nintendo 64 now you can own Turok right here on Steam.\n\nTurok is a fantastic game & it's certainly a game that if you're a lover of FPS games & platform gaming then this game will certainly tickle your fancy, on the flip side, if you're all about the graphics then this is not a game you're going to enjoy because the textures are very much classic 90's textures, flat and very little detail infact how they made Turok's face look is somewhat laughable, I certainly don't remember him looking like that on the Nintedo 64.\n\nRating: 4/5 a pretty flawless game but needed more done to it, like proper graphical overhauls in certain area's and better frame matching on animations for the enemies and AI.\n\nDo I Recommend The Game?:Yes I do recommend the game to fans of the classic 90's games or just fans of the Turok series in general.\n\nThe price may be slightly to steep but this is 2015 not 1997 pricing is always expensive. Could this game have been cheaper? Yeah it probably could've been a more acceptable price of $10 but I'm not complaining as I enjoy the game regardless.\n\nI look forward to getting my hands on Turok 3: Shadows of Oblivion on the PC....

I would have gladly even payed $30 for it.  I really hope this game does well so they consider bringing Turok 2 and 3 as well, cause I have the entire trilogy for my N64 and would love to have them all on Steam too.\n\nNow, some people are going to gripe about the graphics, but to that I say phooey.  I don't buy a game for the graphics, I buy a game to play it and have fun, and this game is just as much fun if not more so than the original N64 port.  If anything, the controls feel much more refined now than they did on the N64.\n\nHow likely am I to refer this game to a friend or a stranger?  10 out of 10.  I loved this game on the N64 and I love it here on the PC.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SireOblivion/recommended/405820/","SireOblivion","Sire","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SireOblivion/","415 products in account","On The Eight Day God Created Turok\n\nAnd what a creation it was, Turok was a landmark game for it's time and a classic on the N64. The game would later be ported to PC with some minor changes and a better sounding soundtrack but the game was locked to Voodoo graphics cards; didn't have one? You're screwed. I'm not sure if the game saw the amount of popularity that other shooters on PC saw at the time but the game faded away with time.\n\nUntil now the only way to really play it was on the N64, but Night Dive has revived it for the PC and they did a tremendous job. First off the game controls perfectly but you can change anything to your liking if need be. Visual options allow you to turn on some modern graphical effects (sun shafts, reflects on water) that were absent in the original PC release. You also get an option to increase the draw distance which helps a LOT, the game was damn near known for it's notoriously short draw distance due to "fog." You can even change the FOV if you care to, very nice touch. Overall the game runs perfectly and I haven't had any issues with it in my 5+ hours of playtime. Well done.\n\nHow does the game hold up? Really, really well. Save for the dated visuals the gameplay is really fast-paced and fun. Turok himself moves at a ridiculous speed but it's all for the better, enemies hit hard if you get careless and there's a lot of weapons to toy around with and find out what works best on which enemy. The levels are also nice and varied, starting off quite linear and short and slowly growing into large and complex sprawls with various ways to go. Secret areas are hidden all over and there's some backtracking to do if you didn't get all the keys in your first go. The game always keeps you engaged without feeling unfair or bored. You'll find things to shoot around every corner.\n\nSo what're the down sides? Well, the enemies are only programmed for the aforementioned short draw distance of the original release, so a lot of the times you can just see guys standing around waiting for you to get into sight. Since you can see them, you can free shoot them without any issues and sometimes they won't even become hostile if they're far enough. Night Dive also decided to redo SOME of the graphics, this is minor but things like the font, main title logo and ammo counters are done up nicely; the issue is only SOME of the UI art has been touched up which is a little jarring. Turok's head is the original art but the number next to it (signifying lives left) is nice, crisp and completely redone. Also having the giant stone "PAUSE" sign on top of the pause screen looks terrible as it's really low res and muddy.\n\nIf you loved this game as a kid, you'll love it still today, it's still a great title that's aged well. If you've never played Turok this is the best one to start with. Night Dive is working on Turok 2 and I can't wait.","December 17, 2015","true","29.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

The outdated graphics may be a turnoff for some players, but Night Dive Studios' optimization of the game for modern PCs has enough options to keep you satisfied.\n\n+ Wide variety of weapons, powerups, and secondary ammo types awarded from exploration.\n\n+ Classic FPS gameplay (Health pickups, strafe-jumping, fast movement, etc.)\n\n+ Large maps with variety in themes and non-linear paths for exploration.\n\n+ Updated visuals such as godrays, water reflections, better draw distance, and support for modern screen resolutions.\n\n+ Controls are responsive and accuracy is better with a mouse than an N64 controller.\n\n+ Blowing a guy up with tek arrows or the grenade launcher feels awesome, and seeing blood squirt from someones throat always feels satisfying.\n\n+ Repetitive but otherwise catchy soundtrack with an electronic-tribal theme.\n\n+ No autosaves, relies on checkpoints and saves like the good ol' days. Dying results in loss of backpack and sets you back a couple minutes of gameplay.\n\n- FPS veterans may finish the game quickly, took me roughly six hours to finish the campaign. Not a huge issue for most players.\n\n- The platforming takes getting used too and precise jumping is required to reach certain areas and make progress.\n\n- The later levels do get confusing to navigate sometimes, and you may have to backtrack to find a level key if you weren't paying attention.\n\n- Minor clipping issues, such as seeing through certain models or going partially into the ground. These are rare instances and never interfere with the gameplay.\n\n- Outdated textures may be off-putting to modern gamers.\n\nSimply put, Turok is worth it for the nostalgia factor and also worth it for newcomers looking for a challenging old-school FPS. Updated controls make it easier to play, and the updated visuals are a nice touch despite the lack of better quality textures.\n\nYou also get to be a shirtless native and fight dinosaurs using alien weaponry. The 90's had the best FPS protagonists.","December 21, 2015","true","6.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This is one of the best FPS to date and it still holds true. While it is lacknig in a story, it more than makes up for it with the gameplay and skill and strategy it requires you to use.\n\nThis game is rather and it definitely shows that. It doesn't have amazing graphics because it's a port from an almost 20 year old game. That should make those of you who played this game back in the day feel old... I digress, apologies mates.\n\nThe control scheme is much smoother than it's old N64 counterpart. It's much easier to maneuver than it was previously. If any of you remember the small lag it had in certain levels or when you were using explosive shells or tek arrows? SURPRISE! NO MORE LAG! It flows beautifully as it should ahve back then. you can still get through level 1 on normal with jsut the knife, so I think cranknig it up to hard should be your goal, although laterl levels this will prove jsut as difficult as it did when we first played this game. "secret" areas now have a map you can view, like level 1 circular type maze near the end of the level. It shows a complete map of the area so you won't miss out on you know what! (hush hush boys!)\n\nFor those that haven't played this game, I suggest you try it out.

This was one of the first titles released on the N64 and was one of THE games to have at the time. It actually holds up very well today (I'd argue it has held up better than the legendary Goldeneye 007) and provides a rich, deep adventure that runs silky smooth and assaults your ears with tribal beats and animal roars.\n\nTurok provides you with many weapns to find to help deal with the mercs, dinos and other enemies you'll run into. They all feel great and pack a real oomph that makes you feel like a proper badass. Movement and jumps are perfect and make sure that any deaths you suffer are from your own mistakes and not poor controles. The new options to configure the controles to mouse and keyboard only improve one of the few issues some had with the N64 game.\n\nDo yourself a favor and buy this classic. It stomps all over modern FPS games and it's simplicity is refeshing. This is one of the greats of the genre and deserves to be in your collection.

The price is way too steep at $20, mind you, but anyone who enjoyed Turok back in the day will love the f#ck out of this (moderatly improved) version.  They are also doing Seeds of Evil, which was the game that was litterally too much for the N64 to handle!  (It's FPS would tank frequently).\n\nI do have a few gripes about optimiztion and FPS issues, and that the FOV settings are "45", "76", "90", and "[motion-induced seizure]".  Also, there are only a handful of achivments.\n\nIf you really love the classic Dinosaur Hunter, buy this.  If you were born after 1996 and hate dated graphics, wait until a sale or skip this, as you will not enjoy this experiance without understanding how incredible this technology was at the time for us 90's kids.

I personally would have liked re-produced high res textures, and not just upsampled original textures. The sounds could have used some bass. I may be wrong, but some parts of some levels felt re-arranged. I'm okay with that as i dodn't notice it all that much. The graphics options are a great touch, and the inclusion of some modern graphics tech is a much needed addition, but again, updated textures would have supplimented the addition of new graphics tech.\n\nPros:\nVastly improved graphics (i ran the DOS version and emulated N64 version to compare).\nSame great gunplay.\nBetter controller support (especially compared to emulated N64 using an XB1 controller).\nMagic of the original.\n\nCons:\nUpsampled low res original textures.\n\nI'm hoping that with our support, the devs will pursue remastering the sequals.","February 17","true","1.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

One that was more at home with Super Mario Bros and The Legend of Zelda than Doom and Quake.\n\nTurok bares a lot more qualities reminiscient of Mario than Doom really. The game features an overly cartoony art style with exaggerated proportions, it takes place in a vague indeterminate setting called the "Lost Land" reminiscient of Mario's mushroom kingdom. It features player lives and pickups inorder to gain new ones. It has a hub level strictly for warping to new ones ala Super Mario 64. It has platforming sections. And the general objective of the game is to "gather something from every level in the game and kill the final boss". It's weird to me coming back to it since, swap the graphics and change the protagonist into a plumber and the enemies into goombas and you have "Super Mario the FPS". Just add dinosaurs.\n\nNow this game originally released on the N64 and has been ported to a brand new engine with this release. You have things like a water reflection shader, higher framerate, FOV options and widescreen. The higher framerate causes the game to feel much faster and more akin to Serious Sam.\n\nNow all this being said. Whether it's worth the 20$ asking price is entirely dependant on if you like older first person shooters and don't mind the rough edges. Since you can beat it in about 6 or so hours. Personally I do like the game as is, and with the promise of a level editor and Turok 2 down the road, I'm more excited for the future of the series than I ever was before.","December 17, 2015","true","10.7"," 11 of 24 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","11","24","0","0"

This HD remaster is essentially the same game from 1997 that we know and love except improved with enhanced mechanics, settings, graphics, and performance especially. They took all of the stuff in Turok that wasn't so great and made it gold.\n\nIn 1997 Turok shook the world, Dinosaur Hunter quickly became one of the most recognized games of its time. It had dinosaurs and a Doom/Duke Nukem motive towards its gameplay. But it surely wasn't just a clone. Turok really stuck out to me , there were some setbacks in the original release that have been preventing the game to really shine and last forever. It had 24-30 fps and an extreme amount of fog to prevent you from seeing to much details on the screen at once.\n\nNow with Turok HD you can run the game at a steady 60 fps setting while also increasing the fov up to 120! These two settings together make for a great experience alone. Increasing the fov makes you able to see more, now combine that with the "Extended draw distance" option and it almost renders the fog limits into oblivion. This simply just makes the game much better and i'm astonished in its results. There is also quite a few additional options in the settings that can prove fun to poke with. For example a new weapon bobbing feature, water reflection, and sunlight scatter. The most intruiging one is the sun scatter which makes the game render sun rays and they shine beutifully through the tree branches and levels. This combined with the water reflection causes for some really beautiful scenery.\n\nThis is not even close to a port that just got picked up and kicked off the cliff to release, so much love was poured into this one. It now feels like the game I knew it was, it always had the potential! Its not always possible to say a remaster is much better then the original but here the comparison isn't even close. Whether you have played the original or not this game rocks and its a dream come true for myself. I prefer the likes of classic gameplay, graphics, and models this game just needed to be opened up. Now it is my favorite Turok game without a doubt.\n\nTurok was a locked treasure chest and Night Dives deep sea divers located, found, and unlocked it. If this released on N64 it would be the gold cart.\n\n10/10\n\nHere is something for comparison\n\nOld Turok\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVKWgEJqyhk\nNew Turok\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIjOyeQI0kY","December 17, 2015","true","374.8"," 163 of 335 people (49%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","49","163","335","23","73"

Being a "remastered" version, I was expecting to see a little sharper textures and some better particle effects. It seems that the game itself has just been brought over to another engine or something that supports better shader fx.\n\nMaybe my mind is foggy, but I don't remember there being such horrendous camera tilt in the N64 version. Pair that off with the insane speed Turok accelerates to and I feel like i'm riding a motorcycle. The respawn rate seems to be a little bit high as well, especially since ammo and health are limited and targets (unless firing physical projectiles like pulse rifles) can't miss you.\n\nAll of this stuff is easily dismisable, though -- it's all part of the learning curve of the game.\n\nWhat gripes me the most is the amount of visual bugs in the game. Insane clipping, massive frame rate drops when underwater/ in the clouds, uncapped meshes, Z-fighting, and that's only what I found in Level 2! There is literally no excuse for some of these things!\n\nIf you're looking to shell out 20$ for a quick nostalgic trip, go for it.  You'll get it. But if you're kind of on the fence about revisiting it, I'd hold off for now.","December 18, 2015","false","1.7"," 42 of 101 people (42%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","42","42","101","4","2"

Even more so since it was unique compared to other games on the Nintendo 64. Does not hold up to the PC games from the same decade, and I compare it to PC game from the same decade because I am playing this copy on PC.  Upon playing Turok, I would not value it any higher than $10. Does not feel like a new experience or different game (as others have said). Needs much more substance to justify the price point. Once again,I would not recommend it for any more than $20---and this is coming from someone who has paid for nearly every re-release of DOOM on every platform and still enjoyed it just as much.\n\nBOTTOM LINE:  A remaster of Turok 2 or a $20 Turok Classic Collection would have held up much better for the money.

The main problem is the price, charging twenty dollars does not make sense since A) Night Dive did not make this game, and B) is over fifteen years old.  While it is graphically updated, the textures still look very bit like (walls made of paper and everything else is made of a type of rectangle). They advertise that the game can use a controller; however, the default button to jump on my xbox one controller is LT. using the camera on my controller feels stiff and a bit unresponsive. The game also seems to have some lagging issues which is odd since I can run Half Life 2 with problems only happening when a lot of things are happening at once but I have issues running a game that was invented at a time where circles did not even exist. My biggest issue  though is that there seems to be a problem with my vision; hard to explain but imagine if you were to look through a glass bowl (everything in the middle seems farther than it should be and objects to the side look as if they have been stretched). No one else from what I read seems to have an issue with seeing but I thought I should just point it out (please send a comment to me if you are also having this issue or know how to fix it).  Even if the game costed fifteen dollars, (which would still be a bit pricey) at the condition it is in, I would recommend to save your money. The only way I can recommend this game is if Night Dive uses the money to update this game some more and to update the other turok games and sell them for a reasonable price","December 21, 2015","false","3.0"," 3 of 23 people (13%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","13","3","23","0","0"

Turok in particular is a fast paced and outrageous shooter that has large, branching levels, great weapons and is lots and lots of fun. The graphics, from 1997, are naturally dated and may turn off some people, but porting the game from the Nintento to PC more than makes up for it, I think, because aiming and controlling is far better and the solid 60 fps makes for a smooth, pick-up-and-play experience. Fantastic game. I haven't touched it since I was probably about nine years old and it's great to be able to blow through it again one more time.\n\nEagerly awaiting the port for Turok 2, which I consider to be one of the best sequels of all time.\n\nSupport Night Dive Studios, buy their stuff.","January 2","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(personally I love this. I am a huge nostalgia sucker)\n- mouse and keyboard support! gamepad support as well but i'm yet to try it.\n- everything is still where I remember it. i.e., so far it seems like a very faithful recreation of the maps, item/weapon loacations, and enemy locations.\n- Turok plays surprisingly well with a keyboard and mouse. almost like Iguanna studios made the game that way first then stuck it in an N64 back in the 90's\n- the old save/checkpoint system is still in effect. ahhh, the good ol' 90's era of "save when we tell you it's ok to save".\n- music and sound are still great as ever.\n- additional fancy lighting and V-sync added. no more crummy framerate. though if they do that for turok 2 as well it will be an instant purchase for me.\n- late game becomes an excercise in ammunition management. "sure the quad launcher will wreck that group of cyber-raptors.....but then what will I use against the rocket launching triceratops?!"\n\nbasically if you remember turok for the N64, this should be a must play. $20 may be a bit steep however. so if you see it for no more than $15, I'd pick it up in a heart beat (which i did, and then I did.).\n\nI VERY MUCH look forward to seeing this studio's work on Turok 2. until then, I'm going to battle my way through to the campaigner and chronocepter his face into next week.","December 19, 2015","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I remember reading about it in Nintendo Power and getting so excited for it. The crazy guns, the cheat codes and the insanely good graphics (for the time) drew me in.\n\nI remember looking up the cheat codes for the game on Game FAQS and hand typing all of the best codes onto a notepad file because I didn't know how to copy/paste yet. The cheat codes made me feel giddy back then. Little did I know they would ruin the game for me.\n\nSo for Christmas 1997 I asked my Mom for this game. Playing this game back then felt so good at first. The guns felt really good and the enemy death animations were amazing. I was able to make it past the first level, but going into the second level I started to lose interest. I printed out all of my cheats and went HAM on the game, teleporting to every level and killing every boss with the extremely overpowered weapons and invincibility. I was bored with the game after that, because the cheats kinda took the game aspect away.\n\nI later realized why I initially got so bored with the game. The control was terrible. Turning was slow but would quickly accelerate leading to overcompensation which led to very imprecise aiming. You just felt like you were in a vat of sticky goo. The N64 controller really sucked for FPS games. Turok 2 was better but suffered from similar problems.\n\nFast forward to 2001 I downloaded a Turok PC Demo and it was total crap with no mouse aiming.\n\nFast Forward to December 2015, Steam. I bought this game on the hopes that it would be playable and to experience nostalgia from 1997. I knew the game was good as it was highly praised in its day, I just wanted to really experience its goodness this time. So how does the game hold up?\n\nThat first level was not only a nostalgia overload, the control with the mouse, playing this game like a real and true FPS made me want to cry it was so amazing. The game was now fast and fluid, better view distance, no frame drops, a crosshair! It felt good. It felt like a really good classic FPS like Quake. I was having a lot of fun.\n\nAfter those first two levels the nostalgia wore off. It went from childhood memories to totally new memories. Because the combat was now fun and engaging, I was able to just play the game and progress. The levels for the most part are pretty well designed. Platforming sections were no longer nigh impossible for me. Jumping was quick, precise and easy. Although the platforming sections were the weakest part of this game by far, they were pretty intense because you really didn't want to die and lose the Backpack that you have had for almost 2 hours.\n\nThe best part of this game are the guns. I feel like almost every gun has a situational use (except for the pump shotgun after you get the auto shotgun). The guns stand above all else in terms of memoribility. The coolest gun in the game being the Chronoscepter, which has 8 pieces that you have to collect through out the game. It has only 3 shots and you finish putting together before the last boss. This gun made me cream myself when I saw it as a kid. Now its just a bad ♥♥♥ gun with effects that still look cool to me to this day.\n\nDefinitely get this game if you played and loved Turok back in the day and want the real Turok experience.\n\nDon't get this game if all you have played is Call of Duty/Halo\n\nAt 20$ It is definitely overpriced though, which is why I can't recommend this game to everyone. Now I'm crossing my fingers for Turok 2 on Steam!","December 22, 2015","true","10.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Gameplay is simple and straightforward, with only the barest excuse of a story.  Players traverse quasi-jungle labyrinths, searching for keys and killing everything that moves.\n\nThat said, this version has a decent framerate, along with a handful of graphical options such as FOV, that make this superior to past versions in every way.  On top of that, playing with the Steam Controller feels fantastic.  If you're already a fan of Turok, or a fan of old-school shooters, this should at least be on your wishlist.","December 22, 2015","true","14.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Like.. this is superior in every way. The controls are as you'd expect, draw distance is still awful ( Im happy with this ), and the fog is still intact. Ive always been one to enjoy Turok more than I did Goldeneye so, I'm happy to see this finally on Steam.\n\nAs for the game: It's great. It's a Puzzle Platformer more than it is an FPS and to have controls so fluid just makes the experience all the more better. The levels are so expertly designed and even the secrets require so much attention to find. The weapons are probably some of the best in game history, Turok 2 probably having the greatest.\n\nAnd yes. The Cheats are STILL there for you to exploit, but word of warning: Cheating will make Achievements not unlock so don't expect easy Achievements.","December 24, 2015","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Improved graphics, faster movement and more accurate aiming (mouse and keyboard ftw) but that doesn't mean game is easier - o no. It's an old school shooter and it's more fun than any new AAA fps (imho).\n\nIf you are playing this game for the first time, you won't be impressed. Nothing new here except fun ;)\n\nI definitivelly recommend it for fans of the series. For people that are thinking of buying it, here are some pro's and cons:\n+ Awesome soundtrack\n+ Fast paced shooting\n+ Dinosaurs\n+ Nostalgia\n+ interesting levels (Spoiler: treetop village)\n\n- Minor bugs here and there, but nothing serious (so far)\n- Game starts windowed by default, so have that in mind\n- Graphics are way better than in the original, but not ok for today's standards - if you care about that\n\nIf you buy this game, you'll have fun. If you don't, you haven't missed much. Considering all said - it's a recommendation from me\n\nThank you Night Dive Studios for enabling this on pc :D","December 24, 2015","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Turok in particular is a fast paced and outrageous shooter that has large, branching levels, great weapons and is lots and lots of fun. The graphics, from 1997, are naturally dated and may turn off some people, but porting the game from the Nintento to PC more than makes up for it, I think, because aiming and controlling is far better and the solid 60 fps makes for a smooth, pick-up-and-play experience.

It was one of the games that attracted us to Nintendo's quirky, but unique new system. While some preferred Goldeneye or Doom 64, Turok was still a strong competitor in the FPS genre and spawned a few successful sequels until plummeting into mediocrity. The controls took time to get used to, but the gameplay was fast paced and bloody, and it even managed to please longtime fans of the comic book.\n\nNight Dive's re-release is like plugging in a 20 year old system again. Your memories begin flooding back and the first few minutes are glorious, but then the nostalgia glasses wear off and you realize just how far games have come. Turok is not a bad game in any way, it's just very, very dated. I love classic FPS games. Doom 2 and Blood still get playtime for me after all these years. Turok just has nothing that keeps it fresh after almost two decades.\n\nI have no problem with the graphics, and applaud Night Dive for leaving the original design untouched. They even kept old glitches intact on purpose and, in a recent update, implemented the original N64 sound effects. Visuals and sound are still great. It's the gameplay that hurts. While playing on a mouse and keyboard is superior to the goofy N64 controller, and Turok moves pretty smoothly, some of the platforming in the game is near impossible. Some of the jumps you are asked to perform happen only by miracle, and sometimes just looking at a platform the wrong way can cause you to fall through it. The weapons are fun, but some don't seem to do anything or cause any varying degrees of damage, and just feel like they were put there to look cool. If you are lucky enough to assemble the Chronoscepter, good luck getting a hit in with it.\n\nMy biggest complaint is that the levels are TOO DAMN LONG. Level 8 wins the award for the longest, most excruciating level in video game history. It's neat that the levels are so open and there are multiple paths, but good god the last level takes almost two hours to complete! It begins to feel tedious after a while and you stop enjoying the game and just wish for the level to be over. Also, enemies respawn, making the levels EVEN LONGER when you have to clear the same corridors multiple times.\n\nTurok is not a terrible game. If you have played it before and it's cheap, go ahead and relive some memories. Just be ready to cringe. It's very hard to recommend Turok to those who have never played it because it is so dated, but if you enjoy games of old and want a field trip back to when FPS games were still in their infancy, it's worth a look.","February 11","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Turok was my first FPS too and I still go back and play it on the ol' 64 every couple of years - now that I have this though I may not have to keep the old console hooked up anymore.\n\nA couple notes:\n-The original field of view is the lowest (47 I think). I keep it on the second-lowest (74 I think) to make things a bit friendlier but any higher than that and it just looks wierd to me.\n-There's no auto-aim. Unless its possibly there on Easy mode, I don't know, haven't tried that...\n-If you draw an arrow you can't switch to another weapon to keep from firing.\n-No option for spring-look joystick - so that exact original feel isn't there if you really wanted it (not a problem for me though).\n-I wish there were achievements for more things, like "Find a backpack", "Beat Game on Hard", "Beat in under 10 hours", and some to make me play through it more than once, like "kill 10,000 enemies" or "Play for 30 hours"\n\nNothing's really disappointing about it though - if you're like me and loved Turok and just wanted to have Turok with Achievements, here you go. Nice job Night Dive; thanks for bringing it back.\n\nP.S.  If you're playing this for the first time, remember this was March of 1997 (for the N64 version). PS1 was 18 months old (in the US), N64 6 months old. This was before Halo, Serious Sam, Quake II, Half-Life, Tribes, Perfect Dark, or Goldeneye.

From the opening sequence to the iconic "I AM TUROK", the nostalgic feels hit so hard.

Now with improved draw distance, smooth and remappable controls and even increased difficulty options.\n\nAnd while I may call this a port, saying that doesn't exactly do it justice. The engine it runs on is entirely new and doesn't actually have too heavy a relationship with either the N64 original or the somewhat shoddy PC port. And on top of that the engine also supports moddability, something the originals never had.\n\nIf you can handle the dated visuals this is totally worth what they're asking for, the game itself can be on the short side if you know what you're doing, but the exploration required to find level keys plus the chronosceptre peices if you want to build that too are fun in a way most key hunts really aren't. The levels are packed with secrets which helps with replayability too.\n\nSo TL:DR. it's good. And at that you should thank Kaiser for his great work on the engine. Keep an eye on him and Night Dive Studios for powerslave-ex (Possibly) and the upcoming release of Turok2.","December 23, 2015","true","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And I couldnt be happier with its arrival on Steam! This is a pretty faith 1:1 coversion of the original game on the N64/PC to modern PC systems. So this is not your typical "Remaster" game that changes the whole graphics and gameplay, while ruining or forgetting some stuff in the process. And let me tell you something, Turok: Dinosaur Hunter is STILL GOOD AS IT IS! So I'm glad how they decided to aproach this. Instead you get the same classic game with slight but welcomed graphic improvements and the obvious advantages that mouse and keyboard inputs provide.\n\nTo those that dont know anything about this game, Turok is a classic FPS that wasnt like anything back in 1997 or even today. This game introduced something that FPS didnt have back then, platforming and verticality, in fact I think it was the first game that did. Basically this game plays like DOOM with Super Mario Bros. levels of jumping all in a 3D environment. The first thing you'll notice is the incredible speed your character has when you move around. And jumping is not just a secondary occasional action, its the key aspect of the gameplay and without decent control of it you will get nowhere as your shooting abilities wont be enough if you want to progress. But dont worry things can only get more fun and feel natural as you make your first jumps. The game teaches you the basic and advanced actions in a tutorial that WILL help further in the game, such as "long jumps" and "diagonal jumping".\n\nThe level design is very clever and complex, they are like laberinths, so forget about just corridors and buildings, you are out in the wild with dinosaurs and other hunters that want to cut your head off. The weapons as with all Turok games can be as simple as a pistol or crazy and inventive like the Quad Rocket launcher or the Chronoscepter which you must find all the parts to assemble it if you want a better chance with the final boss.\n\nThe improved PC controls and a simple increase in color saturation and lighting has made wonders to this old game. Dont let the blocky models and old looking textures fool you, this game still has a lot to offer today, specially in an era dominated by online multiplayer modes and the lack of fun and replayable campaigns in FPS games. Also, the gamepad support is still excelent, probably because the original game was meant for a console so if you are looking for an FPS game to play while sitting comfortably in your couch, look no further, this game plays great with BOTH mouse/keyboard combo or Gamepad. And trust me there arent many fps games that play this good with a gamepad (at least not without autofire, LOL), hehe you can thank me later.\n\nI think this game still has the potential to entertain us for years to come, and hopefully it will be here to remember us and future generations what a fun FPS campaign is made of and what we should demand in FPS games and what not. Give it a chance I promise it wont let you down.\n\nOne last thing: a Real Dinosaur Hunter plays withouth crosshairs!

I was a pro at this game with the N64 Controller and so I thought that I would do just as well with the MS Controller. You don't get the same precision using the MS Controller, when platforming you cannot more or stop as easily as you would like, this cause me to fall or miss some platforms quite often. Once I was way more than half way, I gave the keyboard a shot and oh Boy!. The keyboard and mouse gives you way more precision. I loved the game back then and I really enjoy being able to play thru and beat the game a second time around. This time around, I felt that this game was way easier. Many of the cheats or game view modes will give you lots of replay-ability, I did not have to use a guide for this game and I found all the Scepter pieces on the first run through. For the boss fight, I did not manage hit him once with the scepter :( I just used the explosive shotgun shells for that.

However with cleaner visuals, a real field of view and mouse and keyboard control all I have to go by is the core game itself... and what this means is a time travelling native American verses dinosaurs with guns, alien enforcers and giant insects.\n\nHow can you be bored by that last sentance alone?","January 17","true","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SpaghettiVase/recommended/405820/","SpaghettiVase","Kunt Kuntson","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SpaghettiVase/","194 products in account","Turok: Dinosaur Hunter was a Nintendo 64 game made in February of 1997. This almost 20 year old game was one of the first 64 bit First Person Shooters and really pushed the graphical capacity of of the N64. This Steam port lives up to what the original console version was quite well.\nTurok on the N64 still holds up when returned to today, yet the control is pretty horrible to re-adjust to again. With the Steam port, you can play with a modern controller, and even use the joysticks, making the expirence better.\nThe graphics, draw distance, hitboxes, and many more things have been upgraded to make the game run well on modern computers.\n\nOne thing however, while this is an old topic it is still relavent to new buyers, is the price. A lot of people think that 20$ (usually 15$ when it goes on sale) is real overkill. While I semi-agree I also played turok on the N64 and really enjoyed the game.

At the beginning, you're given one goal. That goal is to make it to the hub. The next thing you know, it becomes a collectathon. The part that allows you to figure out the story is what reminds me of what some game devs are going for these days. I would say that this is a good example of what they go for. There may have been a story behind this game at one point when it was still new. Mostly, Acclaim and Iguana Entertainment have made it more gameplay and goal heavy. Though the controls may be more simple, but overall, there are things that are enjoyable about it. Like for example, when I play through it, I got a slight sense of what the story was behind it. That was what made the first game so great. I notice that Iguana Entertainment has attempted to put together a story for the later series like Turok Evolution, as well as Vexx which was a platformer I personally enjoyed and wish Nightdive would bring that out on the Market. Their method of storytelling was... not perfect. However, they did great on putting in an assortment of other monsters than just dinosaurs, giant bugs and soldiers which I commend them for that. Not all good games have to have to be all cinematic. That's what I like about this one, and I admire how some devs are brinnging this back.","February 18","true","11.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Before Turok FPS were mostly made of sprites and took place in corridors, Turok took the action outside and let you blow apart fully polygonal enemies with a huge armament. Many people remember Golden Eye as the must play FPS for N64 but Turok was released before bond and was truly the game that broke new grounds.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/VDub42/recommended/405820/","VDub42","Lysander","http://steamcommunity.com/id/VDub42/","772 products in account","Turok is a first person shooter that ends up feeling kind of like Doom.  I really enjoyed it as a kid, having owned it on the N64, but I don't think it has held up as well as some other games.\n\nLevel design is often just big rooms or hallways with enemies thrown around.  Some levels in the mid to late game are cool, but early levels are kind of dull and the last couple levels throw a lot of mazes at you.  Some of the keys you need are easy to miss and the game doesn't give any indication of whether you've passed a key or if it's still further up.  (I was missing level 3 key 3 and spent a long time searching for it because I didn't realize the level end portal teleported you to a boss instead of the hub.)\n\nThere is a good variety of weapons, although many share ammo and some are only upgrades of lesser guns.  Most of the enemies don't feel very distinct, many are reskinned or feel the same.  As the game goes on, enemies get more health, so it's easier and quicker to just run past everything and kill only enemies that are triggers.\n\nIf you played it back in the day and loved it, it is probably worth picking up. If you have never played it, I recommend getting it if you like Doom games or if you really like old 3D action platformers.  I finished it in less than 6 hours, so keep that in mind.  This version adds a lot of convenient graphical and gameplay options that helps bring Turok up to modern fps standards, but if you still have an old copy you might be better off just playing that.","April 25","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you havent played it before, $10 is a fair price. If you're like me and played it to death on the n64, the lack of new GAMEPLAY related features makes $5 more fair. The port is handled well with nice additions to the graphics and difficuly options, though a few bugs are present. For example, grenades will splash damage hurt you often while landing far away from you, and you will occasionally clip through platforms while jumping or jump into an invisible wall. These are minor gripes that rarely manifest however, and I fully recommend this game.","May 5","true","8.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Out of any FPS style game I've played, Turok holds the most time I've ever spent playing. Maybe Turok 2, but they just don't make them like this anymore. The game feels very natural with the keyboard and mouse compared to the N64 controller, making it a little easier to navigate and avoid enemy attack. I also liked the advanced sight into the fog this version gives you, much more time to react and plan your attacks. Really the only thing bad I can say about this title is the price tag, to someone like me, I felt it was a small price to pay. To others, especially the people who have never played it, it will drive them off. It's a damn shame, I'd like to see more people enjoying the game as much as I did years ago.","April 10","true","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
