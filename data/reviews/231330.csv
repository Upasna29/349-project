A game where you can be a true adventurer as the famous Quatermain (or Indiana Jones if you want) and this in a Ego-Shooter. What the ♥♥♥♥; is that kinda cool? Really? Adventuring in a Ego-Shooter?\nYES, that is possible. The Farm 51 developing team has made a great game with that. You have brilliant graphic moments (Unreal Engine 3), but of course there are also some bad graphics in there. But hey, nevermind. The important part is that you have really AWESOME PUZZLE moments here. Some of 'em are tricky, lots of 'em are "normal" but funny. The dialogs between James Quatermain and Jennifer Goodwin (your female partner) are funny and make you feel you're just right here - within the awesome temples and pyramids. ;)\nSo, if you love lots of puzzles, adventuring and of course Ego-Shooter then you have to try this game. :)\n\nPros:\n» lots of puzzles (easy and hard / before you can choose the difficulty for puzzles)\n» awesome atrmosphere with pyramids, temples and other "Egypt stuff"\n» nice graphics with the Unreal Engine 3 - the most time\n» funny dialogs\n» well-done mixture of adventuring and Ego-Shooter\n» long-driven story ( I played the whole game with adventuring moments 17 hours^^)\n\nCons:\n» shooting moments are boring and not challenging\n» some graphics bugs\n» at the beginning the controls are a bit complicated\n» The multiplayer part is a waste of time\n\n\nTell me what you think about this game if finished! :)","November 20, 2013","true","17.6"," 184 of 236 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","184","236","0","11"

In Deadfall you play as James Lee Quatermain, an adventurer who struggles to live up to his legendary adventurer of a grandfather, Allan Quatermain. Quatermain's new job is to escort a US agent called Jennifer Goodwin through an Egyptian temple to find an ancient treasure which will eventually lead you all across the world killing mummies and chasing Nazis.\n\nDeadfall is of course inspired by the likes of Indiana Jones and Uncharted and if you like those two things, or anything similar, chances are you're gonna have a good time playing this game. I'd also like to mention that at the time of writing my review I'm approximately halfway through the main campaign.\n\n+Great graphics with good visual effects\n+Great puzzles, they are challenging and often take a lot of thinking to solve but never feel too hard\n+Combat difficulty and puzzle difficulty can be changed independently\n+Interesting mix of genre\n+Overall mediocre gunplay apart from an interesting mechanic involving mummies and flashlights\n+Some cool locations\n+Lots of hidden collectibles to find\n+Relatively wide variety of weapons\n+Good variety of enemies to fight\n+Great atmosphere\n+Performs well on high settings even on my medium PC\n+Simple controls\n\n+/-All of the humour in the game is very cheesy, personally not my cup of tea but others may enjoy it\n\n-Bland voice acting\n-I noticed a fair few typos and occasionally missing words in the subtitles\n-Uninteresting story based around uninteresting characters\n-Riddled with bugs and glitches\n-Puzzle hints are almost entirely useless\n-Checkpoints are few and far between\n-Clunky animations\n\nVerdict:\n7\n\nDespite some issues I had fun playing Deadfall with its good graphics, great puzzles and its interesting genre combination.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Othrandur/recommended/231330/","Othrandur","Othrandur","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Othrandur/","3489 products in account","First, let's get one thing out of the way: this is not an Indiana Jones clone. Indiana Jones was himself based on and a tribute to Allan Quatermain (H.R. Haggard, 1885) and Professor George Edward Challenger (A.C. Doyle, 1912). And the protagonist of this game, James Lee Quatermain, Allan Quatermain's great-grandson, has a completely different personality (and a couple of jokes in the game point out those differences).\n\nBut the feel, the mood and the ambiance are the same, so Indiana Jones fans WILL enjoy it.\n\nThe good:\n\nWhen Lucas created Indiana Jones, he was trying to recreate the feel of 1930s action serials. This game succeeds in re-recapturing that feel and it's the main point in favor of this game. The scenery is beautiful and even the ceilings are worth admiring (not to mention that they also sometimes hold clues or things with which you can interact). The plot is unoriginal, but still engaging. The puzzles are logical and well integrated in the flow of the game. There's an interesting selection of weapons and they feel well balanced. You can kill an unarmored human enemy with one or two bullets, but they can return the favor, so you can't play this game as if you were Rambo. The journal, a very obvious copy of Henry Jones' journal, is not interesting to read, but it is very useful. Sometimes it just provides a hint for a puzzle. Other times, it's a key part of the puzzle and you can't solve it without consulting the journal. A nice touch is that the foreigners you meet speak in their native tongue, which makes it feel more authentic.\n\nThe bad:\n\nThe game is so linear that you might not notice a difference if they put it on rails. Backtracking is impossible because your entrance is invariably blocked every time you enter a new zone. I can't see this game having a lot of replayability. It uses the lazy, antiquated, and much hated checkpoint mechanism. Sometimes, the chekpoint is so far back that it can take 10 minutes to replay the part leading up to your death. Movement and shooting are ok, but in almost every other part of the interface, it feels so much like a console port that it's practically a slap in the face to PC users. You can only scroll back and forth between your weapons; you can't select the one you want directly. The POV is very strange and gives you the impression that you're only 4 feet tall. This feeling is exacerbated by the fact that you're unable to  jump on a crate that your grandmother could jump over. The jumping is so sluggish, in fact, that it's more irritating than useful. There are glitches that will let you get trapped between two objects and your only option is to restart from your last checkpoint.\n\nThe acting is a bit on the campy side, but not so much that it ruins the game.\n\nBut for all the little irritants, this is a fun little trip into an Indy-esque world and I still recommend it, though not at the ridiculously high full price.\n\nOne odd thing: the optional Allan Quatermain revolver that comes with the Deluxe edition is worse than the default Webley; it's just prettier.\n\nTwo suggestions: (1) don't swap your basic revolver for a better one you find. The basic revolver has infinite ammo, your new one does not! (2) If you're so inclined, you can change one of the ini files to give yourself infinite ammo for all weapons (instructions are on the web). A nice side-effect is that you end up keeping almost every weapon you find (you can usually carry only two), but you occasionally get stuck on one of them until some random event in the game clears the buggy state and you can switch weapons again. It's a fun way to run the game a second time.","October 20, 2014","true","8.1"," 86 of 106 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","86","106","0","1"

It's probably not going to be one of the titles that you will remember with nostalgy 10, 20 or 30 years from now, but it's not horrible either.\n\nIn terms of game concept, the main shortfall is its lack of originality: there's not a distinctive feature that sets it apart from other titles, not in terms of mechanics nor progression, or characters.  The fact that the game is inspired by the H. Rider Haggard novels (the same that inspired Lucas/Spielberg for Indiana Jones) makes the game feel like a knock-off of the glorious franchise from the '80s.  There's the fedora, the rolling rock ball chasing you, the ride on the mine cart, the female sidekick, etc...\n\nAt this point I would have still given it a "thumbs up" though: afterl all, not every single game must be ground-breaking and innovative.  However the execution is also unimpressive:\nI played it on "hard" (the max level available) on both combats and puzzles, but neither were much of a challenge (and I'm just an "average Joe" kind of player).\nA couple of times I walked behind a rock/tree/wall only to remain trapped behind it, or having my character bouncing up and down and not moving anywhere.\nSometimes clicking items in an order that did not reflect the programmers expectations (e.g. during the briefing at the agency) simply made impossible to make any progress, obliging me to reload the last saved checkpoint.\nBody animation is rigid and definitively sub-par relative to mainstream titles.\nI should also mention that I played DA on a linux box (64bit, brand new nVidia card with proprietary drivers, CPU 8 cores, 16Gb RAM) and the port is of beta quality at best.  In particular there is some issue with shader compilation, so that even on my machine (which is quite top-end, hardware-wise), just to boot the game requires ~3 minutes.\n\nIn-game transitions between different segments of a map are affected by the same problem, although at a much smaller scale (5-10 seconds of waiting).  This is acceptable while roaming on foot in the map, but it totally breakes the experience in fast-paced transitions like those in the mine cart run (basically you are left with a fixed screenshot and the music background, and when animation resumes you are much further down the railtrack than when you last were playing.\n\nAgain: the game is not horrible.  It's "ok", but the world is a big place, and I would rather recommend something else to a friend.\n\n","September 23, 2014","false","22.3"," 107 of 138 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","107","138","0","3"

Deadfall Adventures has the setting and story of Indiana Jones, the style of Uncharted and the gameplay of... a generic first person shooter. You play this game from a first person perspective which is actually a very nice twist on the genre. You'll be traveling to different parts of the world to find hidden treasures, solve puzzles and chase bad guys.\n\nLike I said, the game has the vibe of Indiana Jones. It all looks very colorful and very adventurous. It has awesome, detailed graphics and horrible, horrible voice acting. A damn shame, because the rest of the game is actually worthwhile, but the voice acting is one of the things that drags the game down. The other thing that drags the game down are the firefights. It's inaccurate and doesn't feel realistic. It's important, because near the end you'll be fighting off more and more enemies.\n\nThe story is fun in that it doesn't take itself all that seriously. It will be fun as long as you keep that in mind.\n\nThere are also loads of treasures to be found; some can be found in the open, some are hidden and can be found by simply exploring and some can be collected by solving puzzles. These puzzles are usually simple to solve and can be completed in just a few minutes. If some of these puzzles were only a bit harder it would've given you a better feeling of accomplishment.\nDoesn't take away the fact that it's fun to try and find these treasures. Treasures can also be used to upgrade your character, but I didn't notice much of a difference when I first started the game and when I eventually finished the game. He still felt like the exact same guy to me.\n\nCheckpoints are sometimes awkwardly placed so if you die while trying to solve a second or third puzzle you might have to start all over from the beginning. This can be frustrating but usually it's just a couple of minutes. Still... annoying.\n\nDeadfall Adventures wants to be a first person Uncharted and in a way The Farm 51 has succeeded in doing this. Next time, keep the graphics, improve the voice acting and shooting aspects, make the puzzles (a bit) harder and you'll probably have a great, fun sequel in your hands.\n\n[Rating: 79/100]","November 30, 2013","true","15.0"," 88 of 110 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","88","110","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Macgyverthehero/recommended/231330/","Macgyverthehero","Macgyverthehero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Macgyverthehero/","102 products in account","Personally, I enjoyed the experience that was Deadfall Adventures, because this game is meant for people who are fans of the Adventure/Fantasy genre, but with archaeologists.\n\nSadly this means not everyone might enjoy this, as this follows the usual "Get to the artifact before the badguys get to it and use it for world domination" cliche. Also, since the game is focused in the first person, some gamers might expect alot of good action in a first person perspective environment, but I will say that the shooting bits of the game are pretty generic, along with the usual cliche armies of Nazis and Russians (yes the two most cliche kinds of badguys in shooters are in the same game together.)\n\nIn my opinion, I did not mind the cliches as they were exactly what I wanted and expected from the game, because the game does take place in the eyes of an archaeologist, and I always like adventures involving such a profession. This game does it's best to recreate the kind of Indiana Jones like adventure we expect in a game involving archaeologists, so I understand why the shooting sections seems generic, because the game wants to focus more on the actual adventure and not just drown it in FPS heaven... which can be a bad thing if overdone.\n\nI heard a bunch of people complained about some of the puzzles in the game, saying it was either too confusing, too straight forward, or the hints of the ingame journal seem too vague. I played through the game myself and only once did I have to look up a walkthrough for a puzzle, turns out that certain puzzle I was stuck on was super simple as all I had to do was shoot a lever. Some puzzles in the game did seem confusing at first to me, but after some thought and looking around I did actually figure out what to do, and the journal only seemed very vague to me just once in the game, which was at that one super simple puzzle I mentioned. There was indeed some simple straight forward puzzles, but I felt these puzzles were a simple relief to the bigger and more complex puzzles I encountered previously. Overall, I felt the puzzles were fun and it felt good just to finally solve each one.\n\nMy only complaint in the game is character animations in the cutscenes. Characters move awkwardly in cutscenes, which reminded me of how bad the character animations in the game Dead Island were in cutscenes when I used to play that.\nOther than that, I pretty much enjoyed myself with the rest of the game.\n\nMy favourite part of Deadfall Adventures was the very cool and well done minecart chase scenes were done in the Mine level of the game. That part of the game made me feel very nostalgic as this seemed to be a clear reference to the minecart chase scene in the film Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.\n\nSadly I could not try out the multiplayer portion of the game, since nobody was hosting anything. So I shall skip this part of the review since I was late for the party.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed this game. I really liked the adventure it let me experience, as I also had alot of fun with the characters, even if our archaeologist hero seemed awkwardly animated in cutscenes along with everyone else. I got through alot of fun puzzles and moments in the game, just feeling the nostalgia of older adventures touching my heart with each step.\n\nNow, I recommend this game to people and fans who enjoy adventures starring archaeologists, travelling, exploring temples, avoiding traps, solving ancient puzzles, and recovering mythical and genuine artifacts for fortune and glory. This game is not as bad as Metacritic says on the store page, as I feel it deserves more, because the game is based for a certain kind of audience who would enjoy this, no matter how cliche the things in this game sound. I missed playing a good adventure starring an archaeologist in the 20th century, and that is exactly what I got to play once again with Deadfall Adventures.\n\nThank you Farm 51 for giving me another adventure to play. I hope the next adventure you guys make will be a successor to Deadfall Adventures, because you guys deserve more than that cruddy 53 out of 100 Metacritic gave you for it.","August 1, 2014","true","15.5"," 50 of 61 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","50","61","0","1"

Though for 5 bucks it's entertaining enough to make it worth your money. When playing the game you see the potential it has, but it has been brought down by under par voice acting and dialogs with weird pauses during conversations and a very cliché story.\n\nThere are also a few bugs in the game such as accidently pressing a wrong key (T) where your character becomes frozen and unable to move, you have to reload a checkpoint to fix it. You can also find maps in the levels, but no key to bring up the maps and look at them.\n\nAnd in general the gameplay and game mechanics is really not what you expect when you look at the nice graphics. It is just so under par compared to the graphics and the pretty detailed texturing. Shooting in this game is plain bad, your accuracy (unscoped) has little to do with hitting the AI target or not, it's unpricize by design. The AI is pretty bad too. instead of you going in to cover and shotting at the AI tactically from a dfistance you can just go beserk and run up to them and shoot them in the face from 1 meter away. And there are dozens more thing I could sum up that is either completely missing ((mini)map for example), or lacking and under par.\n\nThe game is a lot like Uncharted, but then clearly made with a much lower budget and a worse story.\n\nVerdict: 68/100","September 19, 2015","true","6.8"," 40 of 50 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","40","50","3","0"

In many ways Deadfall Adventures is the sort of game that just reiterates how out of touch the gaming journalism industry has gotten where AAA games are almost granted enmity because of publishing house clout and money. It's like a snake eating its own tail thinking that it's devouring prey or predator when in fact is killing itself. One can only hope!\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=213629569\nThanks to the many sites out there people firmly believe that when a game lands with a rating of 6.5 or below it's considered to be crap or a failure. I simply can't support an industry that propagates this kind of foolishness. I landed up in a heated debate with a mindless minion that a 6.5 rating is not the same as a 4 or a 3 or a 2. In what world is a "C" or a "D" consideration for failure when you can also get an "E" or an "F"?\n\nI'll be honest here - the game was never on my radar. I hardly knew it existed until one day when walking into pay my account I just happened to be the lucky 50th customer and thus landed up winning Deadfall Adventures (they also gave away a PS4 to the lucky 1000th customer that day but alas my timing was off as usual). After getting home and waiting for the game to install I started to peruse the reviews only to find that it seemed like a bit of the dogs breakfast. The picture painted was not very pretty. Ho Hum I said - At least it was free! With expectations lowered I entered the game to see if this really was as bad as the reviews were making it out to be. I have to simply ask what game were the journalists playing because this has been one hell of an incredibly fun experience, especially for someone who grew up adoring Indiana Jones as a kid and thoroughly enjoying The Mummy movies as an adult.\n\nLets just clear the slate and start by saying this game was never gonna win any awards and I don't think the developers had GOTY in their head whilst developing the game but if you like your matinee adventures you are bound to get some enjoyment out of this title. In fact you will probably thoroughly enjoy it. Taking on the role of James Quatermain (a descendant of the legendary Alan Quatermain), you are drafted into help a US government agency find fragments of a legendary item known as the Heart of Atlantis. It is slowly revealed that the pieces of the Heart are located within various temples around the globe, temples protected by ancient magic and deadly traps. Thus begins your adventure trying to locate all the pieces before the Nazi or Russian Army locate them, both of which have dubious reasons for wanting to piece the heart back together again, reasons that don't involve the good of all humanity at their core. The hunt is on!\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=218264931\nDeadfall Adventures proceeds to throw you into a puzzle adventuring world propagated with blazing gun battles and filled with set pieces lifted straight from the films that populate the genre whilst still adding its own spin to the presentation. You can see the developers have a great love for the genre and that comes across loud and clear in the stunning environments they have created. As you move from Egypt to the Arctic and then onto the Mayan Jungle, the level of detail presented just gets better and better. Deadfall Adventures can really be breathtakingly beautiful at times. Not everything is sunshine and roses though! The character models can be a bit stiff and the voice cast, whilst not bad by any means, could have been better but then that is just nitpicking because if anything the whole script and voice work echoes the b-movie vibe the game is so desperately trying to recreate. The puzzle sections could have also been a bit more on the difficult side but they really just echo the puzzles adventures from the past so if you don't go in expecting to solve a MENSA puzzle fest that is going to make you feel like a smart Alec then you are still going to enjoy them.\n\nThe shooting mechanics are solid, Deadfall Adventures is after all made by the same team that brought us the Painkiller series as well as NecroVision (which I have not yet tried but will now definitely look out for) and some of the adventure set pieces like the runaway mine cart or descent into the heart of the Mayan Temples belly are really quite exhilarating and fun to experience. The game employs a similar mechanic propagated from Alan Wake where a torchlight is required to be shone on the enemies that rise from the dead to protect the treasures they guard in order to burn off magical wards before they can be killed with shotgun, machine gun or pistol. Some of these later encounters are really tense and great fun to clear as rooms fill with mummies and zombie monstrosities out to ensure your bones become dust within the tombs they protect.\n\nThe game comes with full multi-player but due to the nature of hardly anyone having purchased the game the servers are empty but all the usual modes like survival, deathmatch and team deathmatch are available. The game is also fully co-opable and had I know this I would have gotten another player involved in the adventure with me. In fact I may still.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=213480679\nI really enjoyed Deadfall Adventures and while it certainly didn't present me with anything new - what it did was make me have immense fun whilst playing it. How many AAA titles these days actually employ the fun mechanic? Most just irritate and feel like bouts of work to be honest. I seriously suggest you all look out for this on a sale and pick it up.

From poor character development, the occasional illogical or stupidly easy puzzle, primitive first person shooter experience, and cheap rpg aspect, I had a lot of trouble getting as far in the game as I did. I will say that there is a layer of nostalgia as the storyline and environment liken to Indiana Jones movies a bit, but if you want to watch an adventure film do just that and bypass this game.\n\nMy points in more depth:\n\n- Poor character development: Jumping right into the story the characteres prod with one another endlessly with mundane and all to frequent jest. The dialog and voice quality is lacking any intelligent use of pause, and becomes annoyingly predictable.\n\n- Puzzles are not very enjoyable after the initial nuance, in that the basic principle to shoot the block, or match the faces with the cheat sheet (in game little "Perk") is overused. Other puzzles were somewhat unique but either lacked a logical or discernably logical hint, like the rotate floating particles to make a shape puzzles. One such puzzle was eventually solved through trial and error, and didn't end up making a recognizable image. That was frusterating.\n\n- The first person shooter aspect is usually what draws me into a game. The satisfying plink of the well placed stealth head shot kill. Sadly this game's fps setup is a strict point and shoot. It reminds me in a way of hyperstudio from years ago where you defind a region, and if you "crouched" the region go slightly larger. Click anywhere in the region and you hit the target in (to make things easy) a random location selected from a finite and small preset. Oh yes, and the shotgun is just stupid - small amounts of ammo, no effective spread, and incredibly weak power. Besides headshots what's not more fun than rounding the corner and point blank blasting the baddie with a shotgun? Well, in the game your out of luck because even at point blank range it'll take three or four shells. Sure, we're talking older weapons, and sure, the enemy might have body armor. But at close range in the kevlar you're going to be at least knocked back.\n\n- Lastly, the rpg aspect of this game was pretty bland. A simple grid of powerups that are all vanilla. Shoot or reload faster - upgrade health pool, longer more powerful flashlight. Sure these are great and all if those are the starting base talents for a more complex tree. Sadly this is it for the game, for the trouble of running around and looking int every possible hidden corner in the game you get to aim a little better, and upgrade the once "interesting" combat mechanic (flashlight to weaken and kill zombies). In my opinion a good/fun rpg is one with talents that change how you play the game, and do so with very unique means. Take the classic fantasy class differences between melee, stealth, and magic combat structures.\n\nIn short, I think the designers of this game tried to do a little too much in incorporating too many game archetypes into one. Sure, it's possible to create a great game in this way, but sadly this one stretched itself too far in too many directions, and its playability or "fun factor" if you will, suffered for it.","December 10, 2013","false","3.7"," 98 of 150 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","98","150","0","4"

Honestly, it is one of the most beautiful games I have played through. The visual concepts and designs are just stunning. Gun play is, well... basic but excellent smooth gunplay. Fighting mechanics work how they are meant to, even if they arent anything extraoridnary. I would recommend this to anyone who finds themselves between big title games.

You can describe it as a First Person Shooter Indiana Jones or Uncharted. The game doesn't look that bad and the gameplay is somewhat decent but the more I played it the more I despised it. No matter what gun you use they all feel the same, there's barely any recoil on the guys and they're fairly standard, usual World War 2 weaponry, you can either fire from the hip or aim down sights and that's probably one of the things I less enjoy on a First Person Shooter. Not only to mention it has regenerating health which is something I really hate in games nowadays because you can just go hide behind cover and wait for you to recover full health. The game is extremely linear but it does reward exploration by finding treasure which you can then spend upgrading your health, health regeneration, decreasing weapon spread and recoil etc. The game has some interesting design choices to it such as the use of the compass to find hidden treasure and the ocasional treasure maps you come across on each level, ocasionally you'll come across some puzzle sections in temples that do provide a varied and different experience from the rest of the game and the only help you have to beat them is your notebook, this was probably for me the only strong point of the game. Story wise it's kinda okay, the voice acting is pretty much terrible but it ocasionaly has some humour on the writing. There's also no save feature, only checkpoints which might upset some people, such as me. Overall, considering it's price I don't think Deadfall Adventures is a game you should be looking foward to, it's also worth mentioning it costs 40€ for europeans while it also costs $40 for people from North America which it's a considerable price difference. I'd recommend avoiding it, if you're eager to try it out you might want to wait for a heavy discount.","January 31, 2014","false","12.8"," 29 of 43 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","29","43","0","0"

The story is nothing special but it's interesting enough. The action is good, the music is well-done, and the puzzles are challenging. There is a lot to like here.\n\nUnfortunately Deadfall Adventures has numerous setbacks. The biggest one being the abysmal dialogue. The writing is average, but the voice acting is awful. Characters are loud when they should be quiet, and quiet when they should be loud. There are odd pauses throughout conversations, and some of the voice lines are just downright delayed beyond belief.\n\nThe other big issue is the widescreen support (or lack thereof), and the FOV. While I praise Deadfall Adventure's FOV slider for offering the player an unusually large variation (up to 140), the weapon view models are unaffected by this FOV. Thus, although you can set the FOV to a high number, you cannot remove the visual sensation that your character is holding his gun right in front of his eyeball.\n\nHowever, with some tweaking this can be fixed. An excellent (and free) program called Flawless Widescreen will allow you to tweak the weapon FOV to be more acceptable.\n\nFortunately, this fix is a trivial one. And once you have completed it, you should have no trouble enjoying the game's unique blend of shooting and puzzle-solving.\n\nMy only other problem with Deadfall Adventures was its difficulty. And I don't mean the game was too hard. Rather, I think it was far too easy. In my first playthrough, I set both the puzzle and combat difficulty to their highest (Hard), and had little trouble with it. Bare in mind that I also restricted myself from using any of the upgrades throughout the game, in order to try and increase the game's challenge. I think the difficulty on the puzzles was a good balance, but the combat was far too forgiving.\n\nThe culprit behind the easy combat is likely the game's rather stupid AI. The enemies will often walk slowly towards the player with no regard for their safety. Or sometimes they'll pop up from behind cover, aim at the player, and take several seconds before they actually pull the trigger. This gives the player plenty of opportunities to eliminate them.\n\nHowever, do not let these faults detract from the game too much. In spite of the above, there is much to like in Deadfall Adventures. I found the puzzles (for the most part) to be challenging and just frustrating enough to keep me going. The weapons were also surprisingly satisfying. Couple that with an interesting story, and a chance to play what is essentially the Indiana Jones FPS we never got, and Deadfall Adventures is a fun, albeit flawed, gaming experience.","February 11","true","11.8"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

Not bad, but not great either! By far and away the biggest letdown is the sound. It’s unconvincing, lacks any sense of realism, and to make matters worse the voice actors are absolutely terrible. The story sections of the game feel like they were directed by an eight year old, and are just embarrassingly poor. So the game is mixed. Some elements are good, some are poor.

Rider Haggard (Kings Solomon's Mine, Allan Quatermain, and Allan's Wife) and it makes me appreciate this game even more just for turning me onto the books. BUT that said, I wanted to mention that any fan of the books shouldn't expect anything close to them in the game. Like I mentioned in my review it borrows from Indiana Jones regardless of being inspired by Quatermain. Now I can flatly state; Beyond the name and it being an adventure, it borrows 95% from Indiana Jones versus 5% from Allan Quatermain. Which makes that whole discussion/argument even more silly. Regardless! I enjoyed the game standing on its own, as a bonus it turned me on to the books, which I enjoyed for their own reasons and separately, that in turn kind of make me want to play the game again looking for direct book references beyond being Allan's grandson (if there is any). To reiterate though, "don't expect a Haggard inspired romance" is the supposedly edit worthy point I wished to make.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW (December 2014); This is one of those bad games that I personally enjoyed for some reason. And I do mean bad.\n\nFirst up, the price. I got it on sale for $4 USD, do NOT pay more than that.\n\nSecond, I've noticed a silly argument on it being based on a book series vs. ripping off a movie series. It is based off a book series that also happened to inspire Indiana Jones (some), BUT it also does borrow from Indiana Jones. It doesn't "rip it off" but it directly references Indiana Jones on multiple occasions and clearly draws inspiration from the movies. Which isn't a bad thing! It is based on the book series but also inspired by Indiana. I just don't even know why its a discussion but it is, and I just kept it going haha.\n\nLOTS more bad stuff; Graphical glitches, frame rate drops, downright silly character animations, plot holes, plot jumps, invisible walls, places to get stuck, clunky puzzles to get to areas our adventurer could clearly just leap or climb to, mindless AI, and more I can't recall. But worst of all is the silly saving system. Checkpoints that activate after killing certain enemies or triggering certain puzzles. Rather annoying on a game with hidden side treasures and traps that insta-kill. Upon death it reloads you to the checkpoint and you gotta get all the side stuff again. There just happened to be a few long distances with high chances of death between a few checkpoints that made this a fatal flaw but for the most part the checkpoints do come often enough. Another time I killed a boss with minions still running about and it triggered a cutscene that when over had me standing right in the middle of the surviving minions. You can read all the negative reviews that elaborate on all the problems and more I didn't mention.\n\nI guess I should mention that despite the bad animations, graphical glitches, and frame rate drops, this game does look pretty damn good overall. And then also, I only play single player games and didn't even attempt the multiplayer.\n\nIn the end though, I had fun. I really did. This game has some sort of weird charm to it that got ahold of me. Maybe it was the over the top adventure, or the cheesy one-liners, or the puzzles that actually took thought, or a little bit of all of it. It was a fun casual game that took just over 8hrs to complete. I just simply had fun. And you might too!

However, if you're expecting an action-adventure focused game, you will be disappointed. Deadfall is very heavy on the shooting, and it's the "waves of enemies" variety. The gunplay is decent, but it still gets tedious. On top of that, the checkpoints are poorly spaced, which means you can be harshly punished for failing to pass a hazard while trying to reach treasure by having to redo a giant firefight all over again. The game feels stretched out too. I'd rather play a shorter and more focused game. None of the issues are deal breakers, but they do prevent the game from ever being all that fun.","December 19, 2014","true","24.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Treasure hunting, puzzle solving, ancient traps, single-handedly taking on most of the Nazi army and a mine cart rollercoaster feature prominently.\nPlotline is enough to keep things moving, although it does little more than that. Characters are archetypical and plotlines are frequently common tropes. That said the gameplay itself is fun and varied. Best of all so far not a single puzzle has required me to go out of game and google for a solution, unlike many other puzzle based games. In fact, I would recommend starting on a difficulty above normal.\nOn the downside there are a few bugs. The animations in cut-scenes are sometimes quite laughable, occasionally the NPC scripts don’t fire off in a timely manner leaving you staring at a gate you can’t open, waiting for them to finish whatever it is NPCs do when not bending to the will of the player. None of these bugs have yet proven game breaking, just mildly irritating. I’ve seen far worse bugs from bigger devs, that’s for sure.\nOverall – well worth a look, some great fun moments slightly marred by poor game behaviour.\n","September 21, 2015","true","6.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I spent only a short time playing it during the free weekend, and all I can say is, with 2 players and on EASY, the enemies are near invulnerable (takes all your ammo to kill ONE of the weaker enemies), and the easiest method to kill them is to make use of the dozens of traps placed around each of the maps. This makes for very dull gameplay, where you feel like scooby doo on the run from a bad guy, just running around, and timing the traps which you have to SHOOT to activate, and kill the enemies with.\n\nCould have been better, but if the easiest survival mode was this dull, I can only imagine how awful the competitive is, and how dull the campaign must be. If the campaign were COOP it would give the game some redemption, but its not, sadly. The story looks like it could be interesting but I have no interest in playing through this game alone.","March 1, 2014","false","0.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

THANK god it was only a free trial!\n\nThe game is so flawed I cannot express how much in a simple review. Firstly, the voice acting is shockingly poor, I would not expect ultra high class from a AAA game, but these voice actors should be shot, flat, monotone in some places and just generally off putting!\n\nGraphics - graphically the game is poor and does not make use of the Unreal engine, there are issues with low texture buffering and loading in, load popping and sync issues. I have a decent PC and can run this game without any issue, but this was a low showing effort.\n\nGun play - was shocking!! the guns handled differently on single player than they did in multiplayer, I do not mean a small difference, its like they were different guns!\n\nControls - the controls are slow, clunky and just didnt feel polished in the least, I have played top notch FPS games for years and this game I would easily rate as one of the worst for controls. The controls on multiplayer are different as well, backwards movement is almost like you are not moving at all.....totally pointless when in a gun fight. Staying with MP, when aiming down sights, there is virtually NO recoil, was this done to try and make the game easier so people would stick with it? For whatever reason it was done, it should be undone.\n\nPuzzles/Treasures - the puzzles were simple and straight forward to complete (without using the cheat sheet) and the treasures were easy to find, almost making it pointless to have them in the game.\n\nWould I recommend this game no anyone? no, is the short answer, I will be removing this game from my hard drive and appologising to said hard drive for installing this worthless pile of garbage on it.","March 1, 2014","false","0.8"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Also, the player model's FoV is way too close to the ground, making it extremely hard to solve some of the puzzles and keep an overview of your surroundings. The voice acting is pretty bad as well, but that is the least of the issues which downgrade this game's fun factor...\n\nFor all that is being topped by the sickening head bobbing that can only be deactivated if you know where to look (the user-specific configs are located on C:, not in the Steam game's folder and you need to find the correct file, too). Speaking of head bobbing, why do developers still implement that crap into their games when it is NOT realistic at all? (In reality, your eyes don't pop up and down in your head, you move as a whole which does not cause motion sickness.)\n\nQuite disappointed in what the developers did with the Unreal Engine. Look at Dark Messiah, for instance. That is how a technically well developed game plays (and that game is about a decade older). You move with ease and a feel of realism. No such thing here, very laggy feel and frustrating.\n\nP.S. After testing the multiplayer, which is a non-strategic, monotonous "Kill, kill, kill" in the so-advertised co-op mode (my friend had to google in order to find out what game mode was supposed to be the co-op one), I have to say: Don't.

How wrong I was.\nThree weapon limit (divided into pistol/rifle/heavy weapon categories), regenerating health, very slow and tedious action, terrible enemy AI. Enemies are either humans with terrible aim that take potshots from behind cover or monsters that slowly shamble toward you. The pacing is pretty slow and most of your time is spent solving boring puzzles with the world's worst hint system (some indecipherable drawings in your notepad) followed by boring combat.\nThere's two good things about it though: the script is consistently funny in an intentional comedy-adventure film way and the graphics are very pretty despite the chracter animations being very stiff.

It's a stupid game with ♥♥♥♥-easy "puzzles" and moronic enemy AI. With the Linux version, it takes about 20 minutes to get from pressing the play button to an actual level. That's 20 minutes of load time alone! When it finishes loading, you'll get to kill humans, kill mummies or watch mummies kill humans. And while that might sound like fun, it was way more fun to type this sentence since the game does the standard COD thing. You know that COD thing; where your only HP indicator is the blood splatters on the screen and your HP regens quicker than they can kill you, so if you ever think you're going to die, you just hide in a corner and pluck a couple nosehairs until all the raspberry jelly on the screen goes away and you're good to go.\n\nThe "puzzles" can vary from performing complexed actions like pushing a button, to pulling a lever, to rotating rocks with symbols on them. In one such situation, I had to rotate two rocks next to a door to find the right combination of symbols to open the door. Some experienced puzzle-solvers would look around the room to find hints, and if they did, they would notice the answer is carved on the ♥♥♥♥ing door. I'm not making this up. It's carved on the door two feet away from the rocks. It's HUGE, too. You can't miss it. All you have to do look slightly up and you'll see it. But just in case you do miss it, the game even tells you to check your in-game notebook, which flat out tells you exactly the same thing. Both rocks, same symbol. The same exact ♥♥♥♥ing symbol that also happens to be the same exact ♥♥♥♥ing answer to the last 4 ♥♥♥♥ing puzzles. And it's like that with every puzzle. The notebook is always there to spoonfeed every answer to you, like you're going to forget all the puzzles have the same exact solution. And the notebook wouldn't be such a bad thing except the game always tells you to check it first.\n\nThe only puzzle that proved to be a challenge was the one where there are three buttons to stand on to make a statue slide out of the way. Your uterus sidekick stands on one, you shoot a sarcophagus to make a mummy fall out and land on another, then you stand on the last. And from there? No idea. I tried to run and jump through the gap in the wall, I spammed grenades every where, I tried to kill the ovary-keeping sidekick a few times and nothing worked. I eventually gave up and checked the forums. Apparently, beating this puzzle was supposed to trigger the next cutscene or whatever and that just wasn't happening. So the stupid ♥♥♥ puzzle was bugged the whole time?! I refuse to waste anymore time on this one. Crappy, buggy, easy, overpriced, eyecandy game. Uninstalled. Deleted save file. Smashed computer with a hammer. Not worth it.","March 1, 2014","false","4.4"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","11","19","0","0"

I wasted about 2 hours on it alone going over the buttons and trying to follow my hand map saying 3x's push this one etc. I looked up Walkthrough Videos and did the exact same thing they did (just stood on the button to the right and enemies came out for them) and tried everything and it does nothing (but move the statue except no enemies as seen in the walkthroughs or the wall fails to open up all the way).\n\nI even restarted the level to reboot it and still same issue, so am stuck! It reminds me of Sniper Ghost Warrior 2 with such bugs that restrict going on. Until this is fixed and the game is consistent for all, I have to give a thumbs down.  I will have to uninstall, have too many good games to waste more time on such issues which will probably continue then.  The game seemed pretty promising too!\n\nThe other puzzles are decent, although the little hand maps leave lots of guess work, I guess they want it like the real world - you would have to do things via trial and error, but with no assist after awhile that is not very entertaining and a waste of time.

It seems like it could be great, but it's just not.\n\nMainly, because it's very buggy. Try to take cover behind objects in the environment, and chances are you'll end up stuck, and have to load the game to get out. The cutscenes are really quite buggy as well. Quartermain (the protagonist) can often be seen weilding what appears to be modern semi-automatic pistols in cutscenes, yet these do not appear at any point in the game. In other cutscenes he weilds his revolvers, which are actually weapons in the game. Sometimes he's wearing a hat in one cutscene, it's gone in the next, yet mysteriously reappears in the one after that. No explaination there.\n\nThere are tons of bugs though. Sometimes the FOV gets stuck after zooming in with a weapon, so the player's view is zoomed in while the weapon is no longer being aimed, or even wielded.\n\nSometimes when switching between the compass or notepad and a weapon, it gets stuck, making combat impossible until the game is re-loaded.\n\nSometimes the player is killed by traps that are too far away to possibly do any harm (such as being killed by a spear coming through the floor a few feet to the player's side)\n\nAttempting to jump over even small objects is pointless. Even though the player does appear to jump to a decent height, attempting to jump over a small rock or crate is impossible, and usually just results in getting stuck inside it.\n\nOccasionally for no appearent reason, the notepad or compass will sort of jiggle around or float above the player's hand.\n\nOther annoyances seem intentional, such as all of the insta-death traps, invisible walls that kill the player, and the fact that for some reason Quartermain dies on contact with water. Falling any distance is pretty much survivable, even though there is falling damage. However dropping off of a low ledge into an area the devs don't want you going results in instant death, and it's not always easy to tell where you aren't meant to go.\n\nThese annoyances wouldn't be too terrible if it wasn't for the checkpoint system being used somewhat sparingly. Dying can send you back half a level.\n\nQuartermain's voice acting is terrible and sounds forced. Which is particularly odd when you consider the fact that every other character in the game seems to have decent voice actors.\n\nThe puzzles are pretty disappointing as well. They don't make you think at all. Most of them make absolutely no sense without using the notebook which the game constantly nags you to open with text that pops up on the screen. The notebook pretty much gives step by step instructions on how to solve each puzzle. There's nothing to solve, just instructions to follow that tell you exactly what to do.\n\nThe combat is bland as well. It comes in short bursts, and there are really no surprises. Whenever you're about to enter any kind of combat, you usually get a cutscene first, or at the very least hear the enimies loudly talking which gives far too much warning.\n\nTo inspire exploration, there are artifacts hidden throughout the game as well, however most of which are hidden in plain sight, and if any aren't, your compass points you right to them. To make things even easier, if you don't have the compass out when you're in the general area of an artifact, an indicator flashes on the screen, and if that doesn't make it easy enough, there's even a treasure map for each level. But these artifacts don't seem to do all too much. You can trade them in for upgrades at statues, but the upgrades are very subtle. A little more health, a little faster reload time... and i didn't really notice much of any difference after upgrading the attributes, so it's hardly worth it.\n\nThe story line is pretty bad too. -MILD SPOILERS HERE- You spend the entire game looking for pieces of an artifact, then by the end of the game, you never figure out what it really is, or even what it does. The final boss uses it to become... powerful in some rather generic way, then it's gone when you defeat him.\n\nI had very high expectations for this game, because i really do tend to enjoy this genre, but this game... not so much. Certainly not worth $40. If you can pick it up in a sale for well under $10, maybe give it a try. But it's actually a pretty terrible game. Incredibly buggy too. If it were an early access game, i could forgive it, but it's not.","March 10, 2014","false","10.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Rider Haggard's Allan Quatermain, a fictional big game hunter who spent most of his life in Africa, seeking to improve the lives of the native people without destroying their culture--so, Allan wasn't a terrible guy, and the simple fact is...the game should have been about him. In their desire to emulate all the Quatermain knockoffs, primarily Indiana Jones, the developers instead make an Indiana Jones knockoff. You fight Nazis who are trying to steal some ancient relics that are mysterious sources of power, bring a potential love interest along, have, for a while, a wise cracking cohort (somewhat surprisingly a German), and solve puzzles while ruining ancient tombs. So, the story is somewhat lacking.\nGameplay wise, it's nothing special. Combat works alright. There's a limit cover mechanic, though shooting out of it isn't smooth, grenades aren't devastating to you or your enemies. There's a flashlight mechanic for dealing with risen mummies that's straight out of a horror game, and even on higher difficulty settings makes them the least dangerous enemies except in occasional swarms.\nThere's a system for increasing your skills and attributes, but you could go the entire game without doing it and not suffer. It works based on locating artifacts that give you points, and a sufficient number of points let you up things like health, stamina, weapon reload time, the flashlight enhancing skill, and so on. But, again, their help is minimal, and it feels tacked on. Also tacked on: treasure maps that show you where the artifacts are, but without a birds eye view for location context, they're not all that useful.\nThe puzzles are kind of fun, but if you take too long, your female companion starts spouting off a helpful line of dialogue--just one, over and over and over, until you want to shoot her.\n\nThings that would've added greatly: Better characterization. The sexual tension was laughable, and the script could definitely use a once-over. More back and forth between the characters would've actually been okay for those long walks between combat sessions, while the combat dialogue could've used more than the female character always complaining that the Nazis were moving closer to her. This was especially true in one hilarious context in which she was nowhere near the action, just waiting for me to take a standard slow video game elevator down while under fire. She was in literally no danger, and just kept repeating that one line over and over.\nA better spread of weapons, or modifiable weapons, would've been nice.\nSome sort of stealth mechanic would've actually gone a long way. You disarm occasional traps, how about setting some?\nAnd, finally, the lead character feels wrong. If the devs wanted to do a story in Quatermain's universe, how about doing one about Quatermain?\nI feel like this is one of those rare instances where a sequel could outshine its original. It's a pretty firm 7/10. Grab it on sale, play it once, forget about it.","September 15, 2015","true","5.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I'm having quite a bit of fun with it. Nordic Games have a bright future, they are still rough around the edges a bit and certain areas of this game could've been more polished (voice-acting being my biggest complaint). The core gameplay keeps me playing through and it has enough variety to keep me entertained throughout thanks to scenery changes and the different types of enemies. Yes, the combat could be a bit better but I really like how the guns feel and sound quite authentic.\n\nIf you see this game available at a reasonable price and you are a fan of action-adventure games (i.e. the new Tomb Raider reboot...which I thought was amazing and the Uncharted games) this game is right up your alley. Being a fan of Indiana Jones does help a bit too! :) Forget the awful Alan Quartermaine movies from the 80's though... although this game's voice acting isn't top notch it's still better than those movies!\n\nThe developer listens to the community (just look what they did with Red Faction G! They totally ripped out GFWL and have put a lot of time and effort implimenting community suggestions and the game is now better than ever. The reboot of Painkiller they did was also well done although I wish they'd do a completely NEW title for the franchise and make it great to get recognition.\n\nWell to sum it all up this game is a fun romp (even the multiplayer is decent) and I'd most certainly recommend it to any FPS fan who doesn't expect AAA titles with every game they play. Play this game knowing it could be better but enjoy it for what it is! Nordic Games have a bright future indeed and I'll be keeping my eye on them for sure.","January 15, 2015","true","13.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Any other time that might be unusual."\n\nDeadfall Adventures is a decent first person shooter, action adventure game, with fun puzzles and beautiful graphics, but with voice acting, dialogue, and repetitive combat that brings it down. Good idea that seemed rushed, unpolished, and left with untapped potential. Worth one playthrough of decent length, not much to come back for though.\n\n*Gameplay*+ Decently fun, good distraction\n+ Some great puzzles\n- A lot of tedious and/or boring puzzles\n+ Combat is mildly entertaining\n+ Mummies!\n- Repetitive combat\n\nSome very cool, and interesting puzzles, surrounded by many tedious, boring puzzles that bring down the overall quiality of the game. Combat is fun but gets repetitive quite quickly, but having mummies and occasionally changing the weapons and appearance of enemies helps keep it sort of interesting.\n\n*Graphics*+ Beautiful Environments\n+ Amazing Graphics, the water, plants, ect, all looked great\n- Not enough variety\n\nAmazingly looking graphics and beautiful environments throughout the game. Plants, water, enemies, temples, everything looks well-polished, but what it makes up for in quality, it lacks in variety. Many environments ( which takes place in different parts of the world ) look almost identical with little variation.\n\n*Dialogue/Cutscenes/Story*+ Occasionally something interesting would happen\n+ Decent story\n- Slow quite often\n- Painful, PAINFUL dialogue\n- Clunky cutscenes\n\nThe story in Deadfall Adventures is mildly interesting at best, with only a few moments of actual true interest, despite it being quite predictable. Slow throughout the whole game, clunky cutscenes that are badly executed, and some of the worst dialogue I have seen in a game in a while. It was cringe worthy half the time and the other half I simply felt embarrassed for them.\n\n*Exploration/Adventuring Aspect*+ Fun side puzzles occasionally\n+ Feel like you're actually on an adventure at times\n- Pretty linear path\n- Minimal actual "exploration" (More just looking around in a decently sized area for a shiny)\n\nThe exploration aspect is almost non-existent, however; they have mini puzzles when attempting to retrieve artifacts that make them interesting enough for me to look for them. You are basically on one path, look around the area for artifacts you can find, move on to the next area, and get locked out from going back, forcing you to replay an entire section if you wish to go back.\n\n*Overall*\nI recommend this game, but get it on sale. It is entertaining enough to play through, collect what artifacts you can, and enjoy a decently engaging story (if you can get passed the very painful, and often times embarrassing dialogue).\n\nGood for one playthrough, wouldn't go back for a second time, but good enough game to pass the time. Very good idea, but feels rushed and badly executed throughout. Decent combat and fun puzzles bring this game up, but frustrating, tedious puzzles, and repetitive combat situations bring the game down in quality and enjoyment. I personally did not try multiplayer as I have zero interest, considering I disliked the combat in singleplayer.\n\nBuy it on sale.","February 25, 2015","true","10.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The fighting sequences are mainly creative and well done - I enjoyed them more than, say, Bioshock Infinite's. The puzzles are generally straightforward, but they establish a nice, relaxed pace between the high-tension action segments. I took about 20 hours to play through the single-player campaign - I attempted to collect most of the optional treasures, at least the ones that were semi-obvious, along the way. "Normal" difficulty combat was perfectly doable with a gamepad - if you're using a mouse, I'd bump it up to "Hard."\n\nThanks to The Farm 51 and Nordic Games for porting this to Linux - I played the complete game on Ubuntu 14.04 x86-64.\nThere are a couple of technical issues, but I'm not sure if they're Linux-specific or not: Load times are massive, over 5 minutes for a "cold start"; the gamepad mappings are odd - "Jump" and "Use" are mapped to the same button, so you need to hold LB to interact with things (or perform mêlée attacks), which simultaneously toggles your flashlight.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game to fans of the genre.","December 2, 2014","true","19.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The story is fairly typical Quatermain stuff, and makes for some simple escapist nonsense, but unfortunately the game itself is let down a little by repetitive combat sequences and overly simplistic puzzles (though in a couple of cases I found the clues that are given in Allan's legendary notebook to be more than a little obtuse).\n\nAll in all I'd have to give this game a 6 out of 10 - it's good fun the first time through but I don't see it having all that much replayability, even with the multiplayer options.

Not a bad thing. I only manage to get through the first chapter before i had to end the game, might seem i didnt give it a proper shot but i can usualy.\n\nThe controls felt clunky WASD moved fine, but pushed the button (say crouch) and it did but felt rather robotic. The biggest faw in the controls is that they game makers (i think tried) to use and few keys as possible which is usualy a good thing but when say tring to melee and it might pull up the selection bit (for guns/notes). Probably doesnt matter much but when pressing E for actions, it triggers not when u press E but when u press and realese.

I am playing the game on Normal/Normal. Probably should up the combat difficulty as the soldiers and Dark enemies really are kind of a joke. Puzzle difficulty is hard enough for me as these are more distractions than the whole point of the game for me. The notebook pretty much gives you the answer to any puzzle you HAVE to get past, Weapon variety is good, and you are given the tools to get through each level - so much so that you pretty much know what is going to happen next just by seeing what is laying around. The mine cart scenes where too much. WAY too much of a steal from Indiana jones for a game that is already riding firmly on Indie's coat tails. Plus, these scenes are of little interest. I think you could really just sit there and not bother shooting or looking around and you would end up with the same results. The game claims to be about exploration - but does not give you the opportunity in many places. You are not sure which areas trigger a level transition and which do not, so if you happen down the wrong path at some point you can no longer retrieve the treasures that trigger your character progression. The game is worth what I paid for it (~$9) but you would feel gipped if you paid more.","November 3, 2014","true","12.0"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

To some extent, it succeeds, riding on the coattails of a lot of what made Raiders of the Lost Ark and Allan Quatermain great.  Unfortunately, dull combat against hordes of nearly identical enemies that don't do much doesn't help matters, and although many of the puzzles are pretty good (and the "notepad" hint system nice), and the environs mostly pretty, there's a sad repetitiveness to it and the acting is bluntly pretty bad.  The section in the ice temple area seems to drag on way too long.  Basically, the game seems like it was rushed or incomplete... more time needed to be invested in enemy design and AI and more variety in the shootybangs sequences.

Very well constructed and designed. Sensible and absolutely enjoyable, apart from a few annoying parts, that you have to do over and over again. But, which game doesn't have those parts? It's a FPS, but some puzzle to tackle with, which makes it more interesting. So it's not just shoot them up and that's it. Very colour full and the environment is keep changing throughout the game.\n\nI'd say it's getting more and more difficult to find a good game out there lately. It's all about zombies these days, which I find very boring. Although, this has some of them too, I still feel like it's a spot on game. Think about Return to castle of Wolfenstein. Probably it's the closest game I'd mention.\n\nVery sorry for the lack of Linux support. The game freezes very often when a video or some additional data is about to be loaded. Starting of the game is a little bit long, but be patient it's worth it. Sometimes, it's just stops and you have to restart the game.\n\nIf you are a Linux user, as I've mentioned it, it's a must have game, not only for the fun but for the support as well.

In this game you play a somewhat dumbed down Indiana Jones type character with everything tied to it, in form of adventuring across beautiful landscapes in company of lovely archeologist, exploring mysterious ruins, tombs, pyramids, caves, jungles to finding long forgotten treasures, solving puzzles and battling evil Nazi and mummy / undead / zombie forces on the way, who want to stop and kill you. Game takes place in roughly 1940's Earth. You will be exploring a lot of ancient places left by old civilizations. There is some real truth and facts about places you visit in history, but most of it is legends and fantasy / sci-fi nonsense. Environments look great, not many games that have Egyptian pyramids in them, I really liked those. There are a lot of puzzles and secrets in game, and they are harder to crack on higher difficulties. There's fair amount of humor in the game. Weapon selection is pretty much WWII timeline, knife, pistols, revolvers, shotguns, rifles, machine guns, sniper rifles, grenades and rocket launchers. Character models are decent, texture quality not bad. Voice acting is decent. Character animations and control was not that amazing, but you get used to it. Personally I didn't really like how main character looks like, he had weird facial animations and didn't look good in cutscenes.

The campaign is the best part, the multiplayer I will get to later, which I will let you know right off the bat is god awful due to a very bad reason. The Campaign took me a bit of time to beat and was really fun, except for the god damn glitches. Theres SO many of those in this game, and that is the main problem with this game. I could list a ♥♥♥♥ing cooking recipe of glitches and bugs this game has to offer, but i'll just save you the trouble and list a few of the most annoying and most ridicilous ones ive encountered in my playtime:\n\nAI stuck running toward wall until provoked\n\nIn mutliplayer, when you line up for a headshot with a weapon like a sniper, around 45% of the time it doesnt even get a hitmarker or the kill, you just see blood come out of the head, and then its random how many more times youll have to shoot until he is dead. This got so ♥♥♥♥ing annoying for me while grinding for the gun upgrades, and this occured so much I even rage quitted once due to it, I have lost count of how many times this occured after around 50 times.\n\nYou can see your arms above your guns sometimes. This can be fixed by switching to a weapon and back.\n\nLip syncing can be off sometimes\n\nStuck with unlimited ammo if loading a game sometimes\n\nAnd many, many more.\n\nThe Campaign:\nIn general, the campaign is fairly done and has a decent story, although its hard as hell to keep track of if your not paying enough attention. The puzzles in this game are confusing as ♥♥♥♥ due to how your "notepad" shows you every single puzzle anwser AT THE BEGINNING OF THE GAME. This means that you have to take 5 mins to just find the puzzle you are looking for, and trust me SO many of the puzzles look exactly the same. Theres also the raw gameplay. This is the best part, its got lots of shooting, and so many guns to pick up and shoot. But what Deadfall Adventures does worst at is it's traps. For the record I will say I saw so many more traps in MULTIPlAYER than I did in the actual CAMPAIGN. This would not even be a big deal or even in my review if they didn't act like the game was gonna have so many unique traps. They lied :). So, when you mold everything together and conect all the pieces, the final verdict of the campaign is a solid 6.5/10, a decent campaign, fairly enjoyable and well-paced. Btw, my final verdict was without including the glitches and bugs, just the raw game itself.\n\nThe Multiplayer (Oh BOY)\nThe multiplayer...oh goodie do I have a thing or two to talk about this mode. The multiplayer itself is really, REALLY good! But like I said before, the glitches just had to come in and ruin all of it. Im not going to make an essay on this mode, but I am going to give you a summary of my opinion on this multiplayer. The multiplayer is bad due to the glitches and bugs; failed headshots, sprinting not functioning, weapons disappearing, only my gloves visible, etc. There are many gamemodes to choose from and are all really fun to play with. Unfortunatley, like almost every other game like this, the multiplayer is dead. Literally. There is not 1 single person on any gamemode in this entire game, and I feel if this game had no glitches or bugs, or if it got patches, it would have so many player on it right now.\n\nFinal Verdict\nDeadfall Adventures is great on its own, but due to the glitches and bugs, it makes the game get a such lower score than it really deserves. The campaign is amazing, but on the other hand, the multiplayer is just bad due to the glitches and outrageous bugs it comes along with. But of course the game's glitches make it so unenjoyable and harsh to play. So, with all of this being said, my Final Verdict for Deadfall Adventures is a:\n\n4/10  A bad game to play!","May 21","false","62.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

Worst is the checkpointing which is TERRIBLE to the point of frustration.\n\nHowever, it's a REALLY nice looking game that makes good use of the Unreal Engine and the way they've implemented puzzles and traps into the exploration side of things works really well - though the occasional instant-death trap does not play nicely with the aformentioned bad checkpointing, as you can often find yourself repeating far too much gameplay because of an unfair pitfall or falling rock.\n\nThere's enough here that I'd say it's worth a look, possibly when it drops in price a bit, if you're into Indiana Jones or Lara Croft type games. Just don't expect the same attention to story or character development - it's a REALLY perfunctory stab at the genre which throws every cliche in the book at you hoping something sticks.\n\nI give it Three Belloq's out of Five.\n\n","December 2, 2013","true","11.8"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","1"

Not like some BattleField fun shooter where the enemies die realisticly. No in this one you have to waste your entire 50 pistol rounds on a zombie waste all your smg bullets and not hit when at point-blank range and then finally die and restart. The survival mode is more like a run away and hide for as long as possible, not a wave fighter like Cod Black Ops. They thought for some reason including zombies with more health then you have ammo would be a good idea. It's like putting yellow into brown and saying he'll make friends.

Given that these have been around for most of a year, I wouldn't hold your breath in the hope that they'll be sorted soon.\n\nMore generally (and I'd imagine that this would apply to the Win version too), puzzles are often weak and some can be solved quite simply by spamming switches if you're too lazy to consult the in-game game guide (i.e. the notepad).  Dialogue between characters varies between dull and cringeworthy and is not helped by the rather awful voice acting.  Combat is so so, neither types of enemy will surprise you in their tactics and weapons, whilst generally doing what you expect, are rather limited in variety. The different shotguns also seem a little on the weak side when they should be at their best (limited range / spread).\n\nCutscene animation was like watching hover-handed people with parkinsons and often combined well with the aforementioned dialogue to make for awkward watching.  Thankfully, you can just click on ahead,\n\nSoo, why recommend?  Well the backdrops are nicely done, but more importantly, the game is just well-paced fun - an easy game you can just go back to and be pretty sure that you'll make progress without it being a complete gimme.  Probs best to get it during a sale or in a bundle as the original price is steep..and I can't guarantee you'll get your buck / hour value, but it will be an non too taxing experience that doesn't take itself too seriously.","December 16, 2014","true","25.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/teamtash/recommended/231330/","teamtash","Kritikos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/teamtash/","352 products in account","The game was pretty much panned by all critics. In Deadfall Adventures, I never really felt any sort of adrenaline rush from any enemy encounter. The enemies are way too bullet spongey, so it's best to set the combat to easy and save yourself some time; the combat is simply unsatisfying and dull. The AI is laughably terrible and using your flashlight to defeat mummies is no new concept. Metro Last Light used this same mechanic, but it added to the intensity of the battle, which is not the case here. The story, setting, and characters are all extremely trite. The dialogue is painfully bad, and I couldn't care less about the plot, which is sad because I was initially very excited to play a FPS that was inspired by Indiana Jones. Your female companion is often ridiculous to rely on in battle, and much of what she does seems not only poorly programmed but often glitchy.\n\nThe visuals are the only impressive aspect of the experience, but the animation is very poor. I've been doing 3D modeling and animation for only 2 years and even I could have done a better job with this game's animation. It's just one more blatant problem that works against any sort of immersive experience this game intended on providing. It's a shame, because they must have had some really good artists working on the game. The only saving grace is that cutscenes are skippable. I suggest that anyone playing this game should exercise that option.\n\nAs far as exploration goes, the puzzles are both frustrating and insulting to one's intelligence, though they aren't as frequent as one would expect. Some puzzles are very obvious while others are difficult for all the wrong reasons, such as knowing a solution but being unable to execute it due to bad programming or confusing hints. There are treasures to be found, but not many, and it doesn't feel like you accomplished anything in finding them. Platforming is nonexistent, as the character can't jump high enough to actually get on top of objects in the game. Even if you could, the incessant invisible walls would keep you from exploring off the extremely linear path the game forces you to follow throughout its entirety.\n\nI played this game for a few hours on another account. I really wish people wouldn't judge reviews based on the hours clocked by steam, though I understand that many users are too quick to form a negative or positive opinion of a game. This is something I have run into multiple times, especially when reviewing games that I played extensively before Steam added a system to keep track of the time spent in-game by each user. I promise I would not review a game before giving it enough of a chance to sway my opinion.\n\nI mean no offense to those who worked very hard on this game. I know it took a lot of effort and many, many people poured a lot of hopes and dreams into this project. The premise was what sold me on the game. I took a risk and preodered Deadfall Adventures. As much as I was let down, I still have faith that the developer can create a game of a higher caliber. I hope that the developers will learn from the mistakes made on this project. I wish I could say that I enjoyed Deadfall Adventures, and I could see the potential buried deep within the final product. Sadly, the potential never really surfaced. It was more like something I projected onto the game. Still, I hope they try again after learning from their mistakes.","December 7, 2013","false","2.4"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","3"

I can tell you now that if it seems like you want this game, then you should just get it. It requires a lot of forgiving, but when it works, it's pretty amazing, and very unique - one of the highest fieldety games of this genre by a passionate developer.\n\nThe Good - The combat is fun, and never ruins the pacing. There's always time to explore. The graphics are phenomenal. Some UE3 limitations pop in from time to time but the overall effect of the art design, lighting and most textures really is brilliant. And hell, the setting. Do you want to go shooting Nazi's, Commies, and Mummies? Good.\n\nThe Bad - in a way, the game does deserve its negative reviews. The voice acting and animations are juuust that little bit off, but endearing in their own stupid way. The puzzles aren't really puzzles, just guessing games or connect the dots environmental obstacles. The shooting, while fun, isn't weighty enough; and the aiming is a bit sticky. And let's just say that from time to time the game breaks consistency in some very, very frustrating ways.\n\nHowever, i've not run into a bug, or a glitch. From a purely objective standpoint, it's technicaly proficient. And yes, I suppose it's mediocre. But I don't care, I love the ancient civilization adventure genre. And if you do too, you'll forgive this game and soak in the incredible atmosphere.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Drakevarg/recommended/231330/","Drakevarg","Drakevarg","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Drakevarg/","94 products in account","I knew within five minutes of booting this game up that it wouldn't be a good one. The graphics are fine and the gameplay was passable; but the writing was cliched to the point of self-awareness, the voice acting was abysmal and the animation was somehow even worse than that. At best the game would have slipped by as harmless and charmingly stupid.\n\nI've made it somewhere between halfway through and the 2/3rds mark and I no longer find it charming.\n\nThis game is dumb. Very, very dumb. Putting aside little technical bugs like the compass randomly glitching out and hovering in midair, the gameplay and controls are just sloppy. The FPS elements are harmless enough, you point your gun at the Nazis and the Nazis fall down. It's not especially engaging but it breaks up the puzzle-solving well enough I guess. The puzzles have two settings, irrespective of difficulty: insultingly obvious or impossible to guess. That is to say there IS no puzzle, it's just a stylized code lock with the answer written in your grandfather's all-knowing notebook. The different puzzle difficulty levels seem to only change how hard it is to read his handwriting.\n\nTo give some very mild spoilers, the point where I lost interest in this game is the start of the Arctic Mines level. It started when after the Sudden But Inevitable betrayal, I'm suddenly in a firefight with Russians of all things. And our 'intrepid heroes' start spitting out the word "commie" like it's five years into the Cold War when up to now we've been fighting the freaking Nazis! If anything, the protagonists actually seemed to think the communists were WORSE, since they were fairly civil when they got pushed into solving puzzles for the Nazis at gunpoint but couldn't go two sentences speaking to the Russians without resorting to namecalling. It was bizarre, like one of the devs bumped into someone working on Call of Duty in the hallway and they got their notes mixed up for a few pages. Complete with an out of nowhere QTE escape sequence at the beginning of the level. If that's the case, I look forward to the inexplicable sliding block puzzle in the next CoD game.\n\nThat said, it wasn't this idiotic story swerve that made me throw the game in the bin. No, that came a few minutes later when, as I abandoned a terribly-designed platforming sequence in digust, pulled on a lever and was immediately shoved into a cutscene that pulled me past a point of no return (which the game is lousy with) AND autosaved at the exact same moment, making it impossible to backpedal without restarting the level entirely.\n\nThat was the proverbial straw. I'm done with this nonsense, the game was only getting by on C-list SyFy doofy charm to begin with - giggling at as its Indiana Jones-by-way-of-noir-PI protagonist, his designated love interest by virtue of bust size and open disgust trying to sound like sexual tension, the dialog that sounds like a ten-year-old trying to be clever - and that's stopped being cute. Don't bother with this inept piece of trash.","February 5","false","6.0"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

First, I'll get the negative points out of the way. The game won't win any awards for originality, the story is pretty run of the mill, the combat mechanics are a little clumsy and the voice acting ranges from average to comical. To be honest though if anything these enhance the fun I've had with the game as I figured right from the start that it doesn't take itself too seriously.\n\nYou play as wisecracking adventurer James Quartermain hired to find a powerful artifact sought after by the Nazis. Sound familiar? Yes, it bears many resemblances to the Indiana Jones movies. It's primarily a first person shooter but with puzzle elements which might not be the most smartly designed and occasionally border on stupid but again, that's half the fun. The locations range from hostile looking temples through Arctic wastelands right through to lush Jungles and ancient cities. The game looks fairly pretty in most places and it all runs very smoothly with no lag or fps drops to be found. There are one or two glitches and some occasional pop in on loading but that's it really. It certainly isn't the buggy mess that some critics would have you believe.\n\nOne of the main additions to the game is the constant hunt for treasures which act as stat boosters if you find enough. These will enhance things like your health, rate of fire, reload speed etc and while they don't appear to make a significant difference it is however quite fun to hunt some of these down.\n\nObviously being a first person shooter the main selling point for many will be the gunplay. As mentioned, this can be fairly clumsy and the aiming feels like it's on some kind of grid if that makes any sense. It doesn't really take much getting used to and it certainly doesn't ruin the game. As I said, this is a pure old style game which takes me back to when first person games were enjoyable and Deadfall Adventures doesn't try to be anything other than a good fun game. I can't comment on the multiplayer aspect though as I simply have zero interest in multiplayer or online games. I have had a lot of enjoyment out of the single player campaign however, and while it's probably not worth full price I would urge anyone to give it a go if it's on sale.\n\nDeadfall Adventures is far from original and it might not be the most polished game but it's still a very enjoyable shooter. If you have any interest in Indiana Jones or the Uncharted games then I'm sure you'll find something you like here. Critics were overly harsh on this in my opinion. Then again if it's not Call Of Duty or Fifa most critics don't seem to want to know these days anyway. I think there's a lot to like here. Sure, it's flawed but at the end of the day it's good old fashioned fun. Something most modern games overlook in my opinion. Give it a try. You may just be surprised.","September 24, 2014","true","11.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

You are a descendant from Alain Quartermain in what is a story heavily inspired by Indiana Jones. Which is a very nice Idea. It's not the imaginative of stories but it works.\nThe overall look of the game is also quite good. Bright desert, moody lighted tombs, blinding sunlight in the frozen glaciers...\nVoice acting for germans actually made by german native speakers. Yes! So many really big games and movies fail at this. Big tumbs up!\nThe Journal, helping you with the puzzling. You don't need it but it gives hints.\n\n\nThe Bad:\nCombat is mediocre at best, usually ending in "wait for enemy to pop up and then shoot him in the face" or "point flashlight at mummy then shoot it in the face".\nVoice acting. The effort is appreciated but Quartermain comes through as a chauvinistic loudmouth instead of the laid-back adventurer he's supposed to be.\nPuzzles are so-so, none of them are complex or challenging but some are frustrating because you have to wait for ages until an object finally moves into position or until you have finally turned that statue 180 degrees.\nThe scripting of the action Cutscenes isn't too bad but they just look so... awkward. And sometimes they just don't make sense. Quartermain jumps on a hook, slides through a tunnel, onto another hook, out the other side of the tunnel.. and his companions stand right beside him. Huh?\nConsolified controls. Keys are rebindeable (and there's a FOV slider~) but the controls still are very console-y in the way they are laid out.\nTextures are pretty bad. Rocks tend to be a grey smudge, snow is just a white mess.. meh. Not too distracting but it just looks unfinished.\nAlso the animations on the AI look ... strange. And some sounds are disconnected from the motions. While cycling the K98k the sound plays a much faster bolt-action sound than the model shows..\n\nThe Ugly:\nLeveldesign. It seems very rushed. Sometimes you can jump on boxes, sometimes you can't. Some places just outright kill you without the slightest warning setting you back to the last checkpoint and force you to go through the motions of another deadly trap.\nThe game itself presses exploration, stating exploration is key for this game, go explore and find treasure.\n(As it should be!) But then you are running into invisible walls everywhere. Boxes that you clearly should be able to effortlessly step on are insurmountable barriers all of a sudden. Some rooms that are difficult to find are just empty. What the hell?\n\n\nThis game just didn't know what it wanted to be. Action-Adventure? FPS? Puzzle-Game?\nIn the end, it tries to serve too many masters and fails. And it feels very rushed and unfinished, to boot.\n\nI can only recommend this on a sale and not full price. (Got it from a humble bundle so there it's alright)","January 8, 2015","false","6.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jblade35/recommended/231330/","Jblade35","Jblade","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jblade35/","292 products in account","If you're a fan of pulp adventures than give this a game a try - however it lacks any stand out features and apart from the lush graphics is fairly bland. I enjoyed James and Jen's banter, and it felt like it had some heart to it. However the combat is extremely simple - it's never offensively bad, although supernatural enemies require you shining your torch on them which makes fighting them a bit more dull compared to the human enemies. The guns, WW2-era, are fun to shoot and fighting enemies feels satisfying, which since there's a lot of fighting is a good thing at least. The Puzzles are very simple, although a few aren't very clear and require a bit of trail and error. Finding artifacts is relatively fun, but they're incredibly simple and don't really require you going out of your way. The graphics are gorgeous though, thanks to the strong art style. Egypt looks like it came straight out of a Indiana Jones movie, and looks fantastic.\n\nThe story is typical of a classic adventure, taking you to 3 seperate locations around the world. The characters don't have much backdrop, but the main character James is a classic smart-♥♥♥ and some of his comments made me chuckle. Jen's a decent companion and despite getting captured a few times didn't strike me as a bad character, just a tad underdeveloped.\nIt's a very safe game, which although I enjoyed the full price tag is too much for what it's offering. I also encountered numerous bugs, including Jen not following me at times (however this didn't stop progress) If we see any more adventures from James than hopefully they'll introduce more mechanics and deeper gameplay, since as it is now it's barely skin-deep.\n\nTo sum it up, if you can afford the price tag and are more interested in a fun if slightly shallow adventure, than definitely give Deadfall a go. It lasted me about 8 hours, which as far as modern FPS campaigns go is fairly long. If you're more into deep gameplay and intricate puzzles than you would be better off elsewhere.","March 3, 2014","true","9.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Graphics are incredible, especially the lighting effects. Sure the gameplay uses a lot of ideas from other games, but thats not a bad thing at all. Its like a big mix between indiana jones, tomb raider, uncharted, with elements of alan wake as well as others.

The puzzle element is welcome, but in some instances really hinders the pacing of the game. Sadly, the game's characters are simply not likable enough to step beyond being generic, and as a result the story aspect of the game is largely inconsequential. So, what you're left with is a fairly competent shooter, that cleverly mixes in puzzles, throws in some multiplayer and co-op and wraps it up in a neat package that plays pretty well. However, there's simply something lacking from the game in every department, that borders on being dull and uninspiring. As a result, Deadfall Adventures doesn't reinvent the wheel, or tries to, and merely offers a mediocre but pleasant action adventure, that's worth a play but is not necessarily an essential purchase, and certainly not up to par with its peers in terms of quality. If you like a bit of puzzle solving, shooting Nazis and are bored of military shooters, then Deadfall Adventures is perhaps worth checking out, although perhaps it would be prudent to wait for an inevitable price drop.\n\nScore 7/10 - Review by Robert Cram","November 26, 2013","true","32.1"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

A piece of warning though... this is a true BUDGET TITLE, so I tried to keep that in mind even though, the game falters in so many ways but somehow, I still wanted to keep going and finish the storymode.\n\nThe story is very cliché from Indiana Jones, The Mummy, Uncharted, Tomb Raider, all mixed together. The game involves the player into finding some major artifact but unfortunately, it was split into three parts and guess what, you have to search from them until the very end, where you realize that it was all for nothing.\n\nThe gameplay is lacking. Linear corridors after many invisible ways and glitches aside, the exploration aspect is as rotting as the mummy rot!\n\nI'll put the good and bad aspects so you can have a better preview of the overall game.\n\n\nPROS:\n+Visuals can be good at times but not the characters though.\n+Diverse geographical locations.\n+Pretty lenghty for a FPS game.\n+Weapons variety.\n+Collectibles found are used in upgrading your skills divided into three categories.\n+Soundtrack is quite average but does the job for a budget title.\n\nCONS:\n-Poor retelling of a story we've heard countless times before.\n-Repetitive combat.\n-Level design in this game is really bad. It's filled with glitches and invisible walls.\n-Boring puzzles.\n-Laughably bad voice acting.\n-Dead or non-existent multiplayer.\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\nHonestly, I'm sure the developers tried their best to make a fun exploratory treasure hunt game but it failed on so many aspects that I find this hard to recommend. The game is lenghty and you do have a few collectibles to find around but beside that, once you do finish the main story mode, there isn't much else to do. The multiplayer portion is like a ghost town although, someone wouldn't had bought this game for the MP! At 39.99$, I truly CANNOT recommend this game for all its CONS but if you can manage to get it around 10$ or less, you may want to give it a shot!\n\nThe best recommendation I can give you though is to stick with Tomb Raider and Uncharted games. They deliver the stories more professionally and are more enjoyable in the gameplay category.\n\nPS. I can't find much of a reason to recommend you the Deluxe Edition as the goodies included can't justify the price, IN MY OPINION! You do get the soundtrack with it and if you're a soundtrack sucker, then get the Deluxe!\n\nRATING:\n6.0 / 10","September 20, 2014","true","12.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I have played tons of FPS games, and this one is unique in many ways.  It's open world, yet you are being led toward an end.  The enemies can be tough, but if you use your flashight and objects in the environment you'll survive.  All the criticism I read, there is some truth in it. Are the weapons old?  Yes... but the game takes place in like the 1930's. Is the flashlight trick kinda dumb?  Yeah, but it's over the top funny, cause it works on humans, too. Is the dialogue fillled with cheesy cynical one-liners? Sure.  But I think they are funny, just like in Duke Nuklem, Deadpool, etc.  My only problem with the game is that even though my rig will chew through graphics on Crysis, Witcher 2, etc. this game gave me lag.  On a 1920x1080 res I tried everything, finally turning AA off did it.  It must be the way they rendered it, I just played Wolfenstien New Order and had it set at 8x I think.

It might be stupid at points, but it's at least playable, and the graphics are well-polished. I actually want to finish this game, which is sadly becoming a rarer and rarer occurrence for me.\n\nPros:\nGame is interesting - there's a lot to discover.\nPuzzles are mostly well-designed, and the notebook hint system works well.\nThe game mechanics are fairly well-adjusted to the style of play. I think the compass mechanic works well most of the time.\nThis game is beautiful even on lower graphics settings. The locations are all authentic-feeling and the graphics are well-polished.\n\nCons, probably because of Linux beta:\nInstead of putting up a loading screen it'll just blackscreen and freeze for 10-15 seconds.\nNumerous graphical glitches. especially in the beginning of the game.\nLoading up the game for the first time just made it hang at the splash screen. I had to close the splashscreen through the window manager to get it to run.\n"Blood" -- which looks more like red paint, btw -- isn't cleared from the screen sometimes if you reload from checkpoint while hurt.\nGame isn't all that well optimized for Linux. I had to turn down the graphics settings to just a hair above "ugly" just to get it to run.\nPuzzles are too easy most of the time. I checked the notebook through the first level only to find I could solve it just by intuition or because it copied a puzzle from Tomb Raider. The notebook, while being a nice puzzle mechanic, isn't necessary most of the time.\nThe enemies are well-designed, even if they're a bit easy.\n\nCons, actual flaws:\nGame is too easy on normal difficulty. I blame AAA games in general for this. Play on hard for a better experience.\nArctic Base level had tons of treasure scattered around the map, but no checkpoints at the beginning. You end up triggering a trap and dying, only to reload with the opening cutscene. Made it frustrating given how large the starting area is.\nDialog seems very silly at times. Quartermain isn't an unlikable hero, he just lacks depth. His romance with [s]T*ts McGee[/s] I mean Jennifer Goodwin seems forced, like she's the only poundable thing within miles so why not? Whatever, it's stupid.\nControls are a bit strange. It's really apparent it was designed for a controller. For example, bringing up the notebook involves holding down the scroll wheel on the mouse and awkwardly moving the cursor around. (Or you can just hit [ or ].)\n\nAll in all, I'd say it's well worth the money. Not sure about the DLC though. Grab it if you can, you'll have fun playing it.","August 29, 2014","true","16.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mero4ever/recommended/231330/","mero4ever","No Mercy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mero4ever/","67 products in account","MILD SPOILERS ALERT\n\nMy review might be biased some what. The reason why, is that I love Indiana Jones movies and for a game that some what recreate that experience for me to live it is utterly SPECTACUILAR.\n\nThe GOOD:\n\nThe game is beautiful, its not the best graphics but still amazing to look at.\n\nI loved how you have a book in your hand which shows you how to tackle puzzle but not make it like a piece of cake for you.\nThe gun fights is decent but not challenging, still loved the variety of guns and how the game forces you to chose new guns rather than stick to what you like.\n\nThe game also links the puzzles to upgrades by having you solve side puzzles to earn treasures which can be used to upgrade various abilities.\n\nIt is good to see that the game has a variety of enemies as you will fight mummies, German, Russians and Arabs. each with unique weapons at your disposals as you will tend to pick up their fallen weapons as there are plenty of ammos thus.\n\nThe BAD:\n\nThe game is linear in a way that is somewhat cluster phobic, don’t get me wrong for a game that requires you to solve puzzles it requires narrow areas, but since the game itself was able to achieve by landscape for its last puzzle, it led to wonder why this wasn't the case for all the previous puzzles.\n\nThe game is also very short, I mean looking at the number of hours I have played it above would give you a hint as how short it is, not to mention that I have collected all treasures in one play through.\n\nBoss fights are a bit easy and boring, I enjoyed fighting mummies more than fighting bosses.\n\nThe main character is funny, but I have a Deja vu as if I am playing Duke Nukem all over again, the reason why this is a bad and not a good thing is that, first, I like Duke Nukem to be left alone to be seen only in his games, and two, don’t mix two things I love and expect it to impress me, you are lucky its not in the ugly.\n\nThe UGLY:\n\nThe voice acting is, well, UGLY. It is so bad that it over shadows Merritt Weaver Emmy award speech in terms of worseness.\nThe character modelling would take you back to the time when you first played Metal Gear Solid. I mean for a game that was made on Unreal engine they could have done way better than that.\n\nGiven the two UGLY things above, resultantly, the cut scenes is something that would take you off of the experience, so much the case that you would dread watching a cut scene. In fact, come to think of it, I believe the game would be way better if there is something that would skip all cut scenes. It is this bad, sorry, this UGLY.\n\nOVERALL:\n\nAs a fan of Indiana Jones, which the game, to some extent, was successful in mimicking certain aspect of it, I can but only recommend this game as I enjoyed my time playing it and solving the puzzles. The fights is nice way to take you off puzzles and puzzle time is a good way to relax from all the fighting, while mummies, they are there to always keeps you on your toes whether you are solving puzzles or fighting enemies.","May 11, 2014","true","23.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Nice graphic and exploring are the best. On every level we can find many treasures and sometimes it's not so easy .. The most helpful are maps which can be found on our way but these maps are a bit hard to read. We must be very careful if we really want to find all of the treasures. Anyway these treasures can help us to improve our skills so we should find them. The next thing I like is soundtrack, it's quiet nice, not as good as in Indiana Jones but it's good :) Now the things I don't like .. The levels (especially outside) are closed, even if it's easy to jump somewhere, we can't do it. Game doesn't let us to go or jump where we want, it's the most dissappointing. Next funny thing is that we can hear voice of our friend even if she is so far from us and the dialog is repeated after 10 seconds again and again. The rest seems to be nice but I must play longer to know that. Anyway, I recommend Deadfall Adventures and I think that 7,5/10 is a good rate.","May 2, 2014","true","4.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

"un-toned". so to say. they weren't bleak, per-say, but they did make the personality of their assigned character unbelievable (bad unbelievable, not good) but. later in the game, it does pick up a bit, and improves. over all, the acting being the slight inferior, with everything else being in the better, the over all game mains superior. and this is not just because I love advnture stories/movies/games, but would I recommend this game? [YES]. play it. if you can get over a few set-backs like the voice acting, and maaaaaaaybe some minor clipping. the you will enjoy this game. especially with it being about a descendent of allan quartermain, the character that not only came before, but inspired the films; Indiana Jones (so no, this did not copy off of indiana jones, if you want to get technical, it was the other way around).\nbut don't take my word for it.

The problem is that the game has not 1 thing in which it is outstanding. It is just a mix of all things which is good in other games. I experienced Tomb Raider, Uncharted, Indiana Jones, but also characters which were made on base of real life personalities. I saw the complete storyline of Indiana Jones (one of my favorite games): Jones & Sophia Hapgood which were in complete fight with the nazi's. If you look to the story of the last indy game you will see a complete copy of the story, locations, objects and loading screens, interventions by the nazi's, etc. It also contains elements of puzzle/platform games. It contains so so so much that i cannot get amused by this game. It also uses leveling of your character in multiplayer which does not attract me. The only thing i like in the multiplayer is the way the game is played. There are a lot of extra's in the environment (like shoot at circles to activate elements, for example activate an oven where the enemy is standing on) which makes it amusing to play. On scale of 6 the single player would get a 6 minus and the multiplayer an 8.","March 3, 2014","true","2.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/krocomazo/recommended/231330/","krocomazo","Kroco","http://steamcommunity.com/id/krocomazo/","87 products in account","Man, this game is beautiful. Deadfall Adventures has the setting and story of Indiana Jones, the style of Uncharted and the gameplay of... a generic first person shooter. You play this game from a first person perspective which is actually a very nice twist on the genre. You'll be traveling to different parts of the world to find hidden treasures, solve puzzles and chase bad guys.\nLike I said, the game has the vibe of Indiana Jones. It all looks very colorful and very adventurous. It has awesome, detailed graphics and horrible, horrible voice acting. A damn shame, because the rest of the game is actually worthwhile, but the voice acting is one of the things that drags the game down. The other thing that drags the game down are the firefights. It's inaccurate and doesn't feel realistic. It's important, because near the end you'll be fighting off more and more enemies.\nThe story is fun in that it doesn't take itself all that seriously. It will be fun as long as you keep that in mind.\nThere are also loads of treasures to be found; some can be found in the open, some are hidden and can be found by simply exploring and some can be collected by solving puzzles. These puzzles are usually simple to solve and can be completed in just a few minutes. If some of these puzzles were only a bit harder it would've given you a better feeling of accomplishment.\nDoesn't take away the fact that it's fun to try and find these treasures. Treasures can also be used to upgrade your character, but I didn't notice much a difference when I first started the game and when I finished the game. He still felt the same to me.\nCheckpoints are sometimes awkwardly placed so if you die while trying to solve a second or third puzzle you might have to\nstart all over from the beginning. This can be frustrating but usually it's just a couple of minutes. Still... annoying.\nDeadfall Adventures wants to be a first person Uncharted and in a way The Farm 51 has succeeded in doing this.\nNext time, keep the graphics, improve the voice acting and shooting aspects, make the puzzles (a bit) harder and you'll probably have a great, fun sequel in your hands.","March 1, 2014","true","2.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

First of all, the mummy / zombie enemies that you encounter in the first level are fun as hell to fight and have very realistic movements and amazing models...but you rarely see them at all throughout the game. I'm currently at the ancient Mayan temple part of the game which is the last 3rd or so of it, so maybe they start to show up more just past where I'm at, and I hope they do, because I would have liked to see a lot more of those guys throughout the game than the same old Nazi's and Commie's or whatever. I'm also a bit confused as to why we are fighting both Nazi's and the Russians in this game as its set in WW2 times if I'm correct...the storyline behind your sudden switch in enemies is blurry to me but no matter how it made sense in the game, it was repetitive. Hopefully more interesting baddies will be heading my way towards the latter part of the game. Other than that, the graphics and settings were amazing, the combat was OK. I particularly enjoyed the flashlight feature with which you can temporarily blind your enemies vision. All in all so far an enjoyable, relatively quick adventure story with really cool themes and settings. The enemy base could have used some sprucing up though.","January 29, 2014","true","16.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vermilicious/recommended/231330/","vermilicious","Vermilicious","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vermilicious/","324 products in account","This small review is based on limited free weekend gameplay. After finishing the first part of the story I wasn't allowed to continue, so practically, what I played was just a 7GB demo. Ouch.\n\nThe camera nearly made me nauseous at times, but the game is pretty. It's a linear game, but you're allowed, and encouraged, to roam around the places. There are hidden treasures that upgrade your abilities, spread around in nooks and crannies. That's a plus. However, one big room that begged for exploration didn't seem to hold anything, and ending up in the water, that was everywhere, made you drown. In fact, most places you would expect something hidden, you would find nothing.\n\nThe first taste of combat felt quite awful, but it might just be that the pistols you start off with are bad. I couldn't really hit anything properly. It seemed to improve later on though. There's a nice variety of weapons to use. Some enemies requires using a flashlight in a certain way (like in Alan Wake), but it wasn't explained well, forcing me to look it up.\n\nThe story seems a bit thin, but alright. The voice synching and face animations could be better though. The puzzles seem fairly easy, but the notebook that is supposed to help you is a bit frustrating to use. It doesn't help that it's bound to the middle mouse button by default, which is also the melee attack button, which I found out by chance. Some of the notes I couldn't figure out where I was supposed to use.\n\nAll in all, a fair adventure/puzzle FPS game. Honestly, it's quite overpriced (even at 50% off). I suggest picking it up during a sale, if you like this kind of stuff.\n\nNotable alternatives: Tomb Raider, Adam's Venture.","March 2, 2014","true","1.4"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

It's supposed to be an adventure, but instead it attempts to be an FPS RPG, from what I see. I've played for half an hour, and I've discovered that I have two weapon slots, revolvers have unlimited bullets but take forever to reload, puzzles (on hard level) require you mostly to push a lever or crutch under a door, I can upgrade skills but I have no treasure to upgrade them with, keyboard keys to switch pages of the notebook are not assigned and cannot be reassigned, hints on the screen disappear irrevokably when you accidentally press any key at all, and control settings screen messes up mouse sensitivity. I'd say "buy it when they fix the bugs", but since they haven't fixed them by now, there's nothing really to hope for. The plot is so pathetic, I even forgot to mention it: a chick with big boobs gets kidnapped by Nazis who are after an ancient Egyptian treasure, I suppose it can be played, but if you're like me, you won't enjoy it.

It also seems to pull elements from Disney's Atlantis and Tomb Raider (films).\n\nHaving watched the first two The Mummy films and thoroughly enjoying the unique Egyptian atmosphere and dramatic 1920s style, I was immersed and entertained by Deadfall Adventures. However, the second level began to feel slow and uninteresting. I gave up by level three or four.\n\nAlthough I was interested as to what exactly happens concerning the Heart of Atlantis and Xibalba, I was not willing to slog through ten more levels of the same stuff to find out.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes (and story), there are much better games out there.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/grenadeh/recommended/231330/","grenadeh","Grenadeh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/grenadeh/","961 products in account","Deadfall Adventures is basically what happens if you combine Alan Wake, Resident Evil, The Mummy, and Indiana Jones together into a game. It features puzzles that have to be navigated in the same way as Uncharted - by physically looking ingame at your noteboo to determine the solution. These include puzzles like your classic Elder Scrolls/Indiana Jones floor tile puzzles, light-mirror puzzles like The Mummy/Resident Evil. and plenty of others.\n\nLike any good archaeology-fantasy story, it takes place in the early days of the Nazi regime. The Nazi's have, of course, obtained the services of experts to navigate ancient ruins in search oif ancient powers that can ostensibly help them rule the world, etc. etc. Did I also mention Russians? So within minutes, what does your character end up doing? Evidently awakening all the mummies and other ancient beasts. All of them.\n\nThis is where Alan Wake comes in. In order to actually damage and kill said beasties, you need to hit them with the flashlight enough so that shooting them matters. The mechanic made sense in Alan Wake because of the light and the dark being a permanent theme. I'm not sure it makes sense here, but I'm not complaining about it. I think in the Mummy movies the light wasn't kind to the mummies either. Other than shooting Mummies, though, you get to kill your fair share of "Nazis" - and really that's all you need for a game, right?\n\nThe voice acting is bad, I'm not going to sugarcoat that. All of the VA's said their lines far too quickly and didn't seem interested in putting effort into it. In addition, a lot of the dialogue is very B-movie, generic, absolutely expected drivel. It's unfortunate, because this game had the potential to be quite awesome if the presentation had been taken more seriously. Presentation can turn a horrible game like Uncharted from a generic shooter to a phenomenon, and it looks like Nordic stopped somewhere in the middle with this one. Other than that, the game is also gorgeous. It doesn't have the best graphics ever that will melt your eyeballs, but it uses Unreal engine and looks quite good. There's a lot of epic scenery like the pyramids and Sphinx, but you may get tired of seeing it if you aren't into ancient cultures or Egyptology or any of that.","December 7, 2014","true","3.6"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Unfortuantly for all its similarity its lack of having a lead actor with any personailty drowns out its ability to carve out its own identity along with some design execution that makes Deadfall merely just a good game that only fans of such series would enjoy.\nIn the game you play as adventurer James Quatermain who is hired by a former colleuge to retrieve an artificat, the heart of atlantis. You globe trott from Egyptian pyramids, to the artic and finally to the jungles of the Mayan ruins during your adventure. Along the way you will battle nazis(Hate those guys), undead zombies, and some hired guns but that pretty much is the extent of enemies.\nAs for gameplay there is basic FPS action which is solid, though enemy AI has limited movement and at times the game can feel like its on rails. When battling mummies and the undead you will revert to Alan Wake comabt of using a flashlight to burn them so they become vulnerable to weapons. Wepons are era based from dual pistols and shotguns, to MP40, rocket launcher, and assortment of other machine guns. The wepons all sound, look, and feel good and the reloading animation is quality. When not fighting your way to the next checkpoint there are numerous puzzles to solve. This is by far the weakest element of the game as they are very difficult and in some cases make no sense. i would challenge anyone to try and solve every puzzle without a waltkthru, they are that obtuse. Deadfall has a lot going for it, unfortunantley it doesnt all come together but with such limited adventure chocices for PC players, its worth putting on your fedora, shootoing nazis and looking for treasure. That never gets old.\n\nPositives\nExcellant level design, enviroments and graphics\nSolid FPS shooter action\nLead actress is the star\nMine cart level-Spectacular\n\nNegatives\nFeels like Modders first game\nhero cant jump or swim\nVery easy game even on hardest difficulty setting\nNo personailty\nLack of enemies\nPuzzles can be basic to huh?\nTerrible AI\nPredictable storyline\n","December 5, 2014","true","16.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is fun, with some nice visuals and environments. I really enjoyed exploring the snow levels.\n\nI feel this game had potential to be something that stood out, there's not many games where you can be an indiana jones style adventurer in a first person shooter... but it's rough around the edges unfortunately. There are several bugs that happen quite often. The first, is that on Linux none of the shaders are cached, so you'll get very long loading times and some temporary freezing/stuttering when the level is loading a different area.\n\nThere's also a problem with the flashlight, sometimes you're unable to focus the light, resulting in impossible situation when you need to kill mummies. Only fix is to reload the last checkpoint.\n\nMultiplayer, I can't vouch for it, as nobody ever seems to play it. Never managed to get into a game.\n\n\nOverall, it's a fun game. The puzzles are rather easy (some, very easy).\nI give it 6/10.\n\nIf the Linux port was polished and some of the bugs (which also affect windows versions) were ironed out, i'd be looking at 8/10.","December 6, 2014","true","10.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Rider Haggard (22 June 1856 – 14 May 1925)  and is centered on the main character Allan Quatermain - which was used as the template for the Indiana Jones character - that during World War II era goes after treasures in Egypt, Arctic and Maya ruins.\n\nAlthough it is an First Person Shoorter (FPS), it is the weakest part of the game since it is very generic and it is mostly likely the first shooters before Call of Duty 4 with a very weak AI.\n\nOn the Adventure side in other hand is brilliant and you will find yourself in during 80's where Goonies and Indiana Jones were over the top films as well as their ridiculous plots, puzzles and even more ridiculous quotes but still a great movie.\n\nThe scenarios and puzzles parts of the game is where it shines at most :)\n\nIf you're looking to have FUN and resolve puzzles, grab this game real cheap and go for it.\n\nPS: There are several tweak guides to improve graphics and enable DirectX11 rendering.\n\n\n\n","December 11, 2014","true","26.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The rest of the game looks amazing, and I love the fantasy, but even those moments are marred by the juvenile script and writing.\n\nHow could this be better? Add quicksaves, redo/remove all cutscenes, and go through and fix all the level geometry. You'd then have an recommendable game. It still wouldnt be great though.\n\nHow to move it into great? My view is remove the arcade fights (which are at best forgettable), and go for more simulated gritty survival horror combat (think Dark Corners of the Earth) - I think at this point Deadfall Adventures would be quite special.","March 9, 2015","false","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Actually, when there is some really interesting to do, the game takes over from the player and does it for you, in a cut scene. Puzzles are fun, levels are ultimately linear with lots of  irritating dead ends, And you cannot go back one you leave a certain section of the level.\nAdd to this that your grandma runs faster and jumps higher and that combat flow drags out more like Doome 3, you are, unfortunately, left with a deeply mediocre game with barely a replay value and that goes on your nerves, esp. when Quatermain states for the x-tenth time how fun it was to slide down a robe or shoot some enemies, reminding you with a facepalm that you  - just - had -  fun.

I wanted to like this game. It had a ton of potential. But it's clunky, repetitive, annoying, and at the point in the mayan ruins where you go sliding down...gave up after 10+ attempts...it's near impossible to complete. Seriously.. Run, gun, puzzle, run, gun...no thank you. Wish I could get a refund >.>\n\n\nWish there was a neutral option for recommending a game :)\n\nI will try to be fair in this review....\n\nI've been paying this for ~6 hours now, and while the premise is really fun, like playing out an Indiana Jones adventure, the delivery can be really so so at times.  The graphics, effects, etc. are all great. Great job by the devs on that.  The story is also fun as I mentioned.  Gameplay is where things get mixed.  On one hand, it's a FPS.  On the other, a FPS adventure puzzle game.  Sometimes you can mix the two really well, and other times it falls a bit flat.  In this game so far, it falls a bit flat.  The formula seems to be the same.. expore a little, fight some enemies, annoying puzzle, fight some enemies, explore a bit, add infinum.\n\nI really wish there was a bit more variety and slightly more openness to tackling issues.  Puzzles in this game I get, you have to execute something a certain way for it to work.  Fine. But give some options, change it up a bit.  Flipping a dial and shooting a thing gets pretty old after a while.\n\nMy other two gripes thus far are with the voice actor for the main character...really..really...flat.  He has a good voice, but 0 emotion.  Basically it sounds like a cocky ♥♥♥♥ reading from a script.  Meanwhile the other characters got into it.  Lastly, this feels more like a limited console game than anything in terms of moving around.  I should be able to climb a ladder for a better vantage point, or up a few rocks stacked like blocks. I shouldn't be limited to just running around the small field given.  While a game should always have an ending and a means to get there, and while you don't have to make it super interactive to the point where it'd be rediculous, the game just feels so limited in a world where exploring should be more encouraged and rewarded.\n\nIs it an enjoyable game? Sure. Is it a really great game? Meh...","September 30, 2015","false","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a first person shooter where you shoot yourself through a temple in Egypt, a temple in the Arctic, the "Mayan" jungle and also a Mayan temple... as earlier stated; Much like Indiana Jones and Uncharted.\n\nThe year is 1938, you take the role as James Lee Quatermain and he gets the mission to escort Jennifer Goodwin into a temple in Egypt - go in, get the thing she's after and then get out, that kind of job. But as you're probably aware of, things go south... quickly. And you need to set things right. That's a simple way to explain the story.\n\nIt looks GREAT. They did a great job (for the most part) with the models (the lip syncing went haywire towards the end of the game) and textures and environments, but when it comes to sound... that leaves a whole lot to be desired. The voice acting is not very good at all. Although the music is decent. The AI is hit and miss, sometimes it rushes you for no good reason, sometimes it just stays behind cover for no reason.\n\nSo, in short, the game is "hit and miss". It's fun, keeps the player entertained throughout the eight hour long "Adventure" mode and there's a lot of puzzles throughout, most required to complete to be able to continue. But there shouldn't be any issues completing them, not if you're asking me.

A pity the main character isn't more Indiana Jones and less Adam Sandler.\nThe developers must have some great artists on their team as many of the areas look stunning and actually get better later in the game, amazing especially considering this would have been made on a fraction of the budget of a Call Of Duty game. It doesn't attempt to reinvent the wheel but the action plays well and it isn't that hard but it suits the flow of the game.

Wish I could get a refund >.>\n\n\nWish there was a neutral option for recommending a game :)\n\nI will try to be fair in this review....\n\nI've been paying this for ~6 hours now, and while the premise is really fun, like playing out an Indiana Jones adventure, the delivery can be really so so at times.  The graphics, effects, etc. are all great. Great job by the devs on that.  The story is also fun as I mentioned.  Gameplay is where things get mixed.  On one hand, it's a FPS.  On the other, a FPS adventure puzzle game.  Sometimes you can mix the two really well, and other times it falls a bit flat.  In this game so far, it falls a bit flat.  The formula seems to be the same.. expore a little, fight some enemies, annoying puzzle, fight some enemies, explore a bit, add infinum.\n\nI really wish there was a bit more variety and slightly more openness to tackling issues.  Puzzles in this game I get, you have to execute something a certain way for it to work.  Fine. But give some options, change it up a bit.  Flipping a dial and shooting a thing gets pretty old after a while.\n\nMy other two gripes thus far are with the voice actor for the main character...really..really...flat.  He has a good voice, but 0 emotion.  Basically it sounds like a cocky ♥♥♥♥ reading from a script.  Meanwhile the other characters got into it.  Lastly, this feels more like a limited console game than anything in terms of moving around.  I should be able to climb a ladder for a better vantage point, or up a few rocks stacked like blocks. I shouldn't be limited to just running around the small field given.  While a game should always have an ending and a means to get there, and while you don't have to make it super interactive to the point where it'd be rediculous, the game just feels so limited in a world where exploring should be more encouraged and rewarded.\n\nIs it an enjoyable game? Sure. Is it a really great game? Meh...","September 30, 2015","false","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a first person shooter where you shoot yourself through a temple in Egypt, a temple in the Arctic, the "Mayan" jungle and also a Mayan temple... as earlier stated; Much like Indiana Jones and Uncharted.\n\nThe year is 1938, you take the role as James Lee Quatermain and he gets the mission to escort Jennifer Goodwin into a temple in Egypt - go in, get the thing she's after and then get out, that kind of job. But as you're probably aware of, things go south... quickly. And you need to set things right. That's a simple way to explain the story.\n\nIt looks GREAT. They did a great job (for the most part) with the models (the lip syncing went haywire towards the end of the game) and textures and environments, but when it comes to sound... that leaves a whole lot to be desired. The voice acting is not very good at all. Although the music is decent. The AI is hit and miss, sometimes it rushes you for no good reason, sometimes it just stays behind cover for no reason.\n\nSo, in short, the game is "hit and miss". It's fun, keeps the player entertained throughout the eight hour long "Adventure" mode and there's a lot of puzzles throughout, most required to complete to be able to continue. But there shouldn't be any issues completing them, not if you're asking me. I bought the game for €3.99 and I wouldn't go over that if interested in buying it.","September 28, 2015","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It plays out in an Indiana Jones way and has a lot of puzzles. The story is actually from a book and is an interesting, easy to follow storyline.  Starting out in the beginning of the game I was skeptical about how the story was being introduced and felt a bit bored.. but as I got farther into it it got a lot better and I was quite relieved. The graphics aren't top-notch but do get the job done rather well and are quite easy to run on most computers. I personally thought that the music was pretty good, some battle scenes had music that fit in real well.\n\nThe only bad things I would have to address are the charater body movements in the cinematics. Characters' body parts seamed to wobble slightly when they were speaking and moving around, almost as if their limbs were having spiratic spasms. It in fact was quite funny despite how I wanted to play the game for the story as well as the gameplay.. Also, textures seemed a bit off in some places here and there, but thats pretty much it.\n\nI enjoyed this game and I think you will too because it delivers fun gameplay mechanics along with an engagingly, humorous storyline.","December 15, 2015","true","9.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is really quite the opposite.\nThat being said, it's a  fun, OK game, resurfacing the Indianna Jones atmosphere that has been deeply missed. However, it is full of glitches with a crappy checkpoint save system. Yes, a checkpoint save system in an exploration game. Who would have thought.\nIn the beginning I attempted to collect all the treasure via my handy compass treasure-pointer, yet, once I ran off to collect my treasure to only be killed instantly it was a bit frustrating. Nevertheless I try again, and again. Fixed on getting this one piece of treasure, but each time I was killed instantly I was forced to run all the way back (roughly 4 minutes)  purchase my upgrades again and THEN attempt the puzzle again.\nMy character kept getting stuck in ridiculous places, forcing me to restart from the nearest save and collect all the treasure I had collected previously ... again.\nThe dialogue, oh the dialogue. Filled with corny, primary school aged teasing-flirtatious remarks that make you facepalm while having to endure it throughout the entire campaign. I could get past this, if it wasn't for the crappy save system or the glitches but sadly, it all comes together, ruining my experience as a player.\n\nTo add some positive in my otherwise negative review, the settings are beautiful and gorgeous to explore and the action isn't bad.\nI recommend picking this game up on a sale of at least 60% off or more, the asking price of $40 is a bit over the top.","December 10, 2014","false","7.3"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

Throughout, I felt immersed in the environments and gameplay.  It's a fun experience overall and there are many moments that will make you feel like a true adventurer!\nThe story is quite predictable but that's something you want from a game like this, in a way.  Knowing what's about to happen not only allows one to focus more on the gameplay but it adds to the movie-like feel presented through the game.  Everything presented has a real feel for the most part.  A game like this can't afford to dip out of that realistic feel for very long because in the moments it did, it sometimes felt more like a saturday-morning cartoon more than an adventure movie.\nDeadfall's shooting mechanics work well and the nuance of using the flashlight to make certain enemies vulnerable adds tension to fights that might feel tame otherwise.  Most of the time, one will duel wield pistols but while using the flashlight, one is restricted to a single handgun.  This allows for two very different styles of fighting which I greatly enjoyed.\nThe puzzles can be a bit of a mixed bag.  There is a fine line between challenging and unreasonable.  While most puzzles are are doable with a little time, there are a few that may stymy the player because the solution is unobvious and the hints provided are too vague.  It was helpful for me to use an online walkthrough for the more frustrating moments.  That said, I applaud the inclusion of puzzles like these because they can be the difference between a true adventure game and a generic shooter.\nEnvironments in Deadfall Adventures are visceral and diverse.  The level in the jungle is a real stand out as the path winds through and each set piece is presented.\nAn unfortunate issue for this game is the frequency of small bugs.  Sometimes, events won't trigger properly.  A few times, I had to reload previous checkpoints because of issues such as this.\nOverall, Deadfall Adventures gets my tentative reccomendation.  It's an enjoyable game with a unique experience.   The only caveats being the bugs and the possible necessity of using a walthrough.  If you're looking for a fun adventure game with challenging puzzles and immersive gameplay though, this is definitely something worth your time.","March 16, 2015","true","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Voice acting isn't that great but everything else is pretty solid aside from a few bugs here and there. Pretty cool upgrade system where you need to find treasure in order to increase your stats. The puzzles are a bit too easy, either that or they're not clear enough but you never really get stuck on them for long. Pretty lengthy game, very lengthy if you try to collect all the artifacts. Not tried multiplayer but apparently it's dead so if you want to get 100% achievements on this game it might not be possible. Overall It's pretty good, lots of guns, lots of enemies and lots of puzzles, fun for all.","April 16","true","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I played over a long period of time, but i did not enjoyed that much. It had a lot of bugs, where the game simply stoped working, and the worst part was that i had to start the mission again. The story overall is let's just say ok, and the gameplay was kind of ok too. I really don't know if it worth buying it. I like history games and things, but this was not that good.","May 19","false","14.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I would like to see a second game made for the pc I highly recommend this game to all FPS fans. The story to it is increible and the artistry of the monuments are to detailed.\nIt makes you feel like you are there yourself.\n\n","May 28","true","19.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
