In fact I enjoy teaching him how to play it. I've been looking for something as cool as this gamne for a long time. He comes running to me, dad the robot killed me, halarious. In fact I'm so old school that I love it myself. I switch between Borderlands, Far Cry and the man in a maze! Although I wish they'd make more levels for some hardcore wanna be :).","December 6, 2014","true","8.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

You can toss it around the corner by throwing it at a wall. You can also use it to distract enemies. And, after you charge it up, you can destroy enemies with it. If you throw it correctly, the ball will bounce off the enemy and back to your hands. Otherwise, it will bounce elsewhere, and you will have to chase it....\n\nUnless you use a power-up.  There are four power-ups that you can use, and by grabbing coins and beating levels, you can purchase stronger power-ups or more uses of power-ups. One of them returns the ball to you if it gets away from you. Another gives you a temporary cloak, which is perhaps too powerful. I recommend not using the cloak power-up except on those levels where beating it under par time is way too difficult or impossible without it.\n\nThe only real problem is that the mouse cursor doesn't change shape and color in-game. My cursor is a small white arrow, and it makes it difficult to aim quickly in a bright and colorful game like this unless you're constantly looking at it.\n\nNevertheless, I recommend this game.","September 15, 2015","true","6.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Bonus levels for completing objectives. You have to avoid lazers, robots, turrets and collect loot. Sometimes you just have to destroy all robots on map. You get spotted you may have luck running away, hiding or you will just die, so avoid detection. It's a sort of stealth game afterall. You have special skills and unlocks to them.\nAfter beating a level you spin a wheel and get prize. Can you get them all? Yeah, the TV show serves as a background for more levels to beat.\n\nBlah blah blah... I find hard to desribe this game properly. This game is uniqe to a degree (at least to me). It's about stealth and collecting stuff in first place. Nothing special - yep, possibly true, but I can tell is it's good at what it offers. Stop reading this and check the trailer. Game is fun and worth trying if you like stealthing a bit.\nJust don't blame me if you win a plunger :P","December 4, 2014","true","5.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","1"

You have to avoid killer machines that electrify and explode you with range and contact attacks. Using my "superior" stealth skills to avoid seeker robots is my favorite bit. You use your ball (once powered up) to destroy bots and collect coins to put towards upgrading your gear/abilities. Those include Ball Returns, Freeze-o-Matic, Cloak, and Mines. You also unlock prizes but they're just for show, a little something to collect and give you a sense of achievement. For me there's little "replayability" aside from replaying past mazes for better times and collecting all gears but that gets tiring real fast. All the mazes are not really proper mazes but just a set of walls to help you hide behind and stuff. They're also all very similar to each other and offer little visual variety among them.\n\nThere's local multiplayer but no one wanted to play it with me after seeing me play the single player...\n\nThe game isn't that bad but is it worth the $9.99 price tag? No, absolutely not. As the game is scarily similar to something I'd play on a mobile platform for free, in my mind it doesn't warrant a price that high. If you can get the game on sale or are gifted the game it's more than a decent time waster.","October 24, 2014","false","0.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Feels like it could be a fast-pace thriller if the guy can actually move faster. Otherwise it's just too slow.","September 19, 2015","false","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
