Intended for kids, i found it rather enjoyable too with the graphics and the funny dialogs. I work as a kindergarten teacher, and i could see this game at the pre-school.\n\nThe Story\nTeddy is going on a picnic with his friend Piglet. Piglet is grabbing his bike and Teddy (the player) grabs a kayak.\nWhile on the river Teddy notices that some things are wrong, and tries to help.\n\nPros\n- Nice graphics and funny dialogues.\n- Memorable and cute characters.\n- Funny minigames that suits children from about 3 years and up. (Some puzzles might be tough for small children).\n\nCons\n- I noticed some small glitches in dialogues, but its nothing big.\n- Rather short adventure, aprox 1.5 hours of clear time. (But could be a good thing though for children)\n\nConclusion\nA rather enjoyable little adventure even for me as adult. I can definately recommend this for folks with children.\nI think they will enjoy this game.","September 15, 2015","true","3.7"," 61 of 68 people (90%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","90","61","68","7","0"

Playing this game takes me back to my childhood, when my parents read me good night stories about bears and the living in the forest. A kids game? Sure. Does that mean you won't like it regardless your age? Heck no (unless you hate bears and other animals living in the farm and forest [if that's the case, then gtfo]). The mini games are alright.\n\nGot banned on CS GO? You should defenetly play this (not that it has happened to me xD). Get your mind away from those afk players, auto snipers, and "Kobe" kills. This game is way better and relaxing than anything else; better than Dota, better than Sakura Spirit/Angels, Nekopara, or any of those visual novels featuring cat girls with huge unrealistic breast seriously, get a real woman, better than porn/hentai, better than getting that f*cking knife from the recent case in CS GO!\n\nLong live Teddy Floppy Ear!","March 23, 2015","true","1.3"," 65 of 82 people (79%) found this review helpful 37 people found this review funny","79","65","82","37","0"

I further must admit that I was stationed, glued to the edge of my seat, with all nails bitten off when Teddy had to face Catfish's evil henchmen the mosquitoes and rescue several garden nuts. Im also ashamed to admit that I was even willing to pee into an empty bottle unwilling to leave my screen when Teddy had to act as a negotiator between two warring factions farmer and worm, in order to bring peace to the strawberry fields from the snail infestation and global epidemic.\n\nIn fact Teddy Floppy Ears is such a PERFECT bundle of charisma that those who are looking for the return of Christ might not need to look any more. Yes teddy is that PERFECT!!!\n\nTeddy Floppy Ears and the retelling of his Kayak adventure has been mistakened by many to be only for children of a young age, whose parents are also looking for a teaching icon and tool to help instill in their children favorable traits and characteristics. While it is true that Teddy spends most of his time returning the river to its peaceful state he also shares profound truths and wisdom and sayings, particularly that one should ask before borrowing something and that order demands tidiness.\n\nIn fact if it was not for my room-mate this morning causing a power surge because he had an accident with an iron, I may have even missed church this morning. That is how HOLY this experience was for me. Big plans to erect a Teddy Floppy Ears shrine in my bedroom is now up and running, and a new cult following has now begun...","December 19, 2015","true","0.8"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","50","4","8","6","0"

Well it shouldn't even be a question in the first place. It's pretty obvious why I'm giving the story a 10. The game feels so real and the storytelling in this game is amazing. What happened to Teddy could happen to anyone in real life. I'm not going to spoil any more but let's just say that I shed a few tears.\n\nCharacters 10/10\nYes, also a 10. Teddy is probably the first character I've seen in a game that had this much character development. He feels unique and real. A Teddy might be walking around your own school.\n\nMusic 10/10\nOOOoooh where do I even begin!!! Such nostalgic and epic music! I loved the OST's, especially during the fights.\n\nThis pretty much sums up my review. I hope you will all buy this amazing game. Can't recommend it enough.

Noob (Nightmare Lyra)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nightmarelyre/","406 products in account","While Mountain Adventure and Racing where so bad they were good, Kayaking is just plain old bad.\n\nNew rule: never ever do a point and click game in a kayak or canoe or any other paddeling operated boat again unless it controlls with WASD/arrow keys. While mountain adventure controlled fine enough even if somewhat glitchy and slow, the controls in this one feels very sluggish, unresponsive and at times downright doing the opposite of what you tell them to.\n\nOn top of the abysmal controls we have the issue of the story and missions also being much worse than in mountain adventure. EVERYTHING in the game is a sidequest, even the main story, and it has an unreasonable ammount of backtracking, presumably so they wouldn't have to produce more background art for new locations.\n\nInstead of having a somewhat decently sized area to explore, we now have tons of very very bad mini games that control worse than free Flash games, and will probably have kids with less patience than adults ragequit eventually too.\n\nThere is also much less "so bad it's good" enjoyment in here in the dialouge itself. Outside of an amusing scene involving random off screen kids berating a cat fish for being poor at math (it makes sense in context... sort of) the dialouge is very plain and the over the top overacting isn't as present or cheesy as in mountain adventure.\n\nBasically, I can't recommend this one to adults looking for some cheesy camp value nor kids looking for a fun adventure. Grab the other two Teddy Floppy Ear games instead.","January 1","false","1.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

One should operate by a Code de conduite philosophique. As fun as it may be to have a jolly good rump with other folk whose acquaintances you may indeed never make, one must of course also consider games who operate on a more sophisticated level, the ones that challenge mind and thusly elevate us to a higher understanding of and educate us of the world.\n\n"The educated differ from the uneducated as much as the living from the dead."-Aristotle.\n\n*le minor spoilers*\nIn philosophy there is no one true answer to all questions and problems. Though a comparison can be drawn between George Orwells Animal Farm, allow me to elaborate; the catfish could easily represent the most loathsome of all, fascism oh yes that's right just like that Hitler fellow, constantly forcing change on the good folk and oppressing the working class. The farmer pig ousts the slow-worm out on account of him thinking him to be a snake, a most uneducated predjudice as they tend to be. I won't elaborate much more but let's just say that glorius sovjit bear (main character) happens to be on a quest to spread glorius Marxist principles to the oppressed folk 'o tha' river, to free them from the ravages of not-at-all-extreme fascism and uneducated racialism.\n\nMany a good lessons and deep thought can be attained from but a brief session definitely worth a shot, bring the kids they could use a lesson!\n\nNo but all jokes aside it's a surprisingly fun game but then again I'm just a big child me self.","March 10, 2015","true","1.1"," 22 of 48 people (46%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","46","22","48","24","2"

I'm trying to have a picnic with my pig friend gosh darn it!!\n\n-Also the mini games are about finding and avoiding things. Not a whole lot of innovative ways to make you think a little. +The math puzzle was good.\n\n-The voice acting was awkward and the script laughable. Sometimes your character says unimportant things or inappropriately says goodbye in the middle of a conversation.\n\n-NO ACHIEVEMENTS!!!\n\n-Not a lot of interactable objects or environment.\n\n+The music is AMAZING though! I'd totally buy it!\n\nOVERALL:\nOther than that it's a real basic game for 6 year olds at best. Not enough puzzles to help stimulate young minds. Music is great.

Within 10 minutes of playing a problem arose.  My kids are young and at an age where we are teaching them right from wrong,plus they imitate what they see.    In the game they came to a point where a number of signs were posted blocking the way. A warning sign, an actual STOP sign, and a picture was also shown to them for a reason NOT to continue down that path any further. I was pleased as my kids on thier own decided it was best to follow the signs and not to proceed any further in that direction.  But the game then gave them no alternative but to ignore all the signs and go past them in order to continue playing.  My kids were confused by this. And I was not happy with it either.\nA second incedent was confusing also. The game has puzzles for the kids to supposedly teach them.  The first puzzle they ran into was to match colored frogs to thier respectively colored lily pads.   The game designer should have picked colors that little kids would recognize.  It was confusing trying to teach a kid that a bluish green frog is not a green frog. As it turns out this was not even the worst part as 3 moves into the puzzle the game suddenly had the puzzle disappear and had now proceeded on it's own to place the kids in the kayak further into the game??  A second and 3rd try on the puzzle ended with the same outcome.\nI realize the game did not cost a lot but it has issues in my opinion.","February 1, 2015","false","1.3"," 47 of 123 people (38%) found this review helpful 37 people found this review funny","38","47","123","37","15"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mkpw/recommended/340310/","mkpw","mkpw","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mkpw/","166 products in account","★★★☆☆☆☆☆☆☆\nI've played this game with my 3 years old daughter. After "Teddy Floppy Ear. Mountain Adventure" I was happy to start another adventure game in the series, but the result is really disappointing. "Mountain Adventure" was really nice balanced and it was a pleasure to see my daughter playing without any help. In contrast, in "Kayaking" the story and quests are not so interesting and minigames are extremely frustrating due to specific physics of kayaking - your enemies and obstacles move fast and your kayak lags heavily; it blends into one of the most frustrating game experience I've ever had. Even the main gameplay (where Teddy is also mostly in kayak) suffers from poor response time, slow turning back and difficult maneuvering.","April 9","false","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
