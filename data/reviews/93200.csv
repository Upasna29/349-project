That is the only positive game element to be had here. Save your money and stay away, regardless of the pandering reviews from what I can only assume are people who have never played tower defense games before. I mean hell, if it wasn't for the art style this thing wouldn't even survive on Miniclip.\n\nThe game feels like a continuing list of bad design choices, a case study in what not to do in a tower defense time. When I complain I feel like a lecturer in basic game design: "encourage strategic play", "present consistent rules for your game world", or maybe "release without game crippling bugs and advancement locks". It's bad enough now, but be greatful you weren't playing when the campaign tech tree was locked and you'd be forced to menu-delete a game when an armored enemy type showed up an you had no units capable of damaging it.\n\nAlmost every mistake (as I'm coming to call them, because I honestly don't think any of them were actually thought through properly), is at once trivially annoying and long term game breaking. Manually resetting and time consumingly repicking your tech tree to deal with new enemy types every level may seem simply irritating, but gradually emerges into an overall expectation that you pick the "right" tech tree that enables victory, and all others will fail by default. Having to painfully micromanage your reloads is grating, and eventually ensures that every strategy will be limited to your clicktimes and not your strategy, dooming any kind of open-world defense. And the rediculous armor and repulsion systems vex you piece by piece as your weapons and equipment become obsolete, before finally running the final, game destroying flaw: you will not lose when your defenses are overwhelmed, you will lose when the charming little boxlike enemies have countered every possible defense and your entire list of defensive options have become obsolete.\n\nIt's like the equiptment they give you is just a taunt of what your strategy could have been: oh hey, here's a rapid fire turret. Too bad it does no damage to enemies after level 4, when they all have armor. Hey, check out these repulsion buildings to herd the enemy into chokepoints. Sucks that every other enemy after level 6 has become "intelligent" and will simply run up and eat them. Laser weapons? Armor reflects them - useless. Slowing razor field units? Can't be used with the anti-armor explosive guns, which destroy all your own buildings, including your own defenses, because apparently future scientists drink too much coffee to understand friend-foe ID. Similarly, saving up money in the campaign feels rewarding until you find out that the game raises the difficulty with your cash level and thus it's advantagous to avoid any kind of strategic spending. RotT plays like a cod game, where every interesting idea gets thrown out within ten minutes because it happens to be too fun and interesting to keep using.\n\nI like playing tower defense games because of the evolution of your goals and the resource management involved. I'm not sure I like playing them when resource management is a menial clusterf*** and the evolution of methods is only happening in the enemy forces. I've never had a tower defense game where I've felt so much like *I* was the computer, and the enemy forces were actually the human, getting to play adaptively against me with all the strategy and choice-making I was missing. Playing like a bot isn't a good feeling. I do not recommend playing like a bot. I do not recommend this game.\n\n","January 2, 2015","false","14.2"," 125 of 155 people (81%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","81","125","155","10","2"

The interface seems designed to be intentionally annoying. Contrived gameplay issues overcome the fun animations and cute tongue-in-cheek storyline.\n\nFor example: It seems to be an intentional design choice that the playing map is just a tad larger than your screen size, no matter what resolution. With invaders coming from all sides, you have to roll the edge of the map left, right, up, and down to follow the action on each side of the map. So watching the action on one side of the map means, by definition, that you can't watch action on the other side. It's just a bad design choice to make the game artifically more difficult. A difficulty gimmick, if you will.\n\nAnnoyed and done after about 2 hours.

Some people may enjoy a game where you are frantically jumping around the map, but to me tower defense is about planning defenses, not lighting reflexes.\n\nThe single biggest problem is that you can't build while paused and only have a few seconds at the beginning of the mission to build your refineries and set up your defenses before the enemies start coming, ready or not. The enemies don't follow consistent paths and can easily destroy your towers, which means that in the mad rush to get towers down they won't be placed optimally and will probably be destroyed, wasting money that comes all too slowly from refineries.\n\nThis snowballs with the fact that your finances carry between missions, so if you spent all your money and barely passed a difficult mission, you'll be broke at the beginning of the next mission. This punishes the player for not playing perfectly and makes some of the later missions basically impossible because you didn't play the early game just right. The difficulty also scales with your finances so you have to be in the sweet spot of enough money to build enough towers but not too much money that your get overwhelmed before you know what is going on.\n\nAt least the game isn't as clicky and punishing as it used to be, in earlier versions you had to manually click on refineries to harvest them and turrets to reload them and the tech tree used to be yet another source of punishment to inexperienced players so there might be some hope for this game, but at this point I still don't recommend it unless you like a rather punishing, frantic click-fest.","October 3, 2014","false","4.7"," 70 of 103 people (68%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","68","70","103","3","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gosedre/recommended/93200/","gosedre","Gosedre","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gosedre/","215 products in account","Tower defense games seem to come in two sorts these days: those where stages are played like an RTS from an overhead view and those where you get down into the trenches FPS-style. Revenge of the titans is by far my favorite game in the former category. This is because the range of options it provides, and the incentives it offers to explore them, make it much more centered on creative design than anything else in the genre I've yet played.\n\nTitans works essentially like every other tower defense game: set up defenses around something, a wave of baddies swoops in to destroy that something, you must manage your defenses in real time until the stage is complete. But Revenge also has some features which differentiate it. The pixel-art graphics are charming, though they can be a bit confusing in the thick of battle. If you've played anything else by Puppy Games you'll know what I mean as this style is their trademark. Personally, I think it another great strength of the game, though it may not be everyone’s cup of tea.\n\nThe stages are very large and very open. The defenses you construct are not bound by a grid, and will likely consist of many, many components rather than just a handful of parts. The size also adds to the challenge: enemies enter the map from many different points in a single stage and are can be difficult to coral.\n\nAll this gives you a considerable amount of freedom in coming up with a defensive plan. Many towers interact, so you will be designing and placing installations with scores of interrelated parts, not just putting up some towers on established paths.\n\nComplementing that freedom is a component of management and upgrading. There are two aspects to this: first, there is a deep upgrade tree which, over time, grants you access to new and better towers. This provides a variety of weapons and defenses, but also forces the player to choose which to ultimately prioritize meaning that by game's end you can have very different sets of advanced tools at your disposal. Second, the resources you use to build must be procured during stages via mining, and your balance caries over from level to level. (Thus, in typical PuppyGames fashion, how you play in one stage carries over into subsequent stages.) The fact that your starting resources for the next stage are what remains from the last makes the game into a campaign, and provides an added incentive to devise elegant defense solutions which conserve resources.\n\nBoth of these features can mean that it’s possible to get into a situation where a stage simply isn’t feasible due to your prior decisions and mistakes. Conveniently, you can return to any prior stage at any time and play forward again, so your decisions are only as set-in-stone as you want them to be. I found that this actually created replayability, as I went back to try and conduct a better campaign. On the other hand, there were a few points where I found I needed technologies in ways I couldn’t anticipate and had to backtrack to get them.\n\nTo sum up, Revenge of the Titans is a tower defense game that gives you space to invent and a reason to do it. If you like the traditional tower defense genre and also enjoy the sort of creative design typical to good sim games there are hours of fun for you in Revenge of the Titans.","October 22, 2015","true","51.4"," 27 of 32 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","27","32","0","3"

The awesome research options between levels, harvesting of resources, and the variety of tools to change alien tactics creates a unique experience between each level.\n\nCampaign:\nRevenge of the Titans, obviously you know the name as you are looking at this review. This game offers an interesting differentiation onto a typical Tower Defense game; enemies destroy your towers and the idea is to block the path rather than create a route. The world is being attacked by an alien species from Jupiter’s moon Titan. The name of the game seems to make me believe maybe we attacked them first? But yet again there is no real story other than the world is under attack and you are chosen to lead the defense force. You not only defend the earth, but you progress through the solar system defeating the alien scum at each planet until you finally arrive to Titan. Each planet has about ten levels, each which offer new bosses and pose new challenges that keep you on your toes.\n\nGameplay:\nThe towers are upgraded by placing upgrading towers adjacent to towers. This is interesting as you can place multiple add-on towers adjacent to a tower to create rapid fire towers, or even long range sniper towers. The difficulty curve seems rather perplexing, with little explanation onto how to play this game can seem rather difficult till you figure it out. The game is incredibly entertaining, once you figure out the general gameplay you can really get into this game. You are given one upgrade point per level which you can use to customize your defense force. With about 73 upgrades and only 50 levels means you cannot research every possible option. The game allows you to respec after each mission, which allows you to manipulate your towers to achieve optimal defenses for each level. When playing the campaign make sure you remember that your money transfers between levels (and your towers automatically sell returning funds from the towers). This information is useful, as you can start saving early making the later levels easier. If you mess up after beating a level and lose too much money you can go back replay the level prior to it and fix your mistakes. This allows you to bring a better end result and alter your starting cash in the next mission.\n\nResults:\nRevenge of the Titans is an epic tower defense game that drives in new challenges and creates new concepts not seen in previous games of the same genre. The campaign is long and difficult, on the standard setting, but you can make it easier at the drop of a hat. Each level requires you to respect in order to take advantage of alien weaknesses, but this makes each level dynamic and unique.\n\nPros:\n+Fast paced tower defense game\n+Upgrade screen allows for between match tactic customization\n+Transfer of funds between levels means how you play the level before impacts the later levels\n+Power-Ups transfer between levels, so you can easily stack them. (I for example used none of my abilities until the last level to make the final boss incredibly easy).\n+Great difficulty curve, if you are a beginner you can significantly reduce the difficulty to ease up the levels.\n+Gameplay from prior levels transfers to the next level, meaning you must play tactfully throughout the entire game.\n\nCons:\n-Poor tutorials, by the time you figure out all the nuances of the game it’s already over. (I for example didn't realize that levels don't start until you place your first mineral extractor until level 48 - this would have been useful to know early on)\n-Recommended upgrades seem rather worthless (it’s better to just rush barricades)\n-Not a traditional tower defense (there is no maze building, and to upgrade towers requires add-on towers which can be hard to space)","February 19, 2014","true","15.5"," 32 of 41 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","32","41","0","0"

The game gets challenging but you are also rewarded unlockable tower weapons, defence buildings and also repair units to make life a bit easier. That also depends on how one uses these properly by placing them in the most effective areas to get the maximum efficiency. The enemies also do not follow a fixed path and adapt to the situation. Regrettably, the game is flawed in quite a few ways. Mainly, lack of variation. All enemies look pretty much the same, and behave identically.

At first, it was kind of neat. The art style was simple and kind of cool, the music was decent (in the end levels in particular, there's this really good ambient track), there was a little bit of humour in the campaign, and it seemed like there would be a lot of variation in enemies and weapons as you level up. But several hours in and the gameplay flaws really began to show.\n\n- There are maybe 3 very distinct enemy types. There are tons of enemies in this game, but they pretty much vary only by things like "oh, this guy moves faster" or "oh, this guy has more armor" etc.\n- Level after level, the grind shows itself. Same gameplay, pretty much every single level. (Other than when you need to use the Capacitor, a specific weapon used for a specific enemy type.) There's never any variation, or anything that makes you scratch your head and plan something out. And the art of each level pretty much varies only by colour.\n- There's loads of weapons and gadgets to unlock and use, but you'll most likely end up using the same combination of weapons for every single level once available.\n- Campaign is started on the hardest setting by default...and it's mind numbingly easy.\n\nMost of my play time was spent grinding for the last few achievements (which was honestly the one thing that kept me going.) So, I'd give it a 4.5/10. It is a decent game for being so cheap (especially from a Humble Bundle) but again, only if you are desparately wanting some sort of RTS/TD game can I give a full recommendation.

The core gameplay is your usual tower defense: place shooty towers to shoot the monsters, place buffy towers to buff the shooty towers, place special towers to do other things like acquire more money. This part is fairly solid.\n\nI can't stand the wrapper, though. To start with, upgrades have misleading mouseover descriptions. The game is played on a small map where monsters appear from the fuzzy dark edge and quickly approach your base. With this in mind, you might think that researching the Scanner (description: "Long range detection systems using radar and lidar imaging to improve early alien detection") would extend the map a bit, giving you more space in which to place towers and shoot monsters.\nBut no, the Scanner is actually a buffy tower that increases the firing range of the tower it's placed next to! No "detection" is involved.\n\nIn addition to this misinformation, the campaign mode is very unfriendly to going back and trying to improve your score. Suppose that you've advanced to (for example) level 6 of the campaign, and you're not happy with your performance, so you decide to go back and replay level 3 to accumulate more points there.\nThe extra points from a better completion of level 3 are not granted to your global resource pool on the campaign map, but to your next play of level 4. Thus, you'll have to replay level 4 and level 5 as well in order to get the new advantages transferred to level 6. In general, you won't be playing with your best results - you'll be playing with your most recent results, which makes it frustrating to attempt to improve your record.\n\nThe "Distortion FX" setting that is on by default and jostles your screen at irregular intervals, and the typos in technology descriptions, are just icing on the cake. Perhaps these things are meant to appeal to some sort of misguided realism, but when I'm blowing up alien titans with nanotechnology weapons, I don't want the absurd realism of having low-quality flickering displays because the war caused a power shortage and my character couldn't get spare parts delivered. I want an interface that lets me focus on the gameplay, and the lack of such an interface is the worst fault that I found with Revenge of the Titans.","December 22, 2013","false","2.1"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","16","22","0","1"

While it is frustrating, it's the same kind of frustration caused by games like 'Super Meat Boy'. I can guarantee, fans of 'SMB' (aka masochists) would love this game simply for the replayability and difficulty curve, and I think that's the major issue. This game's targeted demographic is tower defense players, but 'Revenge of the Titans' follows almost none of the normal tropes of tower defense games like 'Bloons Tower Defense 5' (a well polished browser tower defense). 'Revenge of the Titans' I believe suits fans of games with heavy replayability and difficulty, better than the average tower defense player. Now, that isn't to say other tower defense games aren't hard, they just aren't difficult *in the same way* as 'Revenge of the Titans'. 'RoT' requires a much more significant amount of spacial planning and strategy due to the "open" nature of the map and undefined enemy waves. There is also a good deal of micromanaging in collecting powerups and bonus money while simultaneously keeping an eye on your turrets, buff towers, and factories, whereas in lots of other tower defense games (like BTD5), you usually just place your towers and then sit back while the wave finishes itself, and this I think is the most important difference between RoT and other tower defenses; *the amount of attention required by the player at any given moment.*\n\n\nTL;DR While many of the defining qualities of 'Revenge of the Titans' is a huge turn off for casual and/or average tower defense players, it is these qualities that make 'RoT' such a fantastic game for people that enjoy heavy replayability in tandem with masochistic amounts of challenge, and who don't like to sit around waiting for a game to finish its "autopilot" to do something again.","August 19, 2015","true","8.5"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","13","17","0","0"

There are tons of upgrades that you unlock one at a time, and you can respec before any given level to change up your weaponry.

The game starts out simply enough with it's simple/geometric art style and ease of game play. But the difficulty ramps up in later levels and you will be punished for mistakes you made in earlier levels. The amount of money you have to use in each level is rolled over to the next. So if you let many of your buildings get destroyed, they will not be recycled and that money will be gone even though you won the level. Adding to the difficulty, upgrades to the tech tree are necessary but you don't really know how much they help you until you use them which requires a lot of practice and trial and error. Many buildings you use early on in the game also prove to be less effective or even useless in later levels. You will need stronger, more expensive guns but you will not have the money to purchase them because you were not careful in the earlier levels. Do not be deceived by the cute graphics! I breezed through the early levels but then felt like I had missed some very important strategy when I got to the later levels. But by then it was too late and I did not want to back track and replay all the early levels. This may be heaven for a hardcore strategy fan but, personally, I found it too frustrating and chaotic in the later levels to be enjoyable.","May 17, 2015","false","4.1"," 15 of 26 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","15","26","0","0"

It's pretty much a tower defense title, except that you earn money to buy and upgrade things like buildings and money AFTER you finish the mission. Everything you buy will then be available in the next mission(s). Since the enemies walk around all over the map and they don't follow a certain path, it's more a tower spamming game. You just place towers all over the place (well, as long as you have the money), and most of them will do their job perfect. I'm missing the strategy part here, which is a real shame.

Very low budget looking, which I could be fine with, if everything else worked. Every level looks the exact same, as it is some brown terrain with your base at the end and then guys coming from off the screen. First off, there is no enemy variety, they all look and function the same, strike 1. Then there is the fact that the spawn points make no sense and they will be all over the place meaning you have to defend a ton of different sides, making your defense weak at every point, strike 2. Then, in a tower defense, their pathing SUCKS. They don't follow the actual paths, they just kind of randomly run at your base and spread out all over. Oh and don't forget they will attack your base, and the game tells you not to build it in their path, but then makes them have inconsistent pathing. This means no matter where you build your tower they will run at it and attack it and you will always lose your towers, strike 3. Then there is the fact that your towers have TINY range and won't attack them about until they are getting attack themselves. This also means you can't put towers behind each other or they won't attack the enemies, strike 4.\n\nThen there is the fact you cannot maze at all, because if you put up walls they just attack them instead of try to get around, strike 5. Then there is the progression system. Each level you get 1 unlockable. Problem is, they are usually wasted. If you want a new tower, you need to get like 3 unlocks, meaning for 3 levels you waste your unlocks, and during those 3 levels you don't progress or get stronger at all, which can be a problem/ The other unlocks, don't give you a good enough idea what you get or the effectiveness, strike 6. You will get things like collectors to boost refineries or cooldowns to boost towers, meaning you have to spend points researching them, then during the game you have to spend tons of money buying them, just to boost your towers, instead of just researching tower boosting stats, which actually makes sense. Also, the boosting towers you don't get a good idea how much they help, strike 7. In game scrolling over towers doesn't give stats, just shows sell prices or name, not letting you make informed decisions, strike 8. Then there is the fact that at certain points you will be unable to beat the level based on the way you specced. So you need to respec and keep using trial and error to get the right combo, meaning you actuall have little choice as you can't win with different combos, strike 9. I do like the mustache captain that talks though. Needless to say, after so many strikes and missing every part of what a TD game is, this game is OUT. 5/10.","June 13, 2015","false","1.7"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","10","18","0","0"

This game is mainly of the tower and defense genre where you must fight waves of aliens of varying strengths and abilities. Don't worry though, you have a MASSIVE arsenal at your disposal. The tech tree in this game is pretty big; there are plenty of weapons and upgrades in the game to suit your style of tower and defense strategy. There are power ups that can be used during the game as well to change the tide of battle like freezing enemies, nuking them, stimpacking your turrets, etc.\n\nOverall, this game is highly polished. The presentation I believe is flawless because I enjoy the pseudo 8-bit style. The controls are easy to grasp and there are of course hotkeys to quickly build your defenses. The campaign is a good length and the game is just enough difficult to keep me from snoozing.

It REALLY hurts my eyes when the main base is hit, and the entire game jiggles about like a fat person on a trampoline. It'd be brilliant if this could be reduced or turned off.\n\nThe titan AI seems a little... erratic.

This is more difficult than many of the other tower defense games out there, yet easycomers or young children should not fret since their is an easy campaign in addition to the normal campaign. The game also features an endless mode, a survival mode, and a sandbox mode. The missions are non repetitive and usually include new maps with new spawning locations. The graphics, at times, can be beautiful, but are often hindered by the game's dark atmosphere. There are many things I found that set Revenge of the Titans apart from the other tower defense games. For starters the game places you in the game with a base that you must defend and roads leading from the spawn areas to the base. One would assume the enemies would follow these paths? That person would be wrong as the enemies travel along the path only to increase speed but swiftly disengage the path to attack nearby towers or form a direct path to the base. You heard me correctly, the towers are destructible, easily so in fact. The towers must also reload ammunition, slowly I should add. All these things add to the difficulty of the game, yet I am thoroughly pleased as this adds unique challenges and situations and surprises to the game which allow the game to remain a fun challenge, even after hours of playing. This leads me to the research screen. After each level, the player is rewarded with medals and a research point. The player can then use the point in the most advance research screen I have ever seen in an indie game. This screen feature a myriad of choices and subcategories. One fault i must find is that although the player can research towers, these said towers can not be upgraded, other than the placement of other upgrade towers nearby that can also stack in boosting power up to 4 times. After an hour or so of gameplay, I am throughly pleased with this game and recommend that others pick up this game if on sale, as I find some difficuly in justifying $9.99 for a game which resides in the overflooded quantity of tower defense games on the steam marketplace. Unless you are a large fan of tower defense games, I find that picking this game up for less thatn $5.00 is a sweet spot, as I was able to use the %75 off coupon to receive the game for $2.49.","November 27, 2013","true","1.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

That being said, this title is actually worth the $10 they're asking.\n\nCross-platform tower defense is always nice to have in the library.  Low system requirements means that the game could potentially be played on an older netbook (depending on model, of course).  Fun, with a decent replay value, this game stacks up with some of the heftier titles in the genre with a unique graphical style and play that makes it perfect to add to any library.","December 26, 2013","true","1.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It can be quite brutal in difficulty at times, but it also forgiving with retrying. I found it a challenging experience with plenty of possible approaches and playstyles to the game.\n\nDuring play it also actively engages you with player controlled turrets ('ghosts' for example need a special player controlled turret to be killed at first) and it regulary drops some boosters like bombs, freezes, and more or even money to pick up by point and clicking on the battle field. These acquired boosters can be saved cross mission and be used by the player in dire situations.\n\nThe campaign will keep you busy for a while and you can play it differently on another play through. The DLC also offers a sandbox mode.\nIn my honest opinion; it's a game you can play, enjoy, put down and re-play again when your bored. The only thing that I would like to see is a multiplayer mode DLC, it very much feels like an expanded version of tower defense games from starcraft and warcraft if you are familiar with it.\n\nLastly; I found the graphics quite pleasing, it looks simple but everything is clear and its fairly entertaining to look at. The game has its very own identity, and refreshing art style which is further proven by the other games in the same graphical style and theme by Puppy Games.\n\nFor the 10 euro's, it is a good buy in any case. As of writing it is on sale for 2 euro's which is dirt cheap, I'd recommend it.","December 26, 2013","true","19.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's mostly for kicks, but at least it gave me a reason to play (as sarcastic as that sounds, I actually mean it. I feel like there was a point to all that).\n\nThe research system is fantastic. It may look daunting to the first-timer, but once I got used to it, I started to wish it was even bigger. As it is, it's good.\n\nWhile I'm sure it's meant as part of its aesthetics, the battle environments always look... sterile and off-putting. I would have liked to see some daytime areas, forests, cities. Maybe more weather effects like rain and snow outside of X-mas. Instead we get... rocks. And more rocks. In pale pastel colors. Add to that an ever-present, pointless dim spotlight effect which makes everything look dull and dim. On every stage. It's a fun game, but borderline unappealing and somewhat hard on the eyes.\n\nI'm not sure if I was playing it correctly, but I had difficulty setting up towers along paths, as creeps would invariably destroy those towers (not including the creeps that specifically go for towers). In any case, it didn't matter in the end, as I found that on most maps I could just make a super defense perimeter around the base and nothing would get past it except for boss monsters, in which case, all that required was a second set of towers attacking the boss right away.\n\nThe automatic difficulty scaling could use some work. Once you get the hang of the game, you'll quickly start to rake in funds. But if you do too well (+50k in funds), the game gives you zilch next stage. It feels like it's punishing you for doing well, and even without looking it up, I could tell the game was "cheating" by doing that.\n\nOut of all the Puppygames, I regard this one as the best. It's not frustrating, it's not brutally hard, has a good length, several game modes, and even the stages I failed it didn't remain failed for long.","April 25, 2014","true","17.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Revenge of the titans is by far my favorite game in the former category. This is because the range of options it provides, and the incentives it offers to explore them, make it much more centered on creative design than anything else in the genre I've yet played.\n\nTitans works essentially like every other tower defense game: set up defenses around something, a wave of baddies swoops in to destroy that something, you must manage your defenses in real time until the stage is complete. But Revenge also has some features which differentiate it. The pixel-art graphics are charming, though they can be a bit confusing in the thick of battle. If you've played anything else by Puppy Games you'll know what I mean as this style is their trademark. Personally, I think it another great strength of the game, though it may not be everyone’s cup of tea.\n\nThe stages are very large and very open. The defenses you construct are not bound by a grid, and will likely consist of many, many components rather than just a handful of parts. The size also adds to the challenge: enemies enter the map from many different points in a single stage and are can be difficult to coral.\n\nAll this gives you a considerable amount of freedom in coming up with a defensive plan. Many towers interact, so you will be designing and placing installations with scores of interrelated parts, not just putting up some towers on established paths.\n\nComplementing that freedom is a component of management and upgrading. There are two aspects to this: first, there is a deep upgrade tree which, over time, grants you access to new and better towers. This provides a variety of weapons and defenses, but also forces the player to choose which to ultimately prioritize meaning that by game's end you can have very different sets of advanced tools at your disposal. Second, the resources you use to build must be procured during stages via mining, and your balance caries over from level to level. (Thus, in typical PuppyGames fashion, how you play in one stage carries over into subsequent stages.) The fact that your starting resources for the next stage are what remains from the last makes the game into a campaign, and provides an added incentive to devise elegant defense solutions which conserve resources.\n\nBoth of these features can mean that it’s possible to get into a situation where a stage simply isn’t feasible due to your prior decisions and mistakes. Conveniently, you can return to any prior stage at any time and play forward again, so your decisions are only as set-in-stone as you want them to be. I found that this actually created replayability, as I went back to try and conduct a better campaign. On the other hand, there were a few points where I found I needed technologies in ways I couldn’t anticipate and had to backtrack to get them.\n\nTo sum up, Revenge of the Titans is a tower defense game that gives you space to invent and a reason to do it. If you like the traditional tower defense genre and also enjoy the sort of creative design typical to good sim games there are hours of fun for you in Revenge of the Titans.","September 25, 2014","true","30.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Or maybe you just think "I can do SO much better!" well, sadly you can't have a tower that shoots, but you DO get a tower that SHOCKS the titans as they come into range with a click of the mouse, and add multiple ones together, and you got yourself a FORCEFIELD that will kill anything on your command!\n\nBut maybe you don't wanna see towers shoot the titans from far away, maybe you wanna send DRONES in that get up close AAAAND personal, starting with tiny droids that mass produce very quickly and shoot faster than the basic blaster (Puts that blaster to SHAME), then going to BIGGER droids with bigger guns that act like a TANK for the tiny droids, but thats not all, upgrade the droids so the tiny ones have a better weapon and the bigger droids? OH boy lets say they get a WHOLE new weapon (Im not gonna spoil it, but lets say this weapon is DEADLY against anything really that doesn't have armor)\n\nWith 5 planets to battle on (Earth, Moon, Mars, Saturn and Titan), the fighting never stops until you defeat the final boss on every planet leading to titan, each planet holds a new variety of titans, earth has your standard titans, moon moves onto armored titans that might force the blasters blasts to be defencless, so you gotta get better ones, mars has ghost titans that are unnoticable by regular blasters (Unless you get that certain upgrade that allows that to happen), so you must use the special shock towers to kill 'em, saturn has FLYING titans that will drop bombs on your towers, crazy isn't it? Titan however, has titans that will SHOOT your turrets from afar, as if titans dropping bombs from above wasn't bad enough, titans shooting your towers with armor will be your biggest problem.\n\nAgain, the dificulty IS harsh, i mean this game will full on throw EVERYTHING at you every new level and the game kinda says "Ok, so you got this thing, kill it, ok? Ok, have fun with that" each new level, to a certain degree where it feels like its screaming "HEY BTW WE GOT THIS NEW THING THAT YOUR TOTALLY GONNA HATE! HAVE FUN!" all the way to the last level where it just says "Well you know we can't be bothered to google the definition of mercy but were pretty sure it means you need to prepare yourself (before you rek yourself)"\n\nYes i PROMISE there will be rage-quits, this game isn't exactly all easy otherwise i'd rather not review this game at all.\n\nI top my hat off to puppygames for creating a game that has variety and really pumps some love into a genre that i consider dead now (and tower defence games are my favourite :> )\n\nHOWEVER, i have to give 1 VERY big problem i have...\n\nAnd that is, there is a bug within the game that puppydog games just either flat out refuse to fix (on purpose) or just try to avoid it, seriously i mentioned this problem twice on the steam forums and all i got is halfway to knowing whats going on then...nothing else, and this problem is only apparent on steam apparently...\n\n[EDIT] BUT- The developer has managed to find a loophole with the steam cloud being disabled, while this 'problem' occurs if you have steam cloud enabled, just disable it and it'll work like a charm!\n\nWATCH A GAMEPLAY VIDEO I DID ON THIS GAME HERE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQR7l5Sg5TQ","March 17, 2015","true","90.2"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","1"

Sometimes I hate the simple yes/no type of voting. If we're doing it that way I have to recomend this game, but truth is it gets way too hard way too fast and becomes frustrating.\n\nIt's fairly standard tower defense. But there's a huge twist in that what you research and the money you collect on one level carries over to the next. So you must be extremely frugal in the early levels to have a shot at winning the later ones. If you didn't do that great say 5 levels ago that can snowball so quickly into a huge defeat later and you won't see it coming and have no recourse but to restart 5 levels back. It kinda sucks.\n\nBut the retro styling is very cool and it's solid gameplay, although some research options need more explanation. Also super annoying is the stats for the guns are displayed when you first research them but not again later. The tooltips could be a lot better. I'd give this game 3/5 stars, not great, but fun and cheap when on sale.","February 23, 2015","true","3.2"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","10","19","0","0"

I am usually not a big fan of these, but this is a nice one. It has some twists on the normal tower defense in for example it does not have traditional maze building. You place your towers along the route of the emenies and not blocking them, else they will be destoyed quickly. Luckily the towers build instantly so you can place them as soon as you guestimate the route the enemies will take. The decent size research tree and enemy varienty keeps the levels fresh while your are going through the campaign. The difficulty level is not too frustratingly hard, while still giving you a proper challenge.\n\nIt is not perfect though, the game explains the mechanics badly and you have to figure out (too) much yourself and the inability too zoom out of the map and not having a mini-map can make navigating and keeping an eye on the field a pain sometimes in having to pan the screen like mad.\n\nOn a discount this game is definitely worth it.","July 6, 2014","true","2.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/waystonevex/recommended/93200/","waystonevex","Vex","http://steamcommunity.com/id/waystonevex/","404 products in account","I never would have thought tower defense and arcade-y gameplay could blend together so well, but Revenge of the Titans really pulled it off--there's a cool balance between meticulously planned defenses and frantically slapping down towers in a desperate bid for time, all tied up with a slick retro style.\n\nAll-around gameplay is excellent--the campaign is decently challenging to outright difficult, depending on the mission, and it's easy to see places where you can improve, though actually "maxing out" any given level is quite a feat, requiring a zen-like balance between defense and economy. The variety of enemies present also feels just right, and is one of the best places the game makes use of arcade gameplay sensabilties--you get no information about what enemies are incoming until they reach the battlefield, so the game is just as much about adapting your defenses on-the-fly as it is about big-picture planning, which feels really fresh for a tower defense game. The powerups are also an interesting twist, allowing you to be even more flexible--which gave the designers an excuse to make the game just that much more frantic.\n\nOutside of the battles themselves, the tech tree you develop between missions is pretty nice; almost every new weapon unlock feels like an important decision, though it's a little unfortunate that many of the "unlock new tree" techs feel unrewarding, as they only offer the promise of cool upgrades next time around.\n\nThe game's aesthetics are fantastic, and make excellent use of the 8-bit style, further  complemented by the badass soundtrack and powerful sound effects--your weapons sound dangerous, the monsters sound terrifying, and the notifications and powerups sound like the coolest arcade game you've never played. There's a sort of vibrancy to this game that is hard to come by.\n\nAll in all, this game is a hell of a lot of bang for your buck--well worth the full price, but if it's on sale, you don't have an excuse.","March 23, 2013","true","9.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Or a few powerful ones? What enhancements do you want to build? Will you research those heavy blasters immediately or invest into a longer research that will pay off in the long run?\n\nAll in all, a great RTS/Tower defense hybrid game- I definitely recommend it.","March 17, 2011","true","5.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FlamesSuperior/recommended/93200/","FlamesSuperior","UpInFlames","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FlamesSuperior/","263 products in account","Revenge of the Titans is a 2D tower defense game with RTS elements developed by London-based studio Puppy Games. As in all tower defense games, your goal is to halt the oncoming horde of enemies by strategically placing defensive towers that destroy them. In this case, humanity is being attacked by aliens coming from Saturn’s largest moon Titan.\n\nThe campaign spans 50 missions across 5 locations (Earth, The Moon, Mars, Saturn and Titan). After you’re done with the 10-hour campaign, you can spend more time with the game in the Endless, Survival and Sandbox modes. There’s a good amount of content here. If you’ve played a classic tower defense game, Revenge of the Titans will feel pretty familiar. However, what separates this game from the usual suspects are the subtle yet profound base building and resource gathering elements found in traditional RTS games.\n\nEvery map starts with just your base which you have to protect from the Titans. Then you have to build factories that mine crystals in order to make money to be able to purchase other buildings and towers. You also have additional buildings at your disposal such as shield generators, cloaking devices, reloaders, etc. All of these can be unlocked over time in the research screen before every mission. After completing each mission you are awarded with a single research point. Apart from buildings and towers, you can research technological advancements which bring their own benefits to the table. The great thing about the research system is that you can re-spec the entire system before each mission. This enables you to try out different tactics and you will need certain towers and abilities when facing a particular enemy.\n\nEnemies come in a pretty large variety of shapes and sizes and certain missions also throw huge bosses at you which can be very challenging. Certain towers are good for certain enemies, that’s where the research screen comes into play. You need to pay attention as to what types of enemies are coming so that you can choose the appropriate towers and technologies otherwise you’ll have a pretty hard time finishing a mission.\n\nThe game will also randomly distribute power ups and cash bonuses during missions which you will need to manually pick up on the map within a limited time frame. There’s also a tower that needs to be used against a certain enemy that you have to manually control. Coupled with the base/add-on/tower building, the situation can get pretty hectic at times and certain elements such as the power up pick ups simply come off as an artificial way to increase the action. It impeded on the strategic element and just feels needlessly overbearing.\n\nThat said, Revenge of the Titans nails the addictive and tactical core that makes tower defense games so satisfying. And with the RTS twist, it manages to differentiate itself which is really important as the genre is becoming increasingly crowded. It’s a good title for newcomers and veterans alike.\n\n7 OUT OF 10 (GOOD)","January 28, 2014","true","21.2"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

If your a person that possesses little patients, you might want to stay away.\n\nI will have to start this review by talking about "essence" because RotT is not your average tower defense game. The developer's even stated that it's not a solid "by the numbers" game. You as the player have to "feel" your way through it. After several years and many attempts, I finally beat it. Although I still don't have any concrete understanding of the game itself.\n\nRotT uses a tech tree level progression to unlock new units, abilities and upgrades. Each successful level defended unlocks 1 additional point to invest. It has also undergone many changes since it's initial launch over 4 years ago. An absolutely welcome addition is a re-specification button that allows you to reset your tech tree each level. The reset is free of charge so you can use it every level. Previous versions of the game required players to replay several previous levels in order to travel down a separate branch.\n\nGame-play wise the starts off like most other TDG's. The Titans themselves are pretty basic and will follow a set path. The later levels are where the game becomes far less of a tower defense and more like an real time strategy. The Titans intelligence becomes vastly superior and will behave differently based on they way the player sets up their defenses. This can get very frustrating because you don't feel like the game is trying to teach you how to play it. The player just has to either retry old strategies in a new formation or try all new ones.\n\nThat's where the games greatest weakness, is it's best strength. Because it functions on a kind of "fuzzy math", players are encouraged to play the game in the way they see fit. While it does a bad job at trying to explain its mechanics, it's very flexible when mistakes are made.\n\nPro's -\n\nLooks and sounds great! - Always a fan of the retro style graphics and chip-tunes!\nTitans are adorable! - You almost feel bad for having to destroy them! Almost...\nSeveral play modes! - 50 level Campaign, Survival, Endless, and Sandbox.\nLarge tech tree! - 29 buildings and 40 technologies.\nRe-spec Button! - THANK YOU DEVS!!!\n\nCon's -\n\n"Fuzzy Math" - RotT isn't a good teacher. You may have to re-spec several times.\n\nI fully recommend Revenge of the Titans!

After the introductory missions the enemies do not strictly follow a path and will actively move to avoid your defenses, so you can either turtle by your base, try to control the choke points, camp the spawn points or a combination of the approaches.\n\nYour resources (money) carries from level to level so if you are doing bad the later levels will be more rough. But saying that, most people don't realize the AI is adaptive so if your money is low the levels will be easier (and vise versa) - actually funny to read how some players cheated and gave themselves tons of money only to find that they could not kill the enemies because the difficulty was jacked up so much. Therefore, if you play within reason, I think the game always gives off a decent difficulty vibe.\n\nOne negative I would agree with the others about is the lack of instructions - it can be daunting to figure out how to deal with the new enemy types but I think that as long as you have armor piercing turrets most of the rest is manageable. As a pro-tip, the laser with all the upgrades is overpowered and will help you out immensely. Also consider looking at some youtube videos on later levels to learn how to properly turtle - I think that it is the most effective approach in the end-game when enemies will rush you from 9-10 spawn points and evade defenses.\n\nOverall, I played this game for ~65 hours and got all of the achievements and I think it is pretty great hybrid TD/RTS game. I recommend giving it a shot if you are a fan of either genres. 9/10","May 11, 2015","true","65.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I literally spend around 10 minutes after each battle trying to figure what to advance in tech or get a tower. The money you obtain with battles fallow throughout the whole singleplayer; adds a new twist to not going crazy and thinking of where towers are needed most. And another interesting idea, is that often the titans will take the roads, but they are not dependant on them (as in they will go around). They are pretty much trying to make it to your base asap. taking the roads makes them a bit faster. I have not thoroughly finished singleplayer yet, but I generally got the idea of this game.

You have to research things to be allowed to use them, so be careful what you click on the research page! They don't just GIVE you what you need, but they do hint at it for you. Gameplay wise it's a simple concept of "Defend your base", but the execution can be complex! At first they are just marching at you, but new enemy types and larger numbers as you progress makes you have to think quick! Delete an old turret and place a new one, shut down an old refinery that has done it's job for a quick financial injection you may need to put up more barricades! When you're attacked anywheres the games screen jumps a bit and the titans make noises to distract you too! It all adds up to a hectic yet lovely time.

Revenge of the Titans is a game I find highly enjoyable! I happen to like Tower Defense games and RTS games and RotT does it right. You have to research things to be allowed to use them, so be careful what you click on the research page! They don't just GIVE you what you need, but they do hint at it for you. Gameplay wise it's a simple concept of "Defend your base", but the execution can be complex! At first they are just marching at you, but new enemy types and larger numbers as you progress makes you have to think quick! Delete an old turret and place a new one, shut down an old refinery that has done it's job for a quick financial injection you may need to put up more barricades! When you're attacked anywheres the games screen jumps a bit and the titans make noises to distract you too! It all adds up to a hectic yet lovely time.

I literally spend around 10 minutes after each battle trying to figure what to advance in tech or get a tower. The money you obtain with battles fallow throughout the whole singleplayer; adds a new twist to not going crazy and thinking of where towers are needed most. And another interesting idea, is that often the titans will take the roads, but they are not dependant on them (as in they will go around). They are pretty much trying to make it to your base asap. taking the roads makes them a bit faster. I have not thoroughly finished singleplayer yet, but I generally got the idea of this game.

Its not to say its a bad game, oh no no no, its actually pretty decent, just I feel it suffers from some oversights.\n\nBasically you have to defend your base from the oncoming hoards of Titans, using what ever you have researched and are available.  Ok simple enough.  You get an icon showing the direction the hoards are coming from and you build accordingly.  Just on some missions, during my play time, I find that an all important hoard direction marker is actually hidden/obscured by my HUD, which lead to my defences getting demolished because I didnt see said marker.\n\nBut really...tis a minor gripe, if annoying.  The actual gameplay is pretty simple, just point and click to deploy your stuff or click and drag for multiples, so nice and easy to get your defences where you need them/want them to be.  Research is pretty easy to understand with icons showing what needs what to be available, though the game does tend to recommend tech to you if you havent got it, so it kinda takes it out of your hands a bit, by basically saying " you need this, not what you are currently thinking "  Though you can ignore that.  But it does offer you respec points for your research so you can get what you want within you resorce point limit at the time, so thats a pretty useful feature.\n\nGraphically I like it, its a nice and different style to see.  I particulary like how the Titans are designed, especially the sub-bosses.\n\nBut one other thing that gets me is the price.  I would not pay the £7 it was advertised for.  Fun fact, I recieved a 90% off this game coupon from Steam by crafting a badge, so I had it for 70p!  So what I would do, if this game interests you, is get a coupon or wait for it to come on sale at around 33% off at minimum and then I would say its worth it.\n\nNot a bad game, just a few little issues and a bit over-priced, but it is alright.  Should cure your Tower Defence itch for a little while.","July 20, 2014","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Basically, aliens (titans) are invading earth and it's your job to stop them.\n\nGameplay revolves around classical tower defence cliche's with sum bonuses. Basically there is one campaign to play and you unlock levels as you win them. The aim is to protect your factory from being destroyed. You have a limited number of towers you can place on the field, in order to defend your factory (which has limited health). When your factory is destroyed you immeditely lose the game. As you win each level, the money you earned gets tranfered to the next level. Furthermore, as you progress though the story you earn points which you can use to buy new towers, walls and other buildings. There are a variety of towers available including lasers, plasma, support anti- air. All towers will have limited ammo and will have to spend time to recharge again. Towers may be upgraded when clicking on them and spending resources (ie. money). You collect money by building resource gathering buildings. there are a wide variety of enemies including (strong-weak) land and air units. In some levels you will be facing a boss which requires clever placement of towers to destroy. You can aslo call upon limited abilities to assist in the defence such as bombs and fire-rate boost. defeated enemies may drop money or abilities to use later. The game lasted me 12,7 hours so it's decently long, plus you can replay levels after you beat them.\n\nAudio serves the game well. Weapon fire sounds vary between lazers and other weapons. The sounds also help invoke a strong sci-fi, yet cartoony feel to the game (ie. less serious), Other sounds such as alarms are clear and crisp to help warn you of attacks at your base. Dialogue is spoken through text boxes only and there is no audio.\n\nThere is also a survival mode besides the campaign which tests how long you can last.\n\nIf your looking for a good tower defence game get this NOW!","February 2, 2015","true","12.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I enjoy a lot of aspects of it, but it can be frustrating in many ways too.  Defends your base against hordes of monsters, research 1 new tech every stage for 30+ stages, and try to earn money by mining crystals during each round.\n\nProblem is the game gets HARDER the more money, resources, and powerups you stockpile.  I've experienced weird reactive AI where the game seemingly punishes certain turret placement because of a system of perceived threat -- Enemies will skirt your turret range and go around you!  Building vertically is superior to horizontal, so some maps are just frustrating to build on.  It ends up feeling like a race against the impossible as things get harder, so you must do better, but by doing so things get harder still.  That being said, I've never beaten the game because a recent patch broke my old save I think, so I had to start over.  I don't know how the end half of the game goes.\n\nGood aesthetics and music too.","November 27, 2011","true","19.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
