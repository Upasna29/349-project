In the game there are challenges, and certain stats need to be a specific level in order to get through it without losing health. For example your strength stat might need to be at 20 in order to push an annoying troll into a fire. Only one problem, your stats need to be extremely high for every one of these challenges.\n\nSo unless you devote every single choice you make to advancing a couple of certain skills, you'll fail. It's not an autmatic failure, which is good, but eventually you'll run out of health. And even if you do keep improving certain skills, sometimes it won't even give you an option to use them, and thus, you'll lose even more health. I really wanted to like this game, but I'm afraid it forces you to keep improving the same skill over and over again, which makes for a very limited experience.\n\nStory's good, but that's about it I'm afraid.","January 30","false","17.3"," 56 of 68 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","56","68","2","0"

I noticed getting told how I felt and what I thought, and most choices just boiled down to me either interacting with others as a normal person, being a complete jerk to them, or ignoring them completely. I can't think of a single choice I made in the game that actually felt meaningful to me.\n\nAnother bad thing about this game is that it seems to have 3 chapters. This is only chapter 1, as far as I can tell, and felt incredibly short to me. I actually restarted about 3 or 4 times, and it still only took me 2 hours to beat it. There were also at least 3 times that I was forced into failure as a way of continuing the story, though I only played as a mage, so it may be possible to avoid some of those.\n\nThere are other CYOA's out there that aren't going to leave you on a cliffhanger, are longer, and have more varied choice.","February 1","false","2.9"," 33 of 37 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","33","37","0","0"

At least automatic failure does not mean immediate death so loosing a roll is not the end of the game. But later on you don't know if this choice can be done or not because you don't know how much skill you require and eventually you will end up dying.","January 30","false","2.9"," 24 of 35 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","24","35","2","0"

The story is well-written with a large degree of customization from the onset. The game attempts to get you invested in both your character's upbringing and the relationship they have with their guardian. The villains remain largely an enigma in this chapter and it is implied that they are simply being human; most of the conspirators appear to be opportunists rather than any sort of dedicated evil mastermind.\n\nIf the game has a flaw, its that there is too much customization. As there are a plethora of stats, and thus stat checks, no one character can pass a majority of them. Just like in old pencil and paper tabletop RPGs, your character belongs to a Class and should behave accordingly. Although in theory the game is skill based, due to the fact that large stat gains are generally found in adopting class levels, it is in effect a Class system. Thieves generally do not do well at stand up fights and magicians should not try to pick locks. Splitting your focus will render many of the harder stat checks impossible. So approach this game with this in mind.\n\nAs the first chapter, it does well enough to set up the premise and gives you the freedom to guide your character's training for the upcoming challenges. It also features a colourful cast although without the right interactions, most of their characterization is only hinted at rather than stated outright. Overall its strengths lie in the story rather than system although the latter still services its role. Think of it as akin to one of the more mechanically driven gamebooks like Lone Wolf or Blood Sword and if that appeals to you, then this game should be your cup of tea.","February 2","true","8.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

There's a bunch of likeable companions - which you can romance if you like, and those romances are rather well done as well. All in all, a game worth it's price.\n\nThat said, there's some risk that you'll end up frustrated in the beginning, for the risk is that, because you don't always know what stat increases your choices will lead to, or if it'll be enough - your first characters will likely end up... Lacking in several aspects - my very first PCs back from when I played on the CoG site were so lacking at the end that I didn't bother saving those for the sequel. Keep trying though, for it is certainly possible to end up with a character powerful in several ways at the end - and even if you you don't, that is not necressarily fatal as the game can be lenient enough even to a PC that is lacking in several ways at the end.","January 31","true","49.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Others have complained that you don't know if you can do something until you fail, but this adds more risk to the game, it's like in dnd trying to do something and not knowing what you'll roll. Unlike other choice of games I have played (A Study in Steampunk, Choice of Robots, Choice of Romance, and Pendragon Rising) stats are everything in this game. There is no "right" option to choose from if all of your stats are mediocre, and there seems to be no way to perfect every skill, adding more tact to the game as well.\n\nIn short, fun game, especially if you like dnd and would prefer a more difficult text adventure.","January 31","true","2.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

I have yet to buy book 2 and will purchase it soon!\nWhen my friend told me about this book all he told me about his story was that he was a mage, a good guy, and: "Don't f*** up in the end like I did... It is VERY depressing". And so for the whole entire book I was focusing on not screwing up, I spent hours and hours playing this game and focusing on 1: Having good relationships with everyone, (especially Petra... she's my bae <3 xD) I was literally so focused on having good relationships that when I did something that made my lover mad at me, and then when I tried to kiss her she HATED me.... So I restarted the whole book, did all my exact answers up to that point JUST so I am able to get that kiss! Yeah Yeah I was addicted shut up, it is a good book! (PS thats the only time I restarted xD)\n\nAnyway: This book his highly recommended, I've already got plenty of my friends to play it and they fell in love just as quickly as I did. You can be bad, or you can be good. I was a good guy, didn't get a single thing of bad reputation throughout the whole game B) Mostly because the next time I went through the book I named myself Bad@$$ Bruce (Don't know if I'm able to say that stuff so a censorship will just be placed just in case :P) and I was a complete thug and a HUGE D*CK throughout the book, just to see what it was like... Well I had plenty more cash, but not very many friends, and it just wasn't very satisfying in the end :(.\n\nBut through all this rambling all I'm trying to say is that this is an amazing story and I recommend in all the way, who needs $3.99 anyway? What're you gonna spend it on a lunchable? Nah how bout this game! Much better idea! And here's some advice that I will pass on: "Don't f*** up in the end, it's VERY depressing" ;)\n\nAll right I hope all have a good time playing!
