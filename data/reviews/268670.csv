When you boot the game it does state "this version is a pre-alpha prototype" which pretty much hits the nail on the head but doesn't sound nearly as charming as 'early access' now does it. :)\n\nFingers crossed this project doesn't get abandoned like lots of other 'early access' releases.\nWill definitely be kept installed to see how it progress but for now I would suggest holding off. Unless you have the spare cash and don't mind supporting 'ideas' and not expecting a complete or close-to complete product.\n\n@devs Keep listening to the community and pumping out the patches and content, because it could well turn into something lovely. Got a very risen/gothic vibe about it and I say this in the nicest possible way.\n\nedit: This review was made with the inital version of the game. I have not had the time to go back and see whats been changed yet. afaik progress so far has been more behind the scenes work for future content. I would still advise to wait and see what the team produces in the future.","February 9, 2014","true","0.9"," 126 of 150 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","126","150","0","11"

With that in mind, please continue.\n\nI'd like to mention something that has been gone over in other reviews. Yes, at the time, this game is not complete yet, and it has a ways to go. The official release branch has not been updated since February, and the devs were quiet for many months after that.\n\nHowever, the dev team has gotten their engine overhaul almost complete, and have begun an unstable alpha build that they've been releasing updates for on Steam quite regularly. With the updates that I'm sure will be soon added to the game, I'm confident this game will be worth the $20, but if you expect a mostly feature complete game, do not play this yet. Buy it, hold on to it, and play it once it's closer to release.\n\nI'll make sure to update this review once sufficient changes are made.","September 23, 2014","true","66.7"," 80 of 89 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","80","89","0","0"

The devs have really been hitting the updates hard and the game has made tremendous strides.  The graphics alone are breathtaking and the combat and gameplay are really starting to come along. Currently, there is a lot to do and explore in the game and it's fun to just lose yourself in the beautiful world they created. I honestly see great potential in this game as it moves forward and I'm excited to see what each new updated brings.\n\nWhat's great about this early access games is the devs are really involved.  They update the game regularly and take feedback from the community.  Just go to the discussions and you see the devs interacting with the players and taking their suggestions and implementing some of them in the game. I don't get the feeling that this is some fly-by-night group, and they seem to care about their product. Overall I am satisfied with my purchase and I highly recommend this game to open world RPG enthusiasts.","February 9, 2015","true","6.6"," 40 of 43 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","40","43","2","0"

Pre-Alpha. I might even go so far as to say its just post-Prototype. This is not simply playing a game, for now it is mainly just testing the game systems and giving feedback and reporting bugs. The main quest only recently got implemented because they ugraded to a newer version of CryEngine, which honestly has made the lighting effects and general graphics of the game much more beautiful than its earlier version.\n\nThis game is Early Access.\n\nThe game is challenging, enemies hit hard, you have to roll and block. Hacking-and-Slashing will get you dead. There are only 2 spells in the game currently, a heal spell and a light spell, however I believe the developers have said that spells will be receiving attention sometime within the next month.\n\nThis game is Early Access.\n\nThere are framerate problems and certain things still need to be balanced. Animations are meh. However, they update this game consistently every other week, in fact, its more common for them to provide an update of some sort EVERY week. This is a team of maybe 3 to 5 people and its clear that they are working hard.\n\nThis game is Early Access.\n\nPlease do not buy this game if you are going to clutter the forums with complaints about how its in an early state. Its advertised as being in an early state, it says Early Access in bright blue all over the reviews and the page. There are features that haven't been implemented yet, such as Co-op.\n\nPlease DO buy this game if you want to support an indie developer in making a beautiful, third-person, open-world, Co-op RPG and you want to offer suggestions and feedback.\n\nTL;DR This game is Early Access.","November 7, 2014","true","28.5"," 39 of 42 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","39","42","0","3"

The game drops you into a village and tells you to go do what you like.  So far there are no real quests, except ones that you make yourself.  The game's graphics are beautifully realistic, as only the Cry and Frostbite engines can offer, but not to taxing on your computers hardware, meaning my med-tier laptop can handle high settings and still maintain 40 fps.  Finally, the alpha state of the game means that anything can change and anything can be added.  Maybe the next update will include dragons.  Maybe trolls and dwarfs.  Or maybe even Tom Hanks.  Only time will tell, and I will be spending that time playing this game.\n\nEDIT1\nDue to some recent changes in the game my framerate has now dropped to a staggering 13 fps.

It’s a different yet rewarding and enjoyable experience to be part of. Plus, the devs are awesome and always willing to answer your questions or receive any feedback you might have for them here in the forums or over at their twitch stream channel. I've really enjoyed playing the game, interacting with the devs and other fans, and you could too. The devs deliver on their promises and right now is prime time to back this game!\nWhen thinking about whether or not you want to purchase this game, keep in mind the following:\n\nDo you hate paying for DLC and would rather enjoy free content updates in a game? Check!\n\nAre you like me who wants to explore and conquer a gorgeous and an already huge but ever growing open world universe? Check!\n\nIsn't it great when the Devs actually respond to your feedback on the forums? Check!\n\nWould YOU like to help shape an Open World RPG universe? Check!\n\nIsn't it satisfying when your play style wasn't given the short end of the stick? Check!\n\nDo you enjoy games with deep combat systems which gives you a real sense of dynamism and strategy? Check!\n\nWould you like it if no effort you put into your character will be wasted?

Check!\n\nThis and so much more is just waiting for your support!\nMy time with The Memory of Eldurim has been a satisfying and rewarding early access game experience that would satisfy any serious gamer with a patient eye for epic role-playing games. It’s obvious that the team at Liminal Games are passionate and talented developers who are committed to making this game the absolute best it can be. Their commitment to this game is proven by the frequent quality updates like this: improving upon already existing features; adding in new and exciting ones; updating their placeholder animations with professionally created ones; and also by adding new HUGE and beautiful areas to explore and conquer. It’s always exciting to see what future updates will bring us!\n\nIt's great to know that these guys are serious about delivering us the best experience possible.

It reminds me of Skyrim with the feel of farcry. I could see this being a game where after you gain an intimate knowledge of the layout of the terrain it gains a sort of nostalgic quality. Maybe because it has this appeal to kind of wander around and explore, AND since its more vibrant than Skyrim it has a minimal copypasta feel to it.\n\nThe combat mechanics are a good mix of RPG and action elements. And I'm happy to see this game has an asymetrical magic system that is different from the typical kind of system where players get a fire spell and an ice spell and the only difference is the color. My main qualm with a lot of other games with action and RPG elements is that they usually tend to gravitate to RPG or Action, whereas here we see a true blending. The formula looks like it has deeper potential than even Skyrim or Oblivion. In fact its like they took the best lessons from Skyrim and Dark Souls and are blending them in a hardcore fashion.\n\nClearly it looks far from finished though which isn't a bad thing (because its obviously already beautiful), it means there is a lot of room for growth. I think its worthing buying as is, and definately worth buying just to see what it becomes.\n\nOne last thought to expand on my first comment:  Most indie games sacrifice great graphics in favor of faster development cycles and thoroughly fleshed out game mechanics. Almost all 2d platformers, Minecraft, terraria, Don't Starve, FTL: Faster than light etc. are some examples. Therefore I have to give major props to this team for attempting to sacrifice nothing for a great gaming experience. Its a huge challenge. I develop software professionaly too in a non-game industry and I'm aware that a lot of triple A games will have entire teams of guys dedicated to graphics alone, teams probably larger than this entire dev team who also is doing all the different aspects involved in coding a game not just the graphics. It means too that since they have accomplished so much already I can see that they have majorly invested themselves in finishing. Now or later this game is going to be a finished bomb-shell and people are going to wonder how it snuck up on them.","February 12, 2015","true","5.8"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","20","23","0","0"

Also, despite it being listed as single-player, the devs have indicated in the forums that they are going to implement co-op (isn't a co-op rpg skyrim/dark souls experience what everyone wants?). This is an extremely early access game. There isn't a lot to do in it right now. However, the concept behind it is genius. Go check out the forums. The devs seem to be listening to their community. I recommend this game despite it's incomplete status because of its concept. I see a few reviews saying things of the sort "I don't recommend it right now." However, we need people to support this game so that it can achieve its potential. If your looking for a completed game, then this isn't it (hence early access). But if your looking to back something of the sort I've described, then give it a shot. I could see this game, easily going for $60 at full release.

Don't get me wrong, it has a TON of potential. I can really see where the game could go...in a few years. Which is exactly the problem. It will take quite a long time for this game to really reach its potential. I say give it a year at least, maybe two and see how things are then.\n\nI know it's early access, but I didn't realize it was quite this early. I would almost not call this game in an alpha state just yet. It is more like a pre-alpha, behind closed doors only test phase in its current form. For me it was just too early access.\n\nThe good:\nThe enviornemtns look awesome. They are creative, varied and make you want to just explore around, since it's an open world you can definitely do just that.\n\nThe combat has a decent start. It has a sort of Dark Souls vibe with how attacks work and change with each weapon you use.\n\nThe spells seemed interesting and I liked that you could use two different stones to get various different spells for a decent level of customization.\n\n\nThe bad (most if not all of these will probably be fixed at some point):\nNo quest log. There are quests and the quest log is there, but the log is currently not working so it can be hard to remember what to do unless you write it down.\n\nNo interactive map. It's basically just a still image. At least an indicator of my current location would be awesome.\n\nNo voice acting. I don't want to totally put the game down for that. Obviously voice acting is a huge undertaking and maybe the game will eventually have it, maybe it wont. Just be aware that you will have to do a lot of reading here.\n\nNo customizable controls. That wouldn't be so bad, but the hotkeys (in my  opinion) are very strangely set up.\n\nNo controller support (yet). I don't know if controller support is planned but this game really would feel a lot better with a controller in my opinion.\n\nThe game doesn't save your position. When you quit or the game crashes or whatever, you start back in the hut you started the game in. You do keep all your items though, so I found it kind of strange that it doesn't save your position when you quit.\n\nThe game crashes fairly often. I had two crashes in about an hour.\n\nEnemies are a bit easy. While I said it did have a Dark Souls vibe, the AI is a bit weak. The first several enemies I ran in to just walk at you and attack. If you time it right you can use this huge greatsword I found and one shot the enemy before it even gets one attack off. This changed a tiny bit when I ran in to a few shield enemies but it still wasn't that challenging.\n\nThere are several areas you will explore just to find nothing there. I went in to a cave with some skeletons, worked my way to the back and found...a wall with a crack in it that looked like it had something behind it but I couldn't break it no matter what I tried. So then I found another path in to the same cave but at a different area. That path had no enemies and led straight to a dead end with nothing in it. So I turned back around, found yet another cave, walked through it, killed an enemy or two, swam in some water, and found a way out. It led to this high narrow bridge like thing. I followed that all the way to the end and...nothing, the bridge just suddenly stops at a massive drop off.","December 24, 2015","false","0.7"," 31 of 48 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","31","48","0","5"

It has great visuals accompanied by brilliant sound assets however the character animation is somewhat stiff and unnatural and the combat is dull and repetitive, I realise this game is unfinished and is being develpoed by an indie team, the game can amount to a lot but I won't make any assumptions. I do not recommend this game to someone looking for an immediate solid gaming experience, I do however recommend that you invest in this game if you like the concept of and open-world action rpg, that is reminiscent of Dark Souls. Something worth mentioning is that I feel as if the game is hard not 'Dark Souls hard' but this game is unfair, the combat is not fluid and responsive enough to allow you to play the game with the required amount of skill. Having said that the game is in early access and I am very optimistic about this game.","April 5, 2014","true","4.9"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","15","20","0","0"

So, here's my thoughts.\n\nFirst of all: The environment. The mountain, towering up from the earth, and the temple on top. The bridge, spanning from said mountain to the archives on the other side - and of course, the newly added Archive itself. It's just stunning to look at. I've been staring at the environment far longer than I usually do in games. I hope to see many locations as beautiful as this with future patches.\n\nThe graphics are superb, too. Nothing to complain about there. The sounds are a bit generic, but as far as I know, devs are implementing sounds as the development progresses. The sounds will surely be better once the game is released.\n\nWhat about gameplay? The combat is.. well. It's hard. It's fun and tactical, but it's hard. But then, I usually suck at combat in these types of games unfortunately. A suggestion: difficulty slider.\nI have only tried magic on occasion, and never in fact tried fighting using it. There's an illumination spell which I fairly often use, and the magic system is pretty interesting. Instead of mana, you have something called Ikhor. Pile up enough of it, and you die. You gain Ikhor by using spells. It's like mana in most games - but instead of just running out of mana, you'd die. You also collect shards, which contain certain spells. There are equipped on your arms/gloves and makes you able to use said spells. Quite an interesting concept, and it works too.\n\nAs it is right now, you just resurrect at nearest bed/camp when you die. You don't lose anything(as far as I know), and that's just good for me, since I die like 10 times everytime I play the game.\n\nOverall, I think this game is worth the 19 euro they ask for it. I won't give a score at this time since it's so early in development. I do recommend it if you like games like Skyrim, ie open-world RPGs.\n\nSorry if this review is muddy or something, I've been awake far too long. It should, though, get most of my points through.","March 19, 2015","true","30.6"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","11","13","3","0"

It is obvious that the developers are working really hard to make this an epic game, and, from what I see, they are actually doing it.

Even in it's early access state, the game is fun. There may be plenty of room for improvement, but the game seems to be heading in the right direction and I can't wait to see what happens with it.\n\nCurrently, there are plenty of flaws. I was able to slaughter all of the peasants in the spawn town, some even right in front of guards, who obviously didn't care for the town's citizens. I found that quite amusing, but hope that it will eventually be a bit more realistic. It's also a bit unfair, in a way. You're able to spawn right after dying, which doesn't set back time at all (like most RPGs, that load from save states). With this in mind, I was able to continually go after the same guy several times until he died.\n\nGraphically, the game looks fantastic. The Memory of Eldurim makes use of the CryEngine, the first indie title I've ever seen using the engine. I really enjoy the game, but it's going to need a lot of improvement before it's ready to see the light of day. I can recommend it in its current state, but don't expect too much content-wise. Hopefully we'll see some updates in the future.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgpaRBMbqhc","March 11, 2014","true","0.9"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

As it is still in Early Access, the game has a few bugs and other imperfections here and there, but the developers are quite active in the game community and are willing to take a look at things where they can.\n\nThe gameplay itself is mostly what you'd expect from an ARPG. However, there is a fair bit more strategy and planning your attacks than just running in mashing the attack button. You will die, but each death teaches you a bit more about what the particular enemy  needs in order to be beaten.\n\nVisually, it's very nice. There are drops in the framerate from time to time, but I'm sure that further updates will help to optimize it and improve the stability of the framerate.\n\nSound, for the most part, is pretty sparse. The main town has music,  but except for the occasional orchestral chord swells, there's not much in the way of ambient music outside of town. Battle music is also present at times, but don't go in expecting hours of music to get stuck in your head (not yet at least).\n\nOverall, this is a good game with the potential to become a magnificent game.

The combat is fun, the quests vary between completely awful to fairly interesting, and the loot is quite creative, but where this game really shines is in the world design.  At the moment the entire game takes place on a fairly tiny (by modern RPG standards) island.  But this island is packed.  You can tell they took an awful lot of time hand crafting everything, there's a ton of detail and secrets, and really a lot more creativity than I've ever seen in a medieval RPG world.  The joy of exploring the various locations is why I'm so willing to recommend this game, despite it's early state.  If you're the type of person that likes looking through every nook and cranny in a map and are delighted when there's actually stuff there to find, this is definitely a game for you.   There are definitely a lot of wrinkles to smooth out, but it's completely clear there's a gem here that can already be enjoyed.","March 26","true","8.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Were it to progress along some updates, I said, I would change my verdict.\n\nAnd progress it has. The graphics have updated, there is a vastly improved equipment system, it's  better optimized, and everything else works nicely.\n\nIt's still quite rough, I must say. The music needs a bit of work, combat needs a little balancing, the world, while very large, is mostly empty save for the fairly small area currently housing basically everything, and there are the usual bugs and glitches one would expect. I will say, though, that Liminal has some impressive speed, with updates coming out typically once a week (I will still decry them for not always mentioning it in announcements, but trust me, they really do).\n\nWere there a "neutral" button on Steam, I would press it. The game is clearly feature-incomplete, but it's coming along quite well and it's clear that Liminal is actually trying to make a real game rather than pull a Starforge and leave this as it is. I'm not officially changing my verdict quite yet, but if you care to support them and see where this goes, I would purchase it now. If you're on the fence about this game, or you don't care to purchase something at this stage in development, I would reccommend hitting that convenient little "follow" button and keeping an eye on the game's progress, 'cause I get the feeling that you'll be wanting to buy this before too long.\n\nEdit: At this time of writing, the first major update has been released. By "major" update I mean they basically remade the entire playable area, reworking what's already there and adding a huge new place to explore. I can't check it out firsthand at the moment (need a new PC, CryEngine is pretty demanding) but there is officially enough content here to recommend a purchase.","February 26, 2014","true","27.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

That being said, let me offer some advice to those who are about to download it. You will need a near infinite amount of patience for the game to load. In the time it took to load the game (not download, just load), create my character, and get to gameplay I had rallied 2 towns in War and Order and beat 3 unpoppable levels on Bloons TD 5 on my iPhone. However, once the game does load, you will instantly be grateful that you waited for it to complete.

While playing it I get the feeling I am playing an Elder Scrolls game in terms of moving around and following directions.  The combat system is different when other computer games.

The controls are a bit clunky as well. I liked my time with it, then I got stuck after falling off a ledge, so guess I'll end my current playtime here until the game gets more updates.\n\nThe RPG systems seem to be in their infancy, only gear and a neat magic system seem to be available at the moment. The quests a bit meh, the writing could definitely be more concise and precise in what the characters want you to do instead of just implying it. Also greatswords sell for a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, so pick them up whenever possible. Also the only town that seems to have had much thought put into it is the first one, the one I found beyond the stone bridge was basically just houses and squashes and that's about it.\n\nWouldn't buy at this point in time, it's not worth the money, imo. However maybe 6 months or a year down the line I think this game could really be something to see. It has a hell of a lot of potential, and I just hope the devs don't squander this potential.

I wanted a story to get emeresed in and learn of a new culture and history I would have never been exposed to before. To mention also the full combat system isnt quite done, it LOOKS like they spent most of their time on graphics and not gameplay (default set to untra high). It wasnt much fun to play with a little lazor and not much else to do or go on... It has great potential but with no tutorial or much of any story I recomend you wait until the game is actualy finished. ALSO TO NOTE BUGS!!\n\nWoke up on the wrong side of bed and fell out of the freaking map world. Good Game *(claps), good game.\n\nI attacked a guard out of bordom and I got knocked into a tree and spazzed the hell out.

Other than that the game isn't worth playing yet.  the combat is very basic and repetitive with overly simple animations that do nothing to make combat exciting.  Also very basic sound effects.   Add in the no tutorial of any kind and a very slow mouse/turning speed that can't be adjusted in settings and this game feels like it still has a very, very long ways to go before it's worth the $20 they are asking.","February 28, 2015","false","0.2"," 11 of 29 people (38%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","38","11","29","2","2"

See you then.\n\n--------------------\n\nFantasy RPG's are my FAVORITE kind of game, I go all out with them. Skyrim, Kingdoms of Amalur, etc. Tbh I generally pirate before I buy, so my hundreds of hours in KoA/Skyrim aren't recorded on Steam. However, with this being one of the only (if not THE ONLY) 3D open world fantasy RPG in Early Access, I decided to give it a shot.\n\nYou start out in this little shack, you've been washed ashore from battle and are miracously alive. (Kind of cliche, but whatever) The magic system for the game consists of shards, you can hold 2 shards (one in each hand) and these shards give different abilities. You can use these abilities along side your melee combat abilities.\n\nAs of this review there are the following things in the game...\n- 3 Bosses\n- Several Quests\n- 2 medium sized "maps".\n\nNow I rank early access games based on how early I feel they are in their development cycle.\n- Pre-Planning ( This means the game has no direction and they should have figured it out before development  )\n- Early Development ( The idea is set for most of the game, they are working out details and framework )\n- Tech Alpha ( Not many bugs, features, or really anything. Just a showcase of what the game could be. )\n- Alpha ( Many features have been implemented, but still lack depth and are very early )\n- Closed Beta ( The game is about 70-80% there, but mostly working out bugs )\n- Open Beta ( Stress testing, bugs, etc. )\n\nOn this scale I rank this game as in the Tech Alpha stage.\n\nSo why a tech alpha?\nThere's enough here to classify this game as an early demo, but not really a game. Once you've bashed your head against the deathblood (the first boss),  you'll move on to a single side quest. Once you complete that, you'll go to the valarian camp, aggro the second boss, but since he's too hard and you can't obtain gear ANYWHERE else to beat him except off him. You'll either use some sort of exploit or glitch to beat him and get his gear. Once you've done that, you'll move on to the tree boss. (Who is much much easier than the other 2 bosses in the game.) Where you'll get, basically, a free legendary sword for knowing how to dodge.\nThen that's it, that's the game. It's fun while it lasts.\n\nPros:\nThe game is developed enough to find out whether you would enjoy something like this or not.\nShowcases possibilities correctly.\nSome unique features have already been implemented to show the thought process of the development team.\n\nI'll list cons and go into detail why these are currently cons.\nCons:\nAnimations and clunky combat.\nViewing Distance.\nArmor/Spell Balance\n\nIn melee combat you have three defensive options. Block, Parry, and Dodge. All of these use a resource called "Stamina", this resource is also used when you swing your weapon. Due to the input lag and animation time, parry is basically  useless. Blocking is difficult unless you already have the key pressed down seconds before the attack. YOU CANNOT BLOCK IN BETWEEN ENEMY ATTACKS, IT WILL FAIL THE MAJORITY OF THE TIME. What really irritates me about this is it doesn't matter how fast YOU are, your character will still be very slow in reacting. At first I thought this was because I didn't have a certain stat or skill up, but that's just the way it is right now. The majority of your time in combat won't be actually fighting, it will be dodging/kiting/blocking. Even if you have the absolute best weapon and armors in the game. Combat feels clunky in the respect that you can't try to defend yourself mid combat, you have to back out and get ready to strike again. (Dodge back, strike, dodge back, strike, dodge back, strike, dodge back, strike, etc.) Spells such as tremor which knock the enemy back, animation lock you for so long by the time you get out of the lock, the enemy is already attacking you again.\n\nViewing distance. Grass and other objects don't render until you get REALLY REALLY close to them. Right now, there's no option to change this. Things "popping" into existance constantly tends to give me a bad headache, which excludes me from playing this game for lengthy periods of time. Those of you that played Kingdoms of Amalur will recognize this popping, except in TME, it's 10x worse.\n\nArmor/Spell balance, right now spells don't really rank up with you or have different shards. So the healing spells you start out with, will no longer be useful an hour down the line. You'll be forced to use potions, find food, or wait constantly for your health to regenerate. After lengthy periods of playing, since nothing respawns until you die or logout, it can get frustrating. The item set in the game right now is limited, which means the bandits you fought in the starting zone drop the same gear as the bandits in the second map, even though they're 10x harder.\n\n\n"So... It sounds like you're pretty negative about the game, why the recommendation?"\nThe game is going in the right direction, the developers are active, and they've displayed enough here to say.. "Hey, we won't waste your money." Maybe this isn't something you may enjoy in it's current state, but if you enjoyed any of the Elder Scrolls games or Kingdoms of Amalur, this is something you'll enjoy when it's in a more complete state. However, to get to that complete state, the developers need funding. That's primarily the reason for my recommendation, I had a lot of fun with the games current content,  but it falls short. With more content and funding, it can be a great game.","March 19, 2015","false","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
