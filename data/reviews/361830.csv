First things first, it has an amazing soundtrack, and the visuals are retro.  The gameplay is its main focus, and they humorously tote that due to budget everything else was cut, and what it does it does well. NOW what it doesn't do is tell you what this game actually is....\n\nIts a 2D scrolling shooter with MATCH 3 mechanics. Not anywhere was that apparent on the store, and it took me one attempt to figure out the game mechanics, so its easily accessible yet moderately challenging once you get going. For my bottom line.....\n\n"So ya, I'd buy that for a dolar"\n\nList of things you can buy with a dollar:\n\nThis game.\nHomeless person's adoration.\nSome crappy noodles.....(but they taste so good)\n100 pennies if your government still mints them (or some other subpar coinage)\nReally cheap ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s (ok well this one you end up paying more in other ways... :( )\nCheap in game cosmetics\nSome other crappy indie games on steam which won't give you near as much fun as this.....\n\n....oh and it has trading cards...","April 27, 2015","true","1.6"," 40 of 45 people (89%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","89","40","45","14","1"

The Atari-esque graphics and sound effects are a nice touch, and the electronic background music is quite soothing and complements the gameplay.  If you can get a good deal on this -- which you can; the game normally sells for $0.99 and it's possible to get coupons that knock it down further -- then I recommend giving this a try.  It's good for those moments where you might want to play something but don't want to devote a large block of time.","May 9, 2015","true","1.0"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","8","8","2","0"

As a ship with what basically amounts to a peashooter strapped to it, you fire at coloured shapes to stop them from reaching past your defences. However with each shot your defensive line edges forward, making the game harder and harder. This is where the aformentioned simplistic mechanics come in. In one mode of the game you need to destroy three or more of the same coloured shape to get your defensive line to move back. In another, you have to time your shots and destroy ships in rapid succession  to get it to recede.\n\nThis mechanic is really cool and nifty and makes the game fun to play. It requires pinpoint accuracy and you only really have yourself to blame if you break your combo.\n\nThrow in some cool Atari Esque visuals and a decent soundtrack and you've got a game that is more than worth the 79p it's sold for.","June 7, 2015","true","0.6"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","0"

But actually, this is a very addicting game and more with the match three mode. The purpose of this arcade game is to shoot the incoming objects know as gememys. Each time you shot, a barrair thar protects keeps goin forward if its set to survival mode. If the genemy hits your barrier, game over. Sounds easy right? NOPE, unless you are really an expert on predecting movements and on what gememy to shoot since it keeeps goin forward.\nThe match three mode throws that to the window and makes it slightly better, as the name says, it consits of shooting 3 gememys of the same color to avoid the barrier to keep goin forward. The thing with this mode is that it keeps the air flowing since sometimes you might have 2 of the same color, lets say blue and the incoming ones are only reds and greens. So you need to sacrifice 3 shoots just so you need to continue and prevent dying.\nI might make it sound as a boring game, but trust me when you actually play the game. Its so much fun and very addictive.\nBy far one of the best games I have played on a computer.","July 10, 2015","true","1.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Looking at the negative reviews, I expected the game to have choppy functions and lack of content. Although I haven't experienced any buggy gameplay mechanics (running Windows 7 x64), one of my friends has (running Windows 8.1 x64). As such, if you're using Windows 8 or 8.1, I would advise caution with this game, as it may not function properly.\n\nThe amount of content is what you'd expect after watching the trailer; you just shoot the enemies before they get to the line. The game is controlled entirely with the mouse and mouse buttons; moving the mouse moves your spaceship up or down like you'd move the mouse cursor, and left click fires a shot. As such, this game can be played entirely with one hand.\n\nAs far as I can tell, there are 2 gameplay modes; "Match 3" and "Survival". In survival mode, you have to kill the enemies before they reach the border line on the left. However, each kill makes the border move a little bit to the right, requiring you to kill enemies faster. Killing enemies in rapid succession moves the border to the left. In Match 3 mode, each kill moves the border to the right, but killing 3 of the same enemy color in a row will move the border a bit to the left, which I find to be a unique idea. In either mode, however, accuracy is a must; as the trailer said, this is an accuracy-based shooter. There are also several difficulty levels, although I've only played on normal difficulty so far.\n\nWhen starting the game, you're greeted with a settings screen where you can choose the screen resolution, whether or not to play in full screen, whether to display special effects, and adjust the volume controls.  However, after this screen, there is no way to change these settings except for the volume. Fortunately, it's very easy to exit and restart the game to change the settings if need be.\n\nA very simple game at its core, and definitely worth the $0.66 I paid for it.","January 31","true","0.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Definitely worth the $1, though it kinda gets blanded over wtih other games I'd much rather be playing. For example, if I have the choice between wasting an hour on Dragon's Dogma or InSpace I'll choose DD. But if I need to blow through 30 minutes for whatever reason, InSpace is an enjoyable little hiatus from everyday life.","March 5","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You wont get more than a few hours out of it. The one dollar price tag makes it very easy to reccommend. You know, it's one of those games you will get when you have a little extra cash in the steam wallet but you don't have enough for games you actually wanted.","May 23","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
