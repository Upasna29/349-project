"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Faudraline/recommended/58560/","Faudraline","Faudraline","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Faudraline/","1198 products in account","Wow, looking back my other reviews for the prior installations of the series - Runaway: A Road Adventure and Runaway: Dream of the Turtle - and comparing, my jaw dropped for this one. The last time that I checked, Runaway series were a train wreck consisting of badly scrambled plots, annoying character stereotypes and painfully complicated gameplay. Playing the third and the last game in the series - Runaway: A Twist of Fate - I'd like to ask an obvious question: what is this wondrously intriguing adventure game and what has happened to the Runaway series?\n\nWithout further delay, we are back to Brian Basco's life. Our story opens up with a grim situation that we are not quite used to seeing in Runaway series. It all begins when Gina, ex-stripper, full time adventurer and Brian's fateful girlfriend attends Brian's funeral...  I have to be honest: that was a twist that none of us would expect at all. Through certain flashbacks, we learn Gina's point of view. During their vacation to Hawaii, Gina insisted that they'd take a trip to Mala Island. Yet, their pilot had a heart attack during the flight and the plane crash landed to the island. Brian made Gina use the only parachute in the plane... and that was the last that Gina was able to see Brian. The next thing she knows, they are in a military camp, Brian's holding a gun in his hand and a military officer lying dead before him! Needless to say, he is apprehended immediately and stood trial for the crime. The peculiar thing is: Brian didn't remember a thing! The last he did remember was taking the trip to Mala Island! Pleading amnesia, Brian was sent to an insane asylum and was attended by a court appointed psychiatrist to decide whether the amnesia was real or not. A couple weeks after, Gina learns that Brian died in a botched escape attempt from the asylum... and that's the exact point where our game begins: in Brian Basco's funeral.\n\nEven only by watching the starting cinematic, and recalling the events of prior games, I was baffled. I started to play the game immediately and finished it in one sitting to fill the blanks in the story. I was both surprised and glad to see that the plot progression, event dynamics, gameplay logic, character depth and the genre of humor were down right brilliant in this game! This last installment manages to tie up all loose ends and bring a lively dynamic to the setting by arranging various storylines into an understandable and exciting resolution - and also tops the quality of the humor a couple notches up.\n\nAll our characters - especially Brian and Gina - became incredibly well written and well displayed, easy to emphasize with. Gina now has a sense of humor of her own, alongside a stronger character display. She has become much more than the helpless bimbo that we've seen her to be in previous games. Brian, on the other hand, became way more resourceful, attentive and able - managing dangerous situations by himself without the completely random and somewhat idiotic chance events that we encountered in previous games. His compassion feels sincere this time, and his resolve is actually admirable. The humor baseline in A Twist of Fate became remarkably mature and tasteful too, with witty remarks and eligible references, including an ability to needle the flaws of the setting in previous games. I am pleasantly surprised!\n\nDisplay options are noticeably improved. Sure, we are still given 2D backgrounds and 3D cell-shaded animations, but the artwork quality is mastered up until this point. Animations are cute, funny and relatable this time. Art works themselves are pleasant to look at. Voice acting is clear and matching with the subtitles too. I'd like to also add that this is the first time that a game in the series has noteworthy soundtrack, fitting for the mood and the tension waiting to be built up!\n\nThe game has arching storylines where we control a couple of different characters according to the narrative timeline of events, which is anything but linear to fill all blanks left in the previous games. As expected from a point and click adventure, we are given a limited environment to search through, gather items and talk to people to resolve certain chapters in narration. Good news: there is no pixel hunting at all! + there is a joke about pixel hunting near the end of the game :) Talk about self-criticism. Solutions for puzzles or necessary item combinations are not really hard to figure out. They mostly take some decent observation, basic logic and carefully listening to main characters' comments to get an idea about how their mind works. This way, we solve puzzles and observe their personalities successfully at the same time. If you are stuck, you are given a wondrously funny and almost always useful hint system starred by a familiar yet hellishly annoying character in the series. Sorry, no spoilers but you won't be happy to see that certain someone.\n\nI'd never think of the day that I'd see a Runaway game well done, yet here it is. Runaway: A Twist of Fate is a great adventure game which manages to correct all flaws of the series, rebuild badly written protagonists into likable characters and tidy up the collection of ridiculously random events into a brilliant ending! I still cannot advise you to suffer through previous games, yet it is necessary to grasp all nuances of the storyline; and eventually appreciate the skill and artistry of the team that managed to make a mediocre series into one great story in one game! Thus, I can at least recommend watching a "Let's Play" for previous games. Runaway: A Twist of Fate is a beautiful adventure for you to take a chance on.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","April 24","true","7.3"," 40 of 41 people (98%) found this review helpful","98","40","41","0","7"

There are already plenty of good reviews, so I'll just leave some short remarks.\n\nAs for the trilogy, this is by far it's best part. Part 1 had absolutely awful puzzles, while Part 2 although it had better puzzles, lacked pacing and failed in the story (telling) department. A Twist of Fate furthermore increased the puzzle quality and the puzzles became a mostly natural part of the story. Setting, story, dialogue, "acting" and pretty much everything got a more professional touch. Additionaly, stuff like hotspots marker and fast walking got added to the game, making it alot less frustrating.\n\nOverall I enjoyed playing the game. Even though it might not be perfect (e.g. sometimes it's very hard to see the indication to skip scenes), it's a game I would recommend every fan of the genre. Chapter 3 was one of the best parts I've ever played in any adventure/p&c game.\nI did not like part 1 & 2 of the trilogy and I'd recommend only getting part 3, as in-game dialogue and cut-scene supply you with the needed background information.\n\nToo bad this was the last part of the series. Judging by the progress they made over the trilogy, the next part might've been a masterpiece.","November 3, 2014","true","8.1"," 38 of 40 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","38","40","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/albertrayon/recommended/58560/","albertrayon","albertrayon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/albertrayon/","1581 products in account","Runaway: A Twist of Fate, is the third and final (as of right now) entry into the Runaway game trilogy. The story, while leaping ahead a bit in time from the cliffhanger ending of Runaway: Dream of the Turtle, can be considered a direct sequel since it wraps up the events from that game.\n\nIf you have played either of the other two games, which is recommended if you want to know the full story, then you will be familiar with the control scheme. This is a point and click adventure, with the left and right mouse buttons used to explore and pick up items. In your inventory you can examine and combine items, and select them to use in the environment. The puzzles are on the same level of difficulty as the first two games. There are no ways to fail, so if you are having trouble just keep exploring and combining items until you find the solution. A nice addition is a button to press that will show you all the hotspots in an area. That definitely helps make some of the pixel hunting go a lot faster.\n\nThe graphics have seen a nice upgrade from the previous game. My biggest complaint, the character models, have been improved, and while still not the best, are more than serviceable. The backgrounds are as nice as they have been in the Runaway series.\n\nThe voice acting and sound continues to be done well. There are some new original songs in Runaway: A Twist of Fate. Plenty of effort has been put into making the sound top quality.\n\nOne of my biggest complaints of the series has been the underwhelming involvement of Gina. Although saving her is a main plot point of the first two games, she is never really present for much of the games. You have no chance to form any sort of attachment to her. That is addressed in this game, where you will be able to control Gina for large parts of the game. She almost feels like a new character, because you did not have much interaction with her in the previous games. Brian is clearly a different character than when he began the first game, but it makes sense after the adventures you have been on together.\n\nRunaway: A Twist of Fate felt like the shortest game in the series. However, what is there is very enjoyable, and I would much rather play a shorter game that is filled with quality content than a longer game that wears out its welcome.\n\nI fully recommend Runaway: A Twist of Fate. I felt like the previous game, Dream of the Turtle, was a drop in quality in the series, but the trilogy ends on a high note. An additional adventure in the saga of Brian and Gina would be welcome.\n\nGrade: B+","September 3, 2014","true","4.0"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","19","20","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drmircow/recommended/58560/","drmircow","Dr. Mircow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drmircow/","677 products in account","The twist is that they somehow fixed the series, but was it just in time?\n\nFirstly, Runaway: A Twist of Fate is the third and latest entry in the Runaway series, the point-and-click adventure series by Pendulo Studios where you follow Brian Basco - a shy physics nerd turned into a confident adult capable to stand up for himself - and his attractive girlfriend, Gina Timmins, in their Hollywood-like adventures which take some evident inspirations from a couple of known classics, like Broken Sword in particular.\n\nSplit into a couple of acts, this time around the story starts off from nowhere with absolutely no connections to Runaway 2’s ending: Brian is dead and he left a cryptic message to Gina who was supposedly still trapped in some sort of water tank in the previous game. For the first time in this series you take control of Gina, which oddly enough feels like breath of fresh air for this series despite this mechanic being nothing new to the genre. Not only that, but the biggest complain I personally had with this series was how useless Gina was as a character in the past by bringing nothing to the story other than an incentive for Brian to save her -- damsel in distress at her finest. It also did not help her being off-screen for at least three quarters of a game each. But the developers have finally listened and addressed this issue with a newly rewritten Gina who can be clever, reliable, and funny whilst still retaining her woman qualities.\n\nSo as Gina, it is your job to find out what actually happened to Brian as you deduce that he is not actually dead. From there on, the story starts building up piece by piece into a satisfying adventure worthy of its title with enough thrills and detective work to suck you in; you really want to know what happens next. I do not know what kind of sorcery the folks at Pendulo Studios dealt with, but whatever it was, the narrative in particular is a massive improvement over the previous games. It has a certain cinematic vibe to it which works surprisingly well with what Runaway: A Twist of Fate is going for, but perhaps the best part is how you are given a certain degree of perspective from different characters on how the plot develops (or developed in the past events) over the course of the game. Without any major spoilers though, the ending does feel somewhat unsatisfying considering the events that occur in the game, even despite being a throwback to Runaway 1’s ending. At the end of the day, considering how Runaway 1’s plot took a while to hook you and how Runaway 2’s was a trainwreck after the first two or so acts, Runaway: A Twist of Fate shows that this series is capable of consistently adequate writing. In actual fact, this is perhaps the most serious Runaway game from a plot standpoint due to its evident shift in tone, but at the price of also being the most mundane from the series as it cut down on the supernatural nonsense and the number of cheesy scenarios. Therefore, fans of the original might miss some of that wacky trademark whilst those who despised Runaway 2’s “Indigo Prophecy”-like approach in storytelling might go through sensations of revelations. Cutting it to the chase, the plot is simply a retcon of the entire story of the series.\n\nWhere Runaway: A Twist of Fate truly shines is perhaps when it mocks itself. There are plenty of hilarious, tongue-in-cheek, moments and references where it acknowledges how cheesy the previous Runaway games were and even questions the clichés of the point ‘n’ click genre. Realistically, becoming self-aware of itself should have ruined any of the immersion that the game has to offer, but it actually works in its favour to drive some of the humour from this comedy-oriented flick. Still, when it works, it can generate a chunck of laughter.\n\nVisually, the cartoonish hand drawn backgrounds in here still maintain the unique aesthetics of the series, although they do feel subjectively less memorable (than in Runaway 1) and not as vibrant (as in Runaway 2) this time around. Locations and scenes, which in fact are far less than in the previous two games, are more constrained and definitely a lot smaller in size than before. Furthermore, they are also not as exotic as before since most of setting is mainly based in urban locations. One major criticism in regards to the drawings is that some of the rooms or objects were drawn at really odd angles in respect to the camera, so to speak, making them feel out of place sometimes. The character animations are also much better now.\n\nThe puzzles follow the tradition in the Runway series of doing plenty of pixel-hunting and every so often nodding at their illogicality when characters have to “improvise” their way. For our sanity, the developers finally listened to the criticisms received from the previous games and implemented a clever hint system which gives clues (not full solutions) to the player at any given time, along with the  ability to highlight all the hotspots in the scene. This allows for a smoother experience than the previous entries without hindering much of the story’s pace. As result, this becomes the easiest and shortest Runaway to complete, clocking around 6-8 hours at most. The only noticeable annoyance with some of the puzzles is when acquiring items before any real motive, thus making certain actions not sequentially logical. This, sadly, ruins a bit of the immersion that is being built. Other than that, Runaway: A Twist of Fate has probably the best puzzles compared to the other two with less temptations of looking up a walkthrough.\n\nAs with the shift in tone, the soundtrack returns to the vibes accustomed from the original game which is a satisfying feeling for anyone who unashamedly enjoyed it, especially for its cheesily sang theme tune with synth-guitars. Talking about the audio, gone are the days when you were hearing someone talk as if they were doing so through a tin can, so it is, again, relatively better in most parts than in the previous games. But the most notable observation is the change in voice actors. For instance, Brian does sound different this time around. So you may like this change or not, but I did not find any problems with the new voice actors as far as I am concerned.\n\nIn conclusion, Runaway: A Twist of Fate is easily the best and most polished entry in this series, but sadly not the ultimate Runaway experience in my eyes. The way I personally see it is that it spends too much time doing a retcon of the entire series rather than bringing something new to the table. Many of the new features and improvements implemented in here were already present in other similar games of its genre many years prior this. It might as well have been called Runaway 3: The Apology Letter To Fans instead. The only thing that Runaway: A Twist of Fate did was to catch up with modern standards. By fixing many of the series glaring issues (which is commendable), it lost a bit of its charm that made it stand out to other adventure games from its genre, whether you liked it or not. Just when it finished cutting all its badly grown weeds, it ended. Still, I am recommending this game to anyone who fancies a point ‘n’ click adventure game with a good narrative and doable puzzles as it is easily the most accessible of the three games. Luckily, it does not require to have played the previous two to understand the story and recurring characters as everything is explained in it, but in lesser detail. For a better understanding, do play the previous two even if you have to endure their respective flaws.\n\nI believe Pendulo Studios learnt a lot from this experience and I strongly believe, based on how this game played out, that Runaway 4 would have been that ultimate Runaway experience I am craving for. Retain the design polish of this game, but bring back some of those wacky charms of the original.","November 27, 2015","true","8.2"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

If you enjoyed the craziness of the first two games for some reason, you may be appalled how “normal” this one is.\n\nLong version:Runaway: A Twist of Fate feels almost like as if it isn’t even the part of the same series ‘The Dream of the Turtle’ was. It even starts by stating almost none of the events of the previous game ever happened, but it doesn’t stop there: the first game’s plot is reduced to a tale the protagonist cooked up in his head to justify stealing 20 million dollars from the mob.\n\nRunaway 3 is, in short, an on-the-run thriller, where Brian and Gina are trying to disappear from the military police of the second game and from the mob they scammed in the first game– packed into a relatively tame but good-looking point ‘n’ click adventure game.\nNo more immature sex jokes, only humour that knows its place and the importance of timing in delivery. No more super spies, only mob enforcers. No more Joshua… thank all deities.\n\nAlso, no more bad voice acting. Almost the entire cast was replaced with people who can act, all this to put a larger emphasis on the more serious tone. This realism is also present in the scenery: the jungles and military bases are replaced with more everyday locations like alleyways, an asylum, or a cabin in the woods (where you conduct a rather normal investigation into a murder case).\n\nThe puzzles are less Gabriel Knight 3 and more Broken Sword 1. Everything you do follows point ‘n’ click logic, but it does have logic and structure.\nEssentially, Runaway 3 was changed into an average adventure game that doesn’t really do much to stand out, but it also means it stopped being the colourful, annoying clown that probably hurt the good name of this genre more than it helped.","October 7, 2015","true","5.1"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","4"

After a big disappointment to Runaway - Dream of the Turtle, Twist of Fate brings back the mystery and action that Runaway - A Road Adventure had. The graphics and art have been improved and cinematics are much much better than the first two. Twist of Fate makes up for the fails of Dream of the Turtle.\n\nWith Dream of the Turtle leaving the players hanging at the end, Twist of Fate answers the questions that were left in Dream of the Turtle. Giving Twist of Fate two key epilogues: Dream of the Turtle ending and the Twist of Fate finale. Twist of Fate is not entirely dependent on Dream of the Turtle since key events in Dream of the Turtle are well explained in Twist of Fate as a flashback. That's why there isn't much a need to play Dream of the Turtle before playing Twist of Fate but I higly recommend that players should play the first installment, Runaway - A Road Adventure.\n\nTwist of Fate maybe considered as the best among the three since the story plot keeps the player begging for more information on how Brian ended up in that certain situation. WIth a lot of question marks at the beginning, players will be clicking their way to know more. Whenever you get stuck, Twist of Fate has two assisting features: An animated guide and the hotspot displayer. With such features, players won't likely to get frustrated whenever they get stuck on a certain chapter.\n\nSince this one's quite an old game, I recommend it to players that they should buy this when it gets on sale. It's still an Instant Pendulo Studios Classic.\n\nGraphics: 9/10\nMusic: 7/10\nStory: 9/10\nGameplay: 8/10\n\nMy Overall Rating: 8.25","March 8, 2015","true","7.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

A point and click adventure puzzle game series with a nice complex plot that felt like someone's imagination had runaway with them (with a nice sci/fi twist that kept you guessing.)  Then came this game.\n\nEssentially, this game says: Nope! Sorry.  We made up the other two.  They were interpretive fantasies of the main character.  Nothing actually happened the way you spent hours figuring out and playing through.  It was a terrible let down. Some of the puzzles were a bit obscure in the others, however they (their stories) were entertaining enough to keep my interest and make me into a hopeful for this game. With the onset of A Twist of Fate, I've personally decided not to buy another game from Pendulo Studios.\n\nThe voice cast is completely different for starters, as it sort of grinds at your ears after getting to know the other characters in the other two games in the series.  Not enough to be game breaking, but enough that you notice.. repeatedly.  I'm not saying they're not a good cast, they did do a good job, but you can't get by without noticing within the first 5-10 mins.   The artwork is nicely done, and very enjoyable.  The color tones of the various areas help set the mood of each chapter splendidly.\n\nAll in all, taken as an individual game it is enjoyable.  The puzzles are difficult without being impossible and usually very intuitive.  (I did run into a few places where descriptions or items were referenced without having previously been seen, something that I did not run into in the other games in the series.)  In particular, A Twist of Fate seems somewhat easier than the other two Runaway games - something I wouldn't mention if it wasn't very noticable.  Sadly, it seemed almost dumbed down and changed around for the masses, appealing to a wider audience by compromising story plot and introducing a larger number of cutscenes.\n\nI'm certain someone out there will point out some major flaws in my review for whatever reason, but in summation: I don't like or recommend the game.  The game by itself is nice, well thought out, and the plot is interesting- bringing an entertaining conclusion to the series... (that being said, -again in summation- in relation to the rest of the series, the game sucks.)","December 17, 2013","false","2.9"," 16 of 33 people (48%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","48","16","33","2","0"

The characters are more memorable, more fleshed out, better visually designed, have better written conversations, and have better voice acting than ever before. The puzzles are more interesting and more fun than the first two games, partially thanks to the User Interface being more helpful, easier to use, and better looking.\nThanks to minimal pruning of the story, coupled with avoiding actually playing through the goofiest remnants of the second game's plot, A Twist of Fate admirably salvages & continues the last story without destroying it. A Twist of Fate is the best story of the Runaway trilogy, explaining the previous games' tales in the story, in a way that catches new players up to speed without them feeling like they're reading dry synopses.\nYou can also finally play through some segments as Gina, the continual companion (and secondary protagonist) to the player-controlled protagonist Brian, which is nice.\nA Twist of Fate is definitely the best game in the Runaway trilogy, and I would not only recommend it as a stand-alone, but also as one of the games (along with The Next BIG Thing & Yesterday) that make the Pendulo Adventure Pack a worthwhile purchase.","January 1, 2015","true","12.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game starts with the fake funeral of the series main character. The further you get into the game the more plot holes you might spot. As usual in these kind of games, you march on by stealing from people, and distracting people.\n\nHumour is a main part of the game, with a lot of jokes referring to pop culture, e.g. the swap scene in Raiders of the Lost Ark as seen in the promo video. Somehow, these jokes fell flat to me.\n\nPuzzles are of the dialogue and inventory types and no logic or mathematics puzzles. There are only two actions to take on each hotspot on the screen: look and use. Some of the solutions are odd, and some of the situations that arise from those solutions are too. For example, combining a large stick with a ribbon and a disc cutter in order to be able to  remotely cut through steel probably does not work in real life. Not every item in the inventory needs to be used.\n\nHints are provided in-game, and these ones are often useful. Hotspot locations are highlighted at the press of the F2 key. My main gripe with the game is that some screen transitions are not hinted by the mouse cursor. First example of that happens on the second chapter, where you enter a large room. If you click in a nowhere region, you then can see another section of the room. I felt the lack of hotspot in these cases confusing.\n\nGraphics are crisp and vivid, with characters being prerendered. There is an over emphasis on using video.\n\nVoice is everywhere in this game, with lots of extra dialogue that might not end in anything. Many items do even have two different descriptions. Voice acting in spanish was OK, although two or three different lines were spoken with wrong effects being applied, e.g. talking through a telephone was not consistant.\n\nTechnically speaking, the game handles screen resolution in an odd manner. The game is drawn at a single resolution, but allows you to change it. A graphical artifact appeared when I used my screen native resolution - two cursors were shown, one for the location at the native resolution and another for the position of the unscaled game resolution.\n\nAs a concluding remark, this game is an OK game to me. There was nothing too good or too bad that could deter other people from playing it.","December 26, 2014","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A true masterpiece. Although the first two games sometimes reminded me of Broken Sword (one of the best adventure game series of all time), they were never really on the same level as Broken Sword. Runaway 3 changed that. From the very beginning, it's evident that a lot of work went into every little aspect of this game. Everything from the past games was improved, and many of the annoyances were fixed. Some of the puzzles were still a bit too hard/illogical, but the new in-game hint system was very helpful. In fact, it seems like the developers wanted you to use it (or even forced you to), but that's actually a good thing. It's hard to explain, so I'll just leave it at that.\n\nAs a standalone game, Runaway 3 is an excellent adventure game. There are tons of references, jokes, and breaking of the fourth wall that will have you laughing from start to finish. You can ask one character about previous Runaway games. I don't want to spoil anything because his commentary was one of the highlights of this experience, but that alone made this game worth playing. The story also seemed to be much more coherent than previous games, which really helped elevate the quality of the game to a whole new level comparable to the likes of classic adventure games such as Broken Sword, Myst, or Grim Fandango .\n\nIn conclusion, this game should be in everyone's wishlist. There's something here for everyone, regardless of whether you have played adventure games before. As always, I recommend playing the previous games in the series, but in this case it's not necessary.","April 27, 2015","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Pendulo seems to have sorted out most though not all complaints from the original elegantly - yeah, the pixel hunting's there, but items can be highlighted now, which helps. Especially with those parts where two pieces of the shelf, labeled the same can be interacted with separately. The gameplay is typical Runaway trigger-happy affair where you need to examine everything, sometimes multiple times, and, often, try everything without much logic initially, but logically retroactively, and, well, slightly more realistic than some (why would you take random thing A until you really need it). I got stuck maybe 3-4 times, and was helped in all but one case (at the beginning), maybe two, by the in-built, nicely integrated and executed in-game hint system you can access at will. Those "I have no idea what needs to be done" moments are thus reduced to a bare minimum. Muliple users (with password protection) are allowed, so if someone is in need of that (families, roommates, etc), a plus for them.\n\nSo, yeah, the game is much more easy than the last two sequels, and also seems to be much shorter. Steam says I spent 10h on the second installment and 5h on this one, only partly due to AToF being easier. "Playing areas" are smaller for the better part, so it's easier, in those (few) moments where you end up just trying to combine everything with everything, to progress. The story is generally well written and more or less satisfying, answering most if not all the questions left hanging in the air after the second installment. The fourth wall is broken multiple times, and self-ironic bits are commonplace, which is cute. Controlling different characters helps too, no stagnation really.\n\nPendulo's attention to detail (graphical mainly) is even more evident than before - though the TDotT's beautiful tropical blues, greens were what made the game a joy to play (and countered much of the gameplay frustration), the settings here are a bit darker and, perhaps, less enjoyable, but there are unique touches everywhere, from the backgrounds, through some of the characters to hotspot descriptions (multiple for the same thing). At certain points you can just interact with characters for interaction's sake, puzzles that don't help you progress but help with the story and the atmosphere... or to waste time while you think they should somehow take you forward - again, become better in retrospective. Musically - typical Runaway, ambiental stuff more than fitting for the setting, punctured by non-ambiental stuff with vocals that sticks out less than before - the French song in the morgue was especially effective. Professionally done.\n\nAll in all, again, a good adventure game that's not without its flaws - mostly gameplay-wise and, but it bears them well, aware of them, remaining in line with its predecessors. Recommended.","July 27, 2015","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Enjoyable all around. Awesome hint system. An in-game phone helpline that made getting hints actually fun. Not that you really should need many as most puzzles were very easy. Many of the extra dialogue choices were funny and totally worth taking your time to go through. Best mime portrayal I've seen in a game. Nice also to play as Gina.","April 26","true","9.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is the fist of the Runaway games I've played so I'm not certain how it compares to prior games, I only know that I'm buying the remainder of them based on this experience.\n\nThe puzzles were mostly straight forward with a few twists that took a while to figure out.  The characters and video cuts were enjoyable, some dry humor infused for a chuckle as well.\n\nIf you enjoy click and solve mysteries you will enjoy this game.","April 18","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I Pendulo Studios riconfermano il loro peso nel mondo delle avventure grafiche odierne con questo gran bel titolo. L'unica pecca è forse la longevità, un po' deludente rispetto ai primi due...Ciononostante ne vale la pena","June 30, 2011","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was going to write a negative review for this because of the tedious pixel hunting but I realised it's not an issue when you constantly click F2 to highlight every item in the scene. If you buy this game it will improve your playing experience using this, otherwise it's massively frustrating. Still only recomended to those who've played the better point click games already. It maybe better to first play Runaway 1 to get some background (I avoided the second game based on reviews) and those who are fans of the genre\n\nPositives\n\nCinematic and clever use of gives an excellent graphic experience\nA decent plot with a few twists\n\nNegatives\n\nAn irritating leading character\nAttempts at humour usually fail\nPixel Hunting - solved by pressing F2\nFairly short - the game was left on as I worked hence the high number of hours\nPuzzles aren't always logical and sometimes you can try a solution that should work but if you don't use\nThe flashback to the Runaway 2 seemed far fetched.\nCertain scenes weren't particularly engaging. It took quite a while to get into the plot","January 19","true","85.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
