The video settings for a PC title are lacking, and the performance of the game itself is disappointing due to poor optimisation for the platform. The sounds have improved on what was in WRC 4, but they're still pretty bad, especially for the co-driver and some of the general car sounds.\n\nI'm sure this game will improve when people release physics mods, etc. for the game, but until then, I'd just like a good product out of the box, and for the game to run well on PC.","October 10, 2015","false","22.1"," 58 of 79 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","58","79","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/co199/recommended/354160/","co199","RobotWizard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/co199/","684 products in account","Let me preface this by saying I'm not an absolute hardcore sim-racer - I don't have a wheel or a racing rig, I just play driving games using an XBOX One controller. PCARS, DiRT Rally, Race 07, etc, etc - I own and play them all.\n\nWRC 5 is rough around the edges, but with some TLC I think the game could go from good to great. It's not DiRT Rally, but it's also not awful. It's not another Milestone travesty, so we don't have to worry about garbage like the sound dropping out after two stages.\n\nI'll start with the bad:\n\n- Robotic co-driver: You do get the option of a woman co-driver, but both male and female options are spliced from sound clips rather than smooth pace notes like DiRT Rally or Dirt 2 / 3. It's not bad (and the pace notes are effective), but it's something to note.\n- Poor engine sounds: The cars sound like toys.\n- No actual routes: The courses are approximations of the real locations. It's close, but it's not the actual course.\n- Wheel support: There's a limited set of supported wheels.\n\nAnd now for the pros:\n\n+ Classes: Junior WRC, WRC 2 and WRC. You get a good selection of classes and cars, plus all the licensed drivers and gear.\n+ Career mode: The team stats are slightly randomized so you get a good selection of goals to choose from.\n+ Stages: 5 unique stages and a repeat per rally, usually in a 2-2-2 format. The stages aren't terribly long, but they are fun to drive. Finland's scary at night.\n+ Challenge mode: The MP challenge mode is pretty fun. Time trials on a specific stage using a specific team.\n\nReasonably, hard-core sim racers aren't going to like this. It's a balance of arcade racing and sim racing, using a real-world license. If you want a nice introduction to rally racing, this is a good place to start. It's better than WRC 4 (which isn't saying much, admittedly, but it's a marked improvement and is a decent little racing game).\n\n7/10 - needs some work, but is playable and fun.\n\nEDIT 2015-10-14: Patch 1.03 helped with the variable framerate and set DX11 as the primary launch mode, rather than DX9. I adjusted the cons to remove the framerate issues and upped my score to 7/10. The game still needs work, but it's not bad.","October 13, 2015","true","6.8"," 44 of 57 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","44","57","0","0"

If the game gets patched in the future, this has the potential to be a decent game, but it's not worth the price right now.\n\nThe game is an arcade game (which is fine) but it has VERY limited wheel support and the FFB is far from perfect. Car handling and physics just feel awful, while the graphics aren't great considering I have a GTX 780 ti and  i7 4770k.\n\nThe game does have some positives, with the full list of WRC rallies/cars included and car damage has been done pretty well. The stages are also decent. But unfortunately the other deficiencies of the game outweight the positives in the current build.","October 10, 2015","false","29.5"," 55 of 80 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","55","80","2","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deftone37/recommended/354160/","deftone37","Optimator","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deftone37/","145 products in account","First impressions:\n\nGraphics:  With a 4670k O/C'd to 4.3 ghz and a GTX 970 I'm getting very low frame rates (less than 60), even with all graphic settings set to LOW or OFF.  This is just at 1080p.  Very few options to change as well.\n\nSound:  Watch some vids, it's pretty awful.  Co-driver sounds like a robot, car sounds are very poor.\n\nHUD and Camera Views: Standard camera views, but when you switch to cockpit view, you have NO tachometer, no speedometer, and no idea what gear you are in.  This could just be a bug for the car that I was using.  If you shift views in the middle of the race it will reset your current gear to 1.  Why on earth would this happen?  The tach is nearly impossible to see what RPM you are actually at, as the colors of the green/red only get slightly darker as you progress.  You really only know when to shift if you hit the redline.\n\nWheel Support and Force Feedback:  Just atrocious....  No clutch pedal support whatsoever (don't think H shifter either, but haven't tried yet).  There are some adjustments for sensitivity and deadzones, but only a bar to move with no numerical values.  FFB is quite awful, but it is there.  There are 2 sliders in which you can change the strength and vibraton (?).  If you completely lower the sliders to 0 then the wheel suddenly becomes a vibrating mess.  In short, this game is probably best played with a controller...\n\nPhysics:  About what you would expect.   More arcade like but you do need to use the brakes in this game at least....\n\nRally school:  A complete joke.  Not even worth discussing.  You have to do the same courses for Basics, 2wd, and 4wd.  Honestly just a huge waste of time.\n\nOverall:  With only an hour of playtime so far, I'm giving this game a 2/10.  This may change with further playtime, but currently its a buggy, laggy mess.  Stay far away from it.","October 9, 2015","false","2.5"," 52 of 76 people (68%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","68","52","76","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/battleyetiz/recommended/354160/","battleyetiz","Geraldo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/battleyetiz/","747 products in account","I really wish they didn't advertise the game as a simulator, because it definitely is not. What it is, however, is a casual game meant for rally and WRC fans.\n\nIf you're looking for realism, you won't find it here. The tracks are mostly fictional and the car physics are simcade level at best. The visuals are serviceable but dated and are reminiscent of racing games on last gen consoles.\n\nThe performance could be better, but the game should run fine on a modern low end system with some tinkering in the graphics options. With VSync off, I average around 70 fps on max settings with an r7 370 at 900p (45 fps at 1080p). Turning the shadows down a notch yielded a 10-15 fps boost.\n\nThere is plenty of content to play through in the solo campaign. You start out as a junior and have to work your way up every season to become a champion.  The rally school is a really nice addition for people who aren't familiar with rally techniques. There are random leaderboard challenges that appear from time to time that serve as a bit of side content. If you just want to drive and not worry about the career, there is a quick stage mode that has every track and car unlocked.\n\nOverall, I would say the single player portion is very plain. You don't really need to do anything but drive. The car repairs, car setup, and team management have mostly been automated. While there are plenty of tracks, they are an example of quantity over quality. Most are short (<5 minutes) and have rather bland environments.\n\nAlso, don't get this for multiplayer unless you have friends to play it with since it's mostly dead.\n\ntl;dr\n\nIf you just want to sit back with a controller (or whatever your preference) and have some casual rallying fun, then you should get this on a sale.\n","March 13","true","20.2"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiterabbit01/recommended/354160/","Whiterabbit01","Whiterabbit-uk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiterabbit01/","7727 products in account","Introduction:\n\nI've been playing Rally games since I got a DOS version of Lombard RAC Rally in the late 80's and Championship Rally for the Nintendo back in the early 90's (my sons), and later  Rally Championship 2000,  RalliSport Challenge, all of the Colin McRae rally games through to Dirt 2  as well as the  later Dirt games, and  although not classed as rally games the early  road  racing Need for Speed games, Richard Burns Rally , Sega Rally,  Xpand Rally   plus a few others I've forgotten the names of.   I've   loved most of  them for various reasons and  WRC 5 is no exception.\n\nThe latest iteration of World Rally Championship  v5 is IMO perhaps the best  in the WRC  franchise so far, with decent physics when driving on the various surfaces   such as gravel, snow dirt sand etc.  the sounds, including external  environmental sounds,  hitting various obstacles, the various  'tame' expletives your co driver  shouts  when you  crash or   have a near miss, are not the best, but all go to making  a decent  rally game experience.   For newcomers to rally games there's  a  useful  Rally School  mode and an easy driving styles  mode when playing  solo.\n\n\n\n\n\nModes of Play:\n\n\nSolo Mode:\n\nThere are two main  modes of play, Solo and Multiplayer. Solo is divided into four more modes, 'Quick Stage', where you play just one stage of a rally, or   'Quick Rally' where you can choose to play any one of the rally  meets, including all of the stages. The third  solo mode  is   Career mode, where you play all of the championships  rally meets in a particular order; you can't  select   any rally, you have to play them in order according to the real World Championships, starting with the Monte Carlo Rally, then, you move to the next, i.e. Vodaphone Rally de Portugal etc etc.  Some stages in each rally are repeated but  with different road or environmental  conditions, such as day  and night, clear or icy etc.\n\nIf you wish to start a new career,  you can do so, but it will wipe all progress  from the career you've already started.\n\nThe final solo mode is the  Rally School, a useful tool if you are a novice, or not very confident rallying.    This is divided into five different   sections that initially cover the basics  such as pace notes, detailed angles, different kinds of turns and surfaces, accelerating and stopping on tarmac (the easiest surface to negociate), using the hand brakes etc.  Then there's coping with 2 wheel drive  4 wheel drive (two separate sections for this) and advanced techniques.  at the end of each section you have to put all you've learnt in that section together.  You are not able to skip any part of the  Rally School tutorials and you need to pass a certain standard in each  part to progress to the next.\n\n\nMultiplayer Mode and Leaderboards:\n\nThe multiplayer options include online and offline multiplayer, quick match, online invitation and creating a private or public game.  These modes basically speak for themselves so there's  no need to go into detail.  The offline multiplayer  is  almost like playing single player, in that you race  singly between up to 8 players, each one  playing in turn, whereas with  the online multiplayer option, all players  race together, but  do not interact with each other (i.e, you can see them as Ghosts.  As I'm not primarily a multiplayer enthusiast, I can't expand on this area at this time.  I only like playing  vehicle based games online  with good friends as I'm embarrasingly  dire when it comes to technique and racing in general;  for example, looking at the world rankings for this game  20 hours into  the game being released  I stood at 377th out of 450  players, with a 45 second gap between my times and the leader and that was  just for one complete rally and championship type.  There are   three or four of these included in the game  (JWRC, WRC etc).  I felt like I was going as fast as the road conditions and my vehicle allowed,  yet being beaten by 45 seconds makes me wonder what I'm doing wrong.  Hopefully as I work through the rally school I'll improve somewhat. (fingers crossed). For those who are competitive, there are leader boards that show  overall  rankings for all players,  as well as  friends leader boards.\n\n\nControl Options:\n\nThere are three configurable modes of control; Keyboard, Steering Wheel and Controller.  For any rally game enthusiast, the   Steering Wheel is the  best choice as you have more  'configurable' control over the keyboard,   and is the  most immersive control option;  for example you can  configure acceleration, brake and steering sensitivity with dead zones, whereas the  keyboard has no dead zones. The  Steering Wheel option also includes force feedback, (as does the Controller option) which gives a much greater feel and immersivness to the game, plus  your vehicle is much easier to control  compared to if you used a keyboard.  Unfortunately I've  still not unpacked my Logitech steering wheel, pedals and shifter since we moved house  (must do that soon). I've read that others have been having problems  with their  wheels not being supported.  Hopefully  this will be  addressed  in an update soon.  I found using the X-Box controller was  easier than the keyboard and included basic force feedback. There appears to be six degrees of freedom with this game, at least in some of the camera modes, for example, you can look from side to side, upwards and behind in  chase mode and in  cockpit mode  left and right and upwards.  Unfortunately the track IR hasn't been configured for any of the WTC games, so it's unlikely that we will be seeing  WRC5  Track IR enhanced, Maybe   Naturalpoint (the developers of the track IR system) may be considering  the latest title. The first 3 Dirt titles and some of the earlier Colin McRae as well as most of the other titles I mention at the beginning of this review   all have Track IR enhancements.  If this game gets it, it will add even more immersivness.\n\nThe game also works with the Novint Falcon a force feedback device that gives excellent force feedback, but as the   device was primarily designed for mouse based games and  games with guns, it's not  as easy to control your driving unless you use it in conjuction with the keyboard.\n\n\n\nDriving Styles:\n\nThere are four driving styles to choose from  starting with easy, through to medium, hard and  expert.  I've only played it on easy so far so can't  expand on the differences yet.  I will be updating this  review as and when I continue to play the game as I'm only on the second rally  at the moment.\n\n\n\n\nRepairing your vehicle:\n\n\nYou can configure/tune you car  (in the motor home) for various conditions  to ensure optimal driving.  Skill alone  won't  see you winning every race because if you  haven't set up your car for the right conditions for the stage you are about to enter, you'll find your  vehicle will  damage more readily.  You can only  repair your vehicle between  the main stages in any  rally and   depending on how much damage you have   you are likely  not going to be able to repair everything  because you are only allowed   an amount of time that represents the  time allowed  in the real WRC  championship;  i.e. 45 minutes,  so you need to prioritise  which areas you  repair, for example geras, engine, body work,  brakes, electronics, steering etc.  for those less experienced with   the  more recent rally games (the  last WRC   game and I think the  later dirt games have a similar  repair  process) you can  set repairs to automatic. If you select this the A.I. will repair what it considers the  most urgent  repairs. However, don't  ignore the manual process entirely because   damage can also be dependant on the players  style.\n\n\nIn my last race my electronics ended up being  zero percent viable, so was going to spend some time repairing them, but  I decided to go for the automatic o","October 9, 2015","true","23.8"," 50 of 85 people (59%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","59","50","85","4","9"

The description of this game describes it as "THE racing simulation standard". Well, if that is the case, I'm not so sure how someone came to that opinion.\n\nHere is what I PERSONALLY like and don't like.\n\nPros - WRC Licensing. I love seeing the pros and their cars. Though, I'm not certain the sound effects are spot on. Also, It would be great if there was a better viewpoint inside the car.\n\nCons - Nothing online worked for me. I'd get errors connecting to the server. Another mode told me there were over 100 days till I could play it online. Well, alright, fair enough. I guess you need a following to promote an e-sport. Sadly I'm not sure there will be one.\n\nController Support -\nThis game is limited in what you can  and can't use. Some of the most popular logitech wheels aren't supported, and you can't use multiple inputs in your setup. It doesn't support clutch pedals, so no manual override.\nMy current rallying setup includes a shifter, a wheel, a pro 3 pedal setup, and a separate handbrake. It would not read the input from my handbrake at all - only my wheel as a game controller.\n\nAudio - You'll end up wanting to turn off the co-driver voice - which is about the worst thing I can think to do in a rallying game. It's like a robot that doesn't understand word structure or inflection, just belting out words over and over. It's hard to follow and doesn't sound realistic at all.\n\nThis game is planted firmly in contemporary rally, which is great if you are into it. however, after playing the game with multiple cars and setups I wasn't able to find anything interesting in trying different cars. There were differences, but not anything noteworthy enough to make the game seem fun.\n\nSo that's the big thing for me. If it's not a sim, it should at least be fun. I'd have kept it if it were good at at least one of those things.","October 11, 2015","false","1.2"," 23 of 38 people (61%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","61","23","38","3","0"

Gfx are great of course. Sound is okay. G25 Wheel Force Feedback is average.  My biggest complaint is that there seems to be too much traction even on full simulation mode.  I played a snow run in WRC5 and then switched to Richard Burns Rally and I felt much more comfortable with RBR.  When you floor it out of a turn in the snow there is not a lot of traction, but WRC5 gvies a little bit too much and you are soon fish tailing down the road as it tries to pull you into the ditch.\nThe interface is really cool and looks good.  Easy to navigate through the menus.\nThere are a lot of stages to run.\nI'm really liking it for the most part and I have played many many rally games in my life. Now at my advanced age, I can still say I play them a lot!\nOverall a great game, I Just think if you switch to "full sim" mode that you should lose a lot of traction and have to slide more into turns...\nOct 22, 2015.\nI keep crashing on the menu screens. Frustrating.\nStill I am really liking the game!\nG25 wheel is working really good and the feedback is nice! I like the tight turns, which is one reason I like this game.\nThe damage to the car is very interesting and the tires keep getting worn down, making it harder to control.  But everything gets beat up and having no brakes is frequent and common.  Many times the car is stuck in 3rd Gear after slamming into something.\nMore soon...\nOct 24.\nJust a quick note that the dust coming off of the tires looks pretty strange. The dust seems to rise to fast...Looks really odd.\n12/23. Got a lot further now that they updated and I am really liking this game! I think one big thing that is "not right" are the particles. I.e. dust and dirt and especially water. It looks really strange. That could be next releases fix: to improve the dust for replays mostly, but people do notice these things.\nQuick note about sound: I like it. I am watching Ogier/Ingrassia 2015 (Guanajuato, Mexico) onboard video right now , and guess what? The engine sounds are VERY similar to WRC5.  So they did a great job on that!\n12/31/2015: I fixed the steering issue I was having. Which was I had it at very low sensitivity, which makes it hard to correct during hairpins.

However, people, who search for rally simulator will not find it here, because this game has quite arcady driving and damage models. That certainly will not appeal to Dirt Rally crowd, but I think people who are not into hardcore racing simulators would enjoy this game: this game has rally school, much less steep learning curve and it can be enjoyed without having a racing wheel. The tradeoff is not that realistic driving.\n\nIs it better than WRC 4? Yes. It runs smoothly at 60 FPS (older game was locked to 30), the graphics seem to be a big improvement over WRC 4. The amount of cars is decent, but less than Dirt Rally offers and classes are limited to WRC, WRC-2 and J-WRC. The price compared to amount of content on offer (comparing to Dirt Rally) is quite high, but if you can get it on sale, it is worth the money.\n\nCons: it suffers from problem WRC 4 had as well: many special stages are on same pieces of road, so amount of unique roads is much smaller than number of stages. The rewind feature seems to be missing from WRC 4, now you just can restart from last checkpoint. Some signs of poor port from consoles to PC: key prompts seems to be bugged out, a lot of times Xbox controller prompts are shonwn for me when I only own a Logitech Driving Force GT, which has PS3 buttons on it.\n\nAs a conclusion I can say if you are into hardcore racing simulators, you own a decent raging wheel, then get Dirt Rally, it is much better game for you. If you are into more arcady and more casual fun, this might be worth it for you.","January 7","true","14.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This is double that found in DiRT Rally, and still more a bit more than the 300 km quoted by Seb Loeb Rally Evo.\n+ enjoyable stage designs, that feel authentic to the region.  reasonable track widths (not extremely wide and unrealistic).  good variation in terrain and turn types and corner combinations.\n- stages are not real world recreations, as featured in DiRT Rally and Seb Loeb Rally Evo.\n- some stages are very (2-3 km) short.  overall average is 5.4 km per stage (longest is 11 km).\n\nOverall Experience\n\nI'm really enjoying my time with WRC 5.  Those who only care about simulations can skip this title.  But if you're someone who is willing to play something a little more casual, you should be able to easily enjoy this experience.  Thing that makes rally awesome is learning new roads/routes... and this game will let you do that at a great volume.  Career mode is interesting enough as you make your climb from Junior, WRC 2, and finally to WRC.","January 26","true","6.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It means something here. I lost my handbrake, my brakes, my gears. Oh ♥♥♥♥.\n- Presentation is really nice.\n- Repairsystem is nice to see.\n- Online challenges etc. just like Dirt Rally.\n- No restarts in expert difficulty\n- Career is nice to see. Working up from J-WRC to WRC 1\n- Female co-driver\n- Triple screen\n\nWhat can WRC5 improve?\n\n- A better speedometer, that also works in head-cam/cockpit\n- Optimizing steering and FFB\n- Physics\n- Rally school\n- Wished the cockpit was better\n- Fov-slider, and seatadjustment\n- Camera must save, etc. Every time you start now you start in chase-mode\n- Narrow roads\n- Longer stages (20+ km and more)\n\nConclusion\n\nI recommend this game. It's a 15 á 20 euro game at finest, so buy it when it's on sale. Kylotonn has really improved this game with 9 patches! To be honest the patches improved the game a lot. Milestone can learn from this. WRC 5 is now a step above Loeb Evo, a lot of steps behind Dirt Rally. So WRC 6 can only be better from now on. Just take a look at Dirt Rally, Some good stuff from Loeb, and all the other good things of other sim-racings games. Good luck\n\nTested with a Thrustmaster TX, T3PA-Pro's, Heusinkveld Seq Shifter.","October 8, 2015","true","24.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vukth/recommended/354160/","vukth","Vukth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vukth/","28 products in account","Same good old WRC...\nI played every WRC game since the series started. As a long-time follower of the series, the same formula that follows each new WRC installment can be again applied to WRC 5. Now, before i get into details, if you are a casual guy that doesn't know anything about rallying, don't play this, or don't expect to be any good. If you're a Richard Burns/rally sim crybaby, go away. This is not a simulation, it's not meant to be, but nor is it a casual game. If you're a NFS driver, you will suck at this.\n\nThe game doesn't offer more than it did before - WRC/WRC-2/J-WRC authentic cars, and relatively well done rallies of this year. They drastically changed some rallies compared to last year's, for better or worse (it comes to personal preferences and taste really). Each rally has 6 stages minimum (3 rallies have 7 of them). Gameplay is slightly more realistic/improved compared to the previous installment, but not very significantly, nor does it need to be in my opinion. What i think that WRC series desperately need is paying a bit more attention to details and possibly putting some more content there. I don't know whether developers of the WRC series are undermanned or lazy, but the game, like others before it, is unpolished in some minor details that can irritate certain fans of rally games. I, for instance, am fan of fast, gravel/dust/snow/ice rallies with tight roads. In short, i am a fan of fast and challenging rallies. And there are challenging rallies in WRC 5, i just don't enjoy most of those like i did with first versions of Rally Mexico, Jordan and Finland (although there's nothing wrong with WRC 5's Mexico and Finland rallies).\n\nWhat annoys me the most about this game? Two things, very minor maybe, but important to me. First: i love dodging rocks and bottlenecks. There are very few bottlenecks in this game, and the little rocks that lie scattered on the edges of roads of Sardegna, Catalunya, Argentina, and Mexico, do not have "hitboxes" at all. Which means you can run over them like nothing happened. Now don't get me wrong, these rocks are small, but they should still pose a discomforting factor if you run over them at speeds of 200 km/h. Second: Penalties. While i'm all for penalties for cutting certain spots too much, several the penalty "spots" became awful penalty traps for making minimal cuts for curves that really logically demand making those small cuts. I'm not talking about cutting a curve 10 meters deep. There are some spots in Rally Mexico and Germany that are completely ridiculous not to cut ~2m deep. You get penalties for that! also for some hairpins, which you don't even cut all that much. Also, car restart suffers from the same problem somewhat. While this all forces you to drive more carefully and precisely, most of the things i did to get penalties and car restarted on stage are completely ridiculous.\n\nContent is again bleak. In order for WRC to become a game that offline people wouldn't get bored with, it needs more content and immersion in career mode. The original WRC had a potentially great extra content: retro rally cars! Especially the 80's and 90's group! These cars were significantly faster than WRC cars today, but were much  harder to control. They would pose a fun challenge in career mode. Maybe make a storyline, you start off as a nobody in local 70's WRC cars' competition. You get spotted by someone and get a shot at J-WRC. And it goes upwards from there. Maybe also make a way to upgrade your cars. In the beginning you get worse contracts in less successful teams, you get a car with a bit lesser stats than the other ones, and upgrade it's elements (breaks, gearbox, steering, suspensions etc) by beating speed challenges for example. That way you make it more competitive, etc. Similar to the old Colin McRae game. There has to be something. Otherwise it just depends on whether you have a buddy to compete with or not. I sure wouldn't buy it if my friend wasn't up for it and didn't ask me, because i did this 4 times over and again. Can't unrecommend it, though, i don't know whether you played WRC's before or not. Also, why don't the brakes show up in the car damage indicator?\n\nPros: slightly improved gameplay and perhaps graphics, possibility of changing weather conditions and periods of day\nCons: same thing over and over.","May 27","true","37.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

When we did a good setting, it's so pleasing to drift like a pro. The exterior view lacks only a slight motion blur but nothing catastrophic. Personally I play in cockpit view, where sensations are the best.\nThe physics of cars is good, we must make its own settings to really enjoy the physics engine working!\n\nOne feels well the differences in surfaces and is often frights of runway excursions when we take too many risks.\nThe pad vibrations are too light but I do not doubt that a quick fix will be made later if the community reports problem.\nRegarding career she joked. If not for the multi it is especially very exhilarating and fun with friends.\n\nConclusion: I was not expecting a lot of WRC 5 knowing he was taken to zero for a small studio Frenchy, but I was wrong! The quality of play is here! I really like driving in Finland, Wales and Sweden etc. The content is really important many special, different sizes of tracks and I can tell you that a special of nine kilometers plays on your nerves: D\nWrc 5 is not free of bugs but I am pleasantly suprised with the quality and the quantity delivered.\n\nTo finish : Keep the good work Kylotonn!

Its an embarassment to the WRC series.\nI sucked it up, and decided to at least get some achievements. In trying to complete them, I have found the online side on a new game is completely dead. I will update more as I go along.\n\n\nDoes not support my wheel. Menu mapping is for a controller.\n\nI am using 3 seperate usbs for my setup.

If I had known it wasn't truly exclusive I would not have got the game from an outside source. I had no intent on using the "Fantasy Car" , but the perks of having exclusive content was my final determining factor.\n\nIf I had not bought the game from an outside source (Greenman) I could ask for a refund. So this car is the reason I am stuck with a broken game.\n\nAll I have wanted more than anything out of rally games is to have a true to life accurate recreation.

There have been small improvements in some areas, but, the fact that they are trying to pass this off as anything other than an arcade handling model is laughable. The game can be so much more. The FFB is stronger, but, makes no effort to give you any "feeling" of what your auto is doing. In Mexico,; there are a lot of turns and such with visable deep rutts, which I purposefully drove through and had no feedback at all and then when the road was smooth I received weird strong vibrations as if I was driving on a rumble strip. The fact that this game is connected to the Official WRC license is a waste in my opinion. It could have and definately SHOULD have been done far better.\n\nEDIT: I have had to change my previous endorsment of this abortion. They have managed to com[letely make the game unplayable for many players, stuttering and frame rate issues that make the game unplayable and we get "future patches to fix stuttering and frame rate issues". So STAY FAR AWAY until they fix it or Loeb comes out.\n\nThis game has a few issues, THE BIGGEST being the pace notes, and it is far from the quality of DIRT Rally. But it is fun. The game has decent graphics if run in DX11 Mode and it has okay FFB. The stages are cool as they are "real" WRC stages and some are pretty long. They do cut and paste a lot just like DIRT but they have all the "Official" WRC Countries. There really is not much feedback from road surfaces, but , if you go off track into the grass or what not - it does give you some feedback for that. It does not have much in the way of surface changes like dirt simulates well, and the little differences in surface will not be sent through the wheel. it doesnt really alter much from the road surfaces even though there are visual clues of uneven road and rutts and the like. It just doesnt feel any different physically.The physics are not by any means "SIM" but they do have a difference in 2 wheel and 4 wheel drive and the weather makes a difference also. It is not gonna be "Game of The Year" but if you can pick it up on sale it is worth the price of admission.  I paid $35 US and think I may have paid a little too much, but, it really is not that bad of a game. Takes some getting used to. The cars seem to behave strange til you dial in the FFB settings and the controller settings. I would recommend this to anyone who is a Rally fan who doesnt expect too much from it. I have DIRT Rally and thats the game i would get if i could only have one of the two, but, if you can get both - it is great fun after you adjust to it. And I am sure they will patch some of the small bugs and optimize it a little more, at least I hope they will.","October 11, 2015","false","61.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","1"

In fact the entire production squad should be executed. Seriously 8 patches in the first month???!!! They should be paying us. Alas the money mongers have convinced juniors mummy and step daddy that consoles are the ♥♥♥♥ instead of just ♥♥♥♥. Hence we have chopped up slimmed down versions of games. Ones that claim 'Simulation' but are in reality little more that tweakable arcade crap. Pretty sure if simulating me going head on into a lovely oak tree at over 160kms would not result in me simply bouncing off. Final thoughts, flashy bells and whistles with a total over dose in hype. 8 patches in the very first month and still has audio/GPU/CPU latency issue making the game intermitently unplayable. You may get 2 out of 5 stages raced without the game going into slow motion mode. Leaderboards and challenges seem somehow hacked as names appear from clans that do not exsist and one such first place position has a time of 0.0.0.033 for the entire rally. Nothing suspect there at all. Its just a bug.\n\nAll in all out of ten I'd give it -3/10 because it simply does not work. Such a hassle to get money back. This is why PC gamers dislike console fools.

Other things to note I've had initial crashes on starting the game then try again and it runs but freezes at times in the loading screens and takes forever to load for me. I7 6700k, MSi Gaming Board, 8gb ddr4 3000mhz, gtx 960 msi graphics, ssd hard drives and the game gives these troubles on this setup unfortunately(Note I've had no crashes on Project Cars or other high end games like Fallout 4, Witcher 3 etc etc on high graphics settings). I wanted to really take part in the world online Rally Tournament. I'm a racing driver it's in my blood to want to be the fastest","May 9","false","0.8"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

It does what we demand, drive into rally and nothing else like in dirt, i hate that. Here, you are in the rally and that's the point. The fun is there, the driving sensation too ... really good.\n\n\nbut i'm a lefthand, and with the paddle, impossible to change the direction control, it stays on the left.\nNo very confortable to use for a lefthand ... we should change the control settings as we wish, it could be better ...\n\ni'll look forward to a patch with that, because I play like a righthand, but i'm not confortable with it ...","December 1, 2015","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Good thing is that you can practise with solo stages or quick rally. Helps a lot to learning to handle of the car(s) and how to set ups works different stages. Thought there's not too many things set up. Mostly suspension, gears and brakes but they really effects to your cars handling. I'm now just beginner with this. Hours and hours practice and still struggle..  If you did like it WRC4 you probaply love this. If you like arcade style driving  don't buy this game.","December 2, 2015","true","23.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They really improved stages and graphics but for 39.99€ is not much since it`s 5th game in series.\nBiggest downside is lack of cars really. 3rd WRC game had all the classes and historical Group B cars, 4th only current ones and this one only WRC, WRC2 and one WRC-J car.\n\nFrom gameplay I have to say as arcadish rally game handling feels nice with wheel and 360 controller. Does it compares with Dirt Rally? No. Dirt Rally is way ahead now. But WRC5 is much better game than Dirt 2 or 3.\nSince like I play as realistic as possible I find it hard to do so without on-screen pacenotes since co-driver says them many times way to late or early and on many stages they are not accurate.\n\nIf this game goes on sale 15€ or less get it.","November 28, 2015","true","23.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Here are some minus and plus I have about this game:\n\nMinus:\n- Frame rate issues depending on hardware specs and game configuration\n- Some levels are lack of graphic details, looking plain\n\nPlus:\n+ Great driving feeling, made me keep playing, surface feeling when you drive\n+ Graphics, there are levels which really look amaizing, you have to play Monte Carlo on heavy snowfall to see why :D\n+ Game modes, career\n\nOverall, I recommend this game if you want to play a racing game. If you are a fan of WRC you can't miss this game.\nNote: as far as I see we could see further patches that will improve gaming experience.

It was going fine as I looked past the awful graphics and questionable physics because i was having a bit of fun. That was until I realized I was winning everything but only by .5 of a second or so. Seemed a bit odd so I did a little test on a Poland stage, I went very slow and got 6.15.4 and the A.I got 6.16.7. Then I put my foot down and managed a 5.57.1 the A.I? 5.58.6. So what is the point of a racing game with scripted AI. I stopped playing as I know I have won all 3 championships just by going slow and not hitting anything.","January 18","false","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, as much as I want to like this game and probably will still play it solely because it represents the WRC championship, it is simply an OK offering that let's you play through the WRC calendar.  Graphics are glitchy and worst of all there are so many things about it that are inconsistent like the damage model for instance.  Could have been so much more.  Play it for the WRC calendar that it represents but don't expect to be blown away by it.  Definite improvement over WRC 4 but still not the full meal deal although certainly entertaining and challenging enough at times.  The recent Dirt Rally is apparently leaps and bounds ahead of anything this can hope to be as well as Sebastien Loeb Evo which is also pretty impressive, and I look forward to playing either of those one the extremely high price tags especially for Sebastien Loeb Evo come down, even more so once they start getting more content.  If the current WRC calendar is what you really want then play this if it comes on sale, otherwise save your pennies for DIRT Rally or Sebastien Loeb Evo!  In short fun but not amazing and more one to pick up in a sale.","December 30, 2015","true","33.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
