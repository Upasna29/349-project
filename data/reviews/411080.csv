The game is like Pac man and the movie The Running Man lol You need to run around blasting all that moves or blast anything in your way. You then collect the orbs White Points , Green Health and Red Rockets.\n\nThe Dev or Devs are still adding and Tweaking it atm but it runs pretty sweet as is. I think for the $0.99 cents price tag this is one you might want to pick up and im sure in time they will add more but if not its fun as is .\n\nSo for the pirce i say pick this up if you are a fan of cheap neat games or what i like to call time killers!","February 14","true","0.5"," 28 of 36 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","28","36","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/411080/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","Showtime 2073 is an odd mix of old school FPS and Pacman. We play as a nameless protagonist as he picks up a certain amount of pellet each round all while being chased by tons of astronaut looking fellows out to beat the crud out of you as the crowd cheers on. No explanations for anything is given, just press enter to start the game and take too long to question just what is going on and you'll get karate chopped into oblivion. You can take up to 5 hits from these human enemies and while not threatening at all on their own they do come in large numbers so it is rather easy to take a hit while distracted on the pellets. Regardless of their numbers you will still have a massive advantage in the form of a laser gun with infinite ammo or recharging. You could literally hold the fire button down from the beginning of the game until the end with no side effects like kick back,overheating or anything you'd expect from an FPS.\n\nWhile the guns and combat do lack any sense of hard hitting impact the human enemies do have ragdoll physics which make it very entertaining to blast through hordes of them. For some reason the developers added a rather absurdly annoying feature that slows the game down after shooting killing an enemy. I honestly thought I was experiencing unusual slowdown as it persisted even when I turned down all the settings but it was in fact a “feature”. With the amount of enemies you'll be shooting down at any given time this slowdown will be active for most of the game which just makes the game feel awkward and sluggish. Along with your trusty gun you'll also have access to 10 rockets for each red pellet you collect. Everything in this game is destructible which is a big plus as you can simply blow up the mazes instead of searching for an exit while the enemies close in on you. Or you can even use it to blow up the cheering crowd that will never seize to amuse me.\n\nAs cool as blowing stuff up is it can also come back to haunt you as you may blow a hole straight through the floor, forget about it and fall to your demise later on if you aren't paying attention. There are no other forms of attacking or weapons so it can get old rather quickly. You can jump rather high though you jump just low enough to not be able to go over walls. I find jumping to be a rather pointless thing to do as enemies can and will treat you like as a volley ball in a inescapable chain. Physics are very floaty while in air and  it is not rare that an attack will send you several feet up into the air and cost you most of your life on landing since there is fall damage. Sprinting is the only time you won't be able to shoot though the time between sprinting and being able to shoot is nearly non-noticeable meaning you can easily blast someone just a few feet in front of you. The focus of this game is not really on the combat but collecting the pellets. No matter how many enemies you take down more will spawn in and you will never have time to stop moving.\n\nNew enemies such as spiders and mechs make there way into the game later on which are not all that threatening. Your main threat in this game will be the electrical fence at the corners of the levels. They kill you so fast that it leaves little time to escape and is the main reason you don't jump as your doomed if an enemy knocks you into it. It is a pretty unnecessary addition honestly and can very easily be mistaken for any other wall. Some from a shock that still damages you but also repulses you away would have been a better implementation for this hazard. The electrical fence is the only hazard in the game so you've only the enemies to worry about if stay away. Some levels have 100 pellets to collect while others are more arena based and requires you to collect only 10 but has an absolute ton of enemies after you. The green pellets that restore your health are usually the ones you'll want to collect only when you must in case you need them later while on a arena map.\n\nOne thing you'll want to change before starting the game is the key bound to closing the game. It is set to the Escape key by default while pausing the game is Tab. The rest of the controls are perfectly fine and work like any other FPS out there. This does feel much more old school than it does like a modern FPS. While you do move slow until sprinting, you can jump rather high,have no iron sights and have a health bar to worry about instead of the usual regenerating health. Shame this game doesn't feature any other modes other than going through the five levels as a simple survival type mode would be a pretty fun addition where you can enjoy the ragdoll physics and destruction without worrying about pellets. A mode such as this would make this a great title to blow off steam. As it is though every time you start the game you'll have to go through all the levels again to reach the mechs, spiders and turrets which can quickly get tiresome. While Showtime 2073 has some rather serious flaws and will get old fast it should be kept in mind that it is priced at two dollars. Go in expecting cheap, mindless fun and you will likely get your moneys worth as you laugh at some poor bloke that fell through a hole right before being falcon punched right down there yourself.","March 28","true","0.7"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","9","11","2","0"

So much potential but ultimately brilliant in its current raw state. You're massively underselling yourself and your product listing it at 79p, MASSIVELY.

Wait, no, that's not right. Oh, yeah - SHOWTIME 2073.\n\nShowtime 2073 without a doubt draws inspiration from the aforementioned yellow dot-gobbler. Armed with what almost feels like a fully automatic version of the flak cannon from Unreal Tournament - you are tasked with collecting a number of round orbs from a maze-like map while assaulted from all angles by robots highly trained in martial arts. Has this caught your interest? It probably should.\n\nGameplay in Showtime 2073 not only looks like Unreal Tournament - it lives and breathes like it too. Running is a little floaty - and the fact that sprinting isn't a persistent feature leaves you constantly having to press and hold shift after each shot or jump. This sounds really nitpicky, but I honestly don't remember a circumstance where I didn't want to be sprinting - so having the default movement speed at sprint level would have been nice here. In addition, jumping was a frustrating affair on occasion. I would find myself trying to jump over portions of wall and getting stuck atop while enemies piled up on either side below. The engine was somehow unable to handle me riding the top of the wall and eventually would choose a direction to roll me off. In addition to some complaints regarding movement - I also wish there was some kind of impact sound or hit marker to show that you landed shots on your targets - but with the hectic movement and need to "spray and pray" to survive, I understand that there isn't really room for this nitpick to be completely satisfied. Lastly, I wish there was an option to disable the frequent slow-mo that comes when you kill enemies in quick succession. After a while, I did get used to it - and there were even some times I felt thankful for it when I was surrounded by enemies.\n\nIn my almost 3 hours with SHOWTIME 2073 to date, I've managed to get to level 5 a couple of times - but I've yet to finish it. The difficulty really ramps up when you hit level 4 and the game doesn't save your progress when you close the application (which is done by pressing the escape key - I learned accidentally). Luckily, deaths only take you back to the beginning of the current level rather than the beginning of the game.\n\nSHOWTIME's soundtrack is wild. It's just a nonstop, body-shakingly loud bass attack throughout. I never got tired of it, but this just isn't music I'd be listening to in my spare time. That said, when my heart was racing - the heavy beat became the perfect track.\n\nVisually, you're not going to feel like you're playing a game you paid sub-$1.00 for. The visuals are crisp and remind me of all of my favorite arena shooters. There aren't a ton of assets used in total. Weapon fire always looks the same and environments don't vary all that much. Still, where it counts, SHOWTIME 2073 delivers. Enemy variety is an excellent way that the developer knew his audience. I counted 5 total enemy types. It doesn't seem like much, but for the price - I honestly expected a single enemy type for every level.\n\nSHOWTIME 2073 did make me want to go back and play Unreal Tournament 2004 again - but most importantly, it made me want to put that off a little while longer so I could stay in the task at hand. This game is so much fun - and I wholly recommend it when you have a spare dollar in your Steam account from selling old trading cards in the market. OK, maybe that's just the story of me finding this hidden gem.\n\nGameplay - 78\nVisuals/Art Style - 73\nAudio - 72\nContent-to-cost at $0.99 - 90\n\nFor what it's worth, I give SHOWTIME 2073 on PC a: 78/100.","February 21","true","5.1"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brian_Colfxire/recommended/411080/","Brian_Colfxire","Brian C. (The Schmaltzy Cynic)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brian_Colfxire/","468 products in account","Normally I would stay away from first-impressions, but until some major content is added in (as well as tweaks to annoying mechanics) I can't recommend you buy this game even at its low price. With some improvements and additional content, SHOWTIME could become the addicting arcade hybrid of Painkiller and Pac-Man it wants to be.\n\nDisclaimer: This is a review copy supplied by the developer to ProGGaming.\n\nAnother Unity Asset Game?\nI know Unity has been heavily criticized for a lot of schlock on Steam when it's not the engine's fault. Nor am I implying that any game that uses bought assets can never make something interesting. However, and this is only speculation, the game does feel like an asset-flipped game. (For example, the cyberpunk enemies combined with the other assets like the spheres and dancing girls.)\n\nThat is the quality I would describe SHOWTIME 2073 overall. Outside of the weird sphere visuals with the rest of the game's visuals, this thought occurred to me when I booted up the game. Also it had a Unity styled launcher with settings like "Graphics: Good, Beautiful, Fantastic."\n\nFor a $1 game that focuses more on its novelty, I don't think the visuals are an issue. My problem is that it doesn't do enough with its gimmick to make something that should otherwise be addicting.\n\nIt Talks the Talk, But Doesn't Waka the Waka\nThe game's general description is that it's Pac-Man with guns. That description is misleading because the game is missing many core mechanics that appeal to those types of gamers.\n\nThe biggest missing feature from Pac-Man is a scoring system. Nor are there extra lives, time-bonuses, or overpowered bonuses to one-up the enemy. Without those arcade-style features, the game feels like dull with its five same levels.\n\nIncluding a scoring-system, even a basic one, would go a long way to make the gameplay more intresting. For example, if the game went for something like Bulletstorm where it focuses on flashy combination of kills it would demand more skill of the player to round up enemies for a massive score. Or if the game took a cue from Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball with its arcade style mode that gave you power-ups--and one life--it would make dying more of a punishment and the score-system more valuable.\n\nSHOWTIME doesn't need to take all its inspiration from Pac-Man. Challenge modes with specific challenges (like with the Binding of Isaac) would also give the game immense replay value. Or maybe the game needs more than one objective to spice it up.\n\nThat aspect of the game is just one area for improvement. The other aspect, an "old school styled FPS", could also use a little more effort too.\n\nWhere's the Bunny Hop?\nPerhaps I'm mistaken that the game is  going for a hybrid of Pac-Man and an old-school FPS, but if the gameplay took a lot more inspiration from old-school FPS conventions it'd make the combat provide a lot more tactical options. The old-school vibe comes from having to pick up health and ammo from the ground like Wolfenstein 3D as well as how you sprint very fast and can jump quite high.\n\nIf the game wasn't going for that route, then it's not a farfetched suggestion to consider for improvement. The tactics/mechanics found in old-school FPSs for health and weapons could be applied here.\n\nFor example, you can launch yourself into the air with rockets--or when enemies hit you--but the health lost is way too high to make that viable. You can't "bunny-hop" to gain momentum to avoid some encounters but you can certainly leap over walls and enemies. Weirdly, the white-orbs do not provide any health bonuses--something I think should be added (only about 1 - 5%) to balance enemies dealing 20% damage with each hit--which would otherwise make them more important to collect.\n\nIt also goes without saying that this game could use a LOT more enemy and weapon variety. But these weapons should be gameplay changers that require a different approach with each weapon (i.e. a shotgun should be used differently than an assault rifle). Enemies should be balanced to suit these new weapons, and maybe various ammo types could be added to make sure players don't spam rockets.\n\nNitpicks\nThe biggest threat in this game is not the mech suits--which I don't know if they can be killed--nor swarms of spiders. It's actually the electrified fence because every attack does 20% damage of health, so you will die in less than 5 seconds if you hug the wall.\n\nThis game could use some procedural generated maps if there will only be five total. Currently, there are only two variants:  Maze-like areas with destructible walls with 100 orbs followed by big open arena with an absurd amount of enemies but only 10 orbs to collect.\n\nWhen you sprint, do not fire your rockets: The rocket will fire from where your gun-model is angled, which can blow open the floor beneath you and you'll fall to your death.\n\nSome various environments would add a lot, even if it's a day-night change of the map that would go a long way.\n\nMore than one background track would also be appreciated.\n\nSpace out the difficulty curve better by adding in more maps to both add more content to the game as well as make the challenge fair. The current difficultly is too unfair as new enemy hordes are just thrown at you:  LV 1, Dudes in Maze; LV 2, Dudes, Mechs and Turrets Arena; LV 3, Dudes, Turrets and Mecs in Maze; Lv 4, Dudes, Mechs, Turrets and Spiders in Arena; and Lv 5 (as far as I could go, all the above in a maze.\n\nA save-and-quit option would be nice.\n\nDon't automatic start levels. The enemy AI will always start ahead of you and it adds to needless deaths. Have a "Press Any Key to continue" screen after showing the level's stats.\n\nVery flat levels with no verticality.\n\nWeapons can get "stuck" firing, which leads to blowing holes all over the place with the rocket.\nCheck Back in A Month or Two for Improvements\nThe developer has stated he will be adding in more content in two week intervals. Although this game is not labeled Early Access, many of the suggestions listed on the "future updates" page and the bare-bone gameplay we have now ultimately make the game feel like you're playing one. Perhaps I'm too optimistic but I think this game will improve down the line.\n\nAs a reminder, a lot of these ideas in this review are suggestions for improvement, They are critical about what the game fails to do with its novelty: A Pac-Man FPS or an objective-based old-school shooter. Unlike some other Survival Crafting #30457 Early Access game, the core gameplay is a solid foundation and it has potential (if it's used properly).","March 3","false","0.7"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","9","17","0","0"

This game was more of just an experimental game, but I still enjoyed trying it out. I thought that the slow motion system was very interesting, along with how the jumping played along. Basically this game is about a guy which can shoot slow motion bullets and also rockets at people, which can jump slowly like in halo, and is trapped inside of a huge maze with a bunch of angry ai's thirsty to stop you and kill you (by kicking you???lol) while you are trying pick up dots like from pack man.

There are no control options whatsoever, so if you play inverted, I've got bad news for you.\nBut on the other hand, it's overall a great game, and plenty of fun. I certainly recommend it. That is, I certainly recommend it unless you play inverted, in which case I certainly recommend you wait for an update.","May 8","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
