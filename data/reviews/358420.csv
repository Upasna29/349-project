It has horrible clunky controls with barely any cohesion to the combo system. You can't control anything in the air or as far as I know, do any special moves, at least easily with these clunky controls.\n\nHowever as an oddity to bring up in a conversation about weird old DOS games, this is certainly a good one along with Tongue of the Fatman and other similar games. If you're looking for a properly good fighting game, go play Mortal Kombat or Street Fighter.","May 17, 2015","false","0.5"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","14","15","2","0"

It's not bad, but it seems unfair when your opponents use ranged attacks like spit or energy balls while you can't do anything like that. At least I haven't found any way to it. It's not mentioned in the controls.\nNormal difficulty seems to be harder than it is, because they use ranged attacks and keep doing the melee attack. You can do the melee attack too, but you have to be close to them and faster than them.\n\nCrashes and the unfair AI ruin it for me.","March 10","false","0.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Of those in the latter category, Xenophage may very well be the hideous, unplayable crown jewel in the Great Crown of Shame.\n\nThis one is way, way beyond so bad it's good territory and shouldn't ever be experienced by anyone ever again. And it seems to know that, lasting five to ten minutes on average before locking up or just crashing.\n\nThrust back into existence by its cruel masters, it rebels against them, tearing itself apart, screaming "I was not meant to be!"\n\nAnd now, having seen things not meant for mortal eyes, I know only madness, and meat.\n\nMEAT\n\nYes. All the world shall soon know.","March 1","false","0.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","3","4","2","0"

I would go as far to say that even Bubsy 3D (where the dev or devs had no idea what they were doing with the engine) had better scenery than  Xenophage.\n\nThe basic gist of the game is very simple: you are fighting against other characters in a row of 5-6 opponents in the so called story mode (assuming this game had any sort of story to begin with than this paper-thin 7 lines excuse of introduction), as well as you can play in free-play or train against a dummy in story mode. Now as much as it wouldnt sound terrible on paper, the excecution is quite disappointing, and I was being very kind: The whole game basically consists of mashing the same buttons over and over again and hoping that the other enemy falls down.  No spectacular attacks or fatalities, this is all you do in the game. Doesnt it sound overly exciting to you?\n\n....yeah, it isnt.\n\nThat is, if the game doesnt decide to just crash on you  by random (and consider yourself  lucky if it does, because no matter how much you scratch the surface, you wont find the game you are looking for)\n\nI didnt had the occasion to try out the other characters yet and see if they handle in any shape or form differently (assuming they even do), but bluntly put,  Im not really sure  I could force myself to ever launch this hideous garbling mess ever again.\n\nI hate to say it but this has to be one of the weakest game from the 3D Realms Anthology, even for nostalgic purposes I wouldnt recommend trying it out, unless you want to play something that will make you wanna throw up  after 5 minutes.","January 9","false","0.2"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"
