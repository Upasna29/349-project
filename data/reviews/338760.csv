Perhaps if I was a huge shooter or retro arcade fan that would mean more, but I'd certainly favour it to Geometry Wars or Hotline Miami - both fine games, but DRMSE just feels better for me.\n\nIt certainly starts as it intends to continue: even the title screen is hyper saturated neon with a deliberate effort to make figuring out what the hell you should do to start the game far more unclear than the norm.\n\nI hated it first time I played it. But I get it now, this is genius.\n\nBecause it isn't the title screen. It's more like the "You died, here's your score, left click to retry" screen. Like Super Meat Boy players failing and rapidly retrying is the norm, it's encouraged, so stopping the neon and synth would be senseless.\nAnd making it less a shock to the eyes and ears would ironically make it far more jarring once the first level starts again.\n\nNothing out of the game feels out of place, oddly everything feels simultaneously hard to accept and like it dovetails together perfectly.\n\nIt throws too much neon and synth at you; once you overcome that adversity and you feel unstoppable; not many games feel this great continually to play. It's perhaps almost an equivalent of getting over the shock of trying tabasco sauce for the first time and later discovering a lifelong love of spicy food.\n\nDeath Ray Manta SE is something special, something glorious.","December 31, 2015","true","2.0"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","82","9","11","4","0"

The graphics are loud and neon, but in a way where you never lose track of what and where everything is. Score-increasing gems vanish quickly, and are always placed as to encourage reckless manoeuvres. Everything is built to encourage fast play and a just-one-more-go attitude.\n\nAnd of course, there are humorous little touches - enemies exploding into words of encouragement, the gloriously synthy soundtrack - that keep things light-hearted even as you get to grips with things. It's a reflex-heavy high-score rush with a friendly face, always there for when you have five minutes or so to kill while waiting for your Important Business E-Mails.\n\nIf you're a fan of Robotron, Geometry Wars or their schools of dual-stick arcade action, the price is right.","September 18, 2015","true","0.6"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","10","13","0","0"

There are no leaderboards and no achievements, meaning you can only compete with yourself! There's also a score cap, which may or may not be your own objective during your time.\n\nThe game has 32 levels, each with a special collectible that adds a point to your score. The levels get progressively harder and more complex, introducing several subtly different enemies to keep things interesting.\nI found it really tough! Even thought each levels lasts only for a few seconds, I took 6+ hours to beat it! Everything dies in one hit, but so do you. You can also shoot the enemies' bullets, destroying them.\n\nThe game is fair, for the most part. I will agree that it can be really frustrating, though! Especially near the end, where I was trying to maximize my score, and got killed after a near perfect attempt... still, it felt really rewarding whenever I beat a new personal record.\n\n\nThe only problem I have with it is how the visuals are very aggressive, at first. The game isn't very clear about its objective either, which, combined with all the flashing colors, will make the first few rounds very very short and disorientating. It almost stopped me from playing.\n... Deciding to give it a go regardless, I certainly don't regret it!\n\nIt's a very small, but focused game with a single purpose, that it does really well! I'd also like to add that it feels great to play with a controller. It's very fluid and certainly has good feedback with the controller's rumble.\n\nIf you're looking for a quick shmup, give it a go.","November 19, 2015","true","7.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

No replays, power-ups, lives, ammo, weapons or anything. The only progression is in the levels, and these just add more mindless monsters each time.\n\nOf course for four bucks I don't really expect much more than that. And it certainly has that "okay, I'm dead...let's play again!!!" feel that old arcade games had. Controls aren't bad (note: controls are a must. It's not even half as fun with keyboard and mouse). But aside from the audio that gets repetitive fast, there is quite a lot of visual cluttering. Navigating between monsters is hard enough as it is but it throws pretty fireworks at you as well.\n\nSo...I wouldn't recommend.

Two sticks, one fish, some flashing lights. Death Ray Manta is, quite definitely, a videogame in the purest sense. Rejigged, rebuilt, remastered for Steam in the year of our Molyneux 2015.\n\nDeath Ray Manta is a short form top down arena shooter where you blow up enemies using colourful laserbeams.

Collect space gems for a bonus and shoot everything else that you can in order to flash lights at yourself. Aim for your own personal high score.

Enemies explode in words of encouragement when they are shot; an uplifting 80's synth music pulses in the background; prompts flash things like "You're brilliant!" and "Strong Fish!  Beautiful Fish!"  in the brief moments between levels.\n\nThe whole thing is reminiscent of a PSX-era shooter like Nitrous Oxide:  Bright, colorful, simple, and innocently weird.\n\nThere are two ways to score a point:  By beating a level, or by collecting aforementioned gems.  The former is obligatory (by defeating all of your opponents) but you only have a few moments to accomplish the latter before they vanish.  The time-sensitivity of gem collecting puts a twist on the gameplay, since you can't just sit around and play defensively, but if you rush to collect a gem before it disappears, you'll expose yourself to colliding with enemies and projectiles--something that is relatively easy to do while navigating the neon chaos of colors and shapes in this game.\n\nThe game may not immediately grab you.  It's incredibly simple--a twin-stick shooter reduced to a few of its most elementary components, which are then thrown at you in the tiniest of bites--but there's a certain allure in its simplicity.  It's a game that can be played for thirty seconds or thirty minutes, with a deceptive difficulty that can stir up a  "one more try" urge every time you fail.","February 12","true","13.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I have reinstalled the game since my scathing review on 9/18, and I'm happy to say that bug is now fixed.\n\nFuthermore, the developer has added an actual menu, so you arn't immediatly thrown into the game. After playing it again with an open mind, I'm happy to say the game is in a much more playable state, and I found myself having quite a bit of fun with it. At this point I would like to formally retract my vote of not recommending this game, and offically say its worth getting.\n\nFor those looking for a current review, the game is basically like Tempest 3000 had a child with Asteroids. The controls are done with wasd and the mouse is used for aiming, which gives you more control then the old school keyboard shooters. The graphics are still a bit too flashy for my tastes, but at least at this point they arn't bothering me as much as before. Overall this is a pretty decent top down shooter.\n\n--------------------------------ORIGONAL REVIEW-----------------------------\n\nThis game is a mess. First of all, when you start the game, it waits about 3 seconds and then puts you into the action, no instructions, just blaring music and seizure inducing colors.\n\nWhen you start to play the game, its awful from purely a gameplay perspective. The controls are simple, move the ship with your wasd keys and aim and shoot with the mouse cursor. The issue lies in the games flashy graphics, obviously inspired by tempest 3000. With so much flashing backgrounds, particle effects, and psychedelic colors, its very difficult to discern whats an enemy and whats part of the background. Not only does that cause eye strain, but that leads you to some very cheap and frustrating deaths.\n\nThe final nail in the coffin comes when you want to stop playing this mess. You hit escape, press the quit key...and are brought back to the menu, where the game starts seconds later. The only way I've found to actually quit this game is to alt tab out and force quit. I know this is an indy game but that is not acceptable even for an alpha release.\n\nIn short, I'm sad to report this game just fails on every level.","September 17, 2015","true","0.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","5"

If you don't believe me, run this game.\n\nIt's a twin stick shooter - gosh, how many of these are now on the market, right? Except DRM is so ridiculously well crafted and balanced, it's hard to explain. Core of the game is made by Rob "OddBob" Fearon, and he's one of the smartest blokes (because he's a Brit, you see) in the industry. In perfect world, every respectable game developer would read his blog[www.merseyremakes.co.uk] on a daily basis, because Rob simply understands fun in games. Rob made the website about retro remakes, when the term was reserved to simple ports of games from ZX Spectrum made in BlitzBasic. Rob also played a lot of Jeff Minter's games. And most importantly, he's been experimenting with the basic idea - an arena shooter - for some years, starting with War Bus, and DRM SE is his final conclusion on the genre.\n\nIt's super easy to get to - move around, shoot baddies, maybe try to grab the timed bonus item for extra point. There's no combos, no grades, no achievements, no unlockables, no unnecessary things - just pure arcade joy. And tons of colors. Seriously, this thing fires neon palettes through my whole house. You move swiftly from level to level, each of the boards taking only seconds to clear, it doesn't matter if you die and need to start over - you're a beatiful fish with lasers in head, and you shouldn't worry about anything. It's a challenge, of course, but one that doesn't try to prove your fingers are made of sausages or something.\n\nDRM SE is great. Play it. It's good. And the music is nice, too.","September 18, 2015","true","0.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bloodcurdlingraccoon/recommended/338760/","bloodcurdlingraccoon","Beaker","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bloodcurdlingraccoon/","97 products in account","I got this game via an Humble Bundle sale. (ergo: I like small Indie games) All other games in that bundle were tiny Indie projects with a low budget and small scope as well, but none of them was this unfinished.\n\nI figured out what I was sipposed to do and what buttons to press by randomly pushing keyboard buttons, however there are no instrucions whatsoever. Talking about controls: I don't see any reason why I should have to fire manually, if there is no reason not to fire. It's just for the sake of holding the left mouse button. A mechanic depending on mouse positioning only (such as in soundoger+) would have sufficed.\n\nAlso a videogame has to feature an options menu. This game has the scope of a tiny mobile game, but most mobile games deliver more than this. I simply don't want to go to Windows Audio Manager to turn down the volume of an application. Not even speaking of resolution, fullscreen/windowed mode, keybindings, etc.\nThe music was quite nice, but even for a neon-glowing art style this game was too flashy. After every stage there are 2 popups in rapid succession that I was never able to read, because they appear and disappear far too quickly.\n\nI have to admit, that I might have taken a deeper look into this than the obligatory 5 minutes if it was a genre that I generally enjoyed more. After all I didn't see any reason to keep playing. the game didn't even tell me the goal or controls.\n\nTLDR: This game is unfinished. It's quite an embarrassment, considering the small scope.","September 28, 2015","false","0.2"," 5 of 16 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","5","16","0","0"
