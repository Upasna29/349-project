But this is one of the most cynical MOBAs out there.  Take League of Legends, and cross it with some of the more obnoxious Facebook games.  Energy mechanics to play specific characters (although you can spend in-game cash to reset them), Farmville mechanics to gather resources necessary to get boosts.\n\nRather than League's runes, masteries, and normal 'Q/W/E/R' levelling, you set up 36 possible levels in their own Rune system -- but those runes have Gacha style randomness, different levels of rarity / effectiveness, and you can combine runes together to level them up to level 5.  These set up the level up bonuses that you get in match -- and their strength also contributes to the normal level up bonuses you get.\n\nAt all steps you're given incentives to pay money -- money can get you double XP towards your characters to increase their stats in a small way, double your rune drops, turn off the green (common, and incredibly weak) drops entirely, and many other things.  While this game is ostensibly free to play...it's incredibly pay to win, as well.  A person who spends money can buy some legendary runes to start off with that are a good headstart, buy the ability to pick up runes more easily, and buy the ability to get their resources faster to level things up.\n\nThe gameplay is fun...but I can't continue to play it with just how horrible the metagame is.  Add to this the fact that the game is mostly popular in Russia and other Asian countries, with no regional servers--so you will almost always be matched with 3 or 4 players that do not speak your language, and it's just not for me anymore.","May 6, 2015","false","435.0"," 232 of 264 people (88%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","88","232","264","11","0"

Too bad this company is being run by incompitent thieves.   Do NOT, and I repeat, do NOT invest any of your money in this game.  Period.  Don't give them a single cent.  I played for a couple of months, spent some money so I could buy some in game items and whatnot.  Then my account gets corrupted.  I report it, and they tell me to create a new account so they can compensate the new account and remove the old one.\n\nI do this and respond with the information for the new account.  They then tell me that they won't fix it this way, and that I'll have to wait for the next patch to see if the next patch fixes my account instead.  Beause apparently they just wanted to not have to do their jobs.  Wait a week for new patch, it fixes nothing.  I tell them it's fixed nothing, and demand that they now actually do their jobs and fix my account.\n\nThey tell me that they'll fix the account, but I'm being rude to them (I told them that the needed to fix my problem rather than waiting to see if someone would do their job for them) and then threatened to ban me and closed the ticket.  I open a NEW ticket because my account still hasn't been compensated.  Explain what happened.  Account banned.\n\nI'm currently investigating what legal action may be taken against the company, but it seems that with the small amount of moneey I've spent it wouldn't be worth all the time and effort that it would take to try to get the money back, and court costs are out.  So you want my advice?  Don't do business with this company and don't play this game.","February 20","false","3.9"," 124 of 129 people (96%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","96","124","129","6","5"

They enter with overleveled characters and stomp the competition with 4 and 5 man premade teams. If you are going to download this game, wait until they fix it first.\n\nEDIT:\nthis game is ONLY good if you play it for as many hours as i did, if you play, play on the overpowered characters (listed by their brokenness Blademaster/Sesha, Witch/Moira, Nox/Vryl, Haka/Daka, Firefox, Cryo, or Jaegar/wolfmaster) because if you don't you'll get stomped and left in the dust. there are some of these heroes just mentioned that are raking in the resources because they are so easy to play, (i played my blademaster with crappy stuff on him and retired him when he was level 12 because i was so bored, seriously, he's immortal after level 13). I still wouldn't recommend this game because the heroes are so underbalanced and there is a definate lack of initiative on balancing the characters. Until the characters are balanced, my recommendation stands, don't play it if you are NEW.\n\nTLDR: don't play it if you're new, you'll get stomped.","January 17, 2014","false","187.5"," 382 of 479 people (80%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","80","382","479","5","25"

I have the opinion that, like LoL and every other game that does this, if you limit core mechanics with currency then it can never be a truly competitive game. Does LoL have competitions and is extremely popular and makes a lot of money? Yes, but McDonalds is extremely popular and makes a lot of money, but I wouldn't call that food.\nIf you want something to be truly competitive and legitimate on a general playerbase level, you can't limit core mechanics to anyone.\nHowever, it adds incentive to grind and play, and some people prefer that.\n\n-Very simple. It may not seem that way at first with the flood of new information, but once you learn the Talent groups and get the gist of things it's a very simple game. Last hitting or being near creep deaths earns resource which you use to buy your abilities and stats, which levels you up.\n_____________________________________________\nNegatives:\n\n-Matchmaking. As a newish player, though a moba veteran, I find myself going against people with max level heroes and full rare or epic talent sets, and even some unique ones, when I myself have new heroes with no bonus stats and standard or uncommon talents. This is akin to a level 1 League player with no runes or masteries fighting level 30 players. It doesn't matter your skill level, or even if you're better than they are, there's just a very heavy disadvantage stat wise from the start. This makes carrying any allies very hard, especially if they feed. Normally you would be able to overcome that, but not with the stat advantage in addition.\n\n-Language barrier. Over my hours on this game, I've run into one other person who wasn't a friend that spoke or understood English. This could be overcome by a translational chat wheel, or other similar device. One type of ping is not enough to communicate, especially when they're often spammed.\n\nAs a side note, after playing this game you will actually be thankful for "that one guy" on your team in Dota or League who you thought was bad.\n\nI'm going to give this game more time and chances. At the very least, it's nice to go to when I don't want to exert myself on more complex mobas.\nUntil they fix the matchmaking however, I can't recommend this game.","October 4, 2014","false","70.4"," 158 of 191 people (83%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","83","158","191","7","12"

Because it makes you grind so much for good talents and you have to get them for all characters your about to play, this leads to huge player level caps in que system.\n\nWhen you have very big difference is in skill cap terms of talents, you need bigger pool of players for the game, because otherwise you end up playing very unbalanced matches all the time = this is what the game is now.\n\nAlso i have to say that the graphics are decent, but not best par with current MOBA competition, there is little to no customization when it comes to graphical setings, no anti-alias and colorblind modes are present.\n\nCastle building can be fun for while, it is certainly thing to hate or love, it lets you actually do something while you in que for the game which is super nice. I have to say hero designs are really bland and they make hardly any effort to be unique or very interesting to play (Invoker, Mina, Lee Sin and Orianna).\n\nI think the game had potential, but i think talent system limits balanced matches, games high skin prices are also to be taken consideration when choosing a moba as well.

That being said, it lacks server stability.  The matching sucks.  For instance they will put one player with legendary gear in a group with all rare gear.  That is like putting one level 30 champion in Legue of Legends with all level 15 champions.  So if the enemy team has one player with a red name and your team has none you just lost the game.  I was fighting one earlier that just stood in place for about 15 sec. while i hit it with every thing I had and when I finally took his health bar down one notch he hit me 3 times and I was dead.  I will keep playing it sometimes in hopes they will fix that but I would not recommend it to anyone who can't accept that when you see that red name in the load screen you are about to waste 10 min. until you can surrender.  Also if you only speak enlish you will not be able to chat with your team and the pings are very limitted the game will only allow you to ping a couple times with a very easily missed sound.  OK maybe I will talk about some of the many other flaws in another reveiw but this one has become quite long winded.  The pay to win aspect is starting to get really bad.

The Action diablo-esque segments are awful, Go on way too long, are repetitive and boring. The storyline is laughable and pointless. Voice acting in this game is just some of the worst I've ever heard in my life. Facebook games and MOBAs were kept seperate all this time for a reason, also.\n\nGo figure the one thing they did okay at was the MOBA part. It's clunky and kind of outdated, but a lot of the abilities and concepts are really unique. The land control aspect is really neat, The spells do different things depending on what type of land you're on, and there's a male and female version of every class, with specific gender interactions for each skill! This all sounds good on paper, but its a mess.  Having to pay to turn a hero from one gender to another, then making gender a mechanic for certain spells was a completely dumb move.\n\nI did, however, have fun with the "scroll maker" in base. You basically play a little puzzle game on varying difficulties, and if you win you get a scroll that you can give to one of your allies on the battlefield. The scrolls do all manner of things from blinding enemies, doing aoe damage, healing, etc. This was a really wierd yet fun concept that I enjoyed.

I played succeeding versions up to 3.7, Danite's Hell, and those that supported game modes such as -aram. I've also been a progression and hardmore raider in WoW and SWTOR. I play League of Legends casually.\n\nNow about Prime World:\n\nThis is a MOBA but it's not just a MOBA.\n\nIt has the grind of an MMO that both casual and hardcore players can enjoy.\n\nCasuals might like the city-building and city-management aspects of the game. You build buildings and order them to produce wood, ore, food, silver, crystals, or gold (cash shop currency). These resources can be used to buy heroes (like LoL champions), buy hero skins, buy talents, upgrade buildings, upgrade talents, send heroes on quests at the tavern, or rest heroes at the inn (heroes need to rest after a match or quest).\n\nCasuals might also like the Zuma-type game in the actual MOBA part of the game. On the 5v5 map, you can have 3 laners, 1 jungler, and 1 playing Zuma, which helps your team maximize everybody's XP gain. When playing Zuma, a successful game rewards you with a one-time consumable scroll that you can send to anyone on your team, including yourself. The spell on the scroll, and the strength of the spell, is something you select before each Zuma game. For instance, you could start the 5v5 match and play Zuma to create a level 1 healing scroll for your jungler, or a level 5 AoE damage scroll for an early lane push.\n\nFinally, for casuals, there is also a PvE map, ranging from easy, medium, hard, to very hard difficulty. And by PvE, I don't mean a "vs AI" game, where you're still in an arena but fighting bot players. This map involves protecting a central location from waves of enemies. There are also side quests throughout the "match", such as escorting an NPC down a lane or defeating all of a specific type of enemy on the map.\n\nHardcore players can enjoy the endgame, because there is quite a grind when you want to pwn with the best in the world. Your city can produce talents, but you are also rewarded talents when you play and especially when you win. Talent rarity is similar to WoW's, where some are junk and others are legendary, going from yellow, green, blue, purple, to orange. Each talent also has five ranks each, and you can, using WoW terms, disenchant all your junk talents in order to enchant your purples and oranges.\n\nEndgame players can also enjoy the theorycrafting that comes with the flexibility of talent and stat builds. Using LoL terms, some heroes can be built for AD or AP (like LoL's Ezreal or Tristana), and some benefit from both (Akali). Most talents give you passive stat upgrades (+7 agility or +2.2 health regeneration), but others give you a usable skill (temporary invulnerability or immobilize enemy or self heal).\n\nI have only three complaints about Prime World.\n\n1) Matchmaking can sometimes fail you horribly (or benefit you immensely), matching up lesser geared/experienced teams against epicced out players. Mind you, bad matchmaking does not always guarantee a loss for the underdog.\n\n2) Disconnects are an issue. On a good day, all my games go smoothly and everybody has good games. On a bad day, half my games turn into 5v4 or 5v3.\n\n3) My biggest complaint is that all players globally play on the same server, and most are Russian, which leads to ZERO communication. The best you can do is to know the game, know every class, have good map awareness, and hope that your team is as good as you are.\n\nBottom line: I love this game now. I would say it's more casual than LoL, where people rage on you for being new and not executing your skillshots or timing your CCs perfectly. But then again, maybe they do rage here in Prime World and I just can't understand the Cyrillic alphabet. :)","October 5, 2014","true","069.4"," 41 of 63 people (65%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","65","41","63","8","0"

Building up your base takes real time, unless you want to spend to build faster. Heroes lose stamina as you use them, and take time to regain it, again, unless you want to spend money to expedite it. Anyone who doesn't dump money into this trainwreck will take weeks to do what a paying player can do in a day.\n\nBeyond the obvious cash grab monetization set up, the gameplay itself is terrible. Balance is horrendous, and matchmaking is so broken it's baffling. No items and character growth could have been interesting, but instead it just makes it so that the team that pulls ahead first steamrolls all game.

First of all this game's matchmaking time is so long theres a  farmvill clone to keep you distracted while you wait for the worst games of your life! Secondly theres a mini-game in one of the maps and its pretty much a maching colours mini game. The sad thing is this generic colour game is SO more fun than the game it self. Furthermore the matchmaking is so and unfair the game is completely broken. This is also a pay to win game because it is technically impossible to buy high end heros to play with unless you can play this sorry exuese of a game for months. I played this game before and i decided to give it another try. When I got into a match no one was speaking english EVERYONE and I MEAN EVERYONE SPOKE RUSSIAN.

Games like this, which rely on players being put on fairly equal footing, stick in leveling+progression almost arbitrarily. Sure your heroes get stronger but you're only ever put onto the playing field with others in your general tier of power, which makes progression much less about empowering your character and more about pigeon-holing you against stronger opponents (the more you play the more competetive+less fun the game becomes).\n\nBasically stay away from this game if you're not a hardcore MOBA player.

It's another MOBA-type of game, similar to famous games like DotA2, LoL and HoN.\n\nIt has a very unique system, where your passive skills are equipable instead of simply having it. Ingame, you buy your skills with your money, instead of items to boost your stats.\n\nAlso you have a "town-like" system, where you can build buildings and get points, which in the end are usable to upgrade and/or get new skills.\n\nThe character selection is rather small and characters can only be unlocked by leveling your account or with real life money.\n\nStory0/0:\n\nGameplay 4/10:\nCharacter-balancing is not handled well, some characters and animations are far too good, while others are terrible. And if you play against someone who has better passives, you probably won't win, because he will at some point outstat you. Also, you can play a "mini-game" to gain experience/money and give free special items to your team members, which is kind of nice. But sadly, even though that the town-system and equipable skills-system are definitly something new, they overall can't fix a broken game.\n\nGraphics 3/10:\nIt's not really good looking, the map looks lifeless and the character-models all look dull and straight out of something between a PS1 and PS2 game.\n\nConclusion:\nIt's not a good game, the cons are overpowering the pros.

I had thought Nival was interested in the Prime World universe and creating an experience across genres, especially when I heard about the Tower Defense game. However, the two games are separate.\n\nUltimately, the city-building aspect never reached a point beyond a simple, boring Farmville-type knockoff that took the place of the usual "daily rewards" system that underwhelming games use these days to coax players to log back in and hopefully score a gold purchase from a player that might otherwise never bothered to log back in.\n\nThe deck system also had a lot of potential, but instead it serves as another vector to drain gold from a player. To be competitive you need rare talents and you need these rare talents to be leveled up. There aren't restrictions on the level of talents you have equipped, but they do increase your characters' rating which may affect match-making. The match-making however, leaves something to desire.\n\nFor English-speaking players it should be noted that a long time ago Nival took down the western servers, so if you solo-queue you will often be matched into a game of 9 Russian-speaking players.\n\nIt's an alternative to League of Legends, I guess.","April 16","false","525.4"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

I like the fact that I get my own castle and to build it all up, not to mention leveling up heroes and getting custom items to them. however when they release a new character... that's where it gets all bad.... either the guy they introduced is to OVER POWERED or just broken. I remember this scorpion guy who could place eggs on the ground. when you killed him he would come out a new from his egg which was far behind the tower.\n\nWell beside this... the game have a reason for you to go afk... in the base there is a board thing which plays like ZUMBA oh damn oh damn it's fun, but if you play ''Zumba'' for to long... your team will rage. the only good reason to play ''Zumba'' is to get these scrolls which you can choose what they will give to which of your allies. I normally give it to the guy who is doing the best.\n\nOh yeah I forgot there is some questing where you play PVE to level up and gear up..... at times your allies will be very stupid.... unless you are premade 5 people which makes it a ton easyer.\n\nEnough said... Do I recommend this game even for all it's broken and OP stuff.... Yes it's an diffrent experince and it's quite fun when you start to win and get powerful yourself.

As I played League of Legends and DotA2 before I was wondering what another MOBA might bring to the table to make me stick with it.\nBut I can tell you: There were things that did.\n\nFirst of all a short overview:\n\n+ Several unique Heros all with their own playstyle\n+ Different game modes\n+ Talent-System\n+ Nice graphics\n+ Castle-System\n+ Easy to learn\n+ Mostly polite and nice gamers around there\n\n- Low playerbase -> therfor sometimes real terrible matchmaking\n- Talent-System (yes it's also negative sometimes, more on that later)\n\n\nAs you might know Prime World is another MOBA title. But there are two things that are making this one really unique. The Talent-System and the Castle-System.\n\nFor the Castle-System: It is nothing spectacular and reminds me of some tycoon style games on facebook. You have your buildings to get some additional Income or Talents. Productions take from 30 Minutes up to 23 hours. But it's fun to organize and manage your castle during your Queue Times.\n\nThe Talent-System is what makes the game unique to play. There is no exp or gold in the matches, only prime. With Prime you can unlock the heros talents which you organize and plan in the castle before even going to the battlefield. This offers you some tactical decision making aswell as the opportunity to play heros in really different ways. Also you can determinate if you want to specialize on something with your hero or be more like an allrounder.\nAfter every match you get some talents. Some of those are more common, some of those are really rare and therfor more powerful.\nFor me it is really fun to play many matches and it's awesome to finally get a much desired Talent after many games. But I guess it can also be really frustrating, especially as the quality of your heros talents also determinates the power of your hero ingame. So if you're exactly on the same skill level like your opponent and even playing the same hero, but he is epic talented and you are only common you will lose. So it takes some time to get heros strong. If you like this talent farming, like me, it's awesome for sure, but if you just want a smooth start in the game without any disadvantages at start you should probably play DotA2 instead.\n\nWhat the game mostly suffers from is its low playerbase. The matchmaking really sucks often because there are just not enough players to make it work.\nAlso when you start playing the game you get Tutorial Quests. One of them is winning 10 pvp games. You have a own Queue for people having this quest pending which would be nice if there just were some more of them. This way new players face terrible queue times (1h+) and most likely quit before even giving the game the chance it deserves for sure. You can get around this by looking for people in the world chat who already finished this quest and ask them to group with you. But this way you get much higher opponents which might not only be frustrating, but also tends to make reaching 10 wins a real pain in the ♥♥♥.\n\nStill I like this MOBA most of all those out there, as it is more about teamwork and tactical decision making than individual skill, like in League or DotA. Hopefully it will at some point get the love it deserves and the playerbase to run smooth. There is so much potential and it is definitely worth a try!","January 6, 2014","true","051.1"," 16 of 30 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","16","30","0","2"

Unfortunately the builds you cannot alter during game. Some people says extra "talents" per stage are used as alternatives (you use 4/6 talents per stage generally speaking), but i feel that you are so locked in during a game, minor changes don't really change a build.\n\nMost of the time i see the teams are extremely lobsided (too low player base probably). Outranking and out talented the other team. Your character names changes based on how strong of talents you get. yellow<green<blue<purple. Think of it this way, if both person at equally skilled, a lvl 28 yellow character is roughly the same stats as a lvl 18 purple character[estimating]. (max lvl is 36). so If your team is all purples and enemies are all yellows, the yellows can barely do anything against team purple (unless team purple is stupid). Early game is defined by player skills (like roughly up to lvl 13 iish). After that the amount of stronger talents your team have vs enemy team usually dictate the game after about lvl 24.\n\nCan't choose your characters after game finds match. Meaning I've been stuck with a game with 2 supports 3 tanks. Not my favorite situations. Granted we couldn't die at all until late game, we didn't have enough pushing power. Enemies just kept split pushing easy and we had no way to stop.\n\nLast hitting is made to be a child's game, you hit a minion, if it dies within the next 1-2 seconds, the money goes to you. (like i hit a minion right before turret hits it, even if i don't kill with that hit, i get full money from killing the minion)\n\nLast bit is voice acting, some of them are really really annoying to listen to. Good thing you can turn off voices though.\n\nGood part is the zuma they put into the game, it is alternative way of getting money. (money = levels in this game). There are many modes of this game, i personally like appocolypse where you kill minion and they turn into a zombie for your team.\n\nOverall i think this game is not bad, but don't get too irratated when match making is bad (sometimes it runs for like 8 min, keep in mind the longer the queue time, the more lobsided teams are usually, i generally requeue at 2 min) Farming for talent is surprisingly addicting.","December 8, 2013","true","231.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Currently it lacks a large community, but it is still in 'Open Beta'.\nThe game has one big flaw in my opinion: The Matchmaking System. It can sometimes matchup a low ranked team with a high ranked team. They've announced that they'll fix the issue in the next update.\nHeroes are fairly balanced, however some rare talent combinations make some heroes much stronger than others.\nI would still call the game balanced, because nothing beats good teamwork.\nThe game has good support, and is updated regularly. Everything (except custom skins) can be unlocked through playing, however there is an option to buy heroes with real money.\nThe castle element to the game is interesting at first, but by the time you're level 25ish, it's basically a waiting screen for your next match.\nThere is a lot of customization for heroes, and the game is very straightforward and easy to learn.","January 6, 2014","true","666.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Besides the usual regular map similar to other games, it brings several other modes, including an Outpost mode where you battle 3x3 on a one lane area, a native land arena, where your abilities are stronger depending on how much land your team owns, a dragon 4x4 fight where you battle mobs towards the middle, fight the dragon then get to fight the other team and a zombie arena where your enemies are turned to zombies allied with you when they die.\nAs a major difference from regular MOBAs, the hero does not need to buy artifacts inside the fighting game, but they get time to arrange their talents before the battle in their town. After each battle you win some talents and you can progress your heroes using these talents creating an unique hero. The player can add abilities to their hero with these talents and alter the stats to their desire. Of course for newer players some suggested stats that a hero usually uses are highlighted so the player can have an idea of what talents they could try.\nBesides this hero fighting game, the game offers a base building mechanic. I shall admit that this isn't extremely polished and could use some work, but the idea is a good one. The base acts as a home for the heroes, where you can produce talents and train your heroes.\n\nThe drawbacks of the game are the lower population playing it and the matchmaking sytem, which, because of lower population, sometimes ends putting players with huge differences of skill in opposite teams.\n\nOverall, the game is fun to play.\n\nEdit: I have found a major turn-off. Heroes are not well balanced against eachother. Some heroes are too strong from start. And because of the skewed matchmaking system, you may end up being matched with people who have both good heroes and some of the best artifacts, which will mean that you'll start losing the game from the start and it progresses it will only become easier for the enemies.","December 21, 2013","true","61.4"," 18 of 36 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","18","36","0","0"

Instead of making linear 6 item builds, the game utilizes a 'Talent' tree, each rank from 1-7 offering 5 appropriate level 'skills'. These 'skills' can be actives, such as actual abilities, or passive boosts, such as regen, chance to hit effects, strength boosts, etc. These skills can be switched out outside of the game for ones you're awarded from games, or craft. They come with raritiest ranging from yellow, to legendary oranges.\n\nThe game mixes a combination of MOBA, rts, and 'MMORPG' elements, sometimes a little inneffectioally. Regardless, its a fun game, and the leveling is loose like Heroes of the Storm, with the ability to craft your own custom hero, essentially, with the classes being more a 'guide' than hard core choice.\n\nPerhaps not as competitive as other MOBAs, one to be enjoyed by more casual or grind-enjoying enthusiasts. The one downside is the lack of NA population, resulting in quite alot of matches with Russians.","January 7, 2015","true","30.2"," 16 of 33 people (48%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","48","16","33","2","0"

I love it because there is so much progression, you are leveling up stuff all the time. You have a castle and a Lord(you) that you level up, buildings in the castle you level, you have champs that you level up, and you level up their gear(called talents), and you can make/join a clan, and level that up. Gameplay is fun, and you have plenty PvE to do. You can do challenge maps for gear, and various bot games. So why hate it at all? PvP. You must understand that it is not balanced, and that doesn't mean it's bad. Right now the game is set to match you up based on your performance, based on wins. However, gear and character level play a huge role in balance. Gear is divided into levels, like World of Warcraft and other games, based on color and stats. Yellow gear, Green, Blue, Purple, Orange, and each piece has different active or passive abilities or stat increases, as well as the ability to boost your overall stats. Your character has a power rating based on gear score, so you may be in all yellow and green gear with a 1200 power score, and have to fight someone in rare and epic gear whose character level may also be higher, and sometimes, your entire team will be lower level and outgeared, even though your ranking may be similar. Each character level lets you put a couple skill points into your character, so you may face the same champ in lane as you, similarly geared, but if the level difference going in is significant, you are weaker. Skill can overcome that, but skill can't overcome both significant level and gear differences. Factor in that you will often have quitters and afkers, and at the moment no way to report them, and you could easily find yourself wanting to punch a hole in the wall.\nBut if you know that is the way it is, and don't expect that just cause you are better skilled but may still lose...a lot, then you will have fun, imo.","December 4, 2013","true","240.5"," 12 of 25 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","12","25","0","0"

Unlike LoL, you do not start out with all of your "rewards" for level up.  So at level one you are at the same playing field as other level 1s.  If you can get the upper hand as a team, then it does not matter that your opposition has better talents.  I just wish we could trade talents amoungst other players as some players keep getting 4 or 5 of the same drop and its the last one you need and it just is not dropping.  At the same time it gives you that ohhhhhh shinny what did I win factor at the end of each match that you won.  You also get to play "sim castle" to help you out.  You can build up some of your towns houses in order to research and get more talents.  they give you several options on how to get better gear.\n\nThe tutorial is very RPG that gets you into the story.  Another thing about the game that is better than LoL is that you can collect plenty of silver rather fast so that you can purchse the higher level chrs.  LoL you have to grind allllllllllll month long sometime just to get enough to purchase the toon.\n\nI also like that fact that it is talent based.  Not going back to the store to buy your items based.  You can level up right out in the field.\n\nThere are two factions and each faction DOES have a few characters that is only avalible for that particualr faction.  I would sugget going to the website first and learning what they are before choosing.  Other wise it will cost real money to switch factions.  If you can get into the community base, then they are helpful and nice.  You will get the jerks like all games,  But.. I love how this game plays out... and yes sometimes the queue can get rather long but I use it to read up on stratigies and really read what each talent does so that I know what talents I should stack in order to get the best output.","December 15, 2013","true","015.1"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","0"

Much more involved than your usual MOBA like LOL or DOTA. I love the extra features like building your own skills through the ones you earn. The more you use a champion the stronger it becomes. I love the castle building outside of the game itself. I love that they have other game modes outside of the 5V5 classic 3 lane fight. I really enjoy the PVE quest things you can do. I love the more RPG esque map where its 4V4 and you need to build up your champ's then take the middle dragon down.\n\nMy only gripes are, MORE PEOPLE NEED TO PLAY THIS GAME! I doesnt take that long for a match and I like how it will just load me up once its ready so I don't have to be worried about missing it but if more people played it would be much quicker. Its new so I am not to worried. The other thing is balancing and matching. Sometimes it feels skill levels are mismatched but this might also stem from my first gripe.

The community is the main highlight for me, with many contests going on, the participation available is great and there is a lot of hands on from the developers, I will often spend more time on the forums than actually playing the game!\nFrom a gameplay perspective, it is particularly enjoyable how levelling up and customisation of each individual is handled.","December 19, 2015","true","322.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","43","3","7","3","0"

Example, I click download game, stupid outside game window pops up (I am not a fan of those) I start downloading updates, then the window closes itself. I re-open and start to download again, and would'nt ya know it happens again. Bad first impression. Like if the game does not want you to play it, then take it as a sign, is what I say. But nope I did not listen to my instinct and kept trying. So I finally get the ♥♥♥♥ downloaded and open game, but it appears as if nothing happens. Then I realize that it is running, but did not have the god damn common courtesy to open for me, nice. So I click and the taskbar icon and it pops up. But the game does not bring me to any kind of main menu or any crazy thing like that, it throws me straight into a tutorial bot match, ok. So I start trying to fimiliarize myself with the controls and the game, wait left click is to move.....WHY? I start clicking around to move and my hero just stands there, then a minute and a half later he starts moving all around the place randomly. Like near where I click but then backwards and fowards and all over the place nowhere near where I clicked. Ok so he has a mind of his own cool. I know it's not my internet connection, cus I never, ever lag and I have fiber optic wiring and also I am in a friggin bot match so should not matter. Only thing left is my Fps is not good, some turtle symbol pops up and says lower graphics setting, ok ......wait there is no way to use options during a match? WOW! SERIOUSLY? So I close game, restart, find graphics setting in my beloved out of game window, lower to minimum, enter back into game, and still dog ♥♥♥♥. My PC is not great, but I can play DayZ on minimum, and other games work perfectly.  So it's in fact the game that sux and not my PC or connection. ♥♥♥♥ THIS GAME!!!! Uninstall worked fine, most functional part of the game. GG","April 1, 2015","false","0.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

But friends or acquaintances are mandatory for Castle developement ( a fun side project if you're into that thing ). Without other players at your level, you are doomed to very few fighting actions, and it is both boring and frustrating as all get out.\nI guess the open border fight is the only Robot combat possibility, so I have been beating my brain to score a win against Robots (the only type of fight a solo Noble can play).  This means I am trying to understand and combine the Heroes' Talents by hit or miss.  There are mini-manuals to explain some of this complication in warfare, but I still cannot figure out how to call up the help document while playing.\nSo my stats as a player are lousy, but there are several gaming forums, and player-created groups, which means I am just slow connecting with people.  Once I know some in my faction...  I think this game qualifies as a good one but with a steep learning curve.  That means hitting player manuals and game-maker documents will complete your beginning training,  Those who hate to read will be at a diadvantage.\nI like the graphics, fighting/magic system, the potential of this dynamic game.  Prime World.  Try it,  You'll like or hate it, but you'll know!

There are so many things in one game. However, I think Prime World Thrones tries to be too many things at once and doesn't integrate it together. I believe they just found a whole bunch of concepts from click-farming, MOBA, MMORPG and city building and just mashed it all up into PW:T. It's horrible.\n\nPROS\n1. Fun Stuff\nThere are mini-games that resembe Zuma, a bubble popping game that has you shooting bubbles to makes combine 3 of a colour on a snake-like trail.\n\n2. Defense maps / Challenges\nHordes of monsters just keep pouring on and you have got to kill them all.\n\n3. Easy unlocking of heroes\nThere are quests you can do in the other mini-games that unlock the heroes. As long as you reach level 36 and have enough silver, you should be able to get all the heroes. However, locking the core mechanic of the game away from players is mostly stupidity on the developer's end.\n\nCONS\n1. Doesn't gel\nAll the mini-games do not gel. How could you have a Zuma game in the middle of a MOBA battle just to produce a scroll? That will mean 1 afk player aiming to build a specific scroll.\n\n2. Pay-to-Win\nYou actually have to rest your hero so that you can use him. His Vigour needs to be restored at a Spa. Not only that, they make you buy things called Talents to upgrade your hero with gold (cash currency). Talents are special skills that you get in-game when you level up during MOBA combat, a wrong combination will make you very weak or very strong.\n\n3. City Builder\nThis begun to get pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ once I started seeing a need to click-farm and build a city. You have to play multiple games in that don't make sense.\n\nYou build a city to produce housing, food, silver, thread, Prime and a spa.\n\nWhat are they trying to do with this?\n\n4. Hero Upgrading\nThere are Mastery points, which are stat points, and Talents that severely imbalance a game. If you play the game till max level and you get enough Master points, your hero's stats will be far superior to another player's. If you get super rare and powerful Talents that you equip on your hero, you will also be imbalanced.\n\n5. Hero Lists\nMirror Image. The same heroes for the Imperium are in Adornia, just with different skins.","January 29, 2015","false","1.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It should've worked, really. If only they did something about the matchmaking. You wait your fair turn to match up with equally leveled players, only to end up in a team of ... that are eons ahead of you level- and gearwise, who doesn't seem to have spent any spare time outside their computer rooms in weeks cause they are just "hardcore to the core". And they always put people down. I play for fun and to spend time with the hubby who loves gaming. I hate seeing other people abused and I can't really take it when I'm on the receiving end either. I often speak up, which is my own fault I suppose. I tossed in the towel at several occations, I tried to inactivate the chat window by having it scrolled all the way up, but that did nothing for the team playing aspect ;-). Finally I abandoned the game, it wasn't worth it. It's a shame when the users are the one thing that ruins a game. I know they struggle with the balance of fast ques vs. equal matchmaking but the problem seemed to get worse rather than better. They also tried to get the community involved with setting up codes of conduct which was a valiant attempt at approaching the issue of abuse. If they'd have block feature, I'd probably still be playing.","February 17, 2014","false","121.0"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

It has a couple of unique modes, however none are groundbreaking whereas they haven't been seen elsewhere.  The talent building is decent and allows you to customize a character.  The castle mode is a joke; it's literally a waste and the game would be so much better without it.  Lastly, the matchmaking in the game is a complete joke.  If you think LoL was bad, the MM in this game makes it look flawless.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/brassherald/recommended/235340/","brassherald","Brassherald","http://steamcommunity.com/id/brassherald/","165 products in account","This game is terrible. It starts out with a tutorial where, the first thing you will notice is that you have a sluggish character. For this period of time, you spend the time with a lightning character using abilities ripped and mismatched from all the other MOBAs you can think of. During this game, you are given the opportunity to play a game like Bust a Move and Centipede combined for 2 minutes to get a scroll that may or may not help your team. This may be the most enjoyable part of this game, which is not saying much because the rest feels like a chore to play. I can only assume that in a live game, during the time spent playing the minigame that resembles fun, your team would be upset, but I can't tell because the online matchmaking seems to be broken.\n\nAfter you finish your slow crawl to beating the bots, you get put into a kingdom which puts all the fin of the mobile games that try to get you to pay money to accelerate things into the middle of your MOBA. During this time, you need to do things like level up your kingdom so you can buy heroes using the same currency that you also use to have the privilege of continuing to have your current heroes at full power. You can also set your buildings to create materials that are used solely to make more buildings which create more materials, sometimes skills, and heal your heroes. You have missions at this point, but, again, good luck getting matchmaking to work.\n\nThis game is terrible. Don't play it, if you want to play MOBAs on steam, DOTA2 is free and has the mobile game section removed. The Bust a Move minigame is also gone, but I'm sure you can find that somewhere online if you really want that game. In short, play DOTA, League, Dawngate, Strife, Smite, Heroes of Newerth, whatever you want, just do not bother with this game.","July 3, 2014","false","1.5"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

If you put that fact aside, it begins to get interesting - the game throws at you its two parts. Your castle (a base from which you manage battles, quests, building commands,...) and the battlefield itself, which changes depending on what mode you want to play - a pvp? Co-op? Pvp co-op? The game has it all. AND if its not difficult enough for you, you can alwys raise up the difficulty on the co-ops. The more you play each hero, the better it gets. Ability system is absolutely different from any other moba - you collect items which work as your hero´s abilities - sure some heroes are limited to some abilities, but by destroying other items you can upgrade the one you chose (making it VERY effective by the time you get to know what to do with it, and mainly when to activate it)\n\n11/10, would DotA again.","May 21, 2015","true","43.0"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

Nice graphics, a couple of interesting ideas, simple gameplay. If you are a guru pillboxes - you have nothing to do here. The game is perfect for those who want to play without too much straining at your pleasure. This does not mean that there can play carelessly, but it is not as high level as a pillbox or other LoL'y and HoN'y.\nUPD. The farther into the forest, the more wood. Alas, but the project makes no headway (in spite of the new modes) because the most important and key points are not addressed. Awful curve MM (aka balancer) and the dubious quality of the servers (there are frequent departures of players, logs), make the game less comfortable than it could and should have been.\nAnd yes, even though we think that direct Donat gameplay has no effect - it is only at first glance, is an illusion. Without the Golden Age (premium subscription), rely on the collection of high-quality talent is not necessary, drop rate is negligibly low. But even with a premium subscription, random loot is terrible: some talents do not fall months. In such circumstances, it is insulting to see a few players with sharpened at 5 talami and superior power. After all, as the developers did not deny the obvious fact, all the monetization of the game is built around power and Rola it, because it is their talent and quality, the most direct and immediate influence on the combat effectiveness of the hero. Something. how well you take advantage of these opportunities - is another matter and discuss it makes no sense, because that finger to the sky. But at the same time, no matter how good you would not be, if you have nothing to counter the enemy - you lose. It's like the coolest racer in the world to put behind Lada and say "you're a pro, udelali this sucker with a Ferrari ..." It seems to me a very apt analogy and fully transmitting MAT the problem.\nIn fact, we have some interesting solutions to the implementation of the curve.","October 11, 2014","true","67.3"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

Also, the game is not at all any balance, and if there is very weak.\n\nThe game itself can be and interesting than that, but it's a drop in the sea! Too many flaws that do not who do not hurry to fix. should not list them because the game is free, everyone can come and try.

There are more people with high talents, so if you are starting out you will keep losing until you get the purple or orange talent.\n8. The game seems to lack player base, so even if you join a guild nobody will play with you and you are stuck playing with people that speaks Russian language= more losses.\n\nOverall, could have been a good moba game but have bad reputation for many of problems that game has.","October 26, 2013","false","616.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The past review was written as I re installed the game and the reason im re installing is beause the game sent me an email saying im getting a free hero lol and I like free stuff. Oooh and ty for reading this :)\n\nWhen I used to play this game It was fun to me but the only bad things about it was the long queue times and the different languages everyone but thats really all I remember about why I uninstalled it(there couldve been more but there could be a lot more) Something I do remember a lot of was positives :) The reasons why I liked this game so much was because of how different it was from other moba's and how much you could do. It was like a mix of clash of clans without having to upkeep everything and comeback everything and a simpler version of LoL with nice graphics. Overall it was a nice game but I just didnt have enough time for it. Maybe a 7/10~My thoughts of the older versions of this game.\n\nUnder construction yet lol~My thoughts of the newer version of the game.","March 13, 2015","true","20.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I saw this MOBA had just released and decided to give it a whirl, at least for a few bot matches. The RTS aspects of building up your base seem fairly fleshed out and not too terribly pay-to-win as they are pay for convenience. Though I imagine times go up rather exponentially as you play more of the game.\n\nThe Skill systems is rather unique in that, as opposed to having set skills, you equip different skills in a tree of skills and you level up 1-36, picking and choosing which skills you prioritize over others. This lends itself to having no item system for stats as all stats are gained via purchasing of talents. Purchasing talents is as easy as collecting 'Primer' which acts as a universal currency for leveling up or potions/scrolls.\n\nThe Hero variety is actually rather surprising, though both sides are basically carbon copies of each other. There are some unique ideas in some of the hero design in that some have skills that follow your cursor around or there is one that has a pet that you can interchange with at will. The only issue is that unlocking all of these heroes will either take some money upfront or a decent time investment. Skins are actually sort of cool in that they are actual redesigns of the hero, not solely a new set of armor. Like one of the starter Heroes has a male and female skin as well as an Shogun inspired skin that replaces it with a Shogun style person.\n\nGameplay itself is like League of Legends with some Dota spruced in. The combat is heavily League of Legends, while the river is more like Dota with Runes. The items are also more dota like in that you have TP scrolls and potions are a lot less throw away than they are in league due to cost affecting your leveling as well. There are multiple gamemodes, of which I have played the 3v3 and 5v5 models. The Flagpole system is fairly unique in that it allows teleportation via your Teleport skill that is present on all heroes to any region covered by a flagpole you control.\n\nOverall, it's a pretty average MOBA. A good time waster, if nothing else. A solid 7/10.","October 1, 2013","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

So I’ve read). It looked promising but I got stuck when I was forced to play vs AI with AI in my team.\n\nThe AI programming is like this: 1 top,2 mid and 2 bot (probably the meta. -.-‘). You are forced to go mid, because no other bot will give up his lane if you go some were else. And if you go to another lane, mid will get rolled so hard you will lose the game. And what happens when you are lvl 1 “ruler” (whatever it’s called) and you have the noob champ lvl 2? You are close to useless. And how the AI plays? He goes into lane farming, but if he sees an enemy champ he starts attacking and only backs of when he is below 10 %, or he gets killed. Now, this means that he gets rolled easily by you and takes lots of damage from every freaking stuff in the lane. But this is bad for your team, because you will see your mid lane partner getting killed stupidly or getting low hp in 5 secs and returns to base, then comes to lane and in 5 secs he comes back to base, then comes to lane and gets low hp or dies again and again. You have a bad champ vs OP champs that focus you, you can get some kills, but you have to return to heal some times, and here you lose all mid lane towers. Now, what happens when you have them almost destroying your last structure -> no other lane helps defending. You are vs 2 fed OP champs and with only 1 team mate that is stupid, has close to zero cs, low lvl and he continues to go balls deep vs 2 alone, feeding even more.\n\nNow the farmvile mechanic on the castle is not for me. It’s not rewarding having to sit in your thumb waiting for resources.\n\nI have heard that the MM is awefull, making you go against higher lvl players that will roll you any time any day because they have better talents and champs than you. You don’t have a shop were you have access to the same gear to deal dmg has everyone else. You have to upgrade and buy stuff off game so you can be better in game. How easily rolled can you get by this mechanic, omg. Everyone will beat you easily, because even if they have the same champ as you, they will have better talents and will faceroll you easily.\n\nits hard to get a pvp game or help because no one is playing this crap    -.-'\n\nToxic community and bot program users. Will you have fun? NNNNNNOOOOOOOOOO. Period.\n\nLike I’ve said, the game has potential but it doesn’t work at all.","January 3, 2014","false","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Девушки выступают в роли целительниц, хранительниц и вдохновительниц, а суровые мужи привычно расправляются с врагами на передовой. Причем чем успешнее сражаются воины, тем больше полезных способностей появляется у их спутниц и наоборот. Таким образом, игрокам предоставляется возможность не только объединить усилия, но также познакомиться и пообщаться друг с другом, подыскивая напарников и напарниц во время матча.\nГеймплей соответствующий – азартный, но изрядно опостылевший. Команда вооруженных героев иллюстрирует броуновское движение, хаотично перемещаясь по игровой карте. Они раздают тумаков вражеским войскам, берут ключевые точки (некоторые способности работают лучше на «своей» территории), жалят сторожевые башни, возможно даже, жгут деревни и проделывают непристойные вещи с гусями – до тех пор, пока не осознают, что оказавшаяся более слаженной, смышленой и менее падкой на гусей команда противника вовсю штурмует шахту по добыче прайма.\nПоясним. Для развития героя в той же DotA важно было регулярно наведываться в игровую лавку, оставляя незримым продавцам горы золота в обмен на доспехи и свитки. На полках аналогичных магазинчиков из Prime World стоят разве что нехитрые зелья, да свиток перемещения, что поначалу вводит в небольшой ступор.","November 2, 2013","true",""," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What it really feels like is one of those Facebook Social games you play, where you build a castle and everything has a timer on it for an hour or few days. You can spend real life currency to speed these things up, unlock heroes or use in game points to unlock stuff. Is it fun? I honestly can't tell you, because it made me play a good five tutorials and I wasn't even starting on playing with other players.\n\nNo hero has an ultimate, just a set of abilities which is somewhat discouraging. To me, ultimates are the game changer that add that fluff to the delicious center of a moba game. If you like social facebook like games and then this might be your game. Otherwise, I can't really recommend it since it's still iffy for me, but it might be fun for you.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/amancham/recommended/235340/","amancham","Amancham","http://steamcommunity.com/id/amancham/","527 products in account","At first glance the game looks promising. A wide variety of talents to assign to your hero and with that a Flametail can be very different from another Flametail, they don't even have to look the same. Despite all the negative reviews I decided to download and give it a shot ... but will uninstall now.\n\nBase line is: If you are new to MOBA ... don't even try. If you don't want to spend a lot of money ... don't play THIS game. If you're not good in English (or Russian) ... don't try this one. If you are easily fed up and annoyed with your fellow players ... really, do everyone a favour and don't strain your nerves on this one, cause the matchmaking is useless and you will get fed up and angry.\n\nTo make it more detailed:\n\nThere is good stuff, don't get me wrong. I do like the many different heroes, the look of the game, the varieties of talents and I even like the castle and building it all, earning silver, silk and other ressources to improve your castle. I quite enjoyed the PvE aspect (yes, I know, it's a MOBA and not a single-player RPG or god knows what ^^) as it helps to get to know your hero and the way the game is played.\nHowever. Once you have the first PvP quests the fun is over. The matchmaking is indeed catastrophic. I never had to wait long, but honestly I'd prefer to wait some more rather than being matched up against a bunch of players that have high ranking heroes with great talents while I'm having a yellow, basic hero with mainly crappy talents. There is no kick- or vote-off-the-team-option for AFK players and there is a great deal of people who either tab out of the game and forget they entered the queue or who only need a win for a quest and decide to let the others do the work and let the programme run while they go do something else.\nSo you are one or two men down already and matched up against an active 5-player-team with at least one monster hero on their side. Perfect recipe for fed up players and for rudeness. The verbal abuse this community is producing, cursing, shouting, screaming at the 'noobs' is seriously discouraging. Usually they are experienced players levelling up a lower character and having better talents than someone who just started and yes, they are fed up for good reason but it's not the noobs fault - and I'm including myself - that the matchmaking in the game is so bad. If it's your second or third match you make mistakes and you act stupid simply because you don't know any better. And the rudeness level goes from 0 to 100 within the first death in the own ranks no matter who died. Seen that many times, unfortunately.\n\nOf course you can enhance your chances and game experience a lot. You just need to spend enough money on gold to buy the best heroes and talents real money can buy. Of course a F2P game needs some sort of revenue to survive but this way the game is extremely unbalanced.\n\nThere is also little in terms of introduction to the different styles of heroes and such. They have different strengths and weaknesses, but that's for you to figure out (or read up on. I'm sure there's a ton of guides) but if you're not someone who wants to read up for ages before even attempting to play, you're pretty much lost.\n\nAnyway, there's some good ideas behind this, but as it stands at the moment, I would not recommend it to anyone and I deleted the game now. Shame, really, but I play to have fun and not read people shouting and coursing at each other in the worst way ever (and the mature language filter is not helping, either).","February 23, 2014","false","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So I’ve read). It looked promising but I got stuck when I was forced to play vs AI with AI in my team.\n\nThe AI programming is like this: 1 top,2 mid and 2 bot (probably the meta. -.-‘). You are forced to go mid, because no other bot will give up his lane if you go some were else. And if you go to another lane, mid will get rolled so hard you will lose the game. And what happens when you are lvl 1 “ruler” (whatever it’s called) and you have the noob champ lvl 2? You are close to useless. And how the AI plays? He goes into lane farming, but if he sees an enemy champ he starts attacking and only backs of when he is below 10 %, or he gets killed. Now, this means that he gets rolled easily by you and takes lots of damage from every freaking stuff in the lane. But this is bad for your team, because you will see your mid lane partner getting killed stupidly or getting low hp in 5 secs and returns to base, then comes to lane and in 5 secs he comes back to base, then comes to lane and gets low hp or dies again and again. You have a bad champ vs OP champs that focus you, you can get some kills, but you have to return to heal some times, and here you lose all mid lane towers. Now, what happens when you have them almost destroying your last structure -> no other lane helps defending. You are vs 2 fed OP champs and with only 1 team mate that is stupid, has close to zero cs, low lvl and he continues to go balls deep vs 2 alone, feeding even more.\n\nNow the farmvile mechanic on the castle is not for me. It’s not rewarding having to sit in your thumb waiting for resources.\n\nI have heard that the MM is awefull, making you go against higher lvl players that will roll you any time any day because they have better talents and champs than you. You don’t have a shop were you have access to the same gear to deal dmg has everyone else. You have to upgrade and buy stuff off game so you can be better in game. How easily rolled can you get by this mechanic, omg. Everyone will beat you easily, because even if they have the same champ as you, they will have better talents and will faceroll you easily.\n\nits hard to get a pvp game or help because no one is playing this crap    -.-'\n\nToxic community and bot program users. Will you have fun? NNNNNNOOOOOOOOOO. Period.\n\nLike I’ve said, the game has potential but it doesn’t work at all.","January 3, 2014","false","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Девушки выступают в роли целительниц, хранительниц и вдохновительниц, а суровые мужи привычно расправляются с врагами на передовой. Причем чем успешнее сражаются воины, тем больше полезных способностей появляется у их спутниц и наоборот. Таким образом, игрокам предоставляется возможность не только объединить усилия, но также познакомиться и пообщаться друг с другом, подыскивая напарников и напарниц во время матча.\nГеймплей соответствующий – азартный, но изрядно опостылевший. Команда вооруженных героев иллюстрирует броуновское движение, хаотично перемещаясь по игровой карте. Они раздают тумаков вражеским войскам, берут ключевые точки (некоторые способности работают лучше на «своей» территории), жалят сторожевые башни, возможно даже, жгут деревни и проделывают непристойные вещи с гусями – до тех пор, пока не осознают, что оказавшаяся более слаженной, смышленой и менее падкой на гусей команда противника вовсю штурмует шахту по добыче прайма.\nПоясним. Для развития героя в той же DotA важно было регулярно наведываться в игровую лавку, оставляя незримым продавцам горы золота в обмен на доспехи и свитки. На полках аналогичных магазинчиков из Prime World стоят разве что нехитрые зелья, да свиток перемещения, что поначалу вводит в небольшой ступор.","November 2, 2013","true",""," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I saw this MOBA had just released and decided to give it a whirl, at least for a few bot matches. The RTS aspects of building up your base seem fairly fleshed out and not too terribly pay-to-win as they are pay for convenience. Though I imagine times go up rather exponentially as you play more of the game.\n\nThe Skill systems is rather unique in that, as opposed to having set skills, you equip different skills in a tree of skills and you level up 1-36, picking and choosing which skills you prioritize over others. This lends itself to having no item system for stats as all stats are gained via purchasing of talents. Purchasing talents is as easy as collecting 'Primer' which acts as a universal currency for leveling up or potions/scrolls.\n\nThe Hero variety is actually rather surprising, though both sides are basically carbon copies of each other. There are some unique ideas in some of the hero design in that some have skills that follow your cursor around or there is one that has a pet that you can interchange with at will. The only issue is that unlocking all of these heroes will either take some money upfront or a decent time investment. Skins are actually sort of cool in that they are actual redesigns of the hero, not solely a new set of armor. Like one of the starter Heroes has a male and female skin as well as an Shogun inspired skin that replaces it with a Shogun style person.\n\nGameplay itself is like League of Legends with some Dota spruced in. The combat is heavily League of Legends, while the river is more like Dota with Runes. The items are also more dota like in that you have TP scrolls and potions are a lot less throw away than they are in league due to cost affecting your leveling as well. There are multiple gamemodes, of which I have played the 3v3 and 5v5 models. The Flagpole system is fairly unique in that it allows teleportation via your Teleport skill that is present on all heroes to any region covered by a flagpole you control.\n\nOverall, it's a pretty average MOBA. A good time waster, if nothing else. A solid 7/10.","October 1, 2013","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

It was like a mix of clash of clans without having to upkeep everything and comeback everything and a simpler version of LoL with nice graphics. Overall it was a nice game but I just didnt have enough time for it.

But if you still wanna dive in, prepare for a world of frustrations just ahead.\n\nThe only good thing Nival does is to convince (non-Russian) players that any problem that occurs is the players' own faults. A simple in-game example of a warning would be: "You have been disconnected due to your system LOW performance". Sheesh, what are they even talking about, i play other offline and online games, with WAY more demanding graphics than this poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ excuse of a game ever does, just fine. Such a statement just shows how premature, inept and egocentric the dev is.\n\nDead game GG i'm out.\n\n-----------------------[UPDATE]---------------------------\nI decided to take a break from the game for a year and now i'm just checking back to see if there is any improvement. Well, it so happened that there have been quite a few changes:\n\n+ The issue with Steam profile name has been resolved. My previous ign for the game has been fixed, and my current Steam name does not cause any authorization error any more. It's definitely a good move from dev.\n\n+ The Talents mechanics have got major make-overs. Blue and Purple talents are no longer bound to a hero they are assigned to as compared to previous patches. Now this is a huge improvement because you may now freely experiment with different builds, at least when your heroes are sub-15 in terms of level.\n\n+ A most welcomed added feature is the multiple Talent tabs that allow the switching of different builds for a particular hero. It's super convenient to have this feature as it saves time to choose from different roles out of one hero, especially when you are playing in a team. Very good move from dev indeed.\n\n0 The Orange talents, however, are still bound to hero. This reflects the pay-for-convenience element lingering in the game. I would not say this is a bad feature because it makes you really think about what goes into a good build, which should be quite intuitive to veterans of the game. Still, i don't personally like the fact that i need to use the premium currency to unassign Orange talents.\n\n- No server/bridge server for East Asia/SEA regions. The persistent problem here is high ping and even dropped connection. As far as i am aware this problem has not been solved. Maybe Nival doesn't really consider SEA or China to be a market? This issue really perplexes me, yet i can't do anything about it.\n\n*The bottom line: It's nice to see many improvements to the Talents mechanics. BUT, i think Nival has done this a little too late. It should have been implemented way way earlier, when new players are still excited about the new game. Let us be reminded here, that PW still has a very unique and nice touch to its gameplay vs. other MOBAs. I would love to see how the future will turn out for the game. So if i were you i would give it a chance, and a new try.\n\n-------------------ORIGINAL REVIEW--------------------------\nYeah i would recommend this game, but it should be played from a separate client. Somehow the publisher charge you for changing your IGN (we Steam-users do this every so often) so it's kind of a very annoying thing when you have to switch back to your original IGN just to play this game (otherwise you get authorization error).\n\nTo the main thing. If you have read many reviews about this game, and even better, if you have PLAYED it, you know about the Talents system. I'm only pointing out one thing that would immediately invalidate the way Nival is operating the system right now: paying real money to unassign talents. Here comes the pay-to-be-able-to-play nature of the game (nope it's not even pay-to-win any more, mind you):\n\n- When a talent is put on a hero, it is assigned (or "bound") to that hero. Only he/she can use the talent.\n\n- For purple and orange talents (Epic and Exclusive talents AKA your essentials for higher ELO matches) you will need to pay a certain amount of gold (the in-game currency bought by real money) to "unassign" ("unbind") the talent. Ofc, Orange is rarer than purple so you will need to pay more to unassign.\n\n- The limitation of this is that players cannot freely experiment with new builds. Sure they provide you with this "Talent Calculator" app to see how the different combinations of Talents affect your heroes' attributes; however, once you assign the talents to the heroes, talents stay there unless you pay up to unassign them.\n\n- Which brings you to the question of whether this game is a MOBA or not. I don't believe in pay-to-win MOBA because MOBA is about fair competition: skill and skill alone should determine the outcome of matches.\n\n- WHAT IS WORSE about this "pay-to-unassign" system is that every time a new patch comes out (obviously with "re-balancing" fixes to heroes, item shop, environmental mechanics, etc...), veteran players who have quite an established playstyle (and sets of talents for their heroes) are likely to be FORCED to swap in/swap out purple/orange talents to suit the new meta brought about by the new patch. Consequently, they are PAYING real money just to be able to continue playing the game, thereby making them cows for Nival to milk. Forcefully so, let me emphasize.\n\n- Admittedly, there are workarounds to these changes in meta which do not require you to pay gold. However, they are all very tedious methods which will require certain trade-offs. Play the game for a while and you will understand what i'm saying.\n\nThe bottom line: This game is worth a shot, but if you are coming in with an "everything-is-free" mindset then you are in for a hard time. And did i forget to mention high ping issue with this game? Somehow high ping, disconnection and reconnect issues really plague the game as of the moment. I can only hope Nival will do something about it.","February 5, 2015","true","419.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
