Re-brand and Re-market it. It needs to BE SEEN BY THE LARGE SCALE MOBA COMMUNITY! It is a game of true player skill reminiscent of Oldschool WoW arenas with actual pvp balance. Gems and other in game items only add very small variables to the true playing experience. Overall this game has the potential to be the number 1 E-Sport game as it is the most fast paced and exhilarating (no idea how people can play Dota or LoL, personally I can't do 45minute matches as I have responsibilities and it would take too long to master the game) but in terms of BLC You can learn at your own pace like first person shooters because games are quick matches and usually always intense. The reason people don't like BLC is because its TOO DAMN HARD for them. This is where Funcom needs to learn how to create A SIMPLE matchmaking system that incorporates rank. They overcomplicated their entire ranking system and it was ♥♥♥♥in stupid. anyway, now theres no players adn it ill soon phase out unless they REMAKE and REMARKET this game In todays MOBA friendly environment. no one knows about this hidden gem now :(","April 8, 2014","true","21.2"," 78 of 86 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","78","86","0","0"

Biggest thing I have to stress is that while BLC may look like another "Moba" (Dota2/League of Legends), it its essence and spirit it's a lot closer to fighting games or even fast paced first-person-shooters like Quake or Unreal Tournament. Yes, you've heard that right. That's a very important distinction which a lot of people don't realize. Unlike "Mobas" you don't need to have a huge collection of top tier heroes at your disposal, some of the best players in the game mastered 1 or 2 bloodlines and play them exclusively, similarly to fighting games.\n\nFor this reason the game certainly isn't for everyone, there's very little downtime where you can casually stroll back to your lane while considering which item you should buy next, there's no mana so you never run out of things to do in the middle of the battle. You don't level up - you have full arsenal of abilities (that's more than twice as big compared to "Mobas" AND are all skillshots) at your disposal from the first second you enter the arena (with an exception of energy that allows you to cast your ultimate and EX abilities and is gained by hitting your opponents). Reflexes/mind-games/ability to coordinate with your teammates in the matter of seconds is far more important than theorycrafting.\n\nEvery single ability is a skillshot and that applies even to your basic attacks AND heals. That means that it's possible to miss even your basic melee attacks if you don't position yourself correctly or anticipate your opponent's movements. Each bloodline has the basic attack that has no cooldown (in the case of the healers, they also have a ranged healing ability with no CD as well) + 5 other skills + Ultimate + 2 variations of other abilities (called EX abilities which cost energy). That's a lot of stuff to do, at all times.\n\nThe amount of control you have over your bloodline is extremely high, your bloodline is controlled by WASD movement, similarly to FPS games - most bloodlines also have multiple ways to dash/jump/knock opponents away and maneuver around the battlefield, leading to a very fluid and fast-paced gameplay. There's also the fact that you can try to actively dodge your opponent's abilities, creating a huge potential for mind-games.\n\nThere are a lot of cool skills like:\nCounterattacks - for a duration of let's say, 1 second, your bloodline is put into a defensive "trance" and if your opponent hits you while you're in said trance, your bloodline counterattacks in some fashion, teleporting behind their back and applying a debuff or just allowing you to teleport yourself to safety.\nReflects - you can knock opponent's ranged projectiles back at them if timed correctly (though remember, they can dodge them as well, nothing's guaranteed!).\nPulls - ability to grab opposing team's most fragile bloodline and focus it down.\nKnockbacks - ability to push your opponents slightly backwards, cancelling their abilities cast times and repositioning them.\nDodgeable silences called Disables - when hit by such ability, the first ability you use in the period of about 1 second is "silenced" for about 3 seconds - timing these correctly and disabling opponent's critical escape abilities or heals can win you the round. At the same time it means that if you pay attention, you can either wait that 1 second out OR use a less important ability to "eat" the Disable debuff, allowing you to keep up pressure.\nVery important part is that there's VERY little Hard CC like stuns - you won't be locked out for 3 seconds with no chance to do anything while enemy team focuses you to death. Your teammates can always use their defensive abilities like shields on you as well.\n\nBecause every skill is a skillshot, mind-games are extremely important - for example, if you're about to hit your opponent and they use their counterattack, you can cancel your own attack and wait until their counter-attack timer finishes (called trance baiting). If they relied on that counter-attack to survive, they might just die!\n\n\nOverall, while BLC is certainly not for everyone and has a steep learning curve, once you get over it, there's a lot of fun to be had.","January 19, 2015","true","164.0"," 51 of 52 people (98%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","98","51","52","0","3"

A Multiplayer Online Battle Arena in its most strict sense (if not the most traditional), you and your team have one and only objective: surviving the enemy team and slaughtering it.\nBloodline Champions bears a nearly infinite competitive potential that is often sadly overlooked because of the mistakes of its publisher and developer team, which do not seem to invest enough in the stability of this shiny, hidden gem. The community is mostly unusually nice (compared to your average MOBA - you can't expect *everybody* to be nice on the internet, can you?) if somewhat sparse in numbers.\n\nThe peculiarities of the gameplay lie in the total lack of randomly generated numbers, the importance of tactics, the interesting diversity of the characters and last but surely not least, the extreme fast pace of the game, which makes quick decision-making, knowledge of the game and instinct and reflexes key factors to prevail.\n\nIt is worthy of notice how despite it being a free to play, there is no obligement to buy anything in order to be good at it - the progression system can be slightly accelerated at the very start, but due to the extremely skill-based nature of the game, the ephemeral advantages make no considerable part in the winning: this one is most assuredly not a pay to win. Most of the buyable features are merely cosmetical and those that aren't, are always purchasable with the in-game, generously earned currency.\n\nI guarantee you, you have never played anything quite like it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KlayBae/recommended/6370/","KlayBae","darn u 2 heck","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KlayBae/","154 products in account","TL;DR: BLC is an awesome game and you should try it, but it used to be more awesome and I'd like to bring that back with your help.\n\nBLC, BLC, where do I start with you?\nI played this game from very early on, back when the game was brand spanking new and advertised as the one true PvP arena game where only skill mattered. The one game you could pick up and play without having to spend several weeks of grinding for levels or runes/masteries in order to actually start being competitive. In theory, a team of new players who were just completely at home with the game as soon as they started could beat a top competitive team who had played the game religiously half a year in advance.\n\nAnd it was glorious.\n\nOf course such a situation rarely happened. Since skill was all that mattered, veteran players were almost always set to win over newcomers, but it was as it should be. Those moments where I as a relatively new player were able to out-manouver players who were obviously better than me are memorable even to this day. The free Bloodline rotation was satisfactory and the fact that you could try them all out in single player vs bots is something I for my life cannot understand why every single F2P online game has done as well. That particular move is a stroke of genious.\n\nEvery Bloodline feels and plays differently. The only time it feels bad playing a particular Bloodline is when you're being outperformed by another which leads you to wanting to try that one instead. That is the beauty of the game. Nothing stops you from learning every single Bloodline in comfort and privacy against bots. No fees, no need to purchase the Bloodline. This means that if you were willing to put time and effort into learning the Bloodlines in-and-outs, you could prepare yourself to stand an even better chance when playing against real people. And really, Hard mode bots are way more difficult than many players!\n\nThere's practically always been a leveling system. Your level, however, was mostly just a measure of how long you've been playing the game. It had no impact on the game what so ever. What really mattered was your rank, which showed at what skill level you belonged (again, skill was all that mattered as advertised). It's important to note that at this time, it was also advertised that you could obtain most every single thing in the shop, even cosmetic items like skins, weapons and emotes, with the use of Blood Coins as well as Gold Coins, the former being the currency you earn by playing and the latter being the one you purchase with real money. Sure, the Blood Coin prices were discouragingly steep, but it really helped me customizing my one favorite Bloodline (Psychopomp btw) with some cool, non-standard gear and emotes.\nThe only few items that were only purchasable with Gold Coins at this time was things like the Replay system that only very serious and competitive player had any real use for.\n\nEvery single thing with this game, at that time, was geared toward easing newer players into this awesome community and experience. Stunlock knew in their heart that few people would start the process of grinding another game for points, levels, masteries and runes in order to be competitive when they've most likely invested their time heavily in other games. What they did, supplying a theoretically even playing field for new and veteran players alike, was game design ingenuity pure and simple.\n\nFunCom however never had that much faith in the game, and it was horribly undermarketed. This is a story most of us familiar with BLC before Steam know of.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that when Stunlock introduced traits, medallions and masteries into the game, they deviated from their very own core design philosophy. When this new system, trait points unlocked by leveling and heavy Blood Coin investments in crystals and medallions hit Live, they lost a capital h Huge part of the loyal playerbase. The game, suddenly, wasn't new player-friendly anymore. Because when you tried to introduce your friends into the game in this state, all they saw was another huge time sink they had to fill in order to even have a chance. Skill was still central to the gameplay, of course, but the entire sight of the traits and nigh-mandatory medallions that you had to fill was daunting and off-putting. Suddenly, BLC seemed to be on the way of becoming every single other PvP game by mimicking the competition, when its one biggest appeal was its differences from them.\n\n"I'd rather just keep playing League, cba BLC grinding", many of my friends said.\nCombined with the much smaller player base, the Match Making system were acting strangely. There simply weren't enough players so uneven matches like 3 boneys (lowest grade) vs 2 doubleskullies (grade 5) 1 friggin Arbitrator (grade 16) wasn't an uncommon sight. Thus, even the gameplay suffered.\n\nOne would think such an immense community outrage and hit to the entire game's ecosystem would make the developers falling over themselves trying to roll back their newly introduced system. I don't know if FunCom advised them against it or if it was pride messing with them, but the system stayed. Its still there, despite the fact that it single handedly "killed" the game overnight. Well, the release of the Grimrog Bloodline, which was morbidly OP at launch, also played a role of course.\n\nThe release from FunCom made me feel hopeful. Maybe they could finally start moving back toward their roots, I thought.\n\nSure, there are more players now. Probably brought on by the recent media coverage the game's been getting with this step. The level-dependent traits were still there to my disappointment, but I could live with it. I still have my old medallions and gems. I also noted that I have a small size of Blood Coins and a couple of hundred Gold Coins left over. I entered the market place to refresh my mind on what things cost.\n\nWhat met me there turned me off a lot.\nAnother core design philosophy had gone down the grave, the one where you were supposed to be able to earn everything with Blood Coins. Every single cosmetic item have had their Blood Coin price removed and were now only obtainable with Gold Coins, i.e. real money.\n\nThis may not sound like a big deal to those of you who didn't play the game before it was this way, but it really just gives me the impression that Stunlock is in it for the money and wants to do what everyone else is doing and milk the game before it dies off completely. Sure, I guess the system is fair compared to other games, but it really just feels like they're taking their design decisions without feel for what the game has come to symbolize: a realistic alternative game that you can play alongside others without having to spend a huge amount of time in order to start being competitive.\n\nI had absolutely no trouble recruiting friends to this game before the trait and medallion system. When they were bored of playing other games, they'd say "Hey let's fire up BLC", I'd gladly oblige. They didn't hesitate buying Gold Coins (at that time called FunCom Coins I believe...) because it just felt awesome customizing your favorite Bloodline when at the same time feeling you had an alternative if you didn't want to spend the money. That's the exact kind of business plan we all wanted to support.\n\nGameplay? Jesus christ, I love the game, it's lovely in its simplicity, its "easy to learn, hard to master" way. But if you find that you like this game as much as I do and want to spend more time, please, engage yourself in the community at its subreddit (r/bloodlinechampions) and  its forums[blchampions.com]. Stunlock Studios are finally in position to make this game Awesome again. Help us make them understand we want that too. Help us make them understand that we want the even playing field between new and veteran players back.","February 6, 2015","true","7.6"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","13","13","0","0"

It'll ask you to execute pitch perfect combos via your abilities, aim them true (everything's a skillshot), weight in the benefits of your situation and adapt on the fly, coordinate with your team down to the second, and most importantly, learn every little detail about every bloodline in order to best counter it. Barring Quake and CS, you won't find a better title to test yourself as a gamer - BLC will flex absolutely every important gaming muscle of your being and give you the grounds to prove your worth.\n\nIt should be mentioned that as of the last few days the game is now being fully operated by Stunlock Studios - the actual creators of BLC - which is certainly a step up from its previous publishers who were seemingly running it down the ground with poor marketing and cheesy design implementations. Some time ago the progression system was accelerated, the bloodcoing yield increased, and the cost of bloodlines decreased - meaning you can now more easily acquire things in the game, including the much dreaded amulets and gems to slot. The benefits from leveling and statting up were always very marginal, but were the cause for much ire back in the day, for no good reason. Do try to disregard any people saying that the game is ♥♥♥♥ solely because there's a progression system - it is an annoyance at worst and if you're dedicated you won't care for them past setting your own builds.\n\nThe playerbase might not be very large, but it's a very dedicated bunch, which is why you'll often run into people with thousands of games and hours under their belts. During the past few years I haven't played that much myself, but made an effort to log in every once in a while to check out activity, and it's always a pleasure seeing several channels still filled up with players to this day - alongside the weekly tournaments still running with dozens of teams taking part. It's a sad defect of modern gaming communities to declare games as dead based on a seemingly random set of factors like whether they found a game within a minute after queueing up at 4 AM or something of that sort, but I can guarantee you that as far as competitiveness goes, you'll find a very healthy scene, that has miraculously endured through Funcom's mistreatment during the years.\n\nToday, with most regional locks gone, and (hopefully) with Stunlock maybe putting some life back into the game via content updates, I can see BLC emerging back into the mainstream, for as long as people are willing to give it a chance and stick around.","February 1, 2015","true","155.0"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","13","14","3","0"

That's not because I'm new to Steam. It's because this game holds a place in my heart that no game has before or since. And I've played many, many games.\n\nBloodline Champions is the purest PvP game that has ever been. It is so unique in that sense that there is literally no game out there like it. People will compare it to other games using terms like MOBA, which will invariably conjure images of massive maps with jungles, rivers, monsters and all the things that artificially infuse what we have come to think of as MOBA's with their complexity and depth.\n\nBut BLC doesn't need any of that. Its depth comes naturally, as a result of its actual complexity. BLC is what a MOBA should be: an arena in which players do battle--not one in which players level and shop and kill little monsters until they are ready to do battle. There is no avoiding battle in BLC. And when it happens, it's determined entirely by the skill of the player on the keyboard.\n\nThere is a lot to say about BLC. Perhaps, the most important thing to say is that it's a shame that one of the worst game publishers in existence got its hands on what you can tell is the work of a passionate development team. But I'm eccstatic to see what appears to be a revival now that Stunlock has taken it back.\n\nIn the mean time, if you are reading this and thinking about playing Bloodline Champions, this player couldn't possibly give a more sincere endorsement. If you like PvP, you absolutely must try BLC.","February 7, 2015","true","540.3"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

But please, read on:)\n\nWhile I didn't play this game on steam, I did play it the millisecond it was available to play, several years ago.\n\nWithin literally hours of game being released, lvl10 people started bashing on, like, lvl6 people. It was fascinating, to say the least. I have never seen a game brought down in such a quick manner by its own community and with such efficacy. I played bunch of hardcore, "unwelcoming" games, but BLC is the only game that managed to develop a ridiculously antisocial atmosphere within mere hours and to totally devolve into a complete toxic mess in the matter of days. I have yet to see a game that has a player base near BLC's when it came out.\n\nIt usually takes a relatively long time for a game to develop the unwelcoming atmosphere and some don't develop that at all. Usually, the more skill-based game is, the more divisive and aggressive the community will be. But that won't happen until at least a few months after the game's release.\n\nTechnically and mechanically, the game is a masterpiece. I will dare and say that's an objective assessment. The feel of the game, the gameplay, the champions, it's all executed responsively and flawlessly. This game had an unfair fate, because of the bad economic approach and also bad marketing, but nothing rivals the absolutely attrocious player base it somehow managed to acquire in like two days since it was released.\n\nHearing some time ago that the game will come to steam, I hoped that it would finally receive the recognition it deserved. I have yet to install it, but sadly, it seems that the situation is even worse and that its player base will singlehandedly murder it for the second time. I can't understand the notion behind it, but if a game you love and play gets a second chance on a new, popular platform such as steam, it is very counterproductive for you to get defensive and not let people in "your game". For a multiplayer-based game, the ONLY chance is for it to have a healthy and relatively large player base, especially if there's a MM necessary, to provide even matchups.\n\nBut now, browsing through the comments, I see a pattern: unwelcoming community. Regardless of whether the review is positive or negative, this seems to be the only constant new players perceive and isolate in their reviews.\n\nIf this changes, though with the player base fiercely opposing the idea of the game getting new players it certainly doesn't seem it would (but one could hope), I would recommend this game possibly more than any game ever made. This might be an overstatement, but all things considered, BLC is a masterpiece in every way.\nThat said, remembering how it was only hours after the game's release, I actually don't know whether I'll install it or not. It seems that today's situation is only worse, which is hard to imagine.\n\nAll in all - game is superb. Player base, well, isn't - and don't take this lightly. It's not your standard dota, lol, wot etc. notion. We are all used to that. This is something very extraordinary.\n\nSo, basically, I will mark this as a "yes", because the game is fantastic. Would I advise people to play it though? Not really, but you are free to try and see for yourself. This might seem paradoxical, but it's not - if we talk about the game per se, it's wonderful, but it's the only game I've ever played out of thousands of multiplayer games I've played, that can effectively sour the gaming experience of even a full-fledged rhino-skinned lobotomized psychopath.","April 26","true","0.9"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

Every ability, even the standard attacks are skillshots, meaning they are direction-targeted and can miss. The pool of playable characters is diverse and well balanced. Each bloodline looks, feels and plays unique. Same goes for the maps. Games are short and intense. On top of that your account progresses pretty fast allowing frequent unlocks.\n\nThere is only one downside: The game was poorly advertised and shut down for several years before the recent re-release on steam resulting in a small playerbase leading to a sometimes poor matchmaking.\n\nIf you are interested just go ahead and try it. Bloodline Champions is free to play and the installalation is about 400 mb. You won't lose a cent and not much time if you don't like it. For me the game is a great fun and holds an insanely high potential.","February 15, 2015","true","13.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Matches are set in 3v3 format and take usually no more than 5-6 minutes.  There are 4 archetypes of classes, Tanks, Melee, Ranged, and Healers, each with a set of unique characters within them. There are no minions, no farming, just a 3v3 slaughter fest where skill triumphs all. I'm not going to go too deep here, its better for you to experience this thing yourself.\n\nThere are two very large issues with this game. The first, would be the severe latency spikes and or, even total game freezing. I cannot count how many times the game freezes up at clutch points for no reason at all. I can still move my mouse, but the screen is totally unresponsive. Stunlock has not, as of 3/6/15, not given any sort of comment on the matter, which seems to be a lot more common than you would think.\n\nThe largest issue with this game remains to be its playerbase. The playerbase isn't that bad, its the number of players. This game isn't as dead as so many players make it out to be. Nowhere near. You'll still find matches, but theres a good chance you'll be playing against some vets that have been playing for a very long time. If you find yourself getting beat in actual pvp matches, go against the bots.  I can't stress this enough.They're surprisingly well done and are very good for getting the hang of your chosen bloodline.\n\nSo, come, play a few rounds, bring your friends. Revitalize this game. Don't allow the one unique MOBA out there to go off into that silent night.","March 6, 2015","true","29.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/amorphism/recommended/6370/","amorphism","Amorphism","http://steamcommunity.com/id/amorphism/","242 products in account","Short Summary:\nBloodline Champions is an a-typical experiment in the MOBA genre that manage to transcend the overused formula with true innovations and skill based gameplay. Highly recommended to people who wants a different MOBA experience and aren't afraid of investing the time in a hardcore skill-based game. For the casual gamer I would say BLC would pose too much of steep learning curve and a lot of frustration of losing to veteran players.\n\nExtended Review\nBeen playing this game since early beta, clocking hundreds of hours before the integration to steam so I thought I should give a review of what I consider to be one of the best MOBA games out there, which sadly doesn't get the recognition it deserves.\n\nBloodline Champions (BLC) isn't your typical garden variety MOBA, in fact it so different that some people don't consider it a MOBA at all because it isn't stylized after DOTA and its clones, but since MOBA is Multiplayer Arena Battle - BLC fits the bill.\n\nWhat you'll instantly notice is the FPS-driven (top down perspective), WASD movement, mouse-target aiming, heavily skill-based mechanics that aren't to be found in most MOBAs today. A good FPS gamer would have an easier time learning to master the different champions in the game.\n\nThe 2nd quite noticeable thing is the lack of lanes, creeps or a base for that matter - did I mention that this isn't DOTA?! - if you cut all the fat from a DOTA game, leaving it with just the characters, their abilities and how they work together in a team you'll get BLC. This is a clash of your team with the opponents team without anything interfering - no RNG, no creeps, no turrets. It's just kill or be killed. There are no levels or items, so all of the micromanaging (which I hate honestly) in other MOBAs and "best builds" is out of the window - the cards you're dealt comes with your chosen champion and don't change during the match, it's all about knowing how/when to use them (note that there is some customisation to be had outside matches but it has almost zero effect on the actual game).\n\nAll of the above translates to matches that are:\n1) short (3 rounds that lasts 3 minutes max each),\n2) very intensive,\n3) 100% reliant on team-work and knowing how to work with your champions. This reliance on team-work can lead to very frustrative games when even 1 player in your team doesn't know what he's doing. It will affect your odds of winning immensely.\n\nThere is enough variety of champions to fit any style of gameplay - you got your ordinary melee (assassins, self-healing etc'), tanks, range and support (healers) champs. All champions got their own 6 unique abilities (5 regular and 1 ultimate) that serve different goals - space for example, which is used to jump in shooter games, is a maneuverability action, given you speed or blink you to a destination, R key (for most champions) is used for defense or a reactive ability. Champions are very flavorful, in artistic manner and in how their abilities work-together and for that I salute the developers - they are all so fun to play and explore.\n\nSo in conclusion this is obviously a game I highly recommend to most players (with a fair warning to casual players), in an ideal world this game would be played by tens of thousand of gamers and rock the e-sports scene.\n\nPROS\n+ A unique MOBA experience that any MOBA fan should try\n+ Great variety of champions with streamlined interesting abilities\n+ Team-oriented professional players will find a new home with BLC\n\nCONS\n- Very reliant on your team which means very frustrating games when even 1 player is bad\n- Low population of players (not really a con with the game itself) which means you'll see a lot of the same bad players\n- Steep learning curve for casual players will lead to endless frustration when facing veteran players. Not casual friendly!","April 22, 2015","true","56.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It's fun, It's fast-paced and it depends heavily on player's skill, not on gear/level/amounts of money donated. Though at first glance it may seem like another DotA clone, in truth Bloodline Champions share more similarities with classic multiplayer shooters like Quake 3, blending to genres together and attempting a whole new approach to old "hero arena"-type of games.\nThe biggest flaw comes from its obscurity - Bloodline Champions never got aggressive promotion like, for example, League of Legeds, thus game comunity is fairly small and cramped.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fuckiongfag/recommended/6370/","fuckiongfag","Don't talk to me or my wifes son","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fuckiongfag/","5 products in account","Match length in Bloodline Champions is short, relative to other games in the genre. Rather than spending an hour or longer hoping for a game to finally come to an end, matches are often decisively ended within 20 minutes. There are outliers that drag on beyond 40, as evenly matched teams may have trouble managing to end the game against one another, but the game's rapidly scaling death timers generally enable one team to end the competition before that point is reached. Usually, games are over quickly enough that you'll convince yourself you always have time for one more game.\n\nIf you wish to shine individually, you may not enjoy Bloodline Champions; the game is very team-centric, to the point that even experience is shared across an entire team--all players on the same team are the same level during a match. An individual's power to affect a match is limited. Grouping up is essential to winning matches, and attempting any sort of heroic 1-vs.-5 play will likely be met with death. This serves to reduce the amount of rampant toxicity the genre is rather notorious for bringing; most game and chat experiences feature very few instances of nasty epithets, and with cross-team chat disabled outright, there is no opportunity for insulting opponents.\n\nThe environments, animations, and sounds of combat all evoke a mental investment in the action. Animations are simultaneously flashy and elegant, and ability animations feature enough clarity that it's rare to be confused about what killed you. Gunners gun crackles and flashes for each enemy it hits. As Flameman The Flame God leaps into the fray from across the map, a burning fire signals his landing. The comical Ranid Assassin mounts up into its longboat when activating a heroic taunt (unlockable for $10), and he sings a merry tune as he shoots his darts. And the sound of a dead hero (with which you will become very familiar) features a bass "shoomp" to draw just the right amount of satisfaction for each and every kill your team secures.\n\nLeague of Bloodstorm Champions is a must-play for both MOBA players and Blizzard enthusiasts. It avoids stepping into the exact footprints of the games that paved the way for the genre, and delivers a beautifully graceful, unique experience with familiar characters. And should you not fall into either category, it is still a fantastic casual-competitive game that offers untold hours of enjoyment.","November 2, 2015","true","0.5"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","1"

Each player picks a character from one of the following Archetypes: Tank, Meele Damage Dealer, Ranged Damage Dealer and Healer.\nThe players will fight to the death using the 7 Unique Skills each Character possesses.\nWho wins depends only on the Skill of each Player and how good they work together as a Team, since all ranged abilities are Skillshots and its essential to use each Skill in the right Moment and actually hitting one or more enemies.\n\nAnyway this Game is great for anyone intrested in skillbased PvP Arena Gameplay. The only existing Problemis the low Playerbase. But there is Hope because the Playerbase recently seems to have picked up again, after Stunlock Studios took over the Server Hosting from Funcom.\n\nPS: The Free-to-Play Modell is quite fair as well.

It's super fun, the dynamics of the gameplay are still pretty unique, with the exception of XAM that kind of mimic-ed most of the controls and ideas. This game requires high levels of skill and the gaming curve is super high right when you get in (similar to LoL but much harder), but once you master a few characters and get in the hang of it, it's gives you really good gameplay. You play mainly as 3v3 with several different bloodlines and you can upgrade youself slightly out of game with gems and whatnot, but the beauty of the game is that it focuses on the actual teamfights, not farming or solo-laning, which means that each match is usually very fast to finish (maybe 15-30 minutes). The only bad thing about it is the playerbase. NO ONE plays it anymore, which is unfortunate, so Funcom should remarket it and get it on its toes again. But the last time I played was months ago, so the situation might have changed by now.","July 17, 2014","true","1.5"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Think of some maxed out heroes in DotA doing a battle on a small map.\n\nThe huge good difference that this game makes :\nAll the skills and normal attacks are casted on a line, in a AOE attack zone or directly on a character AND there are no chances to stun or to crowd control something - it either happens if you hit or not if you don't - which makes the game 100% player-skill based and also makes it HARD to master at the same time.\n\nWhere the game fails is in the art style chosen for the entire game... In my opinion it isn't very catchy and pleasing to the eye (some kind of dark-tribal-cartoonish slightly unpolished aspect) - I believe this is the game's biggest problem.\n\nIt's a good game for people who like to challenge themselves and test their eye-brain-finger coordination and also for people who like a good fair coop game.\n","January 28, 2015","true","31.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Been playing this game quite alot since it returned. I can highly recommend it. It has everything a good PvP game needs. The idea of bloodline champions is amazing, and inovative. The fact that its balanced and that everything can be calculated is amazing, everything is up to the player. Everything is a skill-shot, there is no random factor in the game. The game has a high skill cap, which allows the player to allways push further, allways adapting new methods and tactics to win a match. You can join a clan, and have fun with people around the world. Making new friends, join up for frendly and casual lobby matches. There is allways game hosted tournements in which you can test your skill vs other players, and get rewards for that. It's important to not give up, when you master the basics and get the hang on, you will fall in love with the game. There is some problems we have, like low player base. It's just becouse low marketing, maybe a bad reputation (funcom im talking to you), and the skill shot system which makes alot of newbs get frustrated and leave the game. Play it then judge it. It's something you need to try. JUST DO IT!","April 26, 2015","true","411.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Very fast & intense.\nI had played it at the very beginning of it's Open Beta (and followed the news from time to time since then), which is obviously a very long time ago, even before Steam release. It had many more players back then, so the matchmaking worked REALLY well, because it was divided into a lot of differnet "divisions" (based on skill) already. Tournaments did already exist in the game client, too! :)\nBut then the playerbase dropped. (I guess most players were just too bad for it's fast, competitive gameplay.)\nI don't even know how many players still play it, I guess very few. Which is a shame because such a low player-pool "breaks" the matchmaking (which had been great before). :(\nI really still hope this game will be re-released or advertised to get the attention it deserves, because in a competitive way this game was way better than ANY other PvP-Arena game, even at the beginning of it's Open Beta already!!

There's no item shop, no "feeding," no pay2win nonsense, it's balanced and perfectly suited for competetive play.\n\nAnd then they added to it. Each character has autoattacks bound to LMB, basic abilities bound to RMB, Q, E, R, movement ability bound to space, ultimate bound to F, and 2 alternate ability variations which can be triggered with a key combo, meaning that each character has essentially 9 abilities at their disposal. The game also has a great atmosphere, with a tribal theme, well represented through both visuals and audio.\n\nOne of the few games that I would say is 10/10. Can't reccomend more. Only downside is the playerbase, but you can always find a game after a couple minutes.","January 29, 2015","true","14.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrsnowman111/recommended/6370/","mrsnowman111","MrSnowman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrsnowman111/","288 products in account","Small summary at bottom.\n\nDo not compare this to HoN, Dota, Dota 2 or LoL. It's nothing like those games, if that's what you're looking for, go play them. It's an arena fighter that's intended to be played 3v3. It has low cooldowns and reaction skills rather than big aoe nukes/targeted abilities.\n\nThe visual style would have to be described as "tribal". It's not technically impressive but there's good design here and everything in the game is clear when you know the effects, similar to most "moba"'s in that way. Bloodline (character) design is focused more on reflecting the role of the character rather than looking cool (like some other games), so you get a feel for the mobility of a bloodline without knowing it for example.\n\nBalance is pretty good. It's hard to tell at my level of play, I was Grade 9 for a while but after a long break I was grade three. But it doesn't seem very relevant because I've had a team of grade 3&4 go up against a team of grade 9-7 and win. I feel the teams are usually quite balanced however, you trade rounds and you don't get a lot of stomps (when you know your character and the opponents, otherwise the game is going to be very hard). I think that people complain about balance or blame the game because they expect their dota/lol/hon/whatever skills to carry over. This game isn't on nearly the same phase. You never cast all your long cool down abilities at once, you save some of them for a rainy day and react to your enemies.\n\nPlaying around ultimate abilities is vital for example, there's some that are completely unstoppable except for moving out of the way then there are some that are easily countered with trances/stuns. But even on the level I played on people didn't do this very much. You could easily get full ultimates off without any real problems.\n\nThere's profile-stat gains (traits), these are extremly insignificant. They affect your health/attackspeed/swiftness/cooldowns/energygain and cap etc by about 9% (tops, one of those). Which rarely comes into play. There's situational traits you can spec into, things like recieving 15% more healing when below 20% (generally 15% more healing for your next heal). Which can be really useful sometimes but it generally doesn't affect the outcome of a game. Also you're usually not great at the game at level 1. So you won't face people who have played the game for a long time usually.\n\nThen there's medallions, these are bought for bloodcoins, you do not have access to a stock of these form the start. Which may seem stupid and unbalanced but they're very situational and I rarely use them. They're things like 1.5 seconds of slow for 30% of your energy, shield for 2.5 seconds that shield up to 300 damage (think 1700 is a pretty average health pool). Generally not worth it but will save you in certain situations. These are unlocked for 650-2000 bloodcoin. And imo the cheapest one is the most useful because mobility is very important in this gamre and it increases your MS for 3 seconds by 40% for only 25% energy.\n\nPayment model:\nThe prices have been re-scaled since I last checked. Every bloodline was about 18k then and some slightly more expensive, currently they're all 10k. Using daily bloodcoin bonus (about 15 games a day) you earn you earn 75% of your base coin gain using the daily bonus. I've played 10 matches and depleted 570 coins from the daily bonus, I've been playing for about 30minutes. I've gotten 132 coins per game on average.  According to random sources online (and self-estimate) game lenght is about 5 mintues on average. Meaning you get about 1500 coins per hour. 6.6 hours for a champion/hero may seem like a long time for some. But this game isn't like the others, each character can easily be played for a very long time. They have more depth to them. Compared to a game like dota which unlocks all heroes from the start, it's obviously quite bad. But compared to League of legends it's nothing really. You also get one free bloodline (out of 7 you can pick from) after completing a few quests, extremely easy to do, I recommend holding off choosing until you've found one you like though.\n\nEach one of them have 7 skills and two "ex"-abilities, ex abilities are powered up versions of an ability which costs power (gained by pickup or dealing damage/healing). They all have some special twist to them also, for example Harbinger heals himself via lifesteal on almost every attack, which changes how he's played drasticly. Inhibitor can boost damage via applying 3 stacks of his primary attack and can heal himself (when attacking) using his secondary attack. If he attacks a target with stacks of the other type they're popped for either extra heling to Inhibitor or extra damage to his enemies.\n\nThey all have twists like this in some way, some push away enemies, some root them, some spells synergizes with others some attacks just combo very nicely. It's a very special game and a competent player can solo 1v3 inferior players, you never feel that the game has ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tted you in some way because you either wasted your spells inappropriately or your enemies played competently. There's no farm in the game and you're always on even ground. Most of the time it's hard to complain at the team because they usually pick a role different from you and they don't get focused the same way you do. Only exception is the tank+healer combo, generally the tank is supposed to make sure the enemies are either focusing him or that he's defending the healer in some way. Running around alone as a tank is generally stupid.\n\nMatchmaking:\nPeople complain that the game is dead, it's not on EU servers for me anyway. I get games rather quickly, not as quickly as you would hope considering the short game time. Compared to dota/lol the ratio of amount of time spent waiting divided by the time spent playing is higher, I estimate about 2x. But it's not an unbearable time. It's about 45seconds-1minute avg it seems.\n\nI used to have problems with unbalanced bloodlines (there was this new one that was just way OP) but it has been fixed i think. And this is a problem with every moba. The only game that escapes slightly is Dota 2 because they release it on the test client/old WC3 Dota first so people play there and have opinions.\n\nThe game has an automated tournamnet system where you can sign up to, there's both open (any rank) and rank limited tournaments. When you win tournaments you earn tournament tickets you can spend on cosmetics like avatars/skins etc.\n\nAlso the supreme pack is a nice buy because that pretty much unlocks all of them, 25 out of 27 (assuming you spend your bloodcoins from the pack on a bloodline) (25€). I wouldn't bother with bloodcoin boosts, maybe if you get satisfaction from feeling you've earned them or the grinding is a thing for you but you consider it a bit harsh. I think they should look them over and make them more like Dota 2 boosts where you feel the amount of money spent is insignificant.\n\n\nSummary:\n-Way way faster phased than LoL/Dota 2 (doesn't necessarily mean it's better obviously but if you like fast games this is good)\n-Each character has more depth to it and are generally very interesting roles, healers don't just cast heals all game, it's your primary "attack" but you do other things too\n-Bloodline rotation every day (good/bad? dunno, lets you find what you like quickly)\n-Game-deadness is overstated you do get games, I can imagine being a completely new player is tough though. You will learn quickly if you read up on the most popular characters (read them as you see)\n-VERY short games, 5 minutes per game. Quick to get into a game and just play compared to other mobas.\n-Skillful, no hero targeted spells. You shoot your own projectiles and you can hit or miss every spell or attack.\n-Balanced lineups (but with focus on roles). It's hard to win without a healer, luckily people know this and pick accordingly\n-Very Unique\n\nGreat game 8.7/10","November 9, 2011","true","41.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

That way you don’t really need to learn a lot and can enjoy even shorter games. For that matter I unlocked that champion from the points you get with the first achievements (first game and such).\n\nIt is free to play, thus nothing lost if you try it. The pricing model itself, with 2 retail/packages is not very clear and understandable though - or clearly fair. It was too complicated for me even at launch, and didn't improve with the switch to F2P - hence I have not bought anything yet.

If this game is to ever rise from the ashes or its beta for Battle Rite be glorious, we need things to change and have the community shine on.

I played this game for countless hours before it came to steam and I loved it.\n\nThat being said, this game was ruined in development. Each hero used to feel very unique, but balance patches made a lot of characters a lot less fun than they used to be (Seeker, Glutton, Blood Priest to name a few).\n\nAnd the nail in the coffin - the talents/gems/medallion system. Back when heroes had a static amount of health and these numbers were low - about 150 to 200 health - the game was much better. You knew if an enemy used an ability, it would be a certain amount of time before it came back off cooldown. Now with the wonky stat system you can never tell their cooldown, their movement speed or how much damage they are going to do. Game feels very pay to win and was practically abandoned with no updates from the old studio.\n\nThis used to be an amazing game, and you might still enjoy it if you didn't know it in its former glory. But regrettibly I cannot recommend it anymore.","October 30, 2015","false","19.4"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

The tragedy is, while they may have did a lot to balance the champs and eradicate bugs, they were simply too late. When it came out, LoL, HoN Dota were the main mobas and drew a lot of attention. While the idea of Bloodline champions is nice, there is little beginners playerbase imho. Games you play as a beginner are either vs ridiculously stronger opponents (e.g. having weeks or months on their profile) or...hm... no you always play vs stronger opponents. i tried it at various times, opponents were always way stronger and more experienced. I cant even blame it on the matchmaking because there is none for beginners. Simplay put, you either have already played the game, or go through a long and tedious period of learning, constantly getting owned with little success moments to motivate you. Apart from that, the champs are not all free to play. Another disadvantage considering the small hero pool.\n\ntl;dr\nif you consider getting this game, dont, you are too late.

Before it got to steam.\n\nIt was a great game. An incredibly fun, competitive, top-down brawler. It felt good to play - controlling the characters felt very robust and proper, the characters themselves were interesting and so were their abilities. It also had quite a bit of depth combat-wise.\n\nSadly, at some point they decided to release what for me ended up being a game breaking update. It was basically "memes and league of legends runes" the update. I kept on playing it for quite a while, I really forced myself but it just wasn't the same. The whole element of farming for these pointless (mostly passive if i remember correctly) upgrades, figuring out the one optimal build to go for, etc. just kind of ruined everything the game used to be: an adrenaline fueled, skill-based, FUN brawler.\n\nIf the idea of farming for upgrades for quite a long time or just flat out buying them, figuring out which to use on which heroes in a competitive top-down brawler doesn't seem repulsive to you and what I described in the first paragraph seems like something you'd be interested in, then sure, give it a try. Otherwise, I recommend you stay away. This gem has been sullied.","May 9, 2015","false","0.4"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

I initially was interested in this game by the unique concept and was captivated by it. After playing it for a few hours the concept starts to lose it's initial appeal and you're left with the actual gameplay which to be honest is pretty good. The gameplay is fun and fairly well put together and balanced. I will say that much like any team based game the players can ruin games for you and make it a hell however that doesn't make the game itself bad.\n\nMy only real problems with the game are the difficulty to buy a new bloodline and the grade system. The grade system seems to be pretty unique but not in a good way. Unlike a typical mmr system that most competitive games have this game has a grade system which gives you a grade based on how well you played ranging from 1-25. This would be fine except for starters it doesn't really explain how it gives you a grade very well and it took a bit of research to get a general idea how it worked. From my research I believe it gives you a grade based on your maximum achieved scores which is a pretty lame way to do it rather than using an average. The other problem is that it takes a fair amount of time to farm up enough to buy a new bloodline but I guess that isn't really that bad so I won't say don't play because of that. The player base is also a little low so sometimes finding games can be a bit of a hassle but that can easily be changed.\n\nThey do a lot of tournaments that any team can qualify for simply by signing up which I think is a fantastic idea and more games should implement this. The tournaments reward the winners with certain prizes that let them get special reqards. The tournaments also range in skill level so that you aren't playing with a grade 2 and a grade 25 in the same game, they try and even it out so that you can play in tournaments with people of your own skill level. They also have a ranked system so that you can achieve certain ranks for the season and get little rewards for that as well.\n\nAll in all this is a good game for killing some time and certainly worth a look. Check it out and I hope this review helped you!","August 11, 2014","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is centred around two or three champions on each opposing team with one main goal; to defeat the enemy team. There are no objectives or items in the game so you don't have to worry about last hitting or farming for a lategame composition, you are the champion you play and nothing more.\n\nThere are a few things you can add onto your account to help you ingame such as masteries, gems to socket into your medallions which can buff, damage or even protect. The game is very fast-paced and skill based almost every skill in the game is a skillshot played through an isometric camera. The game has four main roles of Tanks, Healers, Melee and Ranged. There's a lot of champions and each have strengths and weaknesses, there are tournaments as well as PvP seasons for you, the game is very satisfying however the only real problem with the game is the lack of updates from the developers and the rapidly decreasing playerbase.","December 28, 2014","true","44.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is no pay2win mechanism, except unlocking some new heroes, which you can do via ingame coins that you earn each match anyway, though it takes a while. It does have a fairly high skill bracket the better you get, but each hero has skills fully available at the start of the game and different heroes are available each week on a rotating policy. All of the different classes have similar skill sets but are unique, and you may prefer different hero play styles. I would fully recommend giving it a go, even buy the starter pack if it goes really cheap on a sale.","December 24, 2014","true","34.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game has all the class and specialization archetypes you would find in WoW but it is truly skill based and you have to aim all of your abilities. The game has an isometric camera angle like what you'd see in LoL or Dota 2, but you do not move-to-click, so movement feels very good and satisfying. Cooldowns are very fast and you always have an ability to use. This game had a rough launch but it's easily the most underrated game out there.

Stunlock's game largely succeeds, and though it's not the prettiest piece of software on the planet, it's definitely one of the most entertaining. The player community isn't as populated as it probably should be, but finding matches is usually no problem, especially if you play in the evenings.

I initially was interested in this game by the unique concept and was captivated by it. After playing it for a few hours the concept starts to lose it's initial appeal and you're left with the actual gameplay which to be honest is pretty good. The gameplay is fun and fairly well put together and balanced. I will say that much like any team based game the players can ruin games for you and make it a hell however that doesn't make the game itself bad.\n\nMy only real problems with the game are the difficulty to buy a new bloodline and the grade system. The grade system seems to be pretty unique but not in a good way. Unlike a typical mmr system that most competitive games have this game has a grade system which gives you a grade based on how well you played ranging from 1-25. This would be fine except for starters it doesn't really explain how it gives you a grade very well and it took a bit of research to get a general idea how it worked. From my research I believe it gives you a grade based on your maximum achieved scores which is a pretty lame way to do it rather than using an average. The other problem is that it takes a fair amount of time to farm up enough to buy a new bloodline but I guess that isn't really that bad so I won't say don't play because of that. The player base is also a little low so sometimes finding games can be a bit of a hassle but that can easily be changed.\n\nThey do a lot of tournaments that any team can qualify for simply by signing up which I think is a fantastic idea and more games should implement this. The tournaments reward the winners with certain prizes that let them get special reqards. The tournaments also range in skill level so that you aren't playing with a grade 2 and a grade 25 in the same game, they try and even it out so that you can play in tournaments with people of your own skill level. They also have a ranked system so that you can achieve certain ranks for the season and get little rewards for that as well.\n\nAll in all this is a good game for killing some time and certainly worth a look.

Easy to pick-up (I recommend you start with Glutton), very hard to Master. Has an very high skil curve, with no RNG involved. It's easy to join tournaments and leagues with your friends and the leagues are even scaled to your skill-level (scaled Iron, bronze, silver, gold, platinum). It is probably one of my favourite games ever.\n\nThis game is for everyone who is a heavy PvP fan, whose looking for some balanced action. It's a game where your own skill level is everything that matters, and the longer you play, the better you get and the more fun it becomes. There are about 30 classes to master, each easy to pick up (because each one only has 6 abilities, however it's about learning WHEN to use them correctly).\n\nThe only downside is that developers has left it, and so has a large amount of the player base. This results in long queue times during low hours and something the matches aren't scaled due to the long queue times (newbies vs. 100+ hour players).\n\nI really hope this game gets picked up again and generates a new player base.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bobbywojo/recommended/6370/","bobbywojo","BrbHouseOnFire","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bobbywojo/","145 products in account","I have over 1000 hours in this game. It wasn't always on steam.\nFast, furious, intense. Entirely skill based, 3v3 arena combat.\nA match typically lasts only 5 minutes.\n\nThink of this game as a MOBA, where everyone is already max level, has a full build of items, and are already positioned for a teamfight... This is where a match of BLC begins, and also where the similarities end. Because this game is so focused on the intensity and fast paced action of those teamfights, it goes above and beyond anything you've ever encountered before. Magic bolts flying everywhere, explosions all around you, split second juking and dodging, careful timing, focus, and precision.\n\nSimple enough layout/gameplay that you can pick it up in 20 minutes.\nBut, a ridiculously high skill cap means you can always do better.\nTop down, WASD to move. Each character has 6 basic abilities, 2 special abilties, 1 ultimate.\nEvery ability is a skillshot. You have to actually aim to hit things. Every time you hit things, you gain energy which can be spent to cast your special abilities for a small amount or your ultimate for a much larger amount.\n\nIt's free to play, and I can not recommend it enough. Funcom drove the playerbase into the ground, but they have since been removed, and the players have come back in droves. It only takes a minute for matchmaking to find people for a game now. (Perhaps longer for new players that have no in-game rating yet.)\n\nIn-game tournaments every other day (which cater to even low skill players, so everyone can join in!) with great rewards.\n\n\nAs a free to play, there's some things we have to cover:\nQ1) How long does it take to grind a new character to play?\nLess than any other f2p game I've ever played. Between a large daily coin boost pool, really short match times with high rewards, low cost characters in the shop, and two quests unlocking a character each for free, there's just no comparison. There are 27 characters to choose from, all free to play/try against bots before picking one up in-game.\n\nQ2) How's the real world $ to in-game currency rate?\nFirst, you can unlock every single character (all 27) for $20. So that's insane.\nSecond, those in-game tournaments reward you with coins for skin unlocks/etc. So that's awesome too. Third, the devs give out free skins/avatars/titles on holidays just for logging in, which is unheard of in f2p games. Otherwise, if you wanted to buy a cosmetic with regular cash, it has about the same going rate as other f2p's out on the market. So, there's lots of freebies and character unlocks are super cheap, but cosmetic items are of usual prices.","February 14, 2015","true","82.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kimaniowens/recommended/6370/","kimaniowens","kimaniowens","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kimaniowens/","26 products in account","this is by far the best pvp oriented game I have ever played. It has a few short commings that I will address as well.\n\nPros.\n-fast paced games ( most complete games last 5-6 minutes total)\n-highly based on personal and overall team skill ( stats do not prove who wins)\n-no meta ( you don't "have to have a healer" or tank or w.e pick what you want)\n- no chat filter\n\ncons.\n-poor and or lack of management\n- win traders\n-long matchmaking times....\n- lack of updates or content\n-lack of players\n-lack of players who are willing to practice and quit\n-complainers....\n\n\nThat out of the way lets touch on the pros. This game will not have you sitting down for hours just for one match bored out of your mind. Even when lossing it just shows you what you have to work on. As stated this game soley works on your skill. You can litterally miss (or dodge) melee attacks making your skill level determine how good you are. There are prefered team comps however you can pick whatever champions you want as long as you kill their team before they can kill yours. In this game with no chat filter they do not overly babysit you and "force you to behave." If someone is being annoying just mute them and be on your way.\n\n\n\nNow for the cons. The poor management is probably what gets under the remaining players skins the most. You will often see people typing in channels saying " if only this game had advertising etc. etc.\n\nLack of updates show the blatant fact that this game is running on autopilot. Even community driven events would have a highly positive impact on the game. Win traders are a plague in this community, I will not point fingers but it gets under everyones skins when you worked hard to get your rank and someone else got they highest ranks by cheating the system.\n\nThis game has a lack of players however I would like to note that many veteran players will re download the game to see the current state. If you were to look at the total amount of people who played just for one season the number is quite high even though the quene times are long...\n\nTagging along with lack of players is the bigger problem. New players have a huge learning curve as well as having to deal with smurfs and wintraders. It is not easy to begin this game and deal with long quene times so many quit.\n\nAnd finnally people who whine all day about the game. Some people would probably stick around longer if everyone didn't whine in the public channels.\n\nMy conclusion is this game is a very good game however it is an unpolised gem. If you pick this game up and manage to get past the long learning curve you can very well spend a lot of time playing.","August 16, 2015","true","209.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Back then, I had a blast and now thinking back, it's all so nostalgic.\n\nThis game made me want more and I kept coming back, after a long while, I took a really long break from it. When I come back from the long break, I found out that BLC is almost dead and its devs have gone on to make another similar game. Now imagine my feelings, emotions, words cannot begin to describe the disappointment and sadness I've felt when this became a sad, cruel and cold reality, once a fun and popular game which had potential to be a great game, is now but a former shadow of its brilliance and glory.\n\nThis game certainly neither regressed nor evolved, it just remained the same so this became a trinket of the past crazes. It seems that bad marketing and amateur game devs both had a hand to play in this downward spiral. Maybe this game wasn't bringing in enough revenue or profits? Who knows...\n\nA moment of silence for this game, not its devs. R. I. P. BLC. My one only sincere wish when I came back to play BLC, is reliving the same moments and experiences once again.\n\n"Be happy with what you have, rather than being unhappy with happy you do not have." Well, at least I get to play it again... Devs could've worked on it more, instead of just abandoning it...

All that matters is how well you can play the game. Even a healer can dominate you, kick your behind, wear your skin like a second skin and then finally kill you as an act of sweet mercy. Given that he's better than you. If not, then the roles are reversed. It's kinda fun and well made imo, really worth the money. How much? It's free O_o","September 20, 2012","true","65.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(As in the learning curve of the game)\n+Smooth gameplay.\n+Well aged graphics.\n+Active devs.\n+Multiple characters to play as, each with 7 abilities.\n\nCons.\n-Not a whole lot of people play it.\n-Because of the low amount of people playing it has bad matchmaking where you`ll get placed with players better than you in the early stages of the game.\n-Fairly quiet community in-game.\n\nTL;DR - Game feels great, plays great but it lacks people, so jump on in and bare with the matchmaking for a bit, until you get the hang of it.","February 22","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
