Unlike a horror movie, if there is something you don't like you can't just look away and pretend the threat isn't there.  In a horror video game you need to act or else you will die.  This is true for any horror game, but I think it is the most true for Monstrum.  Why?  Well for a few big reasons:\n\n1)  The environment is random every time you play.  Because of this, you feel lost every time and you need to build an incredibly vague map in your head on where you have already been and where you need to go next.  It's like the worst scavenger hunt you can imagine yourself being in.  It's a frickin nightmare.\n\n2)  The monster is chosen randomly each time.  The beginning of each new game is always terrifying because you have no idea what is after you until it gets close.  Each monster is terrifying in it's own way.  They are either loud and terrifying to look at, or really fast and hard to see.  Each monster is scary in their own unique way, making each experience fresh.   When you get seen you need to make extremely quick decisions on where and when you should hide.\n\n3)  The monsters don't f**k around.  You have to run as soon as they see you.  LIKE RIGHT WHEN IT HAPPENS you better have a finger on the shift key and hauling ♥♥♥ out of there.\n\nBasically, this game takes what is consistently scary (the unknown)  and puts it into every aspect of the game.  Unknown layout, unknown item placement, and unknown enemy and turns it into a great experience.  I still have yet to beat the game after all this time, and I actually love that about it.  It should be this hard.  It should make you feel like the terror is greater than your courage.\n\nThe terror is smarter than you.  The terror is better than you.  But you are going to do everything you can to fight it and escape.\n\nThis is the best horror game on Steam hands down and well worth the price.  Get it.","May 20, 2015","true","20.9"," 290 of 301 people (96%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","96","290","301","20","8"

After sitting for several minutes, and not wanting to seem like a wimp infront of my girlfriend, I opened the rusty iron door infront of me. Immedietely upon looking left some purple phantasm sucked the life of of my while I screamed like a girl. Mission failed.\n\n2nd: After once again hearing a monster whilst in a room, I determined the noise was above me, and leisurely walked out into the hallway. Two seconds later I began second guessing myself and made for a dead sprint, only to run straight into a huge red glowing thing that hugged me to death. Screamed like a wimp for the second time.\n\n3rd: Having smartened up, I finally decided hiding when monsters were nearby was the best tactic. After opening a door and seeing a thin, translucent skeleton down the hall, I quickly closed the door then got down and crawled under a bed. "Surely my superior wit will save me this time!" I thought, only to watch as the creature entered the room and proceeded to drag me, kicking and screaming, out from under the bed.\n\nOverall, 10/10.\nWill continue screaming like a wimp infront of gf.","May 20, 2015","true","1.0"," 241 of 255 people (95%) found this review helpful 232 people found this review funny","95","241","255","232","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spiritreviews/recommended/296710/","spiritreviews","Spirit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spiritreviews/","732 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFull disclosure: review copy provided by developer/publisher!\n\nImagine, if you will, the nerve wracking Survivor Mode of Alien: Isolation; the thrilling, tense, finales of L4D; the creature variety of Evolve, all spinning in some sort of sci-fi amalgamater. Are you done simultaneously vomiting and crying? Because I can wait. Yes, we're all done? Alright. Monstrum for Early Access strives for this Frankenstein's Monster-game concept. And it succeeds. Quibbles aside (ironically the name of my pet capybara), this is a great start for first person horror rogue-lites in 2015, a sentence I never thought I'd utter.\n\nHorror is hard, and I say this knowing full well the porn parody implications of such a statement. Developers are churning horrorish titles out at record speed in light of certain mainstream and indie successes. As such, the quality has plummeted faster than Hans Gruber at the end of Die Hard. Enter Monstrum, a new IP with a refreshing concept: monsters are chasing you... on a frickin' boat. What a trivial yet critical alteration to the formula. We've been chased on star ships, space stations, strange planets, in forests and spooky houses, but very seldom on boats. And I would argue that boats are chockablock with atmosphere, more than we give credit. Labyrinthine and cramped in design, their bowels groan and creak without warning, as if they are alive. The doors are heavy, the lights flicker and dim, pipes shoot hot steam... and those are in the best of conditions. You, however, you're alone on a derelict ship in the middle of the ocean, save for one unwanted stowaway.\n\nYou'll wake up in a randomly generated boat; suffering from video game amnesia, you venture forth with a cryptic note and flashlight in trembling hands. If you're anything like me you'll be confused initially, stumbling down corridors, popping in rooms, and grabbing every glowing thing in sight. Some items are mission critical: a fuse, duct tape, bolt cutter, etc. Some items, however, are purely to distract and slow down would be monster murderers. As you discover plot sensitive items, your amnesiac self will jot down tools necessary to escape your watery tomb. That's usually when you let out a big sigh of relief, turn around, and spot a nameless Eldritch horror. For me it was love at first sight. I gazed into its translucent face, it (presumably) looked back, screeched, and gave chase. I tripped on a gnarly bit of floor board and didn't get up in time to escape my gruesome death. Then you're greeted with a hilariously lame death still and the option to play again.\n\nEach time you play you'll encounter a different layout, a different escape route, and one of two monsters. What's more, the monster appears to explore the ship slowly and systematically, which means you can play half of a game and just not see it, or you can step out, take five steps, and be face to face with it. I appreciate this, especially after being seemingly attached at the hip with a xenomorph in 2014. This design, this setup didn't feel artificial, and I appreciated that. The monster can and will be anywhere. Furthermore, there is no “instant hidey hole” escape button when you're near a locker. You have to manually open that sucker, walk in, and shut the door, usually while being chased. That can be a bit stressful as you can imagine, which again, I appreciate in a horror game. Each monster has a different tactic for tracking and chasing you as well, which I won't spoil. I won't rob you of any potential scares. And the sound. I didn't mention the sound, arguably the most important aspect of a good horror game. Every locker door you throw wide, every cabinet you yank open  in desperation, every hesitant step you take (and don't take), fills the empty isolation with unwelcome din.\n\nI'm excited for Monstrum's potential. I want to see more monsters, like a  creepy mermaid creature, an ape monster, maybe even a run of the mill human with a chip on his shoulder and nothing left to lose (developers: Lovecraft and Poe are your friends! Dead friends, but friends!). I want to see more ships too. A cruise ship with multiple beasties, a yacht, a pirate ship, a party/orgy boat. I'd love to see some kind of 1V1 multiplayer, though that may be asking for the moon. This game is brimming with potential, and what it already brings to the table is very, very fun. Some of the animations are wonky and silly, and the after-death stills just look downright goofy. It's also a surprisingly challenging game. Getting caught means death, and in the cramped and narrow corridors of a ship it can be difficult to escape a hulking or skittering monster. It can feel cheap and unfair sometimes, but then maybe I was playing too fast, too furious. And after beating the limited number of scenarios a few times, that challenge and fear may diminish, and all the procedural generation in the world won't stop the drab interiors of a tanker from getting monotonous. But the core gameplay, tone, and theme of Monstrum is great, and I anticipate good things to come.\n\nSo come aboard, hesitant passengers. The on-board safety demonstration will be temporarily delayed on account of unspeakable horror.","January 29, 2015","true","5.1"," 171 of 214 people (80%) found this review helpful 53 people found this review funny","80","171","214","53","3"

A very good cat-and-mouse horror game. It feels fresh each time you play due to the random layouts and starting each session not knowing which monster is after you.\n\nIt's let down by a few glitches and the occasional unfair death. It would really benefit from allowing you to save your sessions, as playing for 1 and a half hours only to get stuck in a set of drawers and with no save point to revert to...\n\nBut overall a worthy buy, much better than a lot of indie horror games on the market currently.","June 7, 2015","true","28.3"," 58 of 61 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","58","61","0","0"

Spent most of it hiding under a desk. Eventually got outside, thought I heard the monster coming, so I set myself free by leaping off the side of the ship. A definite thumbs up. No bugs so far and perfectly playable. Early access done right. Though I will say that looking around when playing with a controller is a bit wonky even after tweeking the sensativity.  If you're feeling that The Most Dangerous Game kind of vibe you've got a pretty much fully realized product.","February 6, 2015","true","12.2"," 57 of 60 people (95%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","95","57","60","19","0"

I jumped into this not knowing really anything and I have to say that I'm quite unsure wether to recommend or not recommend this game.\n\nThe "Story" ís pretty generic and almost nonexistent.\nGame starts with you, the player, waking up in a spooky, abandoned cargo ship.\nOnce you realize that the ship is inhabited by some weird monsters straight from some Sci-Fi flick, you try to find your way out of the ship.\n\nThe gameplay basically works like the good ol' "Slender: The Eight Pages", you try to collect items from broken vehicles of three options, Helicopter, Submarine and Life Raft.. Once you've fixed up one of these vehicles mentioned before, you survive and the game's over.\n\nIt sounds pretty dull doesn't it ? In the games defense I'd like to state that the AI for these monsters is quite amazing. There's 3 different kind of monsters and each time you start a new game or die, the monster might be a different one.. Same goes with the map, you're in a similar kind of cargo ship but the rooms are placed differently etc. It's all meant to give the game some replay value and giving you a feel that there's something new you haven't experienced yet.\n\n..Anyway, back to the monsters. Each monster works quite differently, The Brute is a massive, glowy fire monster that can smash through doors and is the fastest monster out of those three. Then there's The Fiend who floats around hunting for the player, he can also warp from place to place, use telekinetic powers on the player slowing him down etc. and is the most intelligent monster of the three.\nAnd for last there's The Hunter, skinny, tall and skeletal figure who looks like a god*amn jellyfish. He hunts for the player using the ventilation shafts to his advantage, he can also lay eggs that he can burst out from to ambush the player.\n\nOverall as you can see the monsters all work and look very different from each other. The devs did a fine work on them.\nTo add one more pro in the games defense I'd like to say that the sound design is absolutely phenomenal.. As I was hiding in a closet from The Brute I could hear him walking around, stomping his feet against the metallic floor. The sound of him roaring and the stomping sound caused by his walking sent shivers down my spine.\n\nI have to say though, despite all these cool mechanics, the game does feel like it could've used more content.\nThere's just not enough to do.. I've played it for 2 hours and I already feel like I've done everything there is to do.\nSure you can collect logs and notes but that'll only keep you busy for a while. There just isn't enough replay value despite there being all the different monsters and map changing every time you start again.. It still feels the same.\nThe objective is exactly the same and I wish there was more to do.\n\nPlaying with a controller was also quite painful, mentally I mean.. looking around with the thumbsticks is very clunky.\nI personally recommend playing with mouse & keyboard.\nI also got stuck running away from these monstrosities quite often, which was quite the annoyance.\n\nTaking the price of the game into account I think it's a pretty good deal especially if you're getting it on sale.\nIf you're looking for a good horror game with a story, this isn't the game for you..\nBut if you love jumpscares and the Slender like games then this definitely is the one for you.\nIt's certainly one of the better Indie horror titles here on Steam!\n\nI'd suggest you pick it up if you're in the mood to wet your pants and you find it on sale.\n\nI rate : 5.75 / 10.00","November 28, 2015","true","14.7"," 88 of 108 people (81%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","81","88","108","13","1"

The Survival Horror ...\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wISOWd0O5Ws\n\nSo let's get down to the brass tac's of what made my time with it so great the gameplay,now you start the game in a darkly lit broom closet (think that's what it is?????) and then progress into a dimly lit room where upon you find a torch which you proceed to use.Searching the room you find a fuse (which you will need later on in game-IF YOU SURVIVE LONG ENOUGH THAT IS) and upon looking round the room further still (with your new found source of light) you find a note on the floor.These note's are your only mean's of learning what's gone on and they offer some insight into what's happening as well.\nThroughout my play time i have found bottle's and other object's you can use to distract the foul creature's you will eventually come across,glow stick's that attract less attention from your pursuer's than your torch does and an acetylene torch which at present i have found no use for (but logic dictates i will use it to weld item's that need repair later in the game).\nAs mentioned above you find various item's and these all play a part in the game at some point sooner or later,whilst i was running round (well creeping round that is) i came across a fuse box that actually needed a new fuse in it and "HOORAY" i used the one i had grabbed before thus making the electricity come on in that area.Now that was both a good and a bad thing as i could see more clearly without needing my torch and doing so also unlocked a door for me,but i also attracted attention of an unwanted variety.\nNow when i say this i really do mean "UNWANTED" as if you do die in this game guess what back to the start you go,and of you go again-so permadeath here we come AARRGGHHHHHHHHHH!!!!\nBut to be honest that didnt bother me as i knew what i was getting before this happened and if it does bother you,you either didnt read the games description well enough or you did and your just letting it get to you to much.\nOk so that lead's me to the monster's themselve's and OH BOY neither i have run into dissapointed me in any way,but i did actually die at their hands on both occasion's "NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO"!!!!!!!!!!\nThe first one was a huge hulking thing that i heard before i saw,and trust me when i heard it i nearly fell of my chair as the noise it made was..............well just horrible,so did i run-of course i bloody did as this is the sort of game you have no weapons in and like (DARE I SAY) Alien Isolation you have to use brain's more than brawn to survive.I of course died at its hand's as it came smashing through a door behind me and proceeded to smash my head in against the side of the ship.\nThe second thing was even worse than the first,i was in the hold of the ship and yet again i heard it before i saw the damn thing so i backed of.Now i must have knocked into something as it turned in my direction and started to run at me,i of course tried to run for cover but OH MY GOD this thing was so fast it was on me soon as i tried to open the door to get out (SHOULD HAVE LEFT IT OPEN YOU FOOL),and so ended yet another run oh well "C'est la vie".\n\nThis was my "DEADLY" encounter with one of the monstrosities i came across -\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=384620048\n\nThe graphic's in game do the job they set out to do and are neither amazing (except the creature's they are great and animated to perfection) nor unappealing,but they do help to set the atmosphere well of you being trapped on a rusting hulk with no way of (WELL I HAVENT FOUND ONE YET).\nThe sound is a high point (needs a little work but nothing major) with the ship creaking and groaning,and you never know from one moment to the next if that noise you heard is the vessel or something far more demonic.When the creature's do appear (and they will do sooner or later GULP) the noise's they make are both frightening and at the same time in an ironic way a blessing to hear as they give the lifeless ship that added "Hey im not alone" feeling,as the atmosphere the game create's is oppresive and lonely and even though thats a good thing i was happy (and at the same time bricking it) that at least there was something else living on this ship from HELL!!!!!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mattyrasker/recommended/296710/","mattyrasker","MattyRasker","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mattyrasker/","265 products in account","Monstrum is a first person survival horror game where you need to escape from a ship by one of the available escape methods while being stalked and chased by a monster. if you get caught, you die, and you have to start again.\n\nI buy scary games and I don't know why. I'm easily scared, but there is some kind of thrill to it which is enjoyable. Monstrum doesn't disappoint here - the persistant element of threat and terror of being stuck on a big ship, in the middle of nowhere, alone with something that wants to kill you, really comes across. you can't kill what's chasing you (ala Clock Tower and such like), running and hiding is your only option.\n\nWhat Monstrum isn't is a surival horror game with a deep engaging storyline or puzzles, or cutscenes. Think of this as an escape challenge with horror elements. Every time you play, the layouts of the rooms and corridors are different, the objects you need to pick up are all randomly placed around the ship (but the core layout of the ship, the escape routes, crew and lower deck areas are in the same location). Also, there are three monsters, one of which will be randomly chosen that will chase you down, so you never know who you're up against until you start playing. So this game has definite replayability.\n\nGraphically, it isn't the prettiest game, and I do notice performance issues from time to time (I'm running I5 4690k with GTX 760, Evo840 SSD), especially when there is a monster close by. Also, it has bugged out on me a few times - one of the monsters in one game got caught on the stairs. I could have just continued and won the game with no issues, but that would have been no fun and so I restarted. None of these however ruined the experience for me.\n\nSound however is brilliant. For me, a horror game has to have good sound and Monstrum doesn't fail here.\n\nWant a good night in with friends with a horror game? Look no further. No really! Pass the controller around, and set the challenge - first person to get off the ship wins.\n\nIf you want a good horror game that will give you a few good hours of scares and creeps then Monstrum is a good choice. Highly recommended.","May 11","true","16.0"," 30 of 33 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","30","33","0","0"

In its current state it's obviously very buggy and full of errors but I'll be damned if the concept isn't really appealing. Basically it's similar to games like Slenderman where you have to run around finding randomly placed objects to finish the game. This time you're avoiding two monsters on a cargo ship.\n\nSometimes you get lucky, other times you don't. It's a fun game even in this early state but at the $15 price tag I'm just not sure it's worth the value. At most the game will take you 2 hours to finish and there's only 1 small location in the game.

Even in early access i hold this game in high regard on doing something other games can't do, keeping my tension levels high. A randomly generated adventure, from where you start, to the locations of the items, even to the monster looking violate your anal cavity. You dont know what the hell is chasing you until you hear it roar, and walk right by wherever youre hiding, and the tactics they use are different as well. Both chase you down until penetration, but one is literally a brute while the other can hatch from eggs anywhere in the ship, or come from vents, which i dread when that monster is abound. Theres ways to distract the monsters, different places to hide, 3 ways to escape the ship, and what i really enjoy most is actually really insignificant but its always the little things you know? you can lock. ♥♥♥♥ing. doors. it adds to a level of comfort for me.  While the brute can destroy the door, the monster i dread more takes a while to blow the door down, giving you a chance to hide or run. The stomping or pitter patter of either monster coming down my hallway is enough for my trousers to endure a chocolate chenorbyl. Fuses are scarce, and either unlock doors to rare, useful items or pieces for your escape, or bring power to an entire floor. Cant get em back once you use them though, so use em wisely. Either light an entire DARK floor, and lose a chance of good loot, or grab some goodies at the expense of not being able to see mr. stealyogirl coming up right behind you. However the brute has a literal light for his head so you can see him from a MILE away. The escape method you choose seems to be how difficult you want the escape to be. all require a certain amount of pieces. all methods make some form of noise, but some take longer than others. one for example is a submarine where you have to wait two minutes for it to finally be ready to leave while blaring alarms, practically begging the monster to grab its girthy strap on. even then it can DESTROY certain methods of escape. If you manage to escape the monster, itll destroy the computer of the sub, making it useless to you, forcing you to hunt down another means of escape. The developers missed very little in their version of survival horror. However, the game does contain a few bugs, monsters can get stuck (its the only way i got the helicopter ending to be honest) you cant just drop cups, you HAVE to throw them, which blows the rapewhistle if youre just trying to get a fuse, and other miscellaneous things, which are slowly but surely being patched. Even a new monster is on the way. Its like what evolve would be if you werent a hunter, you were just prey 24/7 with no guns and no methods of trapping the monster. Its a pricey indie game, yes, but WELL worth your time if you enjoy a good intense session of horror.","April 8, 2015","true","10.3"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","92","24","26","14","0"

IT WORKED! :D i saw the red light of the flameman aka johnny storm coming down the stairs. the man then screamed at me and proceeded to chase me. like a scared baby i ran for my life to the room with the chair, locked the door, hid in a locker, and waited. he blew through the door with ease so i guess he ignores locks. and he ran up to the locker i was hiding in and stared me down through the crack. i could see it in his eyes, he was saying to me " Stop making noise down here you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ or ill be back" i took this warning and i did what any sane person would do... i waited til he left the room and then left my hiding spot and chased him down i then ran straight into him at the end of the hallway. needless to say he won this game of chicken and probably feasted on my remains or whatever they do with the bodies of these poor ppl who are left to wander this ship.\n\nin all though the game is great. like when your actually trying not to get caught and you see something bust out of a vent and come after you stuff like that is crazy. i highly reccomend the game. 11/10 would bang a chair around again.","May 25, 2015","true","12.2"," 28 of 33 people (85%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","85","28","33","24","0"

In fact the first bit of time you spend playing the game is amazing. The reason I don't recommend this game though is that after a bit you start to realize that the AI is absolutely terrible. The hunter is supposed to be able to hunt you down with a scent trail you leave and the longer you stay in an area the more noticeable it is. This does not happen. In fact, unless you start running around in circles jumping up and down and turning your flashlight on and off (or set off a camera and a door HAPPENS to be in their way) the monsters almost NEVER enter any rooms besides the main hallways and what not. When they do enter, as long as you are in a locker and they did not directly see you enter the locker you are almost guaranteed to be safe. I have never been killed while in a locker. Once while the hunter was in the room with me I ran around in circles in the locker and turned my flashlight on and off and the hunter acted like it didn't notice anything and started walking out of the room and when I saw this I opened the locker door while it was still in the room and it gave zero ♥♥♥♥♥ and walked out and disappeared. Also the monsters do not really 'hunt' you, more they just 'happen' to appear in the same areas of the ship as you occaisionally. Overall the AI could use a bit of an overhaul. I will happily change my review if they improve the AI.\n\nEDIT: Thank you team junkfish for the reply, I look forward to seeing what you can do if possible.\n\nEDIT 2: I read the bit on the hunter from the wiki here: http://themonstrum.wikia.com/wiki/The_Hunter\nI would check the other monsters on the wikis as well for inaccuracies as a fair amount of them make pretty bold claims.","May 27, 2015","false","6.6"," 50 of 73 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","50","73","0","4"

Died twice, once to the Brute; Hunter for the other.\n\nIt's a frustrating type of game that makes you want to think about your every move on a subconsious level and really judge if it's the right idea. At the same time, you've got about 10 seconds to make that decision or else some creature is going to murder the ever-living ♥♥♥♥ out of you. I'm absolutely thrilled with it and the small little differences on each play through. It's a ship, not much is going to change; it's not like one second it's a cargo ship, and then the next it's a cruiseliner. But it brings small enough changes to keep things fresh, along with the rotating door of monsters that you'll have to duck and dodge your way through.\n\nAll-in-all I recommend this game for anyone who loves themselves a good First-Person Survival Horror. I love it and you will too.","February 19, 2015","true","4.8"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","16","18","4","0"

First of all: hats off to the sadistic mind who though up the monsters, they are terrifying. The story is fairly generic; you wake up on a ship and dont know how you got there. There are a few notes of the ships recent history although they are little more than a distraction and do not add to the overall story much. After walking out the door the first thing you will notice is there is alot of detail put into this game; it feels like it could be a real ship, there is a kitchen, bathrooms, living quarters, storage, mantainance areas and a cargo hold. The atmoshpere is quite creepy to start with however there is no sense that you are about to experience the most terrifying game of cat and mouse you will ever see. After a while you will begin to hear things go bump in the night, and this really puts you on edge and sets the stage for when you ineveitbly encounter the monstrosity you will be facing this time, thats right; there are 3 different monsters and each time a game is loaded up it is randomly selected and there is no way of knowing which one has spawned until you com face to face. Unlike other indie horrors the monsters in this game are completely different and need to be handled differently. The ship itself is also randomly generated however this is highly opinionative as only the layout of certain areas and item spawns are different. One of the downsides to this is it is very easy to get lost and retrace your path over and over getting frustrated about how you have checked everywhere only to 20 minutes later find that there was some well camoflauged door that had the item you need, there are some more nasty surprises waiting around the ship but im not going to spoil. All in all this is one of the most polished and well done horror games period, unlike others it has heavy replay value and even on that final time i defeated this game my heart was still racing just as fast as the first time. The devs know what they wanted out of this game and pulled it off spectacularly and i would recommend this to anyone who wants a horror experience that is less focused on an intricate and confusing story and more poop your pants terrifying. 11/10","March 29","true","21.8"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","16","18","0","0"

What makes this game so scary is your on a procedurally generated ship, and your goal is to escape off of it. The items your looking for to help you escape are scattered around said random ship. However, hunting you on the ship is a random monster (there are three, and they are very different from each other.) that the game picks. That monster is constantly hunting you and is attracted to any sort of noise/light. Get caught by the monster and game over. There is no way of saving your progress , no health bar, just permadeath. Honestly, what makes this game so scary is:\n\n1.) Not knowing the layout of the ship. (The randomness is mostly focused on the interior of the ship, which makes getting lost easy. Running away from one of the monsters, I accidentally back tracked to the same room three times.)\n2.) Not knowing where the items you need to escape are.\n3.) Not knowing which monster the game chose.\n4.) Not knowing where said monster is.\n5.) Not knowing if you are actually walking towards where the monster is.\n6.) Knowing one screw up could mean restarting another round with a different ship layout, and possibly a different monster.\n\nAll of those qualities make every play through so tense. Since the game came out of early access, I've encounter little to no drop in frame rate. Also the graphics have been improved and so has the monster AI. I've never really been into horror games, but I enjoy playing Monstrum (even though I almost have a heart attack every time I play). If your into the horror genre, I would recommend giving this a look.","February 25, 2015","true","8.4"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","11","12","2","0"

Closest comparabable games are the Penumbra series, or more likely Amnesia The Dark Descent as there are no weapons to use. Just a few clumsy defensive items to slow down the monster that is chasing you.\n\nIdea is simple: Slightly randomized ship layout every time you play the game. 3 different predators that each have their own way of hunting you and 3 different ways to escape.  Death is permanent. No saving.  Good luck trying to survive.\n\nAnd it works really well. The feeling of evading a monster inside a crampy ship is really something. Death is literaly just some steps away very often or within arms reach as you hide under a table and the monster is looking for you in the dark doom. And always there are multiple ways out of the ship that is almost at your grasp but ah so far away.\n\nSometimes you hear the monster behind the door. sometimes you can see it. And sometimes it sees you. And then you run. No, you retreat. you RUN. you rout like there is no tomorrow. You 'get the ♥♥♥♥ out of dodge' like you have never done in any other game. Not even in Amnesia do you uncontrollably flee like in this game.\n\nAnd then you notice how you play the game silently. you barely even breathe because you are trying to make as little noise as possible. Too bad the game is a horror game. i bet the kids would be really silent playing this game if they would not be emotionally scarred by this.\n\nGood game all round but some small cons exist: Frame rate sometimes drops when the action is at the most frantic level and certain critical items are just too rare. (Fuses!)\n\nHighly recommendable due to unique 'Amnesia style' monster evading, hiding in the closet combined with rogue elements.\n\nGood luck beating the game. Good luck beating the game against all three monsters. Good luck even escaping one of them.","February 6","true","6.1"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

Good survival horror toys with you by using misdirection and engaging your imagination. Monstrum however is a jump scare slot machine with little cat and mouse and misdirection. Everything is telegraphed to you and is 1:1. You here thumping? Then you know the lava guy is around. You see the lights flicker? You know a ghost is near. See sacks on the wall? Be ready to be chased by a derivative monster. The game rules are very clear, which is good for a rogue like, but makes for a very dull horror experience. At no point did they achieve actual terror with me. The game never made me question my surroundings or my own senses, except for using the same texture on nearly every wall.\n\nI never once found myself coming across a narrative moment that made think "what's going on here?" Everything felt sterile. They even missed the opportunity to have the ship creak and the doors sway as the ship rocks against the waves. Or even have the ambient ship sounds change over time. Instead you're on what must be the absolutely most silent ship, ever. They never pulled the rug out from under me. They don't toy with you, which is the very meaning of "cat and mouse." Simply having something patroling after you is not cat and mouse, it's hide and go seek. Cat and mouse means toying with me, letting me escape only to appear around the very next corner, creating that "phew... OH MY GOD!" kind of moments. Instead it's just hide and go seek. If that's what you're into, this is for you. If you're looking for something that's going to try to get into your head  you might want to pass.\n","June 2, 2015","false","0.7"," 37 of 61 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","37","61","0","1"

Even hardcore horror gamers will have a hard time beating it.\n\n\nPros:\n\n+ Awesome environment. The ship has everything you don't want when you are being hunted: Narrow corridors, small rooms, dead ends, traps and so on.\n+ Great graphics and design. Nice to look at and eerie.\n+ Deeply terrifying monsters. All three of them are living nightmares. With their different characteristics, your strategy has to change in every playthrough.\n+ Equally terrifying sounds. Even the doors are scary.\n+ The randomly generated map ensures that you'll never be able to rush through the game.\n+ Three different escape routes, each usable with other items.\n+ The game doesn't rely on programmed jumpscares, it's rather the monster's smart pathfinding AI that lifts you out of your chair when you run into them frontally.\n+ You can interact with the monsters by attracting them with radios and egg timers, shooting them with flares and fire extinguishers and setting them on fire with gasoline. That's truly helpful when you want to troll them, but I'm fairly certain that you'll find more serious ways to use that.\n+ Monstrum is difficult but beatable over time.\n\n\nCons:\n\n- Technical limitations with the AI cause weird situations. For example, when you hide under a table, perfectly visible to anyone in the room, the monster won't see you, even when it's standing directly next to you.\n- A few glitches that let the monsters getting stuck. However, you won't even think about exploiting them in your first playthroughs. Trust me on that.\n\n\nAll in all, Monstrum is a truly terrifying experience, even for the bravest of you.","March 25","true","21.5"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","8","8","2","1"

I wish it had a tad more variety) this mainly affects replayability.\n- Even with the random generation some elements are static or predictable\n\n= Permadeath\n\n\nFULL REVIEW:\n\nFigured I'd go ahead and write a real review for this game, as this is exactly what it deserves.\n\n17.99? Please... If it had just a bit more content then honestly, with the brilliant concept that this games manages to float around possessing, sprinkling its magical little trail of blood curdling pixie dust. Praise to this indie dev team as they carve a spot in my favs collection. I admit after playing for a few hours I am not screaming as often, but still. I shouldn’t be screaming at all, yet here we are. Complaints from the roommates late at night get old, but I suppose that is either the fault of mine for buying this game, or team Junkfish for creating such a marvelous gem of pure adrenaline. Not fueled by pumping bullets, by just simply by the fear of getting caught.\n\nYou explore an abandoned hunk of metal death floating god knows where in the middle of the ocean. Peruse the ship in search of vital pieces of equipment, to help fuel the frantic struggle to your escape or your demise. Something has broken from its metal prison container in the cargo bay, and is now hungry and P' offed. And you are the tastiest thing around. But I mean who wouldn’t be super upset after cutting a deep gash in your bumpy monster knuckle. Repeatedly slamming it into the sharp edge of an industrial shipping container, prying the torn metal edges of the hole, raging to get out like a little newborn baby having a tantrum in its crib. This baby is ready to destroy the crib and eat all of the furniture. Taste like wood, screw it. Plus one for America and doing whatever the eff you want. Plus it's procedural, so you’ll never know which hall to turn down, despite some of the major areas of the ship remaining static. Which in this case didn't bother me at all. There being several methods of departure from the horrible monstrosity aboard the ghostly vessel of Monstrum, you will often find pieces that contribute to the endgame in some manner but seldom do you find the pieces relevant to your current attempt right away. Each method requires different items. On the flip side there are also several non essentials to pick up, my favorite being the old radio. DO NOT MAKE THE SAME STUPID MISTAKE IT'S NOT WORTH IT MAN, IT"S NOT WORTH IT. All I wanted..... was to not be sad. All I wanted was to shake my booty, like I'm the only girl in the world. All I wanted...  was some tunes man.... and all I got, was stomping and shouting and then eventually screaming (from me) as I charge down the hall still to be caught by the foot and smashed anyways. Sigh. Navigate through doors and pitch black stairwells (batteries in your torch do NOT lasting long btw). Sprint through hallways as the ocean waves crash outside, sneak by security (or don’t lol), and hide in lockers or under desks/beds. Usually because you are about to have your face ripped off by one of the multiple creatures you may encounter, although one at a time.  I’ve gotten in the habit of leaving a few locker doors open to avoid those few precious seconds as I run around a corner and fumble with my buttons long enough to slam the locker shut before the beast sees me. Never feel safe though, dont be fooled. The number of times I snickered as the beast slowly crept by my locker door or paced by the bed I was cowering under, still chuckling once I assumed I had achieved victory, the suave super slick genius that I most defin ONLY TO HAVE MY SENTENCE AND HAPPY TIME INTERUPTED BY THE SOUNDS OF MY SCREAMS as I am dragged out from under the bed like a parent preparing their child for a spanking. A spanking made of pain and terror and ripping your guts out. Rude, but hey. The rush is great. Sprinting isn't always the key though, there is quite a bit to trip on or run into and it WILL be a factor of life and death, if you run into any of these environmental "traps" at the wrong time. So watch your footing, or you'll lose a foot. And everything else. Including your face, as stated.\n\nThe Visuals. Pretty good. Not a diamond in the rough type deal but definitely a pretty game. If anything, it’s very good at being dark and dismal. Oh yeah and depressing. Everyone is dead and you’re not too far behind. That fiery orange glow illuminating from between the jaws of the Brute as it slowly bleeds into the darkness of an upcoming stairwell, is horrifying. The game is literally filled when omens from the jump and has no problem letting you know what will be hunting, and eventually murdering you. In this fashion, you have a chance to plan your strategy, unless you are a first timer. In this case. Listen to this one piece of advice. DO NOT RESEARCH OR WATCH CONTENT INVOLVING THIS GAME. Believe me when I say if you go into this floating slice of hell with no prior knowledge, I can guarantee the initial scares are almost worth the price alone. The eggs left around by you know who are also quiet unsettling I would like to add. But if your eyes don’t yank your guts into a shriek then the audio will.\n\nThis game..... Has BRILLIANT audio design, that will leave you flailing your arms as you jump from your seat and proceed to exit the room. And I say that whole heartedly. The running sequences blare what can only remind me of the gut wrenching metallic squeals of machinery emitted from my speakers during any of my romps through the universes of Silent Hill. But that’s me personally. Sounds of rusty metal clamoring and rattling loudly, just before an abrupt hiss of steam shoots from a crack and burns hot superheated water vapor into your eyeballs, forcing you to the ground at the WORST possible moment. Slamming of doors and lockers and the BLOOD curdling cry of the security system alarm.\n\nMy god.\n\nThe sirens on this ship. I swear they were manufactured for a max security prison with the intention of bursting the inmate’s eardrums long before they could complete an attempt at escape. I keep a set of q-tips and tissue on my desk at all times to stop the bleeding. The screams and shrieks of the on-board menace startle me sometimes even more than the effing thing jumping right in my face, which also happens... In front of all my friends.... On my birthday.... LIVE on stream. <_< Right when I thought I was safe the game’s like well nope screw you. But this is what I love. If you want to poo yourself turn the volume up and flip the lights off. This is the soundtrack I can expect someone to hear as they enter the gates of hell.\n\nSo, in conclusion. No, this game is not perfect. No, it’s not the scariest game on earth, but that is due to the sole reason, that eventually once something is experienced enough, you just simply know what to expect. But f**k does this game come close. The combination of concept, video and audio are a delightful mixture that bubbles in a cauldron until all the fumes and vapors suffocate everyone in the room. A little girl picks up her box of brownie mix and stares at it puzzled, then glances once more at her family now laying limp on the floor. She shrugs and retreats up to her room, hops on the computer, fires up a round of Monstrum, and has a heart attack several minutes later.\n\n\n*Little girl survives by the way.

Yes.  ME!  Like a scared little girl wearing a bright yellow dress and fluffy pink bunny ears, I am!!  All thanks to a ♥♥♥♥ing GAME.  What makes this game so scary?  Let's see now...\n\nScary sound.  Scary monsters (two so far).  Not yet understanding how much noise I can make before said monsters come running after me.  Rogue-like/procedurally-generated elements which make the ship's structure different every time.  Multiple ways to escape the ship, without being sure which one to take (guess it'll depend on what items I happen to find).  Permadeath (which, for the relatively uninitiated like myself, is apparently a hip term for NO SAVE POINTS and YOU ONLY DIE ONCE).\n\nLet me put it another way:  I've just finished my FIFTH playthrough, and it was the first time I even managed to successfully get away from a monster long enough to, well, basically run into him/it again five minutes later to die my inevitable death.  I found a helicopter, but had yet to fulfil even ONE of the three criteria required to escape in it.  So while a single successful playthrough of this game theoretically wouldn't take that long, actually SURVIVING that long is much easier said than done, and the rogue-like elements ensure that NO ONE will be able to speed-run the ♥♥♥♥ing thing (haha, sucked in, all you petty I-can-get-through-Half-Life-in-one-hour-and-forty-seven-minutes, Youtube-addicted pansies).\n\nNow, despite being extraordinarily impressed thus far, I'm reluctant to give this the absolute highest of accolades because I'm not yet convinced of the value of EITHER permadeath nor rogue-like elements in video gaming culture.  Lack of save points, and not being able to learn much from previous failed games due to randomised elements, are two of my single biggest pet hates in modern gaming design.  Having said that...THIS may actually be the game to justify the usage of not one but BOTH of these elements...MAY.  My personal jury (consisting of me, myself and I) shall remain hung for the time being as to whether this will ultimately prove to be the case, BUT...I will confidently say that I'm impressed as hell, and would not hesitate to recommend this (even in its unfinished Early Access state) to anyone who might possess the patience to learn how to stay alive long enough to actually ever GET THROUGH this terrifyingly unforgiving mother-♥♥♥♥er of a game.  "Survival horror", indeed...\n\nVerdict: 8.5/10 (subject to improve, should I get up the balls to play it long enough to actually work out what it's all about.

What happened is a mystery, but one thing is certain, you got to get out before you get killed. You can escape through a liferaft, a submarine or a helicopter. But first you have to gather the right tools and items to fix them. And that’s where the problem starts, since they’re randomly scattered around the ship. There is no save point, so if a monster kills you, you’ll start from scratch.\n\nAnd you will die. Monsters get attracted by noises you make or other actions. But that means you might be able to trick them… if you’re smart. But hiding around in lockers or under furniture will be your main getaway. When everything else fails, you run. But be careful, since the ship is falling to pieces and you might stupidly die in one of it’s traps. As you explore your surroundings, you’ll find notes with tips and small revelations of what happened.\n\nThe main objective this game needed to accomplish is to be scary. And it was… for a while. The environment has a spooky feel and the “hide-and-seek” dynamic does get the blood pumping. But it lacks on ambient sounds to make you more paranoid and immersed. But the biggest flaw is, after some plays, you catch on the monsters’ patterns and it becomes tedious. What should be a question of attention and skill, becomes more a question of repetition and random luck.","June 25, 2015","true","1.6"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","11","15","0","0"

There are 3 possible exits, but which one you use can depend on which monster you have, or which parts you can find to get your exit in working condition.\n\nThe map RNG is similar to Rogue Legacy, where the general areas are the same, but the halls and rooms and items within them can be in completely different configurations. Even the cargo hold has a random layout of open containers to search through, which is different (and tense!) every time you search through them, and try not to get stuck in a dead end with the monster on your back.\n\nThere's currently no save system, so depending on how safe you play, games can last up to at least an hour. Usually much shorter thanks to the monster, heh.\n\nThere aren't really weapons to kill the monster, just stall them briefly so that you can get away or complete objectives. Each monster has their special traits, each requiring different tactics to deal with.\n\nThe monsters don't appear to be able to magically home in on you all the time, at least if you haven't been spotted lately, however they have an annoying tendancy to rubberband. The monsters seem to have some kind of leash where, even if you bait them all the way to the opposite side of the ship, and not get spotted, they seem to magically make their way back to your side of the ship (without searching rooms in their area first) within a minute or 2.\n\nThe exits themselves can be pretty tense, as you usually have to assemble or operate some equipment, and balance how much work you do against how much noise you can make before the monster catches up.\n\nI didn't really notice any bugs or crashes during my playthrough, except one time where a monster got stuck after breaking a radio.\n\nOverall I enjoyed this quite a bit. The RNG keeps the game from getting predictable, and every room is a tense moment where you're trying to quickly look for key items and plan your next move, and not turn into a monster chewtoy.","December 18, 2015","true","39.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

Escape from a broken down freighter while a killer monster hunts you down. Random level generation is a double-edged sword, however.\n\nIn reality, you have to scour each and every room for components to help assemble your escape vessel. There is almost no rhyme or reason to item placement; and since levels are random each time you start up, you have to stip search the ENTIRE ship. You can search drawers and hide in cabinets, but you'll find that both are kind of pointless at times. Sometimes they'll really jerk you around and hide an item under shelving/furniture.\n\nNotes do not provide clues as to where these items are located, but they do give some backstory into the crew members and how they perished. With 3 monsters, I expected the story to change each time and at least tell me which monster was going to torment me; the story is simply vague enough to be apllied to all three at once: therefore notes you collected from previous runs will be saved (which gets kind of confusing).\n\nThe monsters are great. They will relentlessly hunt you down. I don't really care if they just "spawn near you" since that's exactly what Amnesia: The Dark Descent did, my problem is that for a game that is supposed to be replayable... you can't really do much other than run and hide. Monsters have almost no problem getting through locked/shut doors. You can use a fire extinguisher to stun them. Great... (Trapping, killing, or removing the monster from the ship would be fun as hell)\n\nTL;DR\nGood fun every now and then, but gets stale pretty fast.","October 31, 2015","false","8.7"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

You have 3 different ways to escape the ship: Raft, Helicopter, and Submarine. Materials for each route are scattered randomly throughout the ship's rooms and containers. On top of that, each time you play the structure of the ship's interior is different, justifying the rogue-like elements. And because of this, you must start a new game every time you die(no saves either). To help you on your quest are flashlights, glowsticks, and distractions for each monster(i.e. breakable cups).\n\nThis game has a very, VERY well done atmosphere. It's scary, keeps you on edge from the occurance of monsters, and even has gameplay elements that legitmatly justify that YOU, not the game, caused your death.\n\nThis is an early access review, so I will admit that there are plenty of bugs, like monsters STILL getting stuck in doorways, climbing above the level and no longer able to come back(from containers), and dropping items while crouching causes the items to disappear. These happen very rarely, so for it's time in early access and this game's continuous development, these problems should fly right by.\n\nThe only setback I'd say for this game is the pricing. 14.99 is a little expensive for this title, especially for an early access game like this. If the price was pushed down a bit, say $9.99 or maybe even $11.99, then it would definitely cause much more attention to come to this game.\n\nMy final rating for Monstrum is a solid 8/10.\nAfter the game leaves early access bug free, then it may be pushed up to a nice 9/10.\n\nIf you are on the edge of buying this game, don't hesitate uness money is an isssue.

And it was on a very good sale.\nAgain, my attitude is `It`s just a game with just animated pixels in a 3D virtual environemnt; it`s not real. There`s nothing to be scared of.\n\nYet, when you start the game and start exploring this deserted ship, a sense of unease starts to grip you. You don`t know what happened. You know it isn`t good. You know that there`s something wandering out there, but it`s a game, how bad can it be?\n\nYou walk down the eerily silent corridors with the odd flickering light. You enter a small room, find a torch, a fuse and a tape recorder you switch it on. The recording plays the voice of some guy talking about something strange going on. It dawns on you that the recording is quite LOUD. You dismiss the loud tape noise although a quiet volume control would be nice.\n\nBoom, boom, boom!\nThe sudden sound of really heavy footsteps makes you jump- what the heck was that?\n\nBOOM, BOOM, BOOM!\n\nCripes, that sounded like it was right outside the door. You crouch and try to find somewhere to hide before the door opens. There`s no other door, nothing to hide under. then you see what looks like large storage  cabinet. You try the handle- It opens! You crawl inside and wait. Wait.\n\nSomething`s in the room now... searching about.\n\nI quit the game.\n\nDamn. No game has ever stressed me out like that before!\n\n10\10 for atmosphere and I haven`t even seen the Thing yet!\n\nOk, the basics:\n\nYou`re a lone survivor of some terrible catastrophe that has presumably killed the crew of the ship you`re on. You wake up confused in a small room and have to get out before whatever killed the crew finds you and kills you.\n\nThere are items you need to find that will help you as you try to find a way out.\n\nPros:\n1. Great atmosphere. You know something bad has happened.\n\n2. There`s something out there. Every now and then you can hear something walking about and it don`t sound Human or good.\n\n3. It hears if you make a loud noise or most noises for that matter- Be quiet.\n\n4. You can try to distract it by chucking breakable stuff, but it don`t always work.\n\n5. You can run. If you`re lucky, it will lose you. Hint: make many twists and turns. Try not to panic.\n\n6. You can set your controls to personal preference- essential in a game like this.\n\n7. The monster (I`ve met one) Are pretty horrible- And they WILL kill you if they catch you.\n\n8. Great sound effects from the ditsnt sounds of something opening a door to the pounding sound of running feet right behind you.\n\n9. Each new game randomises the ship rooms which adds real longevity to nthe game. Great idea.\n\n10. Apparently there are 3 monsters which randomise with each game. Great idea.\n\nCons:\n\n1. To be honest can`t think of any. It would be nice to choose skin colour for those of us who aren`t white and want to be more immersed, but no big deal really.\n\n2. Monster (at least the one I saw before it broke my neck) are scary, but I`d like them even more frightening.\n\n\nConclusion: Game that really manages to put you on the nervous edge of your seat. It doesn`t use jump scares, but the fear of the terrible unknown that you can`t possibly defeat; the blackness that wants to take you and doesn`t care.\n\nVery well executed. Recommended.\n\nFor extra effect play at night with the lights off!","May 23","true","0.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

The Hunter, a spoopey, scurey slime skeleton who can slither through vents and snake along the floor, leaving behind his goopey mess from which he can teleport from at anytime.\n\nAnd a X-com alien.\n\nGreat fun. The cramped, dark atmosphere is perfect, and stays fresh with each playthrough, as the maze of corridors resets it layout everytime. The monsters are far more than a simple model change too, each one having different traits and gimicks. The Hunter for example is stealthy and agile, and his ability to pop out the vents and egg-sacks makes him a deadly suprise, but he's stopped easily in a chase by the ships doors due to his lack of strength. The brute however charges at the fastest pace of all three, and locked doors mean nothing to him. But he's loud and lacks any kind of stealth, and his low inteligence makes him easy to trick with noises and such.\n\nIt might lose it's charm after a good few playthrough's, but for the price Monstrum is a great little indie horror game.\n\n","May 30, 2015","true","7.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Great atmosphere, good graphics, but most important: It's really scary! You are supposed to escape from this abandoned ship, which could be simple enough (if there weren't monsters lurking in the dark corridors). You have 3 ways (as far as I know) to escape and you need to gather different items for each of them. Each time you play things are different and you will not gaze into the same corridor next time you start up the game. I may have played this for only 20 minutes (because I freaked out and I'm too scared to continue atm), but I strongly recommend this game if you're a fan of camping in lockers like me, hahah.\n\nIt's a horrifyingly great game that has even greater potential!","February 23, 2015","true","7.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

The monsters are always near you, and because of that you are forced to hide, or progress and die. Crouch-walking and walking alike make footstep noise, and your character slams all doors and drawers. its as if the game doesnt want you to progress through the game. If there were ways to just sneak around the monsters, and maybe only have them hunt for you after you mess up and make noises, or generate noise from objectives, then the game would be fairer, and also more fun.\n\nYour typical game feels like this: You spawn, move a little bit, and then the monster hears this. He converges on your position as you find cover/concealment. He then roams around the area for a long time, and you just have to wait for him to wander out of the area.

With that, there is only you and a monster on the ship. You can escape through three different ways which you discover as you explore the ship. Mixing in both procedurally generated levels and perma death (if you die, you must restart. No check points, no saves). The monster that is hunting you cannot be killed. There ways to slow it down, but it cannot be killed. The only way to win is to escape.\n\nMonstrum is excellent. The monsters (there are multiple ones) are terrifying and each one has it's own style of hunting you down. The lighting is great, the music is amazing, and it's very fun finding objects. Though graphically, the game at the highest settings can look very nice, though it's quite a bit poorly optimized. There's nothing that you can really do about this since this is an indie title after all.\n\nI highly recommend this game if you're into horror games, especially of the Outlast/Alien: Isolation kind. If you're more into the shoot everything that you see like Resident Evil, you might not like this very much.","May 17, 2015","true","10.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The atmosphere is unsettling, the developers really made the game look like you are on an old abandoned boat. Everything feels scary. The rooms: old and decrepit, the sound of the doors opening and closing: scary, and the monsters that chase you: terrifying. The game is randomly generated, so there is no way to build off of your old experience. The game allows you to pick from three endings, depending on how you try to escape. Each time you start a new game, you get 1 of the three monsters, no telling which one. Its a very hardcore game. I literally, at 26 hours, just beat the game a single time. The lowest dicount for the game is 45% off asking price, which is more than fair. I would have gladly purchased the game full price. The GTD (Game to Dollar) Ratio that I got was 1 to $0.70. Imagine dropping a measly three quarters to play this well crafted game for an hour.

There is a great sense of the unknown as you walk the halls of the ship, not quite sure what is hunting you or how you're going to escape. The tension that exists as you explore, pick up items, and decide on an escape plan with the beast drawing close is one of the most genuine horror experiences I've encountered.\n\nMonstrum masterfully dictates what you're capable of against your foe, which isn't much, and then allows you to scurry around the ship for your life as one of three distinct terrors stalk the ship, in order to hunt down the ship's remaining survivor. You are in a position of extreme weakness, one in which you simply cannot fight back with any degree of long-term success, and you are forced to run or hide in just about every situation. The permanent death mechanic raises the stakes to maximum in every game as the effort you put into escaping can be taken away at any point. Every game is like living (and often eventually, dying) a horror movie from beginning to end. There is a definite three act structure to the player's experience with the game that is so much more satisfying than the multitude of superficial shock scare games that seem to permeate the horror genre. The first act of the game is when the player wakes and finds themselves on the ship, helpless and unsure of how to proceed, initially wandering the twisting passages, listening to the creeking and moaning of the ship, taking in the surroundings and learning how to interact with the surrounginds. The second act is the intense exploration of the ship and the search for items that will prove useful. The player will certainly have run-ins with the stalking beast and the ship's security systems during this time, while deciding on which escape plan reveals itself as most prominent. The final and most intense act is when the player collects all the necessary equipment to escape, puts the plan into action and comes face to face with the beast in the final moments where, if you slip or make a mistake, all your hard work may be for naught.\n\nThere are very few games that can make my hands shake from adrenaline during its climactic moments, and escaping feels like a real accomplishment. Monstrum, unlike many of the games that litter the horror genre does not submit to using simple jump scares to thrill the player, but actively instills them with a sense of dread.\n\nMy highest recommendations for those who enjoy the horror genre. It's greatly replayable even when you've managed to escape, will challenge the player, has achievements that you will be intensely proud of achieving and, as stated previously, my favorite horror game up to this point. Monstrum will fill you with dread in ways that other horror games only wish for.","December 14, 2015","true","113.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The monsters are horrfying and having to hide doesn't make it any better. It reminds me of TJOC the way the steps strike fear into the mind.

There's plenty of variety in all 3 monsters regarding their strengths, weaknesses, traits and design. All of them play into a different human fear (horrific physical strength, being stalked and the supernatural respectively)\n\n+ Genuinely scary, which is sadly a rare sight among indie horror games. I always try to steer clear from the cargo bay as best as I can because I'm not venturing through that dark, creepy maze unless I'm absolutely certain I have to.\n\n+ A surprisingly huge amount of depth to gameplay. There's far more items than just the key items required to escape the cargo ship and they all have their uses.\nLighters can be used to illuminate an area or ignite a pool of gasoline on the floor to hold off a monster.\nTape is required to repair the life raft but can also be used to sabotage camera's.\nI'm telling you, it's amazing how much you can actually do in this game so it's sad to see some people (falsely) claim there's nothing more to Monstrum than hiding in lockers.\n\n+ Interesting setting. I don't believe I've seen a cargo ship used in horror games before but it really makes sense. It feels right for a horror game.\nThe ship itself looks really good and the rooms, from living quarters to engine room, are believable locations.\n\n+ The difficulty is just right.\nYou're going to die on your first playthrough. Probably also on the next. Possibly on many more to come.\nAnd that's okay. Because of the wide range of options in this game, I never really feel like the monster cheated or I died to unfair b*llshit.\nThis is why I don't mind this game being difficult even if you've already completed it several times. This, combined with the ship's random layout everytime you play the game, makes for great replayability.\n\n-----\n\n- Questionable animation quality.\n\n- Weak audio design, the audio is usually nothing but distant, broken steam pipes and a random noise once every few minutes that doesn't mean anything.\nAlso a BIG sound problem: The attenuation on some sounds is just plain misleading. Sound volume doesn't seem to be affected by distance in height, meaning it's impossible to tell whether a monster is roaring or thumping right next to you or  a floor safely above/below you.\n\n- Could use some performance optimisation, though in general it runs fine on most computers.","May 31","true","6.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As fun as that game is, it has a static map and it's possible to memorize and plan out the most efficient route to maximize your chance of success.  "Monstrum" currently includes two different monsters (three planned for final release) and features a procedurally generated environment, ensuring that no two playthrus will be exactly the same.  Your goal?  Run, hide, find items, and ultimately escape whilst being hunted.  If you can't handle horror games like the aforementioned "Slender" and/or can't even look at "Outlast" without crying uncontrollably, then "Monstrum" may not be the game for you.  As a fan of the horror genre, I'd say this one is well worth the price of admission.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMHl8HlOrrs","March 2, 2015","true","1.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ArchVoj/recommended/296710/","ArchVoj","Vojnitek","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ArchVoj/","30 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nIn a nutshell, Monstrum is one of the best examples of scare tactics used in video games. It's not perfect, of course, but it's orders of magnitude "creepier" than similar cat-and-mouse horror games like Alien: Isolation. The ambiant noises/music and limited storyline really add to the horror.\n\nIt's a very complex mixture between "I feel completely vulnerable and helpless" and "I think I can make it this time!", which is both weird and impressive. It might have something to do with the lack of 'saving', forcing the player to do or die...literally. Personally, I like that you have to start fresh every time - just like the old days. Modern gaming has gotten too dependent on being able to 'save' whenever is convenient, which only adds to the horror that this game brings.\n\nAlso, his game is hard. Very hard. Just because you beat it once doesn't mean you can beat it again. After playing for 10 hours, I only beat the game once, and it was only due to an accidental glitch (I think?). It's a really good challenge, and a lot of fun to play or watch.\n\nSo should you get this game? Yes. Especially if you're a fan of horror/survival. It's worth it.","March 13, 2015","true","13.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Yeah, we have some of that basic formula.\n\nHowever, this one is set on a procedurally generated derelict cargo ship, where you'll have 3 different means of escaping from one of the randomly picked 3 monsters currently present in the game. And I can assure you, it won't be easy. The monsters seem to have wallhacks at times, and the items needed to repair and use one of your escapes (a liferaft, an helicopter, a submarine) are randomly scattered across the ship, which is LARGE and easy to get lost in.\n\nYou'll need to survive long enough to find everything you need to escape using your smarts, your stealth, and your speed, should the need arise. You can run, you can create distractions, you can sneak, you can hide; whatever works at the moment.\n\nEach monster has different abilities and characteristics, and while you'll need specific items to escape, you'll also find several misc items that will help you survive longer, creating light to see better, noises to distract the monster or being able to stun it for a few seconds, letting you escape a certain death.\n\nWhile costing a fairly high amount of cash and not being completely bug free, other than suffering from poor performance in a few situations, it's completely worth a try. If your wallet is too light or you don't fully trust this game, just wait for major sales.\n\nWith this game you get the treat and the trick. With advanced AI, randomly generated rooms and items and high difficulty this game is certain to not become boring even after a while. And it will surprise you.

This is Gamer Guy (In a Suit) from the Echo Army YouTube channel! Today I am bringing you a review of the Survival Horror game, Monstrum. Monstrum was released on Steam back on May 20, 2015 by Publisher/Developer Team Junkfish.\n\n(NOTE: This was a review from a game in my own Steam library, it was NOT provided by the Developer and/or Publisher)\n\nVideo Review:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ZOe6aSNpwP4\n\nThe "Too Long, Didn't Watch" Review:\n\nGreat entry in the genre. Blend of Rogue-like and First-Person Horror is fantastic.\n4/5 A bit pricey, but solid. Worth the $.\n\nThe "Meat & Potatoes" Review:\n\nMonstrum is what happens when you take the First Person Survival Horror thing, do it right, then combine it with some cool rogue-like elements. Team Junkfish has really nailed it here. The ship you appear to be stuck in gets randomly generated for every play-through. There are some similarities of course, but it is definitely different each time. The best part of this mechanic though is the antagonists themselves. See, each time you restart this game, it could be one of 3 different monster-types trying to get you. Obviously, until you get to exploring, you have no way of knowing which and this could change your approach. THe gameplay is very easy and familiar to this type of game. Walk around, hide in cabinets/lockers when needed, run for your life occasionally, find stuff to solve puzzles (in the form of finding and managing an escape) and get the hell of this boat.   If you enjoy the horror genre in PC gaming these days, it really doesn't get much better. The visuals are great, the sounds are fantastic, the atmosphere is superb. It's a touch pricey, but well worth it. There is a ton of replayability here. A gem among the numerous horror games out there. Do not let Monstrum pass you by. 4/5.\n\nHappy Gaming!!!","December 1, 2015","true","1.4"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

It is damn solid. The game runs beautifully in VR, and looks great too. They also provide a little dial around you that tells you where you're character is oriented, and where you're looking with the headset. It's a good indicator for when you need to reset the headset orientation.\n\nIn fact, the VR is TOO well done. While playing with my Oculus Rift, I had never actually had pure terror instilled in me by a game before, and Monstrum did just that. I was cowering underneath a table, listening to the brute stomp around looking for me. Scariest gaming experience to date.\n\nNow let's look at the game's mechanics as a horror game. The thing they do right, is give you a goal right when you start. There's nothing I hate more than wandering around in a horror game not knowing what the hell I'm doing. What's the point if I don't have something to work for? And this goal actually adds a lot to the horror element. It gives the player a much greater sense of survival and wanting to live, making the game even more terrifying. The noise mechanic is also a pretty big staple of horror games, but for a reason, it works. It gives the player hope that they have a chance of escape in a bad situation.\n\nBasically, the game gives the player just enough ability to survive, while keeping the terror meter cranked on high.\n\n10/10 would crap my pants again.","October 13, 2015","true","1.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Because i love horror games like Outlast, Alien Isolation, and many others.\n\nThe game for the most part is a great concept and also for the most part well executed. The Idea of being stranded on a cargo ship with some creepy atmospere is done very well. The whole Idea of trying to find a way to escape via 3 differnt options the Helicopter, Raft orSub isn a cool Idea that adds replay value plus 3 differnt monsters which you will never know which one you will get just adds to the tension.\n\nSO this all sounds great so whats the major issue holding iit back from me giving it a thumb up?\n\nThe Monsters AI.\n\nThe first 5 minutes are fine to search for stuff then it shows up... and never leaves. I can hide away for 5-10 minutes sneak away from it move all the way to the other side of the ship and start searching for what i need again only to have him reappear 30 seconds to a minute later. and repeat this process all over again. I have tried multiple methods of getting it away from me and every time if i am lucky i might get 2-3 minutes to look for supplys again only to have to run all over again.\n\nThe Balance with it is just way to off. It goes from the fun scary "Oh crap i need to run and hide" to "AAAAHHH why wont you just get the hell away from me!!!!" in frustration. I have yet to even beat the game once. got close a few times but can never get the last item with out the monster non stop stalking me to the point io can get nothing done.\n\nI am hoping the AI gets fixed and i will be watching the patch notes  hoping for some kind of fix to the AI.\n\nUntil then wait on this one till its been updated. Trust me i really want to like this game and i think over all they did deliver on a very good horror game its just that AI is to frustrating.

I is very dark, which I think is an important thing for a horror survival game. Why did it last only 15 minutes ? Because I am too f...king scared to play longer right now. Hahaha\nI thought that maybe I could play for a while before running into a monster. Most of the horror games are like that, you know, the first time you encounter a monster is often only after some time, when you start to feel confident. But, in this game, after leaving the second room, I got a message : ''press left shift to run'' and that made me sick to the stomach lol. And when I got to the next room, I heard sick noises, clearly not human noises, if you know what I mean :P and they were close to me so I waited before going out but after a few steps, I saw a red light coming so I ♥♥♥♥ in my pants and ran to hide in the room, under the bed. the creature came in, walking around in the room while I was wondering how the hell would I find the courage to move and get away from this room. I waited a while and the monster finally leaved. When the noise of his steps were far away, I took my chance to go out, but the problem is that the monster came back quickly. So basically that piece of sh...was never too far and I finally ran into it and...died...The second time I tried, I could make a few more steps before running directly into what seemed like a dark blue fog or I don't know what the hell was that but, yeah it killed me, of course, lol. On my third try I managed to go to the helicopter, finding my new objective. Well, I died 2 minutes later, when I tried to go through what seemed to be a gas leak, and yeah it was ridiculous XD. I stopped playing because I had to go.\nSo ok I'm a ridiculous noob, but this game looks amazing, I mean, this kind of game scares my, but generally I am not scared after one minute of play. It surely his a great experience and I will try to beat this game, BUT the only ''problem'' I see is that if you die, the game is over. I am not sure because of course I did not have a long run so maybe if you get far enough, it saves what you have done. I don't know, but for me personally I would like to be able to save. We will see.\nI highly recommend this game to all the survival horror games fans. I would say it is a 10 out of 10. Maybe 9 out of 10 if you can't save your progression.

The only one that's actually scary (in my opinion, anyway) is the one that  actually runs, because you can hear his(it's?) footsteps chasing you . The one that  jumps around  is probably the second scariest, and then that last  ghosty  one is just kind of stupid (and not very scary at all, not even the first time it catches you).\n\nNot much replayability (at all), and one playthrough is pretty short. The plot/concepts is admittedly very bland and trash as well, and there aren't even any intense insane terrifying elements in the game to make up for that.\n\nDon't get this? It might be okay on an intense (INTENSE) sale if you're really curious/REALLY want it, but otherwise I'd reccomend other horror games with depth like Outlast or Amnesia (even though everyone's probably played those already but whatever shhhhhhh), or just watch a YouTuber play it.\n","June 2","false","1.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I said it. I am horror game noob. and this game don't have setting for difficulty adjustment.\nSo I'll write on noob's perspective.\n\nGame with permadeath + instadeath if it catchs you + you can't do anything about monster + random generated mission objects location + huge map + monster special ability Combo.\nThese are reasons that make this game great, sucks, and make it bloody rubish for noobies.\n\nmost of words are represent what exactly those words mean. so I'll explain the last.\n\nI played 7 hours and like 5 times are on hunter mod(monster name) and 1 is on ghost mod.\nHunter place sensor mine from thin air (especially near you and bloody container object location) that never goes away. So you can't never avoid that monster cause one or another situation like you can't go around the mine happens.\n\nwhat I am trying to say is player constantly forced to face the monster. which I think it's too much for noob.\n\nghost thing do exactly the same. It 'knows' where you are like using bad metal detector. it don't know exact pinpoint of your location. cause if it does. that will be bloody overkill even for normal players. but anyway. It keep following you and you can't avoid it.\n\nwhich I think it is too stressful for 'Noobs'\nand I know the very same reason I just say makes this game bloody tasteful for horror game fans.\nbut that reson gave me very little satisfation on this game and from my personal experience,\n\nI say This game is not for you if you think you are noob at horror genre expecially when you can't shoot the monster's face off.","December 18, 2015","false","7.0"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","1"

They don't do anything to advance a plot; I'm assuming that there isn't one. If there is, I'm not interested in knowing about it.\n\nThe rest of the game is walking from nearly-identical room to nearly-identical room until one of several poorly-animated and completely unrelated-looking critters eats my face. I wasn't sure whether to expect survival horror or what I'll call "running around powerless until you die or the game ends". It's definitely the second one.\n\nThe game doesn't appear to offer any form of weapon or even anything to slow down an evil thing coming for you. That feeling of helplessness could be either frightening or frustrating. In this case, it's frustrating. There's also very little cover, and there's no indication of whether you're successfully outrunning something pursuing you. Of course, if you stop and look, you're dead.

They don't do anything to advance a plot; I'm assuming that there isn't one. If there is, I'm not interested in knowing about it.\n\nThe rest of the game is walking from nearly-identical room to nearly-identical room until one of several poorly-animated and completely unrelated-looking critters eats my face. I wasn't sure whether to expect survival horror or what I'll call "running around powerless until you die or the game ends". It's definitely the second one.\n\nThe game doesn't appear to offer any form of weapon or even anything to slow down an evil thing coming for you. That feeling of helplessness could be either frightening or frustrating. In this case, it's frustrating. There's also very little cover, and there's no indication of whether you're successfully outrunning something pursuing you. Of course, if you stop and look, you're dead.

Stop. Don't do it. The game has no Vive support. It was designed for the Oculus and only the Oculus. You can play it on the Vive by downloading additional software and editing some shortcut targets which I did, but the game was not enjoyable at all. Steam does not even recognize that you are playing it and will show you having zero minutes played which is likely why you aren't seeing more negative reviews from Vive users. You need to have played for 5 minutes to write a review. I played for 11 on my pc without VR just to be able to write this since Vive time was not counted.\n\nAbout the game. It is a decent idea. You run around a dark scary ship, trying to avoid monsters, picking stuff up, completing objectives. The sounds are quite good and scary. The graphics are pretty bad and the controls are really bad. You basically have two options for controls. A keyboard/mouse which I think is ideal, but also chalenging since you cannot see it while in VR or an xbox style controller. The xbox controller is not as good, but it is easier to use without looking and better for standing while you play which is important. You can play seated, but you will likely get very nausous. I have a strong stomach, but after about 4 minutes of seated play I had to stop because I thought I was going to vomit. Standing is much better.\n\nPros: Sounds\nConcept\n\nCons: No Vive support\nControls\nGraphics Quality\nFew if any updates\nPrice\n\nOverall, I would not recommend the game. There are much better horror titles out right now and more coming in a couple weeks. I picked it up on sale for $5 so I am not overly disappointed, but I doubt I will ever play it again unless the developer adds full Vive support so it can be played more easily while standing with a better control system.\n","May 27","false","0.2"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","17","1","6","0","0"

Not to say that monstrum in my opinion is more then that, but more that it has a little something different to it, the environment alone is at least something new to look at, though the overall game play is similar to that of most other games of its genra.\n\nWhat the game does well is give you the feel of erieness, that something could and will jump out at you at any moment, the long winding corridors and maze like infastructure making it hard to memorize exactly how to win your next play through, letting it be different every time you go through it. Even the creature you are fleeing from changes from playthrough to playthrough, making it even more unpredictable as you go through it.\n\nHowever despite the games strong suits and low price it is still lacking in a few key features, and a little bit of a lack in forth coming information for the player. Now I am the first to say that a game is an alpha early access game and do want to remind everyone of that, but that doesnt excuse it from me at least mentioning a few of its current flaws. Starting with the interface.\n\nFor starters, there is no save feature, you have no method of saving the game or coming back to progress already made, once you quit, you have to start over, and though from what I can tell the game can run actually rather quick they can also take hours to find the proper gear you need if your under constant preasure from a creature that can kill you instantly.\n\nWhich brings me to a second issue, the AI. Unfortunatly the AI for these creatures seems to be a bit clunky, for one once they come close to you, even if they dont know where you are, they never stop following you, and there is no way from my experience or any others to get them to go away, they give you a few noise making devices such as radios, or coffee cups, but they have yet to truely show all that much effectivness other than to draw the monster directly to you and get you killed even faster with the way the ship is layed out with single hall ways and very small corridors to pass through, you essentially have only one way to go, and that is through the creature since it never leaves which I can promise you wont end well for you.\n\nThe goals in the game are also a bit on the hazy side, your journal updating randomly when you find things or see things, with no real actual concept of what it is exactly your needing to do, or go inorder to complete this new objective, I am all for open world indepandance, but with a monster that never leaves my ♥♥♥ no matter what I do, it be nice to have a little guidance as to where or what I need to do next or at least a general area in which to do it in.\n\nThey do give you a rudamentery map if you can find it hanging on the wall, but with litterally 4 sections and only 1 highlighted with a "you are here" arrow doesn't give you a ton to go off of. Needless to say I dont recommend the game for those that are wanting a new and different horror game, then this isnt yours, and if you do get the game, just remeber it is in early access, so there are still alot of issues but maybe the game will improve with time. For now I will try my hand at it some more, and see if I cant win at least one game.","February 18, 2015","false","1.5"," 39 of 146 people (27%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","27","39","146","12","15"

The possibilities there are absolutely blowing my mind, having all sorts of classic horror movie favorites, and potentially using multiple different monsters on the same map.\n\nAs for its current state, if you enjoy the survival horror genre this won't be anything mind blowing, but so far everything is very well executed. The random map generation is impressively organic while not feeling overly restricted or predictable. Multiple possible avenues for escape, and having to choose between them as you scavenge for the materials you will require to use them can be tense with a monster breathing down your neck. Needing to decide which things to bring with you for escape, as you can't carry them all, and leaving enough room for useful items like glowsticks/torches and fuses.\n\nGreat potential, good stuff so far, looking forward to seeing where it goes.","March 23, 2015","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/slave2machine/recommended/296710/","slave2machine","Slave2Machine","http://steamcommunity.com/id/slave2machine/","275 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nLet me start by saying I don’t like tightly-enclosed spaces.\n\nWhen I was younger, a few friends and I would play a neighbourhood-wide game of hide-and-seek. I liked to win, so I chose to creep down to our basement and put myself in an old steamer trunk in the darkest corner. I’d patiently wait inside the musty thing and, rarely, did anyone ever actually check inside. It had travelled over the world with the various trips it had been on, but over the years that smell of vacation gave way to a salty decay.\n\nMonstrum takes me back to that trunk.\n\nBilled as “a first person survival horror game which finds players stranded aboard a vast, derelict ship filled with traps, environmental hazards, and another passenger in the shape of a terrifying and deadly beast,” Monstrum looks more like BioShock and Alien had a child they quickly sold off for adoption shortly after birth. You don’t get a weapon. You don’t get to be the hero. Your only options are to choose one of three possible escape routes, gather the equipment necessary from scrap littered around the craft to make that happen, and get off the ship as quickly as you can before meeting a watery grave.\n\nDon’t forget, it’s not just a matter of finding a patch kit or tools, but you’re being stalked by a creature (creatures, actually) that would like nothing more than to floss with your grey matter.\n\nTo make things even more difficult, Scottish developer Team Junkfish has removed any hope of memorizing locations and pathways for your best escape routes by taking a page out roguelikes like The Binding of Isaac and created a procedurally-generated layout that changes with every play-through, you’re guaranteed a new game each time.\n\nShort answer; it's fantastic and scared the bejeezus out of me. Stop reading. Just pick it up now.","February 19, 2015","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If it goes into the price range of 5 to 10 this would be a great buy which would be an excellent pick up.\n\nGame Play -------> 8.0/10\n-Plot\nThe plot of the game is that you are on a ship not knowing who you are or what has happened.  So main objective is to get off the ship as well as trying to figure what else has happened while surviving/evading the monster that is on the ship.\n\n-Controls\nThere are a lot of controls.  I've played with both a controller and mouse/keyboard.  The controller makes it easier because everything is right there, but with the mouse/keyboard it is easier to escape/evade  (especially if you customize the buttons) the monsters.  It can get cluncky when you are rushing, but it works.\n\n- Playability\nThe game is different each time you play because the Ship is procedually generated. The developers have said there will be more sections.  Once you figure out which monster is stalking you or is on board the ship makes a difference because you know what to listen for.  You're looking for objects that can help you survive longer or help you escape.   There are no weapons per say to fight the monsters though there are ways to stall them or elude them.\n\nThere is a lot of interaction with environment whether it is foot steps, bumping into a chair, throwing a glass to make noise, or throwing a glow stick into a dark room.  Those last two will help get a monster off your tail.  The developers put a lot of thought into this interaction.  This isn't just a chase get away per say though you can do that, there are a lot of thoughtful things you can do to get away.\n\nSound -------> 9.0/10\nThe sound in this game is the very important.  This sound has really helped the atmosphere and causes you constantly asking yourself if that noise was "it".  From the dripping of water, splashing of waves, general metal noises on a ship this causes you to try and figure out what that really was, especially, at the beginning of the game, since you don't even know which beast is on board.  Once you know the beast that is giving you the chase you'll know what sounds to look for but still this ship has so many freakin sounds.\n\nWhich can cause you to lose sleep at night because the noises your house makes may make you to wonder if the monsters have entered your house.\n\nGraphics -------> 7.5/10\nThe graphics for the game are good (they're not top notchy) ESPECIALLY for an indie game.  The ship has rust stains, raft looks (and sounds) very much like a raft, to the details of draws and the inside of lockers (which you'll grow accustom to).\n\nDifficulty -------> 9.1/10\nThis game is very difficult. I've only made it off the ship once while the beast was in hot pursuit of me\n\nReplay --------> 10/10\nThis game has a lot of replayability for it is procedually generated. I was constantly thinking of things that I should have done after finishing playing.\n\nGame Value (this is the value that I WOULD pay for the game. This value is not necessarily how much I ACTUALLY paid for the game).\n\nI would pay in the low 10s (low teens). This game is a gem find if it is less than 10 and or even at 5, you will not be disappointed. If you see it 10 or less, pick it up and buy it for sure.  Though if it is at its current price (hovering around 15) it is a DECENT PICK UP.\n\nOverall Rating -------------> 43.6/50\n\nIssues/Complaints:\n\nI wish you could push or knock things into the path of the monster to give you some distance between them and you.\n\nOccasionally,  I feel that the monsters aren't playing by the same rules you are because they seem always to be able to locate you.  Even after you sneaked away or set off a noisy television to lore them to that room.  Several times I have been able to make it to the other side of the ship only to find that they're still right behind me or near you.\n\nThe game seems like it could have the potential to craft stuff or combine them but there isn't.  I wish you could set up some type of indicators to let you know if someone is really hot on you tail or if that was just you being paranoid after your shart echoes around and back to you on the ship.  I've experience some bugginess but it was just several times within the same game and this was the only occurence in 9 hours of play.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThis game is REALLY ENJOYABLE to play.  The atmosphere (visually and sound)  has been captured nearly excellently by the developers.  Hopefully, they'll add the ability to put obstacles in walk ways or set up noise traps in a room.  (Imagine the eerieness if you set up bells to ring when the door down the hall and then it rings or the cans you put them on the ground near the steps and you hear them get crumpled)\n\nIf you have questions about the game, feel free to message me them\n\n","February 14, 2015","true","28.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Instead, Monstrum focuses on realism and plays around how monsters would act (If they are hostile) in the real world. It has very good graphics and has a lot of production quality. Although there are only 3 monsters and 3 escape routes, I find myself playing it for an hour or two. The character animations are a bit odd, but I can definatley reccomend this game. My only requests are are you going to add more escape routes and monsters? And can you use the vents? you need a crowbar to break them open, which can be found in eletrically locked rooms.","January 24","true","74.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They have differing intelligance, speed, and strength, along with diffrent AI for how they work.\n\n+ Good replayability. There is 3 diffrent endings, and these endings have 3 diffrent sub endings, leading to up to 9 playthroughts for all content. Plus many secret achievments, and the monster is randomly picked each time\n\n+ A good challenge. This game will kill you a few times before your first win, but each time you die you learn something new about the game.\n\n+Good atmosphere. Dark claustrophobic corridors lead to a tense and creepy game, combinded with the sound it has a good atmosphere.\n\n---------------------------------\n\n- This game does cheat sometimes. You wont hear a monster coming, but it will suddenly be there without warning. One time, when putting a fuse in, the Brute (a monster that makes loud ♥♥♥ stomping noises and loud growls) somehow snuck up on me.\n\n- Yes they have unique AI, but it's not exactly good, I went into a room, monster opens one cabinet and just walks off. This makes no sense, combined with the fact that they almost never pick where you're hiding unless it sees you go there.\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nIf you have some spare money on you, I reccomend you pick this game up if you're at all interested in it.","February 6","true","17.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While I love Alien, this game is different; Alien is a game you can play once, and the scare mostly stops, you've experienced the game. Monstrum on the other hand has a lot of replayability because of the random generation, no item is in the same location, you never know what enemy you face, the rooms change, and it's just overall more challenging in my opinion. In conclusion; I love both games, but Monstrum is a better purchase if you want to get into the horror faster.","February 6","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For Monstrum, I am more than willing to make an exception. Be warned, this is long, pretentious and tries to be more cerebral than my brain can handle, but ♥♥♥♥ it, I love this game too much.\n\nThe premise:\n\nYou are alone on a ship.\nYou need to get off the ship.\nSomething else is on the ship.\nYou don't know what it is.\nYou don't know where it is.\nIt. Is. Hunting. You.\n\nAnyone who has played Slender, Outlast, Amnesia or any other screaming youtuber-bait knows the drill - darkness + beastie + orchestral stings = Not Another Generic Indie Horror Title amirite? Certainly I will not pretend that Monstrum is a title that pushes the genre's boundaries in any meaningful way; it is in essence a corridor crawler where you must find certain items to achieve a goal whilst avoiding a hostile entity that would like nothing more than to make you not be alive no more.\n\nWhat Monstrum is, is an exemplary and noteworthy addition to the indie horror family, one that I feel stands alongside Amnesia in terms of achievement. It earns this accolade through its incredible mastery of two distinct elements that are absolutely intrinsic to the basic concept of horror, be it within video games or entertainment media in general.\n\nThe first element is Sound. Any horror film/game/show worth its salt has at least a basic understanding that, while Sight is the sense that is the easiest to use to convey the imagination of the creator of the film/game/show, Sound is the ultimate doorway into the imagination of the viewer/player themselves. Sound can paint pictures, it can control emotions, and it can create POSSIBILITIES. In horror, Sight is the opening of Schroedinger's Box. In horror, Sound IS Schroedinger's Box. With Sound, there are no constants, only variables. And amongst those variables, horror crawls and chitters.\n\nIn Monstrum, as you travel around the claustrophobic corridors and gantries of the ship, ignorant of the location of your nemesis, things can seem quiet in a very stark, relative way. But Monstrum is not quiet. Wherever you go, you are beset by Sound, in the form of groaning doors, hissing pipes, humming electronics, crashing waves and hostile camera alarms. The ambient Sound is Monstrum is spectacular, creating a sense of sickening dread that I have only felt in a number of games that I can count on two fingers. Unusually, the most notable of these is the Sound that you as the player will create. Every step you take clangs and echoes through like ship like a demented church bell, every door you open screeches and wails like a titanium newborn. In terms of Sound, the actions that you as a player take create such a hideous, crunching contrast with the perceived silence that you will curse every door, every drawer, every step as you fight the urge to run before the Creature comes to investigate all the noise you're making.\n\nI'm not even going to mention the noises the Creature makes as it closes in on you. You can buy the game if you want a taste of that.\n\nThe second horror element that Monstrum, in my opinion, blows out of the park, is The Unknown. Historically, one of the best examples of the use of The Unknown is of course Lovecraftian horror, and the cosmicism principle that we are an infinitely insignificant species, at the non-existent mercy of beings, entities or powers infinitely greater than ourselves. This premise is tapped into by a significant number of video games, notably Call of Cthulu, Alone in The Dark (THE ORIGINAL ALONE IN THE DARK, LET ME BE CLEAR), Slender and even Mass Effect to an extent. Fear of The Unknown is an ancient, biological instinct, pervading millions of years of evolution, death, predation and cowering in the dark. It teaches us that inside Schroedinger's Box, there may not be a cat at all - there may simply be teeth, teeth that allow us to scream for half a second before clamping over our throat.\n\nThe ship in Monstrum is randomly generated each time you play. Every time you start a new game, once-familiar corridors, corners and entrances will evaporate, replaced with a new, alien configuration. Key items required to escape from the ship will move around like mischievous imps with every playthrough, taunting you with their absence. This flawless use of The Unknown means that in Monstrum, there is no real strategy guide, no Youtube walkthrough, and certainly no map. The only guide you will have is the one in your mind - the one you hastily scribble inside your head as you traverse new doors, new passages, new threats. This is where Monstrum achieves - no matter how many times you play, you cannot know all. No matter how many times you play......The Unknown will be there with you.\n\nFinally, we come to it. Your Nemesis. The Creatures themselves. Horror itself demands an antagonist, and Monstrum delivers not one, but three. Each time you play, the game will randomly select one of three completely different Creatures to come play with you. No spoilers, buy the game. All you need to know is that when you start a new game YOU DO NOT KNOW WHICH CREATURE IS ON THE SHIP WITH YOU. It is difficult to describe the feeling this elicits within me every time I open that first door, and I suspect that is because it is a feeling that I have rarely felt, perhaps have NEVER felt. It is The Unknown, boiled to purity and soaked into my soul. I don't know where I am. I don't know where it is. God help me, I don't know what it is.\n\nMonstrum unlocks the power of random/procedural generation in video games in a way that is blisteringly brilliant, a way that I cannot adequately intone. There are some minor issues with this game, but I cannot even begin to summon the wherewithal to mention them. Monstrum's use of Sound is devastating to the nerves, its cloying, rusty graphics a steroid to my wide, glistening eyes. This is indie horror.\n\nBuy it.","May 29, 2015","true","13.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

It cheats! On different plays, the magma monster has teleported across the ship, right to where I was at, even though it had no reason to know I was there. It never saw me in the bow of the ship, and I crouch walked down the length to the stern to not make any noise. Yet when I got there, he was right in the area of the rooms I was searching and immediately found me. And it's not like he was walking around the area, because there was no footsteps, he was just right outside the door when I opened it.\nI haven't had this issue with the other two monsters. I also hate how he will pace in front of a room you're in and never move on, even though he has no reason to know you're there. If he was legitamely looking for you, shouldn't he be moving around the ship instead of pacing across this one door for no good reason? And if he thought you were in there, why isn't he opening the door to check? He's just cheap and cheaty, whixh is disappointing because I love his look.\nIf you enjoy Damned, give this one a try.

The noices stopped. Am I save? I walked towards the nearest room to find 4 lockers, nothing more.\nTo test my hiding skills I hid in one of the lockers. Suddenly all the lights went of. I was afraid. For at least a minute I sat quietly in the locker. When I got out I saw that the lights were really off. Strange? I looked at the door and saw it was open. Hadn't I closed it?

It does its job really well, and I have a feeling it will scare players who legit try not to get scared. I have not had my heart pumping like this in a long time. The randomization just adds so much to the game, keeping both the game play and the fear fresh. even though 50% of the ship is not randomized, it does its job well of getting you lost.\n\nthe fear for me turns up to 12/10 when you use the oculus rift. I've never shook so hard in my life. you can imagine why.\n\nthe game play is solid. and I've never felt this much freedom in a horror game of this style, even more so than Outlast or Alien Isolation. Because you can go ANYWHERE you want on the ship, which ramps up the horror even more cause you feel like it REALLY IS up to you to go and figure out how to save yourself from the situation. no hand holding, other than with helping understand how to repair something (via shopping list to fix a submarine for e.g.). your own plans, your own decision, your own fault for getting what you need to get and failing to do so from monsters with there own plans as well.\n\nSeriously, the monsters are really smart and I can tell by the way they behave. If there are multiple places that I could be hiding, they'll just skim through all the rooms without checking under beds and stuff to save time and to try and keep me from running from room to room. And if they have a really good idea of where you are, they'll stick around in your room for a long, long time until they find you or give up. they're not there to be spooky, they are legit trying to eat your face to the best of their abilities. It gives you a true sense of being hunted, one which few horror games have achieved.\n\nthere tends to be a bug or two, but they are very rare and will never break game-play. In fact none of the bugs revolve around the player, so you'll never die a cheap buggy death. any bugs I've found revolve around the monsters, which is good cause you'll need all the help you can get :P\n\nEach monster has its own strengths and weaknesses, but no matter how well you know the monster, it can still catch you completely off guard. Remember, they are SMART. I remember a monster chased me down the side of the ship on the top deck, and I went into a red locker on the port side. I saw it rush past my locker. It stopped at the corner up ahead, sensing that it wasn't chasing a running target any more. so it began retracing its steps, trying to figure out where I went. it went back and forth in front of my locker. and each pass it went slower and slower and slower. I knew that one of those passes will result in it figuring out that I was right beside it the whole time. and I was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ myself with the realization. I ran the moment it did another pass on my locker, but even though I lost it, I was still shaking.\n\nget the ♥♥♥♥ing game. it's a real gem amongst the 2015 ocean of "scary" game wannabe's.\n\n","November 6, 2015","true","12.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Whoa!\n\nFor the first time throughout my YouTube horror channel hobby, I had to edit the volume down on a few select parts of my playthrough due to sheer panic. I should mention that this was combined with the Oculus Rift DK2 device, which should enhance the atmosphere and feel quite a lot (I have not tried without it, but judging by past experiences, the DK2 makes it seem so much more real and tense)!\n\nI play all my horror games blindly (going into the game without researching anything about it), and if you are reading this, then I think you should, too. Tune up your headset enough so you can hear the ambiance and detail. I remember at one point, I just crouched down in a corner, merely listening to the environment and trying to analyze something stomping around on another floor which was looking for something to eat, or at the very least something to scare the living soul out of!\n\nIf you enjoy games rich on atmosphere and ambiance, and if you enjoy being scared, then definitely try this out.

Every playthrough will be different than the last meaning items will spawn in different places each time you hit New Game. Making it last forever. The atmosphere is terrifying. I run this on a Intel HD Graphics Card along with 2GB Processor and this works like a charm. If you have the same kind of specs for your computer as mine than I suggest getting a game booster. Each of the 3 Monsters have different types of techniques and are very hard to avoid with the cameras in the way. The first time I played it was when someone gave it to me for free when it was still in early access early 2015. To the middle of the year I bought a computer, got steam, and downloaded this awesome game. This game also shares some simalraties with outlast and other labryinth type games. Some people might think that the graphics are a tad bit out dated but the model of The Fiend makes up for it. My favourite monster is The Brute who is the most agrressive and less intelligent compared to the 3 of them. The Hunter is more patient and waits in the vents until you set of a camera or pass him while he quietley waits. The Fiend is the smartest and is harder to lose against and hard to get him off your tale. The Hunter is the quietest and you cant tell when he`s coming. But The Brute and The Fiend have a uniqe warning. The Fiend is a ghost like demon and in hollywood movies they say that when a light starts flickering a spirit is near by. And when ever the The Fiend is near you can hear him floating and breathing, also lights start flickering too. The Brute stomps around and you can see his glowing face before he sees you.\nIn the end I think that this game deserves 5/5 because of the textures, the framerate, the models, the atmosphere, the options, and the overall story.\nAnd if there is an employee from junkfish reading, please add Sparky to the game. ( A 4th Monster Would Be Cool) Whoever doesnt know who Sparky is he was meant to be a prototype for the brute who would be able to punish the player for running. He works like weeping angels.\n\n\nI recommend this game for ages 12 +\n-MrPiggyKins\n\n\nP.S:\nIf there really is a junkfish employee watching, please add in a feature where all monsters can come after the player, Thank you!","October 31, 2015","true","99.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I really like it. Atmosphere is good, monsters are intimidating, it reminds me so much of  Outlast !\n\nIf i had to give constructive criticism, It would have to be towards the endings. Finally escaping the ship and the monster feels like an acomplishment. The simple ending pictures shown of you escaping is just a bit bland. I recommend making it so escaping has more feeling to it. After entering the raft/submarine/helicopter, show a cutscene of the player activating the escape and leaving the ship before cutting to a picture of the said escape route.\n\nFor example:\n\nRaft-  Show the player jumping on the raft and getting lowered to sea. While slowly drifting away, they look back at the ship as it fades to black.\n\nExtra- If the Brute was the selected monster, the player would see it standing at the edge of the ship as they drift away, making one last roar as it fades to black.\n\nHelecopter-  Show the player getting in the helecopter, activating it, and taking off to the sky as it fades to black.\n\nExtra- If the Hunter was the selected monster, it will jump on the windshield right after take off, startling the player. They will then spin the helecopter until it flys off. Then the player would fly away as it fades to black.\n\nSubmarine-  Show the player getting in, starting the controls, and drive away into the sea as it fades to black.\n\nExtra- If the Fiend was the selected monster, the player would turn around and see the Fiend in a door way. They would get in, start flailing with the controls, as the Fiend is heard trying to get in. The player then swims away, as the Fiend's cry is faintly heard, as it fades to black.\n\nThat's all I've got. Hopefully it helps with any future upadates that may occur.

Whoa!\n\nFor the first time throughout my YouTube horror channel hobby, I had to edit the volume down on a few select parts of my playthrough due to sheer panic. I should mention that this was combined with the Oculus Rift DK2 device, which should enhance the atmosphere and feel quite a lot (I have not tried without it, but judging by past experiences, the DK2 makes it seem so much more real and tense)!\n\nI play all my horror games blindly (going into the game without researching anything about it), and if you are reading this, then I think you should, too. Tune up your headset enough so you can hear the ambiance and detail. I remember at one point, I just crouched down in a corner, merely listening to the environment and trying to analyze something stomping around on another floor which was looking for something to eat, or at the very least something to scare the living soul out of!\n\nIf you enjoy games rich on atmosphere and ambiance, and if you enjoy being scared, then definitely try this out. If you also happen to have an Oculus Rift device (DK2 or newer), then YES, definitely put them on and play this!","March 13","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Instead, Monstrum focuses on realism and plays around how monsters would act (If they are hostile) in the real world. It has very good graphics and has a lot of production quality. Although there are only 3 monsters and 3 escape routes, I find myself playing it for an hour or two. The character animations are a bit odd, but I can definatley reccomend this game. My only requests are are you going to add more escape routes and monsters? And can you use the vents? you need a crowbar to break them open, which can be found in eletrically locked rooms.","January 24","true","74.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I really like it. Atmosphere is good, monsters are intimidating, it reminds me so much of  Outlast !\n\nIf i had to give constructive criticism, It would have to be towards the endings. Finally escaping the ship and the monster feels like an acomplishment. The simple ending pictures shown of you escaping is just a bit bland. I recommend making it so escaping has more feeling to it. After entering the raft/submarine/helicopter, show a cutscene of the player activating the escape and leaving the ship before cutting to a picture of the said escape route.\n\nFor example:\n\nRaft-  Show the player jumping on the raft and getting lowered to sea. While slowly drifting away, they look back at the ship as it fades to black.\n\nExtra- If the Brute was the selected monster, the player would see it standing at the edge of the ship as they drift away, making one last roar as it fades to black.\n\nHelecopter-  Show the player getting in the helecopter, activating it, and taking off to the sky as it fades to black.\n\nExtra- If the Hunter was the selected monster, it will jump on the windshield right after take off, startling the player. They will then spin the helecopter until it flys off. Then the player would fly away as it fades to black.\n\nSubmarine-  Show the player getting in, starting the controls, and drive away into the sea as it fades to black.\n\nExtra- If the Fiend was the selected monster, the player would turn around and see the Fiend in a door way. They would get in, start flailing with the controls, as the Fiend is heard trying to get in. The player then swims away, as the Fiend's cry is faintly heard, as it fades to black.\n\nThat's all I've got. Hopefully it helps with any future upadates that may occur. Once again, great game! :)","January 14","true","20.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They have differing intelligance, speed, and strength, along with diffrent AI for how they work.\n\n+ Good replayability. There is 3 diffrent endings, and these endings have 3 diffrent sub endings, leading to up to 9 playthroughts for all content. Plus many secret achievments, and the monster is randomly picked each time\n\n+ A good challenge. This game will kill you a few times before your first win, but each time you die you learn something new about the game.\n\n+Good atmosphere. Dark claustrophobic corridors lead to a tense and creepy game, combinded with the sound it has a good atmosphere.\n\n---------------------------------\n\n- This game does cheat sometimes. You wont hear a monster coming, but it will suddenly be there without warning. One time, when putting a fuse in, the Brute (a monster that makes loud ♥♥♥ stomping noises and loud growls) somehow snuck up on me.\n\n- Yes they have unique AI, but it's not exactly good, I went into a room, monster opens one cabinet and just walks off. This makes no sense, combined with the fact that they almost never pick where you're hiding unless it sees you go there.\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nIf you have some spare money on you, I reccomend you pick this game up if you're at all interested in it.","February 6","true","17.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While I love Alien, this game is different; Alien is a game you can play once, and the scare mostly stops, you've experienced the game. Monstrum on the other hand has a lot of replayability because of the random generation, no item is in the same location, you never know what enemy you face, the rooms change, and it's just overall more challenging in my opinion. In conclusion; I love both games, but Monstrum is a better purchase if you want to get into the horror faster.","February 6","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dracaerys/recommended/296710/","Dracaerys","Night Druid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dracaerys/","282 products in account",""A Monstrous, Horrific time!"\n\nMonstrum is a first person survival horror game which finds players stranded aboard a vast, derelict ship filled with traps, environmental hazards, and another passenger in the shape of a terrifying and deadly being..\n\nI've always found that ships are the perfect location for horror, yet they're rarely used.\nThere's the occasional movie, a couple of games, but nine times out of ten you're likely to find yourself poking around in an abandoned asylum or a creepy forest.\nMonstrum understands what makes a ship such a scary place. Totally isolated and painfully claustrophobic, it's an environment from which escape is nightmarishly difficult.\nFrom the moment you wake up on the ship, you quickly realise that you are, quite literally, stuck between the devil and the deep blue sea with very little chance to survive...\n\nEscape the ship!\nEscape is your solitary goal, and there are several ways to achieve this. You could make for a life raft, try to start the helicopter tethered to the main deck, or else head into the bowels of the ship and try to flee in the sub, if you can work out how to get it into the water.\n\nEach method of escape requires different objects to complete.\nYou'll need bolt cutters to remove the moorings on the helicopter.\nThe life raft is handled by a crane that must be fixed.\nThe sub needs power cells and a replacement headlight.\n\nThe objects needed to meet these goals are also subject to Monstrum's roguelike qualities, and shuffled and repositioned along with the corridors and rooms. The only constant is that you always start next to a room containing a torch and a fuse.\n\nGameplay\nGameplay takes the form of careful and methodical exploration, checking every room for essential items, as well as other objects that might prove useful: glowsticks, a fire extinguisher or flare gun, or just things like radios and egg timers that can create a distraction.\nThere are also environmental hazards, such as broken steam pipes (that can annoyingly kill you instantly) and security cameras which will sound a monster-alerting alarm if you linger in their frame for too long.\n\nIt's really all about the monsters though. So much so that revealing too much about them feels like the only thing in the game that could count as a spoiler.  The one revealed in screenshots and trailers is The Brute, a shambling muck-monster with gaping, glowing eyes and mouth.  There are also creatures known as The Hunter and The Fiend, each of which has its own unique and creepy design, and their own distinctive attack patterns.\nYou'll know The Fiend is nearby, for example, as it disrupts electricity, causing the lights to flicker.\n\nThis is, a ruthless perma-death game.\nMeaning, the only things that carry across from one playthrough to the next are the notes you'll find scattered around the ship, filling in the backstory of the strangely absent crew and offering not terribly subtle hints as to what's required to secure the various escape routes.\nPlaythroughs can be as brutally short as a few minutes, while a successful escape can take anywhere from 20 to 40 minutes depending on how lucky or cautious you are.\nIt's the luck factor that eventually turns Monstrum from a thrillingly sinister exploration adventure, to a frustrating game of chance.\n\nThe game is so random that there's almost no room for the player to exert any kind of agency or strategy. Which escape plan you opt for depends largely on which useful item you stumble across first, while finding the other items needed to complete the task are basically needles in a haystack.\nYou'll only work out what you need through accumulated failure, but even once you know exactly what to do, your chances of success are governed more by your luck, good or otherwise, with regard to the monster and the items spawned on the ship.\n\nEnemies of the dark!\nWhile they apparently have different AI criteria dictating how they hunt you, your encounters with them are almost always going to be the same: walk round a corner, get spotted, run, hide, fail to hide, get killed.\nThe chances to use the ship to your advantage, by locking doors or setting distractions, are minimised by the fact that you have no idea when or where you'll encounter the beast, and when you do it becomes more about outrunning them than outsmarting them.\n\nEnvironment!\nIn terms of production and design, Monstrum exceeds most other indie games of the same genre. Grungy as it is, it's still a lovely looking game.\n\nThe ship's random layout doesn't help in this regard, offering too many narrow linear corridors and dead end rooms with no hiding places. It's a shame, since it's a fantastic environment, and the reuse of endless, ever changing corridors and rooms lends the game a nightmarish quality.\n\nSadly, this feeling can turn into frustration as you search for the last elusive thing you need to escape, aware that any encounter with the monster is likely to find you starting over from scratch.\n\nAlien Isolation, one of my all time favourite survival horror games, works because you come to know the station, which has been designed in such a way that there's always a place to hide or an escape route to follow for the player who pays attention.\nMonstrum's spaces, limited as they are by their need to fit together in infinite ways, too often leave you with nowhere to go.\n\nVerdict:\nMonstrum works best in the first hour you spend with it.\nThat's when its monsters are still scary, the location is still mysterious and the randomised layouts are still able to excite you with their unknowable nature. It's no surprise that the game has been designed for VR.\n\nUnfortunately, that terror does eventually ebb away, not because the scares run dry but because progress so often falls to chance.\nBlundering around identical corridors, hoping to stumble across a solution before being assaulted by an unstoppable monster, makes for a brilliant one-off experience but is no bedrock for a satisfying long term challenge.\nThere comes a point where the player has to feel some element of control, some sense that they might emerge victorious through their own ingenuity rather than blind luck, and Monstrum offers such moments too inconsistently.\n\nDespite its flaws, I recommend it to anyone who loves survival horror.\nIt's scares may be brief, but I'll never forget the first time I came across the ghostly fiend, the alien-esque Hunter and the stupid lumbering brutes that roam the empty halls of this isolated ship.\n\nScore:\n7/10","February 13","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
