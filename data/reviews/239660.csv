(And FPS is my main genre with quite a bit of experience) It in many ways manages to match and in some places exceed both its F2P brethren as well as its more costly retail alternatives. SF2 is as you can tell, is a sequel to a once very successful F2P title back in 2004/2007 in Korea & later internationally by the name of Soldier Front/Special Force. This game manages to not only outdo its (very) dated predecessor but also remain a viable option in todays overpopulated shooter scene. Everything from the animations, guns, and gameplay very closely mimics its big brother Call of Duty, and does a damn good job at delivering the same experience without paying every year for a new edition (map packs included). The game oozes quality and definitely is the best you can get when it comes to free to play currently at the moment if you're looking for COD-style shooters.\n\nTHE GOOD\n+ Fantastic presentation & graphics for a F2P.\n+ Weapons are affordable with ingame cash & permanent.\n+ Quality COD-Style fast-paced gameplay.\n+ A slew of modes to choose from including Classic Defusal to Coop.\n+ Entertaining for both newbies and pros alike.\n+ Tons of people playing all the time.\n\nTHE BAD\n- Sometimes laggy players ruin a good match\n- Hacking players can be a pain in the ♥♥♥.\n- Community is horrible and abusive to eachother. (They crossed over from the first game)\n- No way to mute/report/kick undesirable players.\n- Female characters run faster and are harder to hit.\n\nTHE UGLY\nRaging 12 year olds from the philippines who constantly spam the chat with incoherent things like "aw" "vovo" and "base"\n\nBOTTOM LINE\nI can hardly think of any free-to-play shooters that manage to compare with full retail games this well. It's very impressive if you enjoy COD-Style shooters. If they managed to fix the hacking problem, the game would be perfect.\n\nHighly Recommended. 9/10","August 16, 2014","true","51.4"," 27 of 33 people (82%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","82","27","33","5","1"

It's amazing. I never did get bored as the game has constant patch and updates. (with new map packs etc.) The devs and forums are active. As you know this is a Free To Play game. In most FTP games you might expect a Pay To Win situation. But for SF2, the gun they first provide are pretty decent, and they also have daily log-in prizes. That way you're able to experience better guns, of course with limited time.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/skydancesenpai/recommended/239660/","skydancesenpai","xreprise","http://steamcommunity.com/id/skydancesenpai/","109 products in account","TL;DR at end of this review.\n\n\n\nSoldier Front 2 is the best MMOFPS of all time.\nThat's what I want to say.\n\nSoldier Front 2 is the ultimate CoD wannabe and fails horribly at trying.\nThat's a more accurate statement.\n\nI've put a lot of time into this game, so I know what I'm talking about. To begin, SF2 pits two teams in maps to fight to the death. Cool concept. But it's plagued with errors and mistakes and horrible development. Hitboxes in the game are the easiest out of any FPS I've played (Counter Strike, Tribes: Ascend, Blacklight: Retribution, HAWKEN, Combat Arms, AVA, just to name a few). Your head hitbox is literally the size of a watermelon. It's HUGE. Too easy to hit, too easy to be hit. Many times you'll run around a corner and after you're completely around it, some guy shoots you from behind by hitting that one corner of the hitbox that isn't even supposed to be there.\n\nThis game is plagued with lag. SF2 consists of "action-packed amazing adrenaline-rushing combat." When really it's "that guy's lagging, this server's lagging." You can spray an entire magazine into your opponent and have NOTHING hit. Then your opponent fires one shot. You die. From one shot. And he didn't take a hit. After an entire clip. That's what lag does, it gives the lagger an unfair advantage. Don't believe me? Sucks for you. Go find out the hard way.\n\nHackers. I don't need to say any more. The new kick function doesn't even work, because it shows you a random list of people, the hacker's username not being in that list. So you'll get to know a hacker pretty soon. They don't even speak English. They're Brazilian hackers. Even worse because they spam chat with poorly constructed sentences in some Portugese-English mashup. I don't discriminate Brazilians, but this gets intolerable.\n\nGame development. This game was meant to suck the money out of your pocket, then your mother's, then the funds of the U.S. Treasury. Cash shop guns are far superior than "normal" guns. The stats summary will READ the same, but INGAME it's "Become God for a day." All guns handle exactly the same. Just like CoD.\n\n\n\nTLDR: Don't play this game. It's absolute trash. Even Call of Duty is better than this.","March 17, 2014","false","278.1"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","8","12","2","1"

I honestly believe that this goes over the standard set by even the best triple A games. With truly innovative shooting mechanics that Resemble real-life to no end. With graphics that make the Division look like EAs left over steak dinner, with Intense animations that really reflect real life in a never seen before way. To say I recommend this game would be a lie with my large amount of time playing this game, it has become more than a game it has become a feeling.\n\n*Sponsored by Didgeridoo Incorporated*","April 4","true","0.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/therealchaz/recommended/239660/","therealchaz","STRESS","http://steamcommunity.com/id/therealchaz/","223 products in account","It's a good alternative to Call of Duty. Well, think of it as COD...but free (I actually prefer this).\n\nI would rate this 8/10. It's fun, easy to pick up and weekly updates/maitanance, requires skill (no aim assist) compared to COD.\n\n############# FULL REVIEW #############\n\nI'll start with the positive things about the game.\n\n- It's easy and fast to learn and pick up at any time.\n- Infinite replay value\n- Great gun play. All guns require some degree of practice to be able to use properly and they all a very different from each other. Some guns will require a lot more skill to master than others.\n- The graphics are decent and run really well on most computers. They're aren't amazing however.   Definitely not blockbuster or AAA.\n- The weekly event system is awesome as it encourages the player to try new things and get rewards for them. They even give away things such as SP (in game currency) just for logging in!\n- Monthly updates and maintenance which brings new content.\n- The variety of guns is great. There is a gun for everybodies play style.\n- The new weapon camo system is pretty neat as it allows for some degree of weapon customisation.\n- The maps are designed quite well, the maps are from small to medium sized which allows for intense fighting in close quarters. Pretty much every map has parts in which people who like to fight at range can take advantage of also.\n- If you buy a weapon from the game shop it is permanent. Unless you sell it of course.\n- I love the different game modes this has to offer, such as slaughter which involves one team playing as aliens and the other as humans, Smash with involves two teams of players fighting on three layers of easily broken glass. If a player falls through all three layers they go plummeting down to a spike floor with a small chance of landing on a moving bouncy pad and getting back into the fight. There are the regular Team Deathmatch, Deathmatch, Sabotage (planting and defusing a bomb) and seizure (capturing an item) game modes too.\n\nSome things I'm not too impressed by\n\n- The menu system is a bit off, It doesn't properly run in full screen mode and can be hard to navigate around at first, but overall quite bearable.\n- The rental system is a bit annoying. You can't buy permanently owned character items - you have to rent them for a certain amount of days.\n- No weapon upgrade system\n- If you want special skinned weapons with EO tech and ACOG sights you have to win them by gambling which means spending AP (Aeria Points) which costs actual money. I could buy 100 capsules/tokens and never receive a single permanent item, just some rental gun. They do give away free capsules every now and then which is good.\n- The odd glitch such as disappearing HUD and camera not functioning properly is a bit of a pain. Good thing it doesn't happen often.\n- The mamba character. This is some blonde chick in some tight clothing in high heels. It's a sexist portrayal of women in combat. The male characters in this game are all wearing combat gear.\n\n\nThe gameplay is this: Kill or be killed. It's easy to kill and easy to be killed. There is no aim assist. So if you can't aim for headshots you're dead. Thats about it.\nIf you're new to this kind of game don't worry, there are servers dedicated for you to get to grips with the game. Once you're good enough you'll graduate and move onto the open servers.\n\nSome people think this game is "Pay to Win". I think not because you don't actually need some fancy AUG Mk4 weapon to win. Many of the best pro players use the basic AK 103 and M4a1 given to player from the start. The special paid guns do make it easier but you don't actually need them to be good at the game.  The special weapons, character items and VIP subscription may help you to a extent but you can still be very bad at the game and lose to a player who pays nothing.\n\nAbout hackers, there are a few out there but not too many. Most people kick them from the game and are dealt with quickly. So you don't have to really worry about them.\n\nHope that wasn't too long.","December 12, 2013","true","230.9"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

There are items out there you can pay for, but the neat thing about this game is that when someone with an OP gun get shot and dies, you can pick up their gun and use it until you get killed (or run out of bullets)  What I also like about this game is that you almost NEVER run into hackers. In 400 hours I've only seen 3 obvious hackers.\n\nKeep in mind though, there are many people in this game that have 1,000 hours or more played and they are very very good.  But there are also plenty of noobs that fight like they've never clicked a mouse, so you can pwn them.   Also, if you are not that good, you get to go to the newbie rooms where the good players with anything over i think .9 k/d ratio are not allowed to enter so don't worry about your first time playing.  If you suck at FPS, you get to stay in the newbie rooms for a while while you get good without fear of the same level 55+ player killing you for hours upon hours like in other FPS games.","July 20, 2014","true","061.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","4"

Because they add blurry photoshopped faces for each players.\n\n2.Gameplay\nIt's just like the fun mode of Call of Duty.A lot of game modes,including innovative MOBAFPS in the hero mode.I don't really like the idea of making fun of the character's appearances,though.You see,I love their idea of choosing appearences from famous anti-terrorist or special forces from all around the world,BUT,I feel immediately disappointed when I see unlockable characters in the shops which uses sexy clothes for females,or unrealistic equipments.Whose idea is it ? A girl in bikinis bringing a machine gun ? Seriously ? The unrealistic characters really destroys the gameplay for me.I guess Soldier Front 2 characters is badly influenced by asian cultures in gaming like the other games.Don't get me wrong,I'm also asian.It's just most asian games developers tend to add these unrealistic characters in online games only to add sexy females characters to attract more players.This is an overwhelmingly stupid idea which destroys most of asian games.Seriously.Stop it,asian developers.\n\n3.Pay to Win system\nWell,yes and no.Yes,you can buy more guns using AP (Aeria points) which you can buy at their website.Their AP Recharge system using steam wallet isn't working apparently.But no,you can't win if you use AP guns or characters.They only boosts your exp points and in-game currency rate to help you save your time to advance in the game progress.\n\n4.In-game community\nFirst impression : I'm shocked.Really.You'll find a whole freakin' lot of non-english speaking kids with red pings.They only speak languages I never heard of and God knows where they come from.The community is really badly infested with these 12 years old aliens and they WILL vote kick you if you're in the first place or if you kill them more than twice.Yes,I maybe generalizing the fact.But I find the same thing over and over.I only found ONE english speaker from my past two games through Steam,who types "don no" when he means "don't know".Most of the alien kids only knows two english words,which is a profanity beginning with F and "kik"(I'm pretty sure they meant "kick",because the vote kick started right after that).These "alien kids" have existed far before the game is available in Steam.At least that's what I found.I'm sure there're also a lot of mature,civilized,intelligent humans in this game.\n\nShould you play this game ?\nYes,I recommend it even if the community is a hell on earth and most of my reviews only shows the downside of the game.But the gameplay is really fun and as far as I know,it's the best free to play MMOFPS game I ever found,with A.V.A online on the second place.The offer permanent weapons and that's really all you need other than the fun gameplay and acceptable graphics.Play it,and kill as many 12 year olds alien kids as you can.It's fun seeing them rage quits after failing to convince other players to kick you in their alien language.Trust  me.","December 26, 2014","true","2.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198058203340/recommended/239660/","76561198058203340","Syro","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198058203340/","12 products in account","This is a lengthy review, so scroll downf or a full report!\n\nHaving played this game a fair bit and getting up to level 26 in-game, I can say that this is well-worth the time and effort to play. I've played a large number of free to play shooters out there (nearly all of the most popular ones) and this one is the only one that can deliver on most bases successfully.\n\nThe biggest issue that seems to trouble most FPS games out there today (speaking FREE TO PLAY FPS games) are cash-shop imbalances, and currency gains.  Some games deliver on one, but lack on gameplay or maps, or somewhere else. At least that's what it feels like, Soldier Front 2's cash shop items are primarily cosmetic differences fromt heir normal counter parts. The stats on the weapons are listed and you can compare the regular weapons to the premium weapons, at most the differences are a different skin and occasionally a different optic which can also be obtained through buying the advanced version of each weapon through gameplay. It takes longer, but it is not game-breaking by ANY means. I myself, prefer good ol' iron sights as I'm sure plenty of others do as well.\n\nOn that topic, let me talk about the currency system. You start out with plenty enough to buy your first weapon, and maybe even a secondary weapon that are -permanent-. There's not that many weapons in the game compared to some other shooters out there, but it comes at the cost of all the weapons being relatively balanced and even with that in mind there is still a solid variety of weapons to choose from. The choice of the weapon you use is almost always dependant on your preference via aiming patterns, recoil, rate of fire, etc. Whatever suits your playstyle. The currency gains had me worried at first, though the following week I decided to give it another go and check out the weekly missions and all of my concerns were alleviated. On top of the traditional SP guage that fills up gradually as you play (some of you may remember from Soldier Front 1), the missions grant you these capsules which grant you items, currency, and different cosmetic things as well. You can win up to 1,000,000 SP from a single capsule. After playing for only a couple of hours, I was able to buy two different weapons and have SP left over.\n\nA couple of things to note before you read the pros and cons, is that Soldier Front 2 does not offer weapon customization like other games may include such as Call of Duty, or A.v.A. or Combat Arms, instead it offers 5 slightly altered versions of the weapon you are using that you may purchase. For example, say you started with the AK-107, you will start with a basic version of the weapon. As you gain more kills with it, at certain intervals (75, 150, etc. as examples, not actual numbers) you will unlock AK-107 Version 2, which will be the same weapon with an increased rate of fire at the cost of some firepower. Later versions offer similar give and take versions, such as more fire power at the cost of rate of fire, or magazine size at the cost of weight as you get more kills with that weapon. While this does not seem as creative or fun as some other games, what you result in is a very balanced weapon progression system that ensures competitive gameplay across the board. I prefer the competitive nature of the game at the cost of pretty weapons, all day every day. If tinkering with guns is your thing, I would suggestion Blacklight: Retribution anyway.\n\nThe other thing to note is that headshots are REWARDED. The hitbox for the head in this game is NOTABLY smaller than in other shooters. This will be plainly obvious for you to see, but you are rewarded for taking those shots! Spraying into someone at a distance may cause your rounds to be scattered and it may feel like they're just super tanky and you can't do anything to take them down, but one shot to the head and they are gone. The difference is very noticeable, aiming for the head becomes a second nature while playing this game. What you're thinking might be "Oh well I always aim for the head, this means nothing!" and that's what I thought too, but because of the smaller hit box you will find yourself trying to squeeze those headshots in as much as possible. The feeling I get when playing this game is that I have to be very cautious with shot placement, none of that "3 shots in the leg woops you die!". This may or may not be appealing to some, while it doesn't exactly get any points for realism it gets huge points for competitive play.\n\nPros:\n-Solid game play\n-Varied game modes, including PvE content\n-Very competitive\n-Rewarding weekly missions/objectives\n-NO requirements to join a "Corps" (clan/guild)\n-Huge improvements over the first Soldier Front\n-Balanced weapons\n-Great currency earning rate, if you work for it\n-Shares similarities with Call of Duty\n\nCons:\n-Once you hit a certain k/d ratio, you will be kicked out of the newbie channel -permanently-\n-Open channel may be discouraging at first, veterans and newer players alike\n-No health regeneration\n-You do have health points and armor points, like older FPS games such as Counter Strike. May not be appealing for some.\n-Virtually no weapon customization, may turn some away\n-Shares similarities with Call of Duty\n\n\nI hope you took the time to read this review before you consider playing this game, and I hope that it helped paint a picture for some of you that may be trying it out for the first time! Keep in mind that I have played just about all of the popular free to play titles out there, I won't say all because that's a bit cocky and I'm sure I haven't. The titles I mention include Planetside 2, Combat Arms, A.v.A., Wolf Team, Counter Strike, Operation 7, Gunz, and several others.\n\nSee you on the battlefield, soldier!","April 23, 2014","true","48.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

One of the best balanced games that I have played that is f2p. Of course if you pay to play, you will have an advantage. However, if you keep on playing you will get better and eventually be able to get the pay to play guns with in-game currency. It just takes a long time. Finally, if you get good enough, you won't need the bigger guns because you willl uunderstand the mechanics of the game, and be able to own with the starter weapons.\n\nI strongly reccomend this game for serious players, and also gamers who want some fast paced fun.\n\nDO NOT DOWNLOAD IF YOU GET FRUSTRATED REALLY EASILY; REMEMEBR IT'S A GAME AND IT HAS IT'S MOMENTS.\n\nOnly thing I hate is it takes forever to rank up.

One of the best balanced games that I have played that is f2p. Of course if you pay to play, you will have an advantage. However, if you keep on playing you will get better and eventually be able to get the pay to play guns with in-game currency. It just takes a long time. Finally, if you get good enough, you won't need the bigger guns because you willl uunderstand the mechanics of the game, and be able to own with the starter weapons.\n\nI strongly reccomend this game for serious players, and also gamers who want some fast paced fun.\n\nDO NOT DOWNLOAD IF YOU GET FRUSTRATED REALLY EASILY; REMEMEBR IT'S A GAME AND IT HAS IT'S MOMENTS.\n\nOnly thing I hate is it takes forever to rank up. There are 3 ranks to any given rank. This is anoying but you get used to it.\n\n\nI give it like 4.2 stars-Mostly good, some improvements could be made.  But, there is new content and updates when needed. As well as a rotating item shop. Only bad thing about the item shop is they constantly advertise to get you to buy items with real money.\n\nGive it a shot!","April 20, 2014","true","4.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've played a large number of free to play shooters out there (nearly all of the most popular ones) and this one is the only one that can deliver on most bases successfully.\n\nThe biggest issue that seems to trouble most FPS games out there today (speaking FREE TO PLAY FPS games) are cash-shop imbalances, and currency gains.  Some games deliver on one, but lack on gameplay or maps, or somewhere else. At least that's what it feels like, Soldier Front 2's cash shop items are primarily cosmetic differences fromt heir normal counter parts. The stats on the weapons are listed and you can compare the regular weapons to the premium weapons, at most the differences are a different skin and occasionally a different optic which can also be obtained through buying the advanced version of each weapon through gameplay. It takes longer, but it is not game-breaking by ANY means. I myself, prefer good ol' iron sights as I'm sure plenty of others do as well.\n\nOn that topic, let me talk about the currency system. You start out with plenty enough to buy your first weapon, and maybe even a secondary weapon that are -permanent-. There's not that many weapons in the game compared to some other shooters out there, but it comes at the cost of all the weapons being relatively balanced and even with that in mind there is still a solid variety of weapons to choose from. The choice of the weapon you use is almost always dependant on your preference via aiming patterns, recoil, rate of fire, etc. Whatever suits your playstyle. The currency gains had me worried at first, though the following week I decided to give it another go and check out the weekly missions and all of my concerns were alleviated. On top of the traditional SP guage that fills up gradually as you play (some of you may remember from Soldier Front 1), the missions grant you these capsules which grant you items, currency, and different cosmetic things as well. You can win up to 1,000,000 SP from a single capsule. After playing for only a couple of hours, I was able to buy two different weapons and have SP left over.\n\nA couple of things to note before you read the pros and cons, is that Soldier Front 2 does not offer weapon customization like other games may include such as Call of Duty, or A.v.A. or Combat Arms, instead it offers 5 slightly altered versions of the weapon you are using that you may purchase. For example, say you started with the AK-107, you will start with a basic version of the weapon. As you gain more kills with it, at certain intervals (75, 150, etc. as examples, not actual numbers) you will unlock AK-107 Version 2, which will be the same weapon with an increased rate of fire at the cost of some firepower. Later versions offer similar give and take versions, such as more fire power at the cost of rate of fire, or magazine size at the cost of weight as you get more kills with that weapon. While this does not seem as creative or fun as some other games, what you result in is a very balanced weapon progression system that ensures competitive gameplay across the board. I prefer the competitive nature of the game at the cost of pretty weapons, all day every day. If tinkering with guns is your thing, I would suggestion Blacklight: Retribution anyway.\n\nThe other thing to note is that headshots are REWARDED. The hitbox for the head in this game is NOTABLY smaller than in other shooters. This will be plainly obvious for you to see, but you are rewarded for taking those shots! Spraying into someone at a distance may cause your rounds to be scattered and it may feel like they're just super tanky and you can't do anything to take them down, but one shot to the head and they are gone. The difference is very noticeable, aiming for the head becomes a second nature while playing this game. What you're thinking might be "Oh well I always aim for the head, this means nothing!" and that's what I thought too, but because of the smaller hit box you will find yourself trying to squeeze those headshots in as much as possible. The feeling I get when playing this game is that I have to be very cautious with shot placement, none of that "3 shots in the leg woops you die!". This may or may not be appealing to some, while it doesn't exactly get any points for realism it gets huge points for competitive play.\n\nPros:\n-Solid game play\n-Varied game modes, including PvE content\n-Very competitive\n-Rewarding weekly missions/objectives\n-NO requirements to join a "Corps" (clan/guild)\n-Huge improvements over the first Soldier Front\n-Balanced weapons\n-Great currency earning rate, if you work for it\n-Shares similarities with Call of Duty\n\nCons:\n-Once you hit a certain k/d ratio, you will be kicked out of the newbie channel -permanently-\n-Open channel may be discouraging at first, veterans and newer players alike\n-No health regeneration\n-You do have health points and armor points, like older FPS games such as Counter Strike. May not be appealing for some.\n-Virtually no weapon customization, may turn some away\n-Shares similarities with Call of Duty\n\n\nI hope you took the time to read this review before you consider playing this game, and I hope that it helped paint a picture for some of you that may be trying it out for the first time! Keep in mind that I have played just about all of the popular free to play titles out there, I won't say all because that's a bit cocky and I'm sure I haven't. The titles I mention include Planetside 2, Combat Arms, A.v.A., Wolf Team, Counter Strike, Operation 7, Gunz, and several others.\n\nSee you on the battlefield, soldier!","April 23, 2014","true","48.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wunderwaffen/recommended/239660/","wunderwaffen","WunderDash","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wunderwaffen/","139 products in account","Soldier Front 2 is overall a fun, fast paced action game with inspiration from games like Battlefield and Call of Duty.\n\nWeapons\n------------\nSoldier Front 2's weapons feel powerful and heavy, such as in all good FPS games. Most guns are heavy hitters as a starter assault rifle or pistol does about 60%-70% damage PER SHOT! Sniping is respectably easier in Soldier Front 2 which allows many people to become the accurate damage dealers that they wish to become. Most weapons are purchasable through just playing the game and earning SP (The in-game currency). You can buy and funnel real-life currency into the game and that will obviously give you the edge over starter or beginner players, but I have on several occasions defeated and dominated players that have custom or bought weapons, So there is no worries if you cannot afford getting high powered expensive weapons.\n\nMaps\n--------\nThe maps within Soldier Front 2, have a certain something to be desired but offer a good gaming experience. Several maps are just "killhouses" such as "Dam" which allows enemy snipers on several occasions and several different vantage spots to camp senceless and pick off any clueless victims. There are better and bigger maps such as "Farm" and "Riverside" which is long range tactical 8v8 experience that leaves the player feeling happy with his/her progress and kills.\n\nCustomisation\n----------------\nThere is a wide range of customisation options in Soldier Front 2 that lets the player become his/her own soldier and create his/her own character instead of being a randomly generated soldier in such games as Call of Duty. This lets the player feel as if he/she is the soldier instead of just being a name. Items such as Hats, Glasses, Helmets, Different force uniforms, Bandannas and masks really let you customise your soldier, many of these items are purchasable with SP and will only last 7 - 31 days depending on how much you spend on him/her.\n\nVehicles\n----------\nSadly there is no drivable vehicles in Soldier Front 2 as the maps and gamemodes are based on "Deathmatch" settings and have no exploration rewards, Just kill, kill, kill for your experience.\n\nLeveling\n------------\nSoldier Front has a very long and tedious leveling up system, I have personally clocked about 30 Hours into my character and he is only level 25. Expect a long and arduous journey but you will enjoy the ride.\n\nCommunity\n--------------\nThere is an in-game and in-lobby message system and a friend system that allows you to keep in contact and play with your comrades in arms, people are not very "sour", but occasionaly you will get a raging 12 year old telling you that you are a f****t because you killed him. His is evident in most FPS games and unfortunately happens here as well. Just stay friendly and they will be friendly back.\n\nIn summay Soldier Front 2 is the game to play for a frantic FPS multiplayer struggle, I have a 2Mb connection and play comfortably with a green ping at most times, some non-european servers have a touch of lag, but I am currently in Southern Africa. This game will leave you satisfied as it is completely free to play! Thumbs up!","May 3, 2014","true","44.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has a variety of different and unique gamemodes, events eqiupment & weapons. One of the new features in SF2 which were not available in the first game is throwable melee weapons. Compared to the first game there are a few new maps and characters and every thing looks newer and more improved. It is also nolgastic to play on the remade versions of the old maps. (Some of which have new names).\n\nThere are also better features for players who use Aeria points. Some of which are being a VIP and making rooms with bonuses players. Also players who use Aeria points have a slightly higher advantage in games that other players. This is because they can get new exlusive and better weapons at a lower than required rank.\n\nOverall I recommend playing Soldier Front 2 and give it a 9.5/10","February 4, 2014","true","165.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

What is gamebreaking is lag. It seems that 9/10 players in the game have their connection rated as a little red dot which means it's weak (ideally the dot should be green). Obviously this causes issues for those of us who've moved into the 21st century and stopped using dial up. In its current state I wouldn't recommend this game.

Game play is solid, the graphics are decent also, plenty of modes to play and a large player base. you cant complain really.

It has decent graphics and is really fun to play. Depending on your experience with shooters this is pretty simple to play. Headshots are very easy to get and the movements are really simple so anyone can be decent if they give at least a day to learn the game. There are very few hackers (over the past month I've seen none) which makes this game better than CA (imo). Unlike most F2P FPS, it is not P2W (pay to win), instead it's pay to have slightly more variety in weapons and to look fabulous. People with VIP do NOT have elite mod status like in CA so when you do well no one can kick you until after the game which is nice. A vote kick option is there but a huge majority of your own team must vote YES to kick you during a game.\n\n(I know I've been bashing CA quite a bit, but hey, it's another F2P FPS and comparing "key" issues is nice)","April 17, 2014","true","101.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Absolutely no money is required to participate. I must add that once you have experienced the totality of the game you will almost for certain feel the need to pay small amounts to enhance your experience. Furthermore, the graphics, maps, gameplay and stats are all a +1 in my book. Batlefield scenarios are mixed in different map modes. Predominantly close quaters with locations for snipers to deny an area. They have specific map modes that  cater specificly to the sniper to allow some seperation for the guys who like pure cqb, That being said there are still snipers in CQB maps. Weapon abilities are mixed and vary. I can't say there is an Uber weapon but others in the right hands own all.\nOK on too some mixed negatives. Head shots are your primary focus. If you like to aim center mass...you are already dead. This game is a tutorial in head shots. I am getting better, but I suck compared to players with vast more game time than I.\nSome maps are linear and force a stalemate battle.  This is mostly due to the fact no body reads the Art of War any more.\nHope this helps in making your decision to play a bad ♥♥♥ FPS, compared to call of duty and BF, right on par.","February 14, 2014","true","522.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Game modes consist of classic modes like Team Deathmatch, Sabotage (pretty much classic CS game mode), Corp Battles (clan battles) and a survival based mode vs aliens.  The game is not pay to win if you're decent at shooters, the payed guns are only marginally better than the free ones,  and there's a wide selection of perfectly viable free guns anyway (in fact one of the most popular guns is one of the default starter guns).\n\nCons would be that the UI feels very cluttered and confusing at first, and the game does push store items in your face often, but there's pretty much no reason to buy anything from there excpt cosmetics.\n\nOverall I give it a 6/10, as there's still room for improvement, but it ain't half bad for a free game.","August 14, 2014","true","16.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

I am not very fond of the durability system, so it becomes hard to unlock new guns and upgrades and accessories unless you make purchases.  After all it is a free-to-play, so if your not expecting a catch you must not be a gamer, or your just plain blind (No offense to blind people).  If anything not unlocking guns very often gives you time to adjust to certain guns, have favorites and specialties, and also appreciate guns that you recently unlock more than you would with fast leveling, getting loaded with weapons games.  Sure this game may run very slow on certain aspects for certain computers, and the graphics may not be fantabulous, but this game is free-to-play and certainly meets my expectations (which are low for pay to wins), but despite that, I constantly find myself coming back!  Mostly because there is a rare chance of coming across someone who is annoying or rude, and also because the friend, and social systems are really good!

But if you would like to read my review go ahead. It was truly an unreplacable game) Soldier front 2 is an FPS game. It is basically a free version of Call Of Duty Black Ops II. Made by Aeria games, Soldier Front 2 focuses on multiplayer battles instead of single player battles like Black Ops II in the campaign. Soldier Front 2 has amazing graphics and stunning features.\n\nThe guns in soldier front 2 have good and balanced damage, weight, firing rate and recoil makes gameplay smooth and great to play. The maps are well designed and they are easy to learn so being good at the game is based entirely on skill. Soldier Front 2 has developed their guns well with great skins and phenomenol muzzle flash. The lightiing isn't too bright or too dark and you can easily set the game options with a few clicks. The guns look realistic and the first person perspective makes everything look lively however, the guns are really similar  to Call Of Duty Black Ops II. There are dual guns and guns similar to ACRs, M4s and lots others.\n\nThe game has lots of game modes such as alien survival, alien defense, competetive, open, newbie and . Aliens in Soldier Front 2 are called Xanthid. Xanthid survival is where aliens start swarming in from everywhere and you must survive for the longest time. Xanthid defense is where Xanthid invade your territory and you must kill them and complete waves while defending your core. Competetive channel is for hardcore players who play competetively to gain titles and earn a good reputation. Open channel is for all ranks for noob levels to pro levels. Newbie channel is for players who have just started playing the game or are for people wanting to troll beginners. Finally, the Xanthid hero mode is basically like league of legends in first person shooter mode. To win you must destroy the other teams nexus by buying guns, perks, upgrades and farming mobs/players/turrets.\n\nTo conclude everything, this game is awesome! Great graphics, great gameplay, great guns, great maps, great features and great game modes. Recommended for everyone of all ages. Can be played by kids in the newbie channels and can be played by teenagers/adults in the open/competetive channels.\n\n9.5/10\nChop\n2014","October 3, 2014","true","35.0"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","7","14","3","1"

I am not very fond of the durability system, so it becomes hard to unlock new guns and upgrades and accessories unless you make purchases.  After all it is a free-to-play, so if your not expecting a catch you must not be a gamer, or your just plain blind (No offense to blind people).  If anything not unlocking guns very often gives you time to adjust to certain guns, have favorites and specialties, and also appreciate guns that you recently unlock more than you would with fast leveling, getting loaded with weapons games.  Sure this game may run very slow on certain aspects for certain computers, and the graphics may not be fantabulous, but this game is free-to-play and certainly meets my expectations (which are low for pay to wins), but despite that, I constantly find myself coming back!  Mostly because there is a rare chance of coming across someone who is annoying or rude, and also because the friend, and social systems are really good!

Task manager shows it being non responsive after I press the big green start button. I downloaded the game and downloaded all 5 patches and when I press start nothing happens the game is just non responsive. Complete waste of my time and bandwidth. The worst part of all this is when I look at task manager it shows that the game is using up resources. You heard that right! It is using up cpu power (all of it game maxes my cpu at 100% usage) and the game is using up memory at a fast pace while its being non responsive. If I did not know better the way this non responsive game is acting I would think this game was a virus. DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS NON RESPONSIVE GAME. You will save time bandwidth and your computer resources if you just go and play something else.","March 15, 2015","false","0.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","43","3","7","2","0"

At first they marketing the game with trailers, gameplays and even screenshots that's make people think it's just another Call of Duty clone, but guess what? it wasn't, not even a tiny bit.\n\nThe game is pretty balance in term of gameplay but it did have some P2W issue here and there. The graphic is not so great or bad either way since it just an online game. The game core is still the same as the original: Competitive FPS, but still fun and entertain - it doesn't even give you stress and rage like CS:GO did. Don't get me wrong about the game being competitive or fun at the same time. I mean serious, this game could be an eSports game if it's not have the cash shop weapon system include.\n\nThe game is very good overall, the only bad thing is the player base, not much of them left. This game deserve better, really high quality for a free to play game, but not much people know and appriciate that, I feel kinda sad for the dev. The game could be equal to CS:GO if it has the right "push".\n","January 12, 2015","true","16.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I approve of it. It is fps game. It stands to the point of its fps as it relates to reality abit when you can't actually look at yourself without a mirror or photon reflection because of being less transparent or less particles of the reflection. I would type that this game is definitely one of the fun moods for a game of playing it in my opinion. For the shatter partyhouse map, it is definitely fun, it's like playing a familiar game when aging for me. You get to smash the glasses for people to fall but it can risk them being killed and another half, not. Racing to the middle to claim a gun or weapon if you want. Tactics performed to win. Can or not be Pay2win in my opinion because there are events where you can win guns and the fact that people use hacks which you don't neccessarily pay2win half the times. It can be mad skills of fps skills that you are just good at in fps. It really all just depends on the smartness and tactics of how you are performing and slightly differential weapons. It's rather a slope of people's population and is unknown of increase/decrease but I hope it increase because it may matter to the creator to improve it way better for the people to play it and some people thoughts to this game may change because the "things" they were looking for are in the game.","October 26, 2014","true","48.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

At first they marketing the game with trailers, gameplays and even screenshots that's make people think it's just another Call of Duty clone, but guess what? it wasn't, not even a tiny bit.\n\nThe game is pretty balance in term of gameplay but it did have some P2W issue here and there. The graphic is not so great or bad either way since it just an online game. The game core is still the same as the original: Competitive FPS, but still fun and entertain - it doesn't even give you stress and rage like CS:GO did. Don't get me wrong about the game being competitive or fun at the same time. I mean serious, this game could be an eSports game if it's not have the cash shop weapon system include.\n\nThe game is very good overall, the only bad thing is the player base, not much of them left. This game deserve better, really high quality for a free to play game, but not much people know and appriciate that, I feel kinda sad for the dev. The game could be equal to CS:GO if it has the right "push".\n","January 12, 2015","true","16.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I approve of it. It is fps game. It stands to the point of its fps as it relates to reality abit when you can't actually look at yourself without a mirror or photon reflection because of being less transparent or less particles of the reflection. I would type that this game is definitely one of the fun moods for a game of playing it in my opinion. For the shatter partyhouse map, it is definitely fun, it's like playing a familiar game when aging for me. You get to smash the glasses for people to fall but it can risk them being killed and another half, not. Racing to the middle to claim a gun or weapon if you want. Tactics performed to win. Can or not be Pay2win in my opinion because there are events where you can win guns and the fact that people use hacks which you don't neccessarily pay2win half the times. It can be mad skills of fps skills that you are just good at in fps. It really all just depends on the smartness and tactics of how you are performing and slightly differential weapons. It's rather a slope of people's population and is unknown of increase/decrease but I hope it increase because it may matter to the creator to improve it way better for the people to play it and some people thoughts to this game may change because the "things" they were looking for are in the game.","October 26, 2014","true","48.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.\n\nNor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.\n\nWe, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.","June 21, 2015","false","13.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.\n\nNor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren.

We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.\n\nWe, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.","June 21, 2015","false","13.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Raylazor/recommended/239660/","Raylazor","Raylazor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Raylazor/","120 products in account","Soldier Front 2 is simply a game that targets a larger market- the Call of Duty-esque fanbase. Veterans from Soldier Front 1 will get some nostalgia and enjoyment out of the upgraded new maps, however gunplay is simple and objects seem generic. Overall, Soldier Front 2 is an easier game, but unfaithful to the original.\n\n-PROS-\n> The SP you gain from matches is now more than you need to repair, making characters finally self-sufficient, not needing to rely on SP recharges, Super Booms, AP+/PA+ points, or equipment. SP is also much more easier to come by, allowing you to try out different playing styles.\n> Guns are more balanced and open to multiple play, allowing different set-ups to work more effectively on certain maps. The variant/modification system provides you more out of the gun that you may already like.\n> The fresh upgrade on original SF1 maps provide so much more gameplay compared to the original.\n> Various annoyances from the original are corrected in this version of SF2.\n> Pay 2 Win is less apparent and isn't very likely to affect gameplay too much.\n> Pistols can play a valuable role. Both standard pistols and the legendary Desert Eagle feel worthwhile to buy and wield.\n\n-CONS-\n> Gunplay is simplistic and generic. It combines a little bit of CoD with the CS series, but not enough to roll it to either end. This awkward child recoil DOESN'T compliment either ironsights/hipfire, lowering the value of gunplay to both CoD and CS fans.\n> Headshots are not always consistent. There are damage differences in the head depending on which side you fire it at.\n> Grenades have little value in play due to the indicator. Flashbangs are effective but obvious. Smoke Grenades have no actual purpose. Standard HE grenades are triumphed by the more expensive Incindiary Grenade.\n> Movement fell onto the sprint-button trope. It results in less emphasis on weapon switching and knives cannot be 'wielded'\n> Objectives still feel worthless to go after. Although it puts tension on the defending team, it ends up just involving defenders abandoning their base to stay at the attacker's spawn.\n> Although the map's graphics are upgraded and slightly tweaked, they aren't competitive ready. Spots can still be easily camped to gain immediate map dominance.\n> The new wall-exploding gimmick isn't fully fleshed out and extremely loud.\n> Hit-Detection is extremely poor and laggy. Like CS:GO except 16tick and on a constant 200ping.\n\nOverall Soldier Front 2 is a different game under the same franchise. Most gameplay feels raw, awkward, or clunky and has few redeeming factors. However, Soldier Front 2 is still a decent play due to a well-tuned gun/modification system that gives a reason to dedicate to your lover gun. Soldier Front 2 gets a 4/10.","July 17, 2014","false","127.9"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sharinganerror/recommended/239660/","sharinganerror","Sharinganerror","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sharinganerror/","238 products in account","This is the sequel to the original South Korean F2P MMOFPS which had an insane amount of skill requirement and map familiarity. Every minor to major update made players rethink their playstyles, which weapons they should use, and had a very dedicated community alongside and because of it. It wasn't a very content-heavy, graphically impressive, or technically advanced game. In fact, it was a poor man's CS 1.6 clone, but it was still extremely good because of it. It barely had seasonal costumes added to keep it fresh and the maps were few but familiar which kept the fact that new maps took years to get more tolerable as each was designed so well that every game felt different from the rest.\n\nThe sequel remains faithful to the series by retaining the original maps, gameplay types, and weapon advantages while adding modern staples like ironsights, sprinting, and newer gameplay modes like survival, endless team deathmatches, and sniper duels. It still doesn't get content updates fast enough, but that doesn't really matter to the community that enjoys this game.\n\nI personally love this game for staying true to the original's vision and retaining the same flavor that was unlike other FPS's from that time and to this day.\n\nPlay this game, if you don't like it then move on, you'll find greener albeit different pastures. If you do, congratulations and I'll see you on the battlefield, soldier.","September 27, 2014","true","119.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Somewhat specific audio settings as well, making sound whoring easier.\n- Most maps are pretty straightforward, yet have an interesting design to them.\n- Rotating spawns in some Team Deathmatch maps.\n- Most weapons are atleast usable to a degree, unlike other mmofps with some seriously underpowered starting weapons. (Combat Arms, for example).\n- Not pay to win(Though, SP is somewhat of a pain without buying sp capsules).\n- Events each month/week.\n- Nice and helpful Game Sages(GS).\n\n\nCons:\n- The "NA" server is open to people from all across the world. People will cry and cuss you out in languages you've probably never even heard of.\n- This game is almost as infested with lagging pinoys, among others... walls are commonly non-existant.\n- A lot of events are bugged quite frequently. Supposedly repeatable events only work once, if that. Some do work though, so at least.. there's that, I guess.\n- People seem to have crashing issues a lot, I've been having them recently as well.\n- Channels are plagued with immature people from around 3pm-9pm est.\n- Have to pay(SP or AP) to change your reticle type/shape.\n- Capsules have a low chance to offer anything good, even the AP ones.\n\n\nOverall, the game, itself... it pretty good. I started playing mmofps with it's predecessor and it lives up to the name. The laggers, and other problems listed above.. are quite frustrating though. :l","September 29, 2014","true","226.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Graphics are dope, sound is really nice, weapoms feel and fire smoothly, theres customization options for ya weapons and character apperance, theres a variety of game modes as well as a really awesome variety of maps to choose from; There is a pretty good active community to where you can always find a room with a bunch of players in it to join and play. Of course there are some downsides in the game like how theres a lack of real in depth character developmemt and ranking system to where you really upgrade ya character n wanna truly invest time to get ya rank up. Of course there is a rank system but, feels half a**. Now in the nitty grit of the spectrum the overall opinion i have for this game is a good one. It is a fun game to play and thats the most important thing for a game to have is that its actually really fun to play; so if you add all the positives of the game with the basic fact of how fun it is that gives ya a worthy product to download and actually sit n invest your time to play. Its the best Online Multiplayer FPS Modernized Military Free-2-Play game on steam IMO.

Aeria and the moderators on the game just ruin it. I bet that most minecraft servers ran by 9yr olds could do a better job then Aeria. This is a good game if you just want to mess around in a fps seeing how everyone in game is red ping and the mods in the game are corrupt. If you are looking to get into a competitive fps game I would reccomend CS:GO because all the hackers in SF2 are able to get away with hacking. There have been certian people in the game who have been caught with hacks and have even made videos on how to hack in-game and are still allowed to play the game. These players recieved no punishment and are still able to play on their main account and just keep hacking.","April 24, 2015","false","356.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The guns are fun to shoot, the game is fast-paced and like I said, you don't need to spend money to be decent in game, though it does help if you're one of those people. Bottom line, it's a video game version of a popcorn flick, not too complex but fun to just sit down and enjoy yourself.","December 21, 2013","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I will recomend this game, but only to people like me who like arcade shooters.\n\nFirst off, it is a generic CoD without killstreaks and with  greedy money tactic, just like most f2p fps games.\nHOWEVER, the game actually has ADS (Aim Down Sight), which is useful. The FOV is low, and if you have a big moniter it has a chance at making you dizy (is that how you spell it? I am a Freshy and I can't spell simple words) but it isn't too big of a problem for me. My laptop isn't great, but it could run the game at 45-60 FPS.\n\nHowever, this game has 1 HUGE flaw for me. I was getting the most random freezes ever. I couldn't figure out the problem for the freezes. It almost never happened in firefights but when running with team mates. Maybe a model was gitched in my install, but I do not know.\n\nIf you like Arcade shooters, play it. It is free anyway. If your a realism junkie, run far away.","December 23, 2013","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Everae/recommended/239660/","Everae","~Everae~","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Everae/","252 products in account","So, this game.\n\nHere's my review.\nIt doesn't innovate in terms of the MMFPS genre and it could do with a lot of work. Gunplay is average and guns aren't really that great in variety with most feeling like others.\nHowever, this game really could improve in graphical fidelity as a game in 2013. Looks rather dated but I'm not one to care that much about graphics if you really care about it.\n\nOne feature I did like however was the Xanthid mode - where people play against each other as human and aliens. This is actually quite a fun feature, and there is 5 varieties of aliens to play as; a Metroidy suicide bomber, an invisible "Aliens" like creature, a long range acid launching scorpion thing and an orb carrying thing which I have no idea what it does.\n\nI do notice the very similar emblem of the Xanthid to be rather familiar with the Zerg emblem.\n\nI was unable to access Party and Hero modes since apparently there is no one playing it. Another problem I encountered was the apparent freezing of gameplay whenever I died, chat would still work but I couldn't revive or join the game without deserting the game altogether. Interface could also be a lot more user-friendly as it was rather confusing at first look.\n\nAnd there are some very odd ways of how people killing even missing by miles according to killcam.\n\nIf it is to be believed this game is still in open beta so there is time to improve. Might write another review when this is fully released.","July 7, 2013","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It may look like another CoD clone because it is. And I'm okay with that. It's major fun with some game modes and unique kinds of maps that aren't on many first person shooters, like a map that has 3 layers of glass and then a 30 foot drop into spikes, and the objective is to either shoot your enemy or shoot the glass underneath his feet. Also, there's a mission where you and your teammates have to cross a bridge while the other team tries to prevent it. It's for those of you who have that itch for CoD, like customizing your character, and want to do it with a lot of people, since most people who have bought CoD tend to stay near the recent ones. What happens when CoD Ghosts comes out? Well, less people on Black Ops 2, and even less on MW3. With this, there's always a healthy community.","July 31, 2013","true","9.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

This game, in my opinion, combines elements from Counter-Strike and those of arcade shooters such as Call of Duty. This game features 5 game channel -- Newbie, Open, Competitive, Xanthid, and Hero Mode. Newbie is for all players under the rank of 47. Open is for everyone, although the skill based is definitely higher than that of the Newbie channel. Competitve is mostly for corps (clan) battles, but also has a corps recruting channel to try to get new corps members. Xanthid mode reminds me of the Zombies mode from Black Ops, but it is different and quite fun. It has two modes, Survival and Defense. Survival is wave after wave after wave with now defensive barriers to help you. Survive 30 wave and win. Defense has you protecting a node from wave of xanthids. Easy mode -- defend against 15 waves, Normal mode -- defend against 20 waves. Now, it also has a Hard mode and Hell mode which can be unlocked, but I have yet to do so. The last mode, and the cetainly most interestin mode, is Hero mode. Hero mode is essentially a League of Legends or Dota 2 game, but in first person. It can be a 3v3 (recomended), 4v4, or 5v5. Players and team xanthids have to destroy enimy turrets and thier node, while protecting their own.\nThis game also features a very good shop. You rank up to unloack the weapons, and use SP (in game currency) to buy them. Now, if you want to, you can pay real money for AP. AP can get you a very limited amount of items straight up. Only 3 weapons are available for AP. You can get a VIP cupon to get better looking items of ones you can get with SP. To get the good items, you have to take a chance. You buy 1, 6, or 12 lottery tickets, and you can get either a really good gun, or some crap. The good items have a small chance of actually getting. Now, there are also some lottery tickets you can get with SP, and you can have a chance to get some weapons that rival those that you have to pay real money for.\nI highly recomend this game, and since it's free, there is no reason you shouldn't at least give it a try. :D","July 16, 2014","true","164.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
