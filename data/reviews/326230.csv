Despite zero polish, the game is a fun "one-more turn" experience, and if you let yourself, you can get immersed in the setting. However, Smugglers V: Invasion is the exact same game, with a little less variety. The hook of Invasion is you can no longer play as the factions: Coalition, Syndicate, and Outer Rim, but can now play as the Kilrathi from Wing Commander.\n\nThere are some improvments from Smugglers V to Invasion, but it's price tag of 10$ is just too steep for the same game again, and I'll probably just go back and play Sumgglers V vanilla cause of the faction variety.","October 24, 2014","false","9.2"," 76 of 95 people (80%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","80","76","95","6","3"

This game series is older than FTL, Space Ranger and the X-series together. To do it right, you shouldn´t compare it to those games anyway (like some other reviewers did). You could better describe it as a 2D version of Pirates, Elite and Wing Commander plus a rudimentary adaption of Masters of Orion. With Smugglers: Invasion the grandseigneur of turn-based space trading returns. Don´t be fooled by the graphics, there is a real gem behind the rough edges. The devs have polished the game perfectly (except the graphics, but I don´t care about that anyway). Best of all: You can talk with the dev and he really cares! I've only scratched the surface ... need to get back playing!","January 17, 2015","true","2.6"," 23 of 35 people (66%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","66","23","35","4","0"

Both games are great. When I was a child I got Smugglers 2 as a gift. When Smugglers 5 came out, I immediately bought it for my own child. This expansion adds a lot of new content and playing an alien race for the first time in the series is great.","January 9, 2015","true","0.4"," 20 of 33 people (61%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","61","20","33","6","0"

I think it is one of the most underrated games on Steam. The series dates back to 2000 or 2001 and each game in the series has been more and more improved. It´s very polished (dev still making regular updates and listens to community) and has a great depth. I cannot understand some of the reviews here. I think they have been fooled by the easy accessibility and did not play long enough to get to the advanced features. In the base game you can fly everything from a fighter up to battleships. I don´t understand how one review can say they aren´t in the game. Also each profession has some unique skills, for example a trader can flee the battle and has special skills to defend and delay combat until reinforcements (which other game simulates reinforcements??) arrive or a pirate has special abilities focused on making sure exactly this doesn´t happen.\n\nIf you are looking for a very addictive 2D version of Elite, Pirates or Freelancer, don´t look no further. However if you prefer 3D or very good graphics, you have to look somewhere else."\n\nThis expansion adds a lot of new cool features and a new playable alien race. Read the feature list and you know what´s different. What you see is what you get.","January 17, 2015","true","2.1"," 15 of 24 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","15","24","2","0"

This is basically an extended and improved version of the base game (= "expansion"). Read the feature list. This are exactly the new features you'll get. On a sidenote: The dev took some of the formerly exclusive features of this expansion and added them for free (!) to the base game. I think such a customer service should be supported.","January 23, 2015","true","4.0"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","9","14","0","0"

Then i get this screen "Cant render window modal" everytime i click on any of the button att he bottom. which is how you essentially play the game. searching google with "smugglers 5 can't make a visible window modal" list ALOT of this problem. so since the game was released Oct 16, 2014 and they must of stopped workin gon it according to the forums. This game is a waste of money it seems. maybe they will fix it..... but as companys go anymore. lets push it out the door and forget it. sorry to see that","April 14, 2015","false","1.5"," 14 of 25 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","14","25","0","0"

The graphics are very simple, the music is repetetive, and the story is simple.

If you liked Smugglers and you have a remotely interest in the new scenario (cat-like warrior aliens invading humans), pick this game up. The base game had been 30$, so 10$ is a bargain and it´s well worth the money.","January 18, 2015","true","2.0"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","10","18","0","0"

I found a small bug or two, but nothing really important. A few spelling mistakes.\n\nI´ve loved playing the Jalkath aliens. They are somewhat like the Kilrathi from the Wing Commander universe, but still different enough. I think Invasion is a worthwhile addition and I hope the devs continue the series.","January 18, 2015","true","13.9"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","36","5","14","0","0"
