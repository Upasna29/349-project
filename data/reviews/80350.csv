"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Faudraline/recommended/80350/","Faudraline","Faudraline","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Faudraline/","1198 products in account","Blackwell Convergence is the third installment of Blackwell series, and it continues the story of Rosangela Blackwell, a couple months after the first game left her. Convergence drags us further into the legacy of Blackwell family, shedding some light on the nature of their responsibilities, raising many more questions that we will chase after in later installments. The more I play these games, the more I sink into Rosa's shoes, leaving me with a feeling of uneasiness and even suspicion for our age old companions.\n\nSeveral months after the Blackwell Legacy, we learn that Rosa did quit her small book review job and desperately tries to publish a "fiction" novel that tells of her experience about her first case: "The Devil and the Deacon". Frustrating enough, fiction novels are not exactly on great demand. While pursuing a career as a blossoming author, she keeps investigating several cases with Joey, following Lauren's footsteps. After a fairly basic case, she attends a gallery opening as she promised to her neighbor and only living friend, Nishanthi Sharma. The incidents to follow this fairly generic social event will complicate Rosa's life within only a five days period. She is to meet an old adversary, pursue a murderer, rub shoulders with her aunt's circles and encounter a mysterious madam who asks her help in turmoil.\n\nI'd like to define the first game as mystery that tips its hat to folklore, and the second was basically a noir movie with supernatural elements. This third one, however is surreal in tone, and philosophically inclined to dabble with notions as responsibility, family, trust, cause and consequence. Nearing the end of game, there is a whole part weaved with metaphors and symbolic apparitions only. I felt a great sense of respect towards Wadget Eye Games and their golden boy Dave Gilbert when they used Joseph Mitchell, legendary journalist and an expert on human soul in Blackwell Unbound. In this game, they add Joe Gould, namely Professor Seagull to the equation and bring in the big term that shall dominate the storyline from now on: the collective unconscious! This installment was a downright early Christmas present for nerds like me, who are greatly interested in social sciences.\n\nWhen we take this second glance on Rosa, we are quick to realize that she is more experienced now. She stands her ground and tries her best to get the job done. She is still an odd duck, but more open to interaction and takes steps on either bonding with other people, or at least persisting on what is right. Her dynamic with Joey is becoming better in synchronicity as a gradual process. But it is safe to assume that she is not there yet. I couldn't believe my eyes when I realized that she was even trying to make actual jokes, different from her passive aggressive sarcasm that we encountered in the Legacy! Rosa is becoming a strong female character, just as Lauren was, with personal standing, a sense of justice and an in-depth personality as she grows up. With her cheesy grin, baggy clothes and nerdy glasses, she is a refreshing figure compared to the sexually exaggerated female protagonists that we encounter nowadays. This is a good example of character development.\n\nAs far as the game itself goes, it is evident that everything is improved. Graphics are prettier, and the atmosphere is more carefully arranged to establish an eerie setting, strengthened with beautiful soundtrack. Adding clues sequence is completely removed from the game, yet we are encouraged to use technology more to progress during case investigation. We use Rosa's computer to find an address, get into people's mail, and gather information and so on. Joey hasn't been very effective in this game, but he is still a controllable character with the option of consultation.\n\nThis series is like a symphony; starting sleepy, speeding to raise suspense and dive into a crescendo. What next? Only the fourth game will tell. At this point, I insist. Please give this game a chance, if you enjoy adventure games. Everything will become personal so fast, you will wonder when that happened.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","August 19, 2015","true","4.4"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","23","26","0","0"

Lovely game and a massive improvement over the two earlier games, the dev said himself that he spend a 2-3 months on previous games, and this one took almost two year.\n\nYou still need to play the earlier games first, else the story won't make any sense, and this is very much a story driven game. Puzzles are almost non-existent, with most of game time being spent either on conversation or cutscenes.\n\nArtwork is still 320x240, but it looks simply stunning, very much on par with late Sierra games (too realistic to compare with LucasArts output). Music is great as well, main motif gets arranged into various, mostly jazzy tunes. Only low point was the ending nu-rock song, which completely didn't fit the rest of the game.\n\nCommentary mode has ~30 minutes of content, but I must say, I'd prefer if it wasn't as much focused on voice acting - roughly half of the entries deal with stories about that.","April 2, 2014","true","4.4"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

The Blackwell series definitely has a special place in my heart. BC tells the story of Rosangela Blackwell, a novice medium, and Joey, a spirit stuck with the Blackwell family, and they both go about solving mysteries in NYC and investigating cases related to ghosts who have problems moving on to the afterlife. It's considerably better, longer, and more clever than its prequels. It's really fun and brings you back to old-school adventure games, while still bringing fresh elements to the table. If you're into classic point-and-click games, you most definitely have to try it! I had played it a few years ago and it was still fun to replay it now. Don't forget to play Legacy and Unbound first! While you could play BC as a standalone game, you'll miss a lot if you haven't played them, especially Unbound.\n\nPros:\nDespite having ghosts and all, characters are very realistic, well-developed, deep, interesting, funny, and loveable\nThe story is interesting and solving the mysteries is really fun\nThe puzzles are kept to a sober level of difficulty, but there's no handholding, either\nThe dialogues and the voice acting are really outstanding, I can't stress it enough.\nThis time you get to control both Rosa and Joey, adding a lot to the puzzles\nBeautiful retro graphics\nBGM is awesome, way better than the already good tunes from Legacy (although I prefer the 70's stuff from Unbound)\nCons:\nThe low resolution annoys me a bit (you can set it to 1280x960, though, but that option is hard to find)\nWhile the game itself is a lot more polished than its prequels, the proofreading of the dialogues could still improve.\nThis is probably a matter of personal taste, but I think the credits song totally ruined the moment for me, for I thought it was completely out of place and didn't match the game's atmosphere really well.\nBought on: PC and Android Bundle 11 by Humble Bundle for an average of US$ 0.55 (roughly R$ 1,46). It's also totally worth its full price, which isn't high at all!","January 2, 2015","true","5.5"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","4"

Like every adventure these are nice little stories to examine. Besides the resolution is bad, the graphics are well painted. It seems Blackwell is a remake series from LucasArts which made great adventures in the past.\nThe third part Blackwell Convergence is  quite more balanced than the other parts. The riddles don't concentrate just at the ending. In the beginning you will also solve a couple of ghost quests. The story develops in the middle when you reveal first monetary links between the studio and the art gallery. It has a fabulous ending in the ghost world where you are in an American Diner arguing with some ghosts from the past. And a great fight scene on the rooftop, which is also famous for WadgetEye games (like in th Shiwah).\nPS: A little bit annoying was to play the game in commentary mode to get a special achievement.","October 30, 2014","true","3.6"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","1"

Another solid title of ghost-helping, albeit with removed Notebook combination feature that was making it more unique.\n\nThe game still runs on quite old adventure engine, even if it's updated. It still means that you may encounter small glitches, though... I don't remember any, unlike Blackwell Legacy. The engine still has this anti-aliasing applied to scaled sprites, ruining pixel-art somewhat, but scaling is rarely used in this part. Pressing Shift+Tab, commonly used for Steam Overlay, will make the game to instaskip all the dialogues, you can fix it by just pressing Tab. No real support for widescreen, but at least image isn't stretched.\n\nThe game has quite a modern game design to it, as you can't die or get stuck in a dead end because you didn't pick some item hour ago. The game keeps ability to switch between Rosa and Joey (sidekick ghost who can only blow air). Ability to combine clues in notebook is gone completely this time around, which is shame, as it was unique part of it. Notebook is still there though. But it added investigative feature where you can search Internet (and mail), which means that you get to type things that you may figured out, great!\n\nPixel-art and animations are better than in Legacy, this time even backgrounds look top-notch. Animation for character portrait is missing though. The setting is taking on more of rainy and yellow color this time around and it keeps a bit of jazzy feel in music of Unbound but more modern, relaxing. Though, it feels more forgettable. I still think that soundtrack in Legacy was superior.\n\nAnd once again the game will start with quite a motion, this time with included short intro case, so you will have easier time starting playing than in Legacy. Then you are off to mostly wandering and chasing a mystery, maybe even saving some ghosts, getting your villian along the way, and a familiar one at that. The scope of a game feels larger and you will even get to explore moer unique locations and character. It does have one loose end that never got properly explained: why certain ghost babbles like another character sometimes. Yea, it's hinted how it got there, but never clearly explained. But yes, it's a little bit more on wandering side. The puzzles make sense by now fully and you getto type your clues in computer.\nAlso, Rosa trying to act more confidient and doing strange jokes is still cute.\n\nAnd yes, once again it comes with a commentary mode, great! Well, if forget that once again the focus is on voice acting. Also comes with extra voice acting bloober. Nothing as much of extra content as in Unbound.\n\nAnother solid adventure, another solid game which has it's own charm. This and Blackwell Unbound are connected by plot, so try to not play Convergence before that one. Though this one felt as weakest entry for some reason, but technically it's a good game.","April 14, 2015","true","15.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

A little time appears to have passed between Legacy and this game as the relationship between Rosangela and Joey is somewhat more relaxed. Characters from the past two games make appearances, though with different voices in some cases. The voice actors aren't worse, the characters simply sound a touch different than they did before. The combining of clues to form new conclusions mechanic is missing (and missed), but the interface is a hybrid of the past two games with clues appearing in the notebook and the search function (changed from the phonebook to the internet) prompting a typed word. Despite these rather large changes, the commentary is less robust than in the previous two games. No explanation is given for more than one recasting, but the removal of a key element of the series is touched upon. The art is steady improving from game to game and the puzzles are becoming more intuitive while maintaining their interest. Plot lines are closed a little better in this installment and so the need to immediately start the next game isn't as strong as it was with the past two.  All these complaints are in comparison to the games that came before it, on its own, Convergence is just as good as the other two and a fitting installment in the series.","May 4, 2015","true","5.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Enter Joey Mallone, a ghost and spirit guide tied to the female members of the Blackwell family. When Rosa's aunt, Lauren Blackwell, passes after being in a coma for decades, Joey is 'released' from Lauren and enters Rosa's life. Details are revealed throughout the five installments of the Blackwell series regarding the female members of the Blackwell family, how Joey came to be, what happened to Aunt Lauren to trap her in a comatose state, etc. Together, Rosa and Joey seek out and help tormented ghosts trapped in the physical world cross over to "the other side" throughout the series.\n\nIn BLACKWELL CONVERGENCE, this installment takes place about six months after the events in Legacy. Rosa's neighbor, Nishanthi Sharma, convinces Rosa to visit an art gallery viewing. There, Rosa and Joey meet a film company director who later reveals that an actor in a recent film died. Murdered is a more accurate statement, they come to find. While working on the mystery, they stumble upon an old murder case whereby the victim's research work was stolen to benefit a rival company. Finally, on the art gallery's opening night, a familiar 'person' makes an appearance and murders the artist. In all three cases, Rosa and Joey learn that the same venture capitalist foundation funded the three separate companies. Rosa and Joey have their work cut out for them to solve the mysteries, help set the tormented ghosts free, and live to tell about it ... well, Rosa, anyway.\nNote: CONVERGENCE features two real people included in the cast of characters: writer Joseph Mitchell returns, as well as New York eccentric Joe Gould.\n\nTo enjoy the story at it's best, the games should be played in order of creation. 1st 'LEGACY' -- 2nd 'UNBOUND' which explores the events and time that Lauren Blackwell and Joey were working together in the 1970s (while Unbound turned out, unintentionally, to be a prequel to Legacy, it should be played after Legacy to not only help enlighten the player as to what happened in the first installment, but also gives the player clues as to what is coming in future installments) -- 3rd 'CONVERGENCE' which takes place about six months after the events in Legacy -- 4th 'DECEPTION' which takes place some time after Convergence -- and 5th 'EPIPHANY', which is the final installment in the Blackwell game series.","August 18, 2013","true","8.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

If you need a refresher, in the first game Rosa first meets her spirit guide Joey and begins her adventures as a medium. The second game steps back in time to Rosa's Aunt, and her encounters with the villain The Countess. As of the 3rd game, Rosa and Joey have been working together for some time and have become more accustomed to each other. You continue your adventure as a Medium/Detective, trying to help lost souls move on to the other side.\n\nBlackwell Convergence is a point and click adventure like the previous two games in the series. This game does take a bit of a departure from the notebook mechanic used during interrogations in the other games. While it is still present, it is used very sparingly. I would consider this a much more traditional point and click in that aspect. While I enjoyed the notebook feature as it was before, I wouldn't say that its absence took too much away from Blackwell Convergence. I think the main reason is because this is the tightest story of the three thusfar, with every event building on each other until the conclusion. I really enjoyed the story and dialog, and found myself taking my time more than usual just to hear everything.\n\nThe voice acting is on par with the second game, which is in what I would consider the good but not great category. Rosa's is much improved from the first game, and Joey's is on the same level it has been. The graphics have seen an improvement from game to game, and are now reminiscent of mid to late 90's 2D adventure games. The character portraits are very well done, but I would like to see a little more detail in the environments.\n\nOverall, I would recommend Blackwell Convergence for fans of point and click adventure games. It has the best story I have seen in the series so far. It is also probably the easiest, with no puzzles that are real head scratchers. The story leaves the door open for more games in the series, and I am looking forward to giving them a try.\n\nGrade: B+","September 17, 2014","true","3.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Luckily, the story is rather linear and it didn't look like the game could be put into an unwinnable state, so you can keep trying.

What a charming point- & click game! Unlike Syberia, this game has very "cool" graphics as well as a story that's quite different. Essentially, you're in control of Rosa & joey; Rosa, who is a writer of the paranormal can see ghosts, and help them get out of their eternal limbo using Joey to properly communicate with them (you'll get more of the story when playing..), but essentially it's "inspired" the modern game "Murdered: Soul Suspect", so if you've played that, the concept's the same.\n\nVoice acting is stellar. Really good. It's sort of noticable at times that the voice actors knew that it was a video game, but emotions are in most cases very well expressed to the player, so I won't really make a big fuss out of it! This is a rather old game, so please keep in-mind that everything won't be perfect, but still.\n\nSome elements are really strange.. such as the menu system being crazy bad & unorganised. Perhaps there are ways to drop items, but I haven't found anything like that yet. But it's really a basic point- & click adventure game, and I can't really complain. It's just.. good! Fun and different. Tired of Call of Duty? Try this! It's definitely worth a go! But keep in-mind that the resolution seems to be 800x600 and there are no ways of actually controlling visual settings. Still, the game works well!\n\n8,8/10","July 23, 2014","true","4.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As each game progresses, the storyline becomes more and more polished, the art gets better and better, and the puzzles and clue finding get more interesting. In this third installment you get much of the same as Blackwell Unbound. Here are some of the pro's and con's of the game.\n\nPro's: The storyline is evolving into a rather interesting and mysterious one. Rosa and Joeys relationship is more defined, which allows for better interaction between the two characters, much like Lauren and Joey from the second game. The puzzles have become much more fun, even for someone like me that is used to the "Use banana with three headed monkey", I am really starting to get used to this puzzle style and believe that the puzzle style is the right one for this type of game. I also enjoyed the music and the length much more in this game from the previous two.\n\nCon's: I still hate the art. Sorry, I just don't like it. The consistancy between the games on a number of aspects is not good. On the one hand some of the changes are good, but some of them are not and you have to get used to a new style every time.\n\nI've since changed Blackwell Legacy from a thumbs down to a thumbs up. The first game still lacks in many aspects, but it sets everything up and the series as a whole up to this point is at least a 7.8/10 in my book (and that is saying something because this doesn't fit my conventional style). And as I have said before, if you love mystery and clue finding then this series is one of the best out there, making it a must buy. If you're more like me, you could go without this game and be fine, but you won't regret buying it either.\n\nCheck out my other point and click adventure reviews on my page!","December 19, 2015","true","13.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yukichigai/recommended/80350/","yukichigai","Y|yukichigai","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yukichigai/","463 products in account","Another wonderful example of modern Adventure Gaming, the third entry in the Blackwell series captures all the charm and enjoyment of the first two games, while largely skipping the mistakes they made.  It also merges the plotlines of both games, serving as the first true sequel in the series.  Overall it's one of the stronger titles in the series, even if its enjoyment is more reliant on having played the previous titles.\n\nAs with the first two games, Blackwell Convergence brings the old Point-and-Click adventure genre into the modern era, retaining the same method of gameplay without bringing along all the pointless frustrations that so many early examples fell afoul of.  There are no completely counterintuitive things you need to do, no series of "correct" actions which could only ever make sense within the confines of an Adventure Game (the so-called "Adventure Game Logic").  By and large the puzzles within the game are all a matter of logical examination and critical thinking.\n\nThe game also brings along most of the improvements from the previous games, particularly the ability to control Joey or Rosa directly, along with the Notes screen, tracking clues in your current investigation path.  There's also the text-entry lookup feature from Unbound, this time on Rosa's computer instead of Lauren's phonebook.  It's an interesting mechanic with a lot of flexibility, one that makes you feel a bit more involved in the game. Sadly, one of the most innovative features of the Blackwell series is absent in this game: the ability to compare clues on the Notes screen to form new conclusions.  While its absence doesn't directly interfere with the game, there was an undeniable enjoyment factor from the mechanic in the previous games.\n\nIn terms of plot, Blackwell Convergence has a wonderfully put together one, combining themes from Blackwell Unbound with character development from Blackwell Legacy.  Rosa and Joey's relationship has clearly advanced, with Rosa maturing a bit, though not losing much of her general prickliness and social awkwardness.  She's also more comfortable with Joey, and in return Joey with her, even being supportive and protective of her.  This relationship helps hold together the plot, beginning as a rather conventional forlorn ghost story and ending as something far more complicated.  Complicated, and yet with a distinct (and satisfying) beginning, middle, and end.  By the end of the game the mysteries put forth are all answered in a fairly satisfying way; the implications of those things, not so much.  Much like the previous game, the plot here doesn't provide solid answers to a lot of the core questions that the previous games raised, but it does hint at what they are.  Perfectly fair in an episodic title like this, though I won't lie, it does leave me wanting more pretty bad.\n\nUltimately, I think that's not a bad way to describe Blackwell Convergence: a great entry in the series that still left me wanting more, in a good way.  It was wonderful to connect with Rosa and Joey again, see them interact on a much more comfortable level, and progress through a satisfying series of mysteries while they do it.  Another wonderful game from Wadjet Eye, in other words, and one any Adventure Game fan can count on enjoying.","May 23, 2015","true","1.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You play as either Rosangela Blackwell or Joey, her spirit guide. The notebook is still in use, but you no longer have to match one topic to another in order to develop a new lead.\n\nThe Good    Story - More content and mystery here compared to the previous 2 Blackwell games. Loose ends are tied up, and there's a pretty good climax.\nReplayability - You have to make choices at a few points in various parts of this game which will affect the consequences. This makes it worthwhile to give the game at least a 2nd playthrough to see the alternative outcomes.\nCharacters - There's quite a variety of different people and ghosts, including some from previous games. More importantly, I was amused to discover that some characters actually existed in real life!\nSetting - A few of the locations featured are actual, real life ones. I had a bit of fun googling them after the game ended.\nEnding - Particularly satisfying, especially if you've played the previous Blackwell game (Unbound).\nGraphics - Done in the same style as before, so is consistent with what players of the previous 2 Blackwell games have become used to.\nVoice acting - Always consistently good.\nNew puzzle-solving ideas - POSSIBLE SPOILERS ==> Access "Oogle", the game's search engine, to find out more about someone or something, and hack someone else's "Bmail" account to see what secrets they hide!\nThe Bad    Previous 2 Blackwell games must first have been played - You can choose not to, but you'll miss out on the full experience if you just jump into Convergence directly.\nBacktracking / Time-wasting - You have to keep going back to Rosa's apartment in order to check stuff on the computer. It's the digital age, for Christ's sake. Just have her carry a smartphone!\nLength - My 1st play took around 3 hours. A lot of that time was spent going back to Rosa's apartment to check stuff on her computer. (Each time you go home you have to access the computer, bring up search, enter it, wait for results to show, then close computer, exit apartment, wait for elevator, and go to map.) Minus that and total gameplay duration would be a lot less.\nSummaryDespite its flaws, Convergence should overall still be an experience every old-school adventure gamer will enjoy. The story and puzzle-solving mechanics make sense, and the availability of different outcomes (based on the player's choice) at different points of the game keeps things fresh, so a 2nd play could still yield a fresh result.","April 9","true","7.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Love Point and Click games.\n\nImpressions: If episodes 1&2 are Monkey Island 1 in visual style Convergence is certainly Monkey Island 2. The characters are still retro but there's more colour and detail to everything. The 'Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased)' formula continues to be a fun basis for an adventure but for the first time it felt like a pixel hunt and some sections are very wordy. Also it's hint heavy which drives the plot onwards but reduces the challenge.\n\nThe Good:\n* The upgraded visuals and interface over parts 1&2.\n* The plot is ideal and grows the overall story well.\n* Save interface is massively improved.\n* Voice acting is consistent and good throughout.\n* Charming twists and ideas early on but runs out of steam later on.\n\nThe Bad:\n* Feels a lot shorter and easier than the previous games.\n* The great notebook mechanic of 1&2 has been cut back.\n* Achievements give away plot points, don't read them.\n* Some locations only have plot items clickable.\n* Doesn't make use of Joey's ghost skills over the previous games.\n* Very few items to collect to further the plot.\n* Very heavy-handed hints drive the plot but make it too easy.\n* Long sections of speech that go nowhere useful.\n\nRecommended for: Fans of the first 2 games, you need to play them to understand the plot and characters in so sections.\n\nConclusion.\n6.5/10.

At this point the series looks like the very best 90s adventure games, which is a huge leap from where it came from. The story is as good as ever, building on everything that came before.\n\nIt’s a bit longer than the first two entries, but it’s still relatively short, and the puzzles are a breeze. This is perfectly fine for the type of story it is. This isn’t the kind of game where you want to be banging your head against the wall to figure out what to do next. This is meant to move at a brisk pace, and it feels like it achieves what it sets out to do without fault. Apart from the voice acting, which is a constant problem for Wadjet Eye Games. It doesn’t ruin the game, but it’s bad enough that the actor for an old lady sounded like she belonged in a Monty Python sketch. Enough to make you shake your head in disbelief.\n\nAt this point I’m happy to arrive late to the series, being able to plow through them all one after the other.

Gameplay and Story get a rating scale from 1 to 10, and the AV stuff gets a rating from 1 to 5. My philosophy on this is that there are some instances in which a game may not necessarily have that much in the way of gameplay (take Amnesia for example), but the story/atmosphere/whatever it may be is reason enough to pick it up. Also, take the cumulative score with a grain of salt; it's just a numerical feeling about the game as a whole. That's part of why I do these subscores. Also, keep in mind that I'm not going off of school grade based rankings. A 5/10 denotes what I feel to be an average game. Likewise, 7/10 is a game that I think is pretty cool, and something that gets a 2/10 is near-abomination level. Pinning scores to an even further obfuscated rating scale is kinda senseless, but for the sake of my backloggery, I'll repeat again that 1.0-2.7 is a one-star game, 3.0-4.7 is a two-star game, 5.0-6.7, 7.0-8.7, and 9.0-10 are three, four, and five stars, respectively.\n\nAdditional note: This review will be shorter and will be written in respect to the first and second in the series (Blackwell Legacy and Blackwell Unbound), since this is an episodic sort of series.\n\nGameplay: We're back to Rosangela for this game. Honestly, this is the kind of improvement I was wanting to see. There weren't any "puzzles" in the traditional sense of adventure games, which made me more than happy. Rather, gameplay took more of a backseat approach in this game. The puzzles that were there didn't require any sort of intense abstraction of logic and generally made a great deal of sense. Definitely a great improvement over the previous two in the series. 8/10.\n\nStory: Oh man, things start getting real this game. With the last two games I felt like I could go for a week without playing the next in the series. This one... I dunno. Maybe a few days at most? Also, this is the game that finally got me to 100% go for Blackwell Epiphany, which is apparently the best. Nevertheless, this game really got the pacing of the story right, with plenty of tense, dramatic moments as well as some much needed comic relief. Things finally came together, and it's oh so good. 9/10.\n\nGraphics: Yet another art style change. Looking at the wikipedia page, I suppose this isn't all that surprising, but it's still kind of jarring seeing the art change so much. Apparently the last two games use the same artist (although yet another different artist), so at least for the review for Epiphany I won't have to bring it up again. Nevertheless, I really liked the comic-y style this iteration in the series presents. All of the art is clean and it just looks good. I just wish they would've kept with a consistant artist throughout the series. 4/5\n\nSound: At least they kept someone for most of the series in this department. Also, the music is enjoyable as ever, with the soundtrack leading a sort of fusion of the last two game's OSTs' styles. Also, much to my joy, the voice recordings didn't have any glaring errors like popping. Voice acting is still good and still believable, which is the best thing you can say about voice acting (at least as far as I can tell). If you make the character sound believable, you've done your job and done it well. 5/5.\n\nOverall scores are 8/9/4/5; cumulative score of 8.7/10. Very excited for Deception and Epiphany.","June 21, 2014","true","2.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Also this is the first title where you may feel that it had an actual budget, though the improvements are seen mainly in the quality of the background graphics.\nFollowing the footsteps of Unbound, but yet again with the first game’s protagonist, we partake in yet another set of ghost stories where the goal is to learn the spirits’ woes and how to convince them to find peace with their deaths and move on to the afterlife.\nGameplay-wise Convergence is starting to veer back to the classic adventure genre, losing the clue-based puzzles and using item interaction instead. I have to admit, in my opinion it hurts the game’s atmosphere and story, even though the creator was getting better and better in writing character stories for the ghost. This part was always the biggest selling point of the Blackwell series – the ghost and the life stories behind them, which were always more complex than anyone would think from a short indie game – and thankfully the game does not disappoint in this regard.\nAlso by this time the overall plot of the series is really starting to take form, which is really nice to make you feel you are playing a multi-part epic, but sadly hurts the individual cases somewhat as they all need to be tied into something instead of being completely separate from each other.\nOverall the game wasn’t as a big step up from the previous title as Unbound, but it is still exciting enough to keep people interested in Blackwell.","July 15, 2014","true","4.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Again- the same antagonist does the exact same thing for the exact same reasons. *Sigh* We do learn a little bit more about her, but it is very little. The game seem to be foreshadowing a more interesting plot- which fails to make the actual plot of the game interesting. Also there is no use of the notepad gameplay, emulating deduction of facts and connection, which I really liked in the previous games.

Convergence is longer than Unbound, but it's still a good length. The clue-matching system is thankfully gone, replaced by a system where you look things in by typing them in (which is hilarious when you look up things before the game lets you). Rosa's less awkward in Convergence than in Legacy, which makes her a bit more likable.\n\nThis is the game that really makes it worth picking up the first three.

Over the course of the game, she encounters several of the spirits her Aunt Lauren dealt with before getting out of the medium game, as well as some other issues haunting her family's past.\n\nAs with the first two games, The Blackwell Convergence shifts a bit in art style. However, this remains just as satisfying visually as the prior two iterations; Wadjet Eye really knows how to pick 'em. As a midpoint for the Blackwell games, most of the plot feels like tying up loose ends more than casting out or dealing with many new ones, though there are a few new ghosts and their stories to be told.\n\nAlso in line with the prior Blackwell games, Convergence is a solid experience through and through. The puzzles are stimulating, with only a couple that might throw you for a bit, and in most cases those get hung up on order of operations. Other than that, not much to say that I haven't been saying since the first one, except keep playing 'til you're done them all.","January 7","true","9.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's not too much to say about it that is different from my previous reviews of the games of the series.  Either in this or the following game you finally get reasonable audio controls (its been a few months since I played).  If you're already invested in the series then by all means pick it up, it certainly doesn't get worse!\n\nThere is one moment where I did get fairly horribly stuck with no idea how to proceed and no easy way to brute force, because of a required text input.  I can understand that the view of the designed and that of the player are different merely because of their roles and thus what may be obvious or intuitive to one may not be to the other, but it can still be frustrating when it occurs.","October 20, 2014","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Wadjet Eye gets it spot on again. Must-play for adventurers\nIn this, the third in the series of Blackwell games, you once again alternatively play Rosangela Blackwell and her spirit guide Joey Mallone. Set in New York this retro-style point-and-click will haunt you for a bit.\n\nWith much more storylines and personas this is the best in the series yet. Voice acting is still on the very fine level that was a trademark of the two previous games.\n\nMature, at times witty, and well-balanced the game is another real gem for adventure game aficionados. Graphics and music are somewhat smoother and nicer than before; as always they enhance the overall gameplay atmosphere. Though less 'noir'than Blackwell Unbound the script is another show of good psychological study into characters' motives with some fine detective puzzles (nothing really challenging) to boot.\n\nWhat can I say Wadjet Eye nailed it again. I hope they continue to produce great adventure games.","February 15","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Very good storyline and game mechanics. It kept me up late at night several times because I just wanted to know how the story ended. The only bad thing I can say about it, is that the story ended after part five. But that is probably a good thing because you do not want to ruin a good story by stretching it thin.\n\nYou play this adventure with two main characters: Rosangela Blackwell and Joey Malone. Part two is kind of a prequel in which Rosangela is replaced by her Aunt Lauren Blackwell.\nRosangela and Lauren are mediums and Joey Malone is their spirit guide. Together they help the souls of dead people (ghosts) that are stuck in this world to move on. Doing so they encounter a number of persons/ghosts who play an important role in the story later on.\n\nJoey is a ghost himself so he can reach places that Rosangela cannot, but he cannot wander off too far because he is bound to Rosangela. He also cannot touch anything so he needs Rosangela for this. This poses some interesting situations in which Joey needs to get Rosangela into locked rooms/buildings.\n\nA very interesting game mechanic is that you have to cross-reference pieces of information. By cross-referencing the right information you will learn new things which will help you to further progress into the game. Some information you have to lookup on the internet (in game) and emails play an important role too in this game.\n\nThe Blackwell series consists of five separate parts:\n\n1. The Blackwell Legacy\n2. Blackwell Unbound\n3. Blackwell Convergence\n4. Blackwell Deception\n5. Blackwell Epiphany\n\nBe sure to play them in that order because it is in fact one big story divided over five parts.","February 7","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's not that it's a bad point and click game per se, i mean, it has good pacing and logical puzzles and decent voice acting. The graphics are certainly a step up from the first two. But Rosa is a much less likeable protagonist than Lauren, and it's a major bummer that the whole episode was based around a hackneyed "big bad" storyline. I really enjoyed the more cynical Dead Like Me meets Veronica Mars in NYC vibe of the first two episodes, so it's a shame that this one took a turn toward run-of-the-mill urban fantasy/horror. I hope episode 4 shows some improvement in the storyline.","April 16","false","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That said, the story itself is quite interesting, since it ties in with real-life New York history and its legendary citizens. The art style feels a bit drab, and the new mechanics almost feel like a step-down from the previous entries in the series, so overall this feels like the low point in the series, but only by a small margin. Nonetheless, it is well worth playing.\n\nRating: 7/10","June 2","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
