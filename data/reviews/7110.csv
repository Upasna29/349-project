This requires users to hack the install directory by renaming files, or to seek to resolve the problem by more convoluted and risky means.\n\nIt is of course BioWare's responsibility to fix this, but Valve is still selling it, and it's unacceptable that people feel the need to download anonymous executables off the internet in order to play a game they purchased.\n\nIf you feel like dealing with the head ache of trying to get this broken product to work, it's actually a very good game. It starts a little slow but you encounter lots of interesting characters, make lots of decisions that impact how things turn out, develop relationships with party members, get multiple endings, and can unlock a lot of cool powers. It's a very good game, it's like a pre-cursor to Mass Effect but JadeEmpireConfig.exe is broken and results in a Can't Find Steam error.\n\nOh the solution to the Can't Find Steam error? Simple\n\nMake a backup of JadeEmpireLauncher.exe, create a copy of JadeEmpire.exe, and rename that copy to JadeEmpireLauncher.exe. Then run it in XP Compatibility Mode with Run as Administrator checked. For most people, this solves the problem. I'm sorry you had to look for a work around like this to make a game you spent money on playable.","November 27, 2013","false","9.2"," 652 of 812 people (80%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","80","652","812","6","39"

This seems to not only be because of a "we don't care" attitude on Bioware's part, but also on Valve/Steam parts for letting things into the Steam shop that obviously haven't been QA'd AT ALL. This basically forces users to "jumping through hoops" like resorting to running Steam as Administrator, "registry hacking", manipulating broken config game files, renaming game executables and so on, without any guarantee that the game will run in the end anyway. Most of the problems are well-known (i.e. mentioned numerous times on forums here at Steam and Bioware), but there seem to be neither official solutions nor statements nor any signs of pressure from Steam towards Bioware to fix it.\n\n* "Can't Find Steam error" : The most blatant proof that Steam didn't QA the Steam Version. The initial setup will throw this error message at your face unless you start the STEAM CLIENT itself in Administrator Mode (!). As the game requires admin privileges, and Interprocess Communcation between game and steam (with Steam_api.dll for Overlay / DRM) requires both executables to have admin privileges. Basic programming mistake on Biowares part? Non-existing QA on Steam's part?\n* Verify integrity of the game cache throws you into a loop: Got "2 files failed and will be reaquired" every time you try from the steam client? In this case: Good luck. (Steam's fault)\n* Crashing Game Configuration Dialog: The game configuration laucher crashes while trying to discover your hardware? You're out of luck unless you start renaming files / editing the registry / create a valid xml config file. (Bioware's fault)\n* Dead-locking game right at the beginning: You only get the initial loading screen where you only see a background image? Afaik, there is no known solution to this problem at this time. (Bioware's fault)\n\nThere are speculations that the last 2 points might be caused by the "Optimus" technology from NVidia (modern Laptops with dedicated graphics cards have 2 cards: One integrated HDxxxx Intel version inside your CPU and one dedicated NVidia / ATI card). If that were true, it would mean that most laptops with dedicated graphic hardware (from NVidia) won't run this game at all. This is only *speculation* though.\n\nTL;DR version: DON'T BUY! Unless Valve / Steam starts putting serious pressure towards Bioware to fix the plethora of issues nothing will be done, and the version offered in the shop will remain broken.","December 23, 2013","false","0.8"," 276 of 337 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","276","337","0","4"

I've played this game in the past and it's a great game. The game is not the problem, getting it to run is. The host of known problems with the Steam version continues to grow.

Make a mistake trying to change the registry yourself and you just might end up reformatting your hard drive.

The biggest difference from their other games is that it takes place in the Eastern fantasy world of Jade Empire and character's fighting styles are inspired by martial arts practices and techniques. If you like Bioware RPGs and, or fantasy martial arts movies play this game.\n\n\nTo expand upon my previous review the game isn't as deep as Kotor may be, though simplified Jade Empire is still a great experience. The gameplay is more action based than other Bioware games, no strategic pause option, D&D rules, and such. You can use focus points to slow down time for an advantage or for certain styles. Each fighting style you gain can be leveled up and is like it's own weapon or feat. You'll most likely find yourself switching between two or three that work the best. The diologue and choices are as great as you'd expect from a Bioware game. The story is basic but leads up to a pretty good twist and the quests are great, hardly any felt like pointless fetch quests. Very enjoyable game that would make a great intro into RPGs or fans wanting more.","December 1, 2015","true","24.9"," 50 of 53 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","50","53","2","0"

I was surprised by how well it stands up against the newer titles. If anything, the fact that this came before many of Bioware's other titles elevates it to a higher status for my regard.\n\nThe rundown:\n\nGraphics:\nThis is an old game, and as such, will have old graphics. Textures aren't particularly high, faces can be a touch blobby, and clothing moves like awkward paper. I also found the cutscenes, while also marked with the usual low quality of the time, also had a strange film grain effect. This may be removable, but I never found it so pressing as to search for the option. Some of the cutscenes that involved content of a more gory/violent/disturbing nature did not appear so, though one's imagination can fill in the gaps (this may be a pro or con). Overall, I found the graphics acceptable for serving their task.\n\nAudio:\nI enjoyed the musical score, particularly the swells that appeared during the more intense moments in the game. I'll probably go see if I can hunt down the OST (EDIT: found the OST. It's still great). As for the dialog, I found the majority of major characters to have intriguing voices, and rarely felt the need to read the subtitles and skip when speaking with them. This was not always the case with the minor characters. I suspect the voices themselves are more than decent, but the lack of camera movement during a conversation could become a little stale (a flaw of the time, I would think).\n\nCharacters:\nUnsurprisingly, this is where the high quality really shone through. Although there weren't as many opportunities as I would have liked to interact and speak with the companions (though to be fair, that's always my complaint), I found their backstories interesting and genuinely wished to know more about them throughout the game. I wouldn't have minded a few more side quests, or the ability to take more than one companion along, as I found myself taking the same two out. This just means further playthroughs are needed for the future.\n\nStory:\nWhat I liked about it was its seeming simplicity. It began in a rather straight forward manner, following some of the usual tropes. However, as the story progressed, I enjoyed seeing the new twists, and I wish to give particular commendation to some of the aspects in the ending. Unlike some of Bioware's more recent titles, I really wasn't certain if I'd made the 'right' choice (assuming there had been others - I've only played through once, following the Open Hand path). This ambiguity was very appreciated, and it's something I'm still thinking about. Some form of sequal would have really been fantastic, as I would have loved to see what my impact on the Jade Empire ultimately ended up being.\n\nIn short, despite the aging, I found the game to be extremely entertaining, and possibly a necessary staple to anyone curious about playing more Bioware games. I can definitely see myself replaying it. For information purposes, my playtime ended up being 23 hours.\n\nOne last note: The steam edition of Jade Empire had this issue where upon startup, it would tell it 'couldn't find steam' or some such drivel, and then promptly close. The fix was relatively easy. Exit steam entirely, and then run it as administrator, and then start Jade Empire. That should allow the configuration paths to form correctly (I believe that was where the issue lay, but I can't be certain. Regardless, the game worked normally for me then on out).","June 20, 2015","true","23.4"," 40 of 45 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","40","45","0","0"

It might looks a bit cliché at the beginning, but there are many twists in the plot and there are a couple of features that really make the game a very good product. The graphics might not the  best around but I didn't realy care much about it. Bioware makes a good use of romances (both heterosexual and homosexual) even if they're not the focus of the game. The combat system is fast paced and much more technical than other Bioware titles (mostly because this was intended as a X-Box game, then ported to the PC version), but I enjoyed it and never found it frustrating.\nThat said I would really recommend this game to people who enjoy ancient Mongolia/China settings, mixed with magic, mythology, kung-fu monks and action roleplaying games.","November 26, 2013","true","24.7"," 60 of 78 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","60","78","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thesmolder/recommended/7110/","thesmolder","Akihiko Sanada","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thesmolder/","105 products in account","Introduction: Jade Empire won my heart several years ago, when I first played it on the original XBOX. For those of you who are familiar with BioWare products, it will come as no surprise that Jade Empire lives up to being a quality role-playing game. Clearly inspired by ancient Chinese mythology and folklore, this game is both alluring and enticing to players who can appreciate compelling storytelling combined with a refreshing cast of characters. While this particular title has a relatively simple design in comparison to many of BioWare's other creations, I would still encourage you to pick it up and check it out - Particularly if you are interested in refreshingly original environments, and parables.\n\nComplications & Fixes:\nWhile I recommend the game itself to anyone, I must ADVISE CAUTION TO THOSE SEEKING TO BUY IT ON STEAM. For some, the game will not operate smoothly (if at all) without downloading and installing an additional file. For those of you still needing help, there are many thread discussions regarding this error inside the community forums.\n\nAlternatively, you can download and install the two files that I used (they worked for me) from:\nhttps://anonfiles.com/file/2fd02e0d0446d3bcaa2c6b2d1fd85d8d\n\nFor reference, I believe this is the thread where I originally found the solution: http://steamcommunity.com/app/7110/discussions/0/864978835694348660\n\nStory: Jade Empire follows an orphaned martial arts student, initially training under Master Li, who is unaware of his/her full potential... Or for that matter, the road that lies ahead of them. Little does the protagonist know that every step of the journey will be a test of character, which might or might not conflict with their martial skills. While facing other-worldly creatures, in a unique combat system, the student will grow to master his/her ability -  and only then can they face the dark power growing in the Jade Empire. This game does feature multiple endings based on the players path and decisions throughout the game.\n\nGameplay: The story is absolutely gripping, and is divided into 7 chapters, each featuring their own set of sub-quests.  Some quests are entirely optional, such as the option to form a romantic relationship with a NPC team member. I was honestly very impressed by some of the same-sex options, considering the release date of Jade Empire. This might actually be one of the first games that provided this option to the player. Throughout the game, the player will be able to make decisions for their character, which can in fact impact the ending. Furthermore, some of these decisions can also be used to influence your party members into following different paths as well.\n\nThere are two major philosophies that seem crucial to the game as well: The Way of the Open Palm, and the Way of the Closed Fist. These two opposing philosophies can easily compare to Yin and Yang (or the Dark Side and the Light Side from Star Wars). However, it is important to recognize that just because someone practices the Way of the Closed Fist does not actually mark them as evil... Likewise, a follower of the Open Palm is not automatically good either. Followers of the Open Palm believe that maintaining harmony is important, whereas the followers of the Closed Fist believe that one should become self-reliant. Whether or not an individual is good or evil boils down to the context surrounding the event, so Jade Empire strays from painting a black and white world. That in itself, is a noteworthy mention, all too rare in video games.\n\nAnother brilliant feature implemented in Jade Empire are the mini-games. I really really really enjoyed the Raiden-inspired Dragonfly mini-game. Seriously, just go check it out on YouTube or something, you could spend hours doing this alone. It is sooo fun!\n\nControls: I might have been lucky, but I didn't have any problems with the controls in this game. They were pretty straightforward, and the game is compatible with a XBOX360 controller. On the other hand, a friend of mine confirmed that Jade Empire is not compatible with the PS3 controller. Otherwise, the controls work perfectly fine for me, as to be expected. The combat system is a bit more complex than other games I've played, but the innovative style is addicting, I promise.\n\nGraphics: The first thing to consider is that this game came out in 2005. As a result, the graphics might be considered outdated by many of you. However, I do not feel like the graphics are so outdated that they become a distraction. The visual aesthetic of the game may not be the best, but it's definitely not the worst.  I rather enjoy the art style of this game, however I cannot say that the graphics are the highlight of Jade Empire either... And yes, you will get stuck in weird camera angles until you reload it sometimes. There are glitches. Do not panic.\n\nSound: I think the language might be made up, but it sounds decent to me. The voice acting wasn't horribly obnoxious, and some of the music in this game is enjoyable to listen to. The audio surrounding this game meets par, as there isn't a lot to nit-pick.\n\nReplay Value: Honestly, Jade Empire doesn't get old to me. I found the experience to be extremely enjoyable, and have since beaten the game several times since my first playthrough in 2005. Definitely worth playing twice!","June 21, 2014","true","34.3"," 33 of 37 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","33","37","0","0"

This is the game, and the settling is the sadly rarely used Chinese Fantasy. Jade Empire is a very different beast for what we now expect from modern Bioware games. Originally for the first Xbox and ported to the PC around 2007 back in the days where STEAM was also very different and oddly enough not well remembered.\n\nI had fun playing Jade Empire. It was something new, despite the now dated graphics. It was something fresh despite the system limitations like being limited to a single companion and being one of the shorter Bioware games I have played. A good game always has a rock solid foundation. Very few games bother to cover China at all.  The combat system in this game is very unique and reminds me a lot of the more modern but quite different open world game Sleeping Dogs. You fight with WASD, general movement and using techniques (spells) that are fueled by a chi (mana) meter. This makes fighting a lot more fluid and interesting that the usual turn based stuff older RPG games are associated with and there is a simple wonder of going all Bruce Lee (and yes, one of the male main character models pretty much is a tribute to Bruce Lee) and kicking ♥♥♥ while staying mobile.\n\nYou aren't limited to your fists, there is the usual slightly bland array of metal weaponry and Chinese Magic style techniques some of which transform you into mythical fantasy beasts of the era. The companions themselves, whilst limited in combat are quite interesting like with all Bioware games. There is even the token 'Drunken Style Master' who helps boost you with buffs of well wine really. One of my personal favourite quests in the game is a much more interesting Arena quest that makes the younger Oblivion one seem hilariously bland and boring in comparism. Oh and John Cleese has a cameo too in which he plays an Arrogant ♥♥♥♥ of an Elizbethan Explorer who debates and fights you.\n\nSadly there are some flaws. Like I mentioned before the game is short, I played it one and off for an hour or two for the last few weeks and just shaved past the eighteen hour mark before completing it. Once you finish the Imperial City portion of the game pacing gets incredibly rushed and the scant quest based hub areas vanish completely. The storyline demands you to get it done and over with.\n\nAnd the Gem system really could have done with some more thought. But these things are pretty minor. The most disturbing issue was the fact this game is one of the older titles that is broken due to STEAM constantly changing but I found a player bashed up fix in the STEAM community forums which was easily to install and get working in about a minute.\n\nSo final opinion really, if you are looking for something new and interesting in both setting and combat system RPG wise and don't mind the length and the age of the game you will enjoy Jade Empire.

However, this steam version WILL NOT launch on Windows 7 and 8 without a few back end tweeks. Lots of google investigation returned a lot of confusion. But I found the proper way to get this game running. Do the following semi-easy fixes depending on the errors you receive:\n\n"FAILED TO FIND STEAM" BUG\n\nThis is because this game was made for older OSes, where steam is typically located in C: Programs, not C: Programs(x86). In order to fix this do the following:\n1. In your Jade Empire folder change the file "JadeEmpireLauncher.exe" to "JadeEmpireLauncher_Backup"\n2. In the same folder rename JadeEmpire.exe to JadeEmpireLauncher.exe\n3. Right click My Computer(Called This PC in windows 8.1) and go to properties, then click Advanced System Settings, under the adavanced tab, click Enviroment Variables. Look for the "Path" variable, high light it and the edit button. A window will pop up. Put your cursor in the "Path Variable", it will be a Path to your Program(x86) folder. Go to the very end of the path already in there and add a ; a SEMI-COLON, NOT a : colon. This is going to seperate the first path from the new one.\n4. After that semi colon, simply put in the past to steam that you use such as: C:\Program Files (x86)\steam. Hit Okay.\n5. Please, REBOOT YOUR COMPUTER <- THIS IS IMPORTANT For some reason this game won't register this change unless you reboot.\n\n"IN GAME STUTTERING" BUG\n\nGREAT! You made it into the game. But it's running with this horrendous unplayable stutter even though you are running at a solid 30-60 FPS. Here is how you fix it:\n\n1. Go to Jade Empire folder.\n2. Open the JadeEmpire.ini file with notepad.\n3. Find the entry ClampFPS=1 and change the 1 to a 0.\n4*. (If you are only running one video card, skip to 5)  If you are on a gaming laptop that runs a high performance video card alongside an intergrated one, this game almost ALWAYS will naturally try to run off the integrated card instead of the good card. Go into Your card's control panel and under 3d settings, click Add Program, select Jade Empire, then change it from Integrated to High Performance Card.\n5. Turn off the steam overlay by selecting Steam->Settings->In-Game->Uncheck Enable Steam overlay.\n6.And as always after doing this, REBOOT YOUR COMPUTER. The game WILL NOT recognize it if you don't.\n\nThis is a GREAT game and a lot of fun. But it wasn't updated for newer systems. These fixes aren't as hard as they found, Give them a shot.","August 13, 2014","true","2.5"," 22 of 26 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","22","26","0","0"

The combat is different to any other I've experienced, with a massive martial arts emphasis while still being the kind of "pause and fight" type deal you get in KOTOR or Mass Effect. Every aspect is well thought out and brilliant.\n\nI'm so disappointed there weren't more games in this series.

The advanced combat style system, while a good idea could do with some streamlining, there are almost too many styles (something between 15 and 20) but you end up using only a couple of them exclusively.\nThe combat in itself can range from very difficult (even with a controller) to smash a button simple. Bioware should have remembered they are first and foremost a RPG company, action is not their fortes.\nStill when you get the hang of it, the fights are usually fun and very kung-fu likes , I only wished it had been a bit simpler and more responsive.\nThe RPG part is working nicely, although it sometimes feel like we could do with a little less dialogue, but like in many bioware games we feel obliged to go though everything a character has to say just in case something interessting is hiding in the choices.\n\nGraphics and sounds\nFor a game this age I'm agreably surprised with the nice graphics. The background landscapes are beautifully rendered with a lot of colour , the music and sounds goes nicely with it giving it a distinctively fantasy oriental feeling. Yes it's dated but at anno 2015 I didn't have any problem with it, and as the game went on, I was actually more and more impressed about the nice backgrounds and objects put in the game. The characters look quite nice , maybe a bit boring but nothing too serious. The attention to the details is maybe what impressed me most, everything feel very oriental, from the design of GUI to the music or the decorations, very nice.\n\nPlot\nAt first it doesn't really engage, but after an hour of two the game become more and more exciting, the characters who start at bit bland become more fleshed out and interesting and the quests and surroundings get better and better. In fact the game get really interessting 1\3 into the story when you reach the capital. In short it might seem a bit boring at first but things get better with time, give it a chance.\nToward the end it get really amazing and I have to say it's one of the most engaging RPG I have played for a long time. The story is much better than NWN2 (expensions included) and the ending is much better than masseffect and even KOTOR 1. The Bioware "morality" system however annoyed me with it's very basic evil and good choices. It's very black and white and counterintuitive , bioware doesn't manage to give us clear motivations to behave like a "♥♥♥♥♥♥♥" , most people will naturally choice the "good-guy" choices especially when being a bad guy doesn't give you any clear advantages. This is not a new problem for bioware RPG however and it's something most of us have learned to live with in those games. Still a bit annoying.\nThe story start a bit tame, but it very soon become a lot more exciting. In fact towad the end I was really engrossed in it and the game amazed me more and more as I progressed. The story is one of the best I've experienced in a RPG for quite some times and it's very refreshing.\n\nConclusions\nThe game has its flaws, but mostly it's great  especially if you like a great and engrossing story. The beginning is a bit tame, and take some time to familiarise yourself with the controlls which can feel cluncky at time. But as a whole the great story and interessant characters make it worth your time, I definitively recommend this game.","January 10, 2015","true","56.0"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","0"

Things quickly change however as you are charged with saving the world and restoring balance in the world, pretty standard hero stuff really. You won't be on your great all important quest for long before some random peasant will ask you go save a cat from a tree however. Jade Empire is a game that loves procrastinating. Despite what should be a fairly urgent overall plot you will find yourself spending most of your time solving the problems of various little people around the world. Sometimes I'd even forget why I was doing all this in first place.\n\nJade Empire is gorgeous game. The graphics are stunning, the art style is impressive and the sounds and music work well together.\n\nThere is a certain open feeling to many of the quests and although this is only a disguise for the relatively linear progression you have throughout the game it does work well to keep you from feeling like you are completely on rails. The morality system, despite it's flaws, is probably one of the best ones ever concocted by Bioware and it hints at shades of grey quite often, particularly during the later stages of the game.\n\nThere is only really one major problem with Jade Empire and it is unfortunately a rather big one. The combat, the basic gameplay mechanic that the entire game is based around, is dreadfully dull.\n\nThe controls are fairly standard, light attack to deal damage, heavy attack to break blocks, your own blocking ability and an area effect strike in case you get swarmed. This is all very simple and not very interesting so what Bioware did in an attempt to make the combat more dynamic is provide you with a wide range of combat styles. Everything from familiarly named martial arts styles and weapons styles to magic and support styles and even transformation styles that morph you into various mythical creatures. The idea being that you need to switch between the different styles to maximize your combat potential. Unfortunately the entire execution of this is flawed and while you do need to change styles every blue moon to match enemy immunities there will only rarely be a need to do this in combat even on the highest level of difficulty.\n\nSomething that probably deserves a mention here is that Jade Empire is some very nice romance options and is quite possibly the only game to have a three-way romance option that didn't make me feel like puking.\n\nAll in all Jade Empire is a great game marred by some unfortunate design flaws. The world is beautiful and well crafted, the characters are interesting and engaging and Bioware's attempt at grey morality pays off surprisingly well. It's a game I'd happily recommend as it is a great play but the horrible combat unfortunately keeps it from getting that all time classic status that some seem to want to bestow upon it.","December 10, 2012","true","78.0"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","2"

It stands, however, very firmly, as a mid-point between Bioware's other landmark titles: Knights of the Old Republic and Mass Effect. It is very recognisable as a spiritual successor to the gameplay style of Knights of the Old Republic. On the other hand, you can see much that would go into Mass Effect being developed in Jade Empire. It says more than anything about Jade Empire that I could not write a paragraph in review without mentioning Bioware's other two excellent titles.\n\nThe characters and their development, the storyline, and quite frankly the world developed around them, simply doesn't live up to the heights generated by the other series mentioned herein. It perhaps helps with immersion that I was a Star Wars fan prior to playing Knights of the Old Republic; but Mass Effect's dramatic introduction of an entirely new universe was simply amazing and Jade Empire achieves nothing of the sort. It is a nice world, more densely populated than Knights of the Old Republic which makes it feel more immersive. But unfortunately it just does not stand out. It is not particularly memorable, and there is virtually no reason at all for the game to be open-world (when it does open up). If you are thorough, there is literally no reason to return to places you have visited in the past in Jade Empire, and that is rather unfortunate.\n\nIt is an aging game, so the graphics look a little dated at this point but you can still see that for their time they were quite pretty and it does not in any way impact the enjoyability of this title. The gameplay is also quite interesting, very fast-paced and there are a really wonderful array of fighting-styles that your character can learn. Slightly unfortunate, however, is the loss of the ability to play as other characters at will, which was a welcome feature included in Knights of the Old Republic.\n\nAll in all, this game is definitely worth looking into, especially for fans of Bioware's other excellent RPG titles. I have been rather critical in this review but it is only because Bioware has soared so much higher in other outings and with so much potential it is rather unfortunate that Jade Empire failed to achieve these expectations. Nonetheless, I still consider it one of the better RPG games I have played and would recommend giving it a shot. 8/10.","October 10, 2014","true","22.3"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","17","22","0","0"

Years later I bought it again on steam for another 2 euros. All I can say is: money well spent.\n\nA lot of people will tell you that Jade Empire is Bioware's weakest game. When you measure any rpg up to Knights of the Old Republic or the original Mass Effect, chances are your perspective is going to be a bit disadvantageous for Jade Empire. This isn't star wars, and this certainly isn't mass effect, but it is a unique game that has all the makings of greatness.\n\nI was bummed out in Knights of the Old Republic when I learned that the combat would be dictated by a D&D dice roll system. This is the kind of uncertainty I hate, the kind of unrefined gameplay that has absolutely no excuse to exist in the modern world. Jade Empire does away with that and gives you live action, direct, fist to face combat. It has aged like a biscuit though. It is tough, rigid, and unrefined by todays standards, but a step up from the roulette style gameplay from Knights. Combat is fun for while, but you'll quickly find yourself looking for ways to dispatch your foes as fast as possible. The game offers various options. Martial Arts allow you to attack your enemies with your bare knuckles and are generally effective against all enemies. Elemental Styles allow you to throw fire or ice (bending if you will) at the cost of chi. Various weapons are very effective against humans, but useless against spirits. Support styles allow you to set up your enemies for a finishing blow. And at a hefty chi price there are the transformation styles that allow your to morph into a being of pure awesome to obliterate your foe. There is plenty of choice for you to customise your style, and the game gives you a fine world to flaunt your skills.\n\nJade Empire is set in an oriental world. Full of references to Chinese, Japanese, Indian and Bhuddist mythology. If you have ever watched Avatar: the Last Airbender then you should get the idea. There aren't many games out there like this and Bioware has done a great job at crafting a world that looks the part. This is the nice thing about Jade Empire. You'll want to walk around and talk to people, help them (or ruin them, you know the drill). In the end though you'll still be after the same thing thing: Saving your master. You play a martial arts student, whose life is uprooted when a secret orderer invades your hometown and kidnaps your master. Que the hero music and get to it.\n\nIt is a shame Jade Empire has ages so poorly. The controls are fluent as a beached whale, and the character models are not always as polished as they could be. Still, its universe and setting are unique and if you like a decent RPG of westen make then do not hesitate to get this.","February 25, 2014","true","17.6"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

It probably won’t be your favourite action game of all time, but you definitely won’t regret playing it.\n\nLong version:Jade Empire was created between the releases of two highly successful titles, which later overshadowed its existence, although not without reasons. At its core Jade Empire is nothing more than an attempt to recreate the success of Knights of the Old Republic with a new world based on a highly fictional version of early Imperial China. For the most part, it works well… just don’t expect much historical accuracy, especially on the shoot-em-up stages against the ancient Chinese Luftwaffe. Yes, you read this correctly.\n\nAn RPG usually is as good as its story, and the game won’t let you down in this regard. The plot is solid with a few good twists, the characters are memorable enough, and the mandatory romance subplot doesn’t feel as forced as in most games. But it’s hard not to notice that most quests are recycled from KotOR and Neverwinter Nights.\n\nSo, why is Jade Empire so obscure and forgotten? For two reasons. The first is the lack of actual role-playing elements, and the second being the combat system.\nThis was the first title where BioWare tried real-time player-controled action instead of random-based mechanics, and it’s not working too well. Fighting is just mindless button mashing and the hit detection is beyond horrendous; using hand-to-hand styles almost equals a death sentence. As you can imagine, this creates slight issues in a Kung Fu game.\n\nStill, Jade Empire is a solid title, and highly recommended for those who like BioWare’s KotOR era. Set the difficulty to easy or medium to avoid the frustration over the combat system, and enjoy this little piece of uniqueness.","October 27, 2014","true","63.9"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

Graphically amazing, story telling amazing, combat system very fun, customization eh... but still sufficient. I played a lot of xbox games when this came out and this was one of the only games besides Halo 2 that had me hooked and I might have needed rehab at the time only to have relapsed with the release of Mass Effect soon after ;P. The main hook for me was and still is the story (and my love for martial arts). Not that the story was over-the-top incredible or bursting with shock and awe but it was truly captivating and realistic because of the connection you develop with the characters like any meaningful story will allow you to do, and so easily. I would recommend this story for anyone who hasn't experienced it yet.\n\nOK so like I said for its time the graphics were amazing. but nowadays if your not a fan and your the new guy or gal picking this up you might be uncomfortable with its lack of visual stimulation. Well I might have painted a rough picture of Jade Empires graphics, The game still has 1st gen xbox graphics but there are still many mods out there to enhance this game graphically. What you want to look for in this games beauty are the landscapes and the vibrant far east colors.\n\nCombat is fun but a bit rough starting off as per usual. You choose two combat styles to start with and to complement those you get to choose one of two weapons and you can switch between these 3 arts very quickly during battle. There is a tab target to switch through enemies and it is very accessible. The only problem I had was attack speed and positioning, you'll find yourself charging up an attack that takes way too long and doesnt land its target because they had an hour to move >.>. The great thing about this little problem is that you can actually put points into attack speed wooooo! problem fixed you just gotta get good :D\n\nWell that concludes my review.\n\nYou don't find too many games in the genre like this especially not one with an Oriental storyline by Bioware, They did an outstanding job with this title and I hope one day an updated re-release until then ill enjoy this version!","May 19","true","3.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Aside from one story-halting bug about half way through - fixed with a simple patch in my case - the title ran without hitch. Judging by other reviews however, I'd be wary of purchasing this title for a Windows 8 system.\n\nDespite the age of this title, the occasional bug, and it's clunky, badly dated interface, I'd still recommend this to those with a love of Wuxia, or just looking for something a little different.","September 4, 2014","true","81.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Now I can't imagine why. It has possibly the worst combat and camera controls of any game I've ever played.\n\nDuring combat, some button presses are often delayed by a few seconds. If you begin a combo and then try to dodge, it will complete the combo before dodging. Often so much time has passed between when you press the dodge button and when you actually dodge that you may no longer want to dodge. But you will. Oh yes, you will. The same goes for if any enemy is hitting you. You will wait for the enemy to finish THEIR combo before you dodge/attack. Basically, the combat is very stilted and unresponsive.\n\nThe camera is perhaps even worse. It's understandable given the age of the game and the hardware it was developed on that the camera would be somewhat limited. You can only tilt the camera up, not down, and the camera movement is very imprecise. That's all forgiveable. What is not forgiveable is how the camera behaves in combat. If you are fighting near a wall the camera will tilt at odd angles preventing you from seeing what is going on. This becomes especially annoying when you are fighting in a small room. You may be fighting blind 75% of the time.\n\nThere are other issues with the game, as well, such as the invisible barriers that surround you during battles, the stilted dialogue, the overly simplistic RPG elements (there are only three attributes), and the fuzzy cutscenes.\n\nI just can't recommend this game, which is a pity. I really did love it on Xbox. Kind of makes me question the judgment of past me.","February 26, 2015","false","35.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I was on a BioWare binge, and needed more of what made those games so special. In short, Jade Empire is a decent game, but a relatively weak effort from a company that has done so much better.\n\nGraphics: The graphics are a highlight of the game, even if somewhat dated today. The worlds are rich and colorful, the game has its own unique art style, and it's fun to see the different special powers and items in play.\n\nLevel design: For those of you familiar with KOTOR, the level design will remind you at times of certain worlds in that series. BioWare is very good at creating an atmosphere or "feel" with their level designs and this is no exception. However, there aren't all that many worlds to explore in comparison to BioWare's other games. KOTOR II, which was released a year before this game, contained over 7-8 different worlds, not including shorter stages. Jade Empire barely has 5, and not even the supposedly grand Imperial City is quite as large or expansive as Nar Shaddaa. (It comes across as more of a small village than anything.) I could compare it to watching an older Hollywood film - one can often tell that the sets are as large as the view of the camera; one step to the right and you're in a studio. Similarly, the limited nature of some of these areas makes them feel less authentic.\n\nSound: The music is enjoyable enough and fits the artistic theme of the game. However, it is mostly forgettable, with one notable exception - the Imperial Palace theme ("Anthem of a Tyrant"), which invokes a bit of a Darth Vader or Don Fanucci vibe. The voice acting is decent (albeit a little cartoony at times), and I had no complaints about the sound effects.\n\nStory and characters: I did not find either the story or the characters particularly original or compelling. However, that is not to say that there are no highlights; Hou has some smirk-worthy moments as a repressed husband and Silk Fox leads an interesting dual life. But other characters are defined by single traits: Dawn Star, for instance, is the generic good-hearted heroine with no flaws, and the Black Whirlwind is drunk and roguish. Things get especially cringe-inducing when the game tries to shoehorn a backstory into the latter. Unlike Dragon Age, which contains multi-layered characters, or Mass Effect, which explores personal changes through the game's arc, the characters here are fairly static and uninteresting.\nPlot-wise, the game borrows a critical element from KOTOR II without coming up with many creative plot ideas, so hardcore BioWare fans won't be too thrilled with the game's writing. Unfortunately, hardcore BioWare fans are the group most likely to try this game.\n\nGameplay: The gameplay heavily revolves around combat, which heavily revolves around melee attacks, which heavily revolve around incessant clicking of the mouse. There are moments when strategy is involved, usually when facing off against multiple strong enemies. In addition, the PC can learn a couple of ranged attacks and possess weapons, but the selection is disappointingly limited and you'll find yourself resorting to the same two or three fighting styles over and over. Not to mention, almost every conflict in the game is resolved through combat, which grows tiresome. The enemies often take twenty hits to go down, which tests not one's skills but one's patience. Furthermore, some levels contain dozens of battles with groups of the same kind of enemy (often respawning!). However, there are a few battles in the game that require more creativity to fight, and although they do not dominate most of the game's combat, brawling with these foes can be very enjoyable.\nI think that the game in general relied too much on combat, while devoting little attention to gameplay through dialogue/choices, strategy, etc. In addition, the combat itself was not varied enough for me to forego this issue - I found myself terribly bored throughout the third act in the game, simply tolerating each battle just to get to the end.\nThe game does implement an alignment system, but it seems to matter a lot less than in other BioWare titles. At the end of the day, combat is Jade Empire's main feature, and it's not as fun as one might expect or hope.\n\nFinal verdict: 6/10 - The combat is often repetitive, some characters are flat, and the game feels disappointingly short and lacking in an engaging plot. However, despite these flaws, there are some well-designed environments, and the originality of the artwork and setting is a strong point. If there's a Jade Empire 2, BioWare needs to recognize this one's limitations. Jade Empire had the potential to be a great title, but given the drawbacks outlined above, I can only call it decent. I would recommend it to dedicated BioWare fans, but not really anyone else.\n\nOh, and the flyer levels - really, Bioware? You thought it was a good idea to implement scrolling shooter stages?","February 25, 2015","false","21.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The characters are really funny! The story is really really engaging and exactly what you'd expect from bioware, some top quality stuff that is a bit more fun to play than mass effect.\n\nYou really need to think about what strategy and styles you pick, if you just button mash, you'll get nowhere. That's what I love about this game, great challenge, and great story. What more could you ask! The battle system is fun to fiddle around with, though it was not readily apparent for me to press both light and heavy attack to make an AOE attack which is great for controlling mobs.

It's sad to see so many people not recommending this game just because they couldn't make it work. Jade Empire: Special Edition has two start up flaws. One is the launcher that starts when the game is first run. It tries to gather system info and crashes later. There is an easy work around for this by going to your install folder for Jade Empire and renaming the Jade Empire Launcher to JadeEmpireLauncher_Old and renaming the Jade Empire .exe to JadeEmpire Launcher. After this the only other issue was the "steam not found" issue. This was easily fixed on windows 7 by going to start, right click on computer, properties, advanced system settings, and editing the enviroment variable called "path" to include your steam folder. Going to the of the line, and typing without the quotes ";C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam" and then hitting okay. The game works perfect after that. Make sure you have a restore point on you pc incase it gets messed up, but it should work fine.

I took the path of the Open Palm (good guy) but there is probably some good replayability here with another run through at some point going with Closed Fist. I don't think this would change the story dramatically but it would make a replay interesting by varying quests from the first time through. On the whole, I'd enthusiastically recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good story in an RPG and is okay with traditional RPG elements being on the light side.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/eliamoroes/recommended/7110/","eliamoroes","Elia Moroes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/eliamoroes/","221 products in account","Jade Empire is an action roleplaying game which puts you in the role of a young martial artist on a quest to free his/her master from the grasp of the sinister order of the Lotus Assassins while slowly discovering the history and the machinations behind the titular Jade Empire. The game heavily borrows from the Chinese tradition and mythical lore for its setting and characters.\nThe main beef of the gameplay are the martial style you can use in combat: some of them are about using a weapon like a sword or a staff, others allow you to cast spells or incapacitate your enemies. You can equip four of them at a time and learn to use them in tandem, manage their mana cost (or better said, chi or focus cost depending on the style used) and upgrade their stats carefully. Enemies respond differently to the various style, forcing you to switch between them during each battle. Other novelities from Jade Empire, gameplay-wise, are about the techniques, permanent stats bonus you can collect for your character from quests, and gems, which provide some bonuses when equipped.\nJade Empire remains a classic BioWare videogame at its core, with plenty of companions you'll learn to know better during your journey, interesting secondary characters and a pletore of either funny or interesting sidequests. There is even a karma meter (which judges your action through a "good" and "evil" scheme of some sort) and the possibility to change the later story drastically depending on your allignment and previous choices. In the end, you can even romance a character of your choice.\nIt's worth mentioning however that Jade Empire is somehow scarce when it comes to explorable locations and, at least on normal difficulty, the game can become rather easy really quickly (namely, some styles are very unbalanced and, generally, using a stunning styles in tandem with an heavy damaging one is sure to make most enemies encounter a breeze).\nThe Special Edition of Jade Empire adss content that once belonged only to the Xbox version and its collector's edition. Also, starting up this Steam version could require some workaround.\nAll in all, Jade Empire is a classic RPG from the golden age of BioWare: you should totally buy it if you enjoy the other games made by this studio, but be also warned that not everyone could find the Eastern theme going in Jade Empire that appealing\n","July 22, 2014","true","22.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The action in the fights is smooth and the controls are easy to pick up, but take some time to master.\nI really liked the feel of this game. The world wsa just fun to learn about.\nThe graphics are still pretty good even though the game is almost 7 years old.\n\nThe bad:\nThe game is curently  broken for windows 7/8 users. There are a number of work arounds and fixes posted in the forms. I found that renaming some files and running steam in administrator mode fixed it for me.\n\nBottom line:\nIf you like RPGs and this game is ever on a good (50% and up) sale, then pick this game up. Hopefully Steam can fix the issues with the install so that it will play on newer systems, but you can get it working with a little patience and I think it is well worth the work.","December 20, 2013","true","8.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I have very fond memories of playing this on my XBOX when it was first released, and then sadly giving the game away. Regardless of this version's totally unnecessary, asinine technical issues (which are fortunately easily resolved), this game is absolutely a must play.\n\nIt's somehow gotten even better over the years. What stood out to me when I was a kid was the mythological, epic story and the combat, and it remains nothing short of awesome.The engaging, intriguing characters bring the interesting plot to life, as well as grounding the more fantastical elements and making it personal. You cannot help but become emotionally invested in the world. Rich lore, side quests, and their corresponding items make it highly addicting.  At first glance, the combat may appear simplistic, but it controls smoothly and takes a while to truly master. The ability to use weapons and transform into intimidating demons is so great and never gets old. Once you become adept at switching between distinctive combat and support styles, fighting becomes an intricate and brutal dance. Multiple play throughs are a given, especially with the compelling morality system. The pretty graphics hold up surprisingly well, the soundtrack is breathtakingly beautiful, and Jade Empire will leave an impact on you that is sure to stay.\n\nThis is a game you should savour every moment of!","February 2","true","42.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198011520172/recommended/7110/","76561198011520172","Unfortunately","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198011520172/","89 products in account",""Everything begins with choice." -Morpheus\n\nJade empire is another great that time forgot. Lacking the major franchise tie-in of the Knights of the Old Republic series (or duo) and the triple-A investments of the Mass Effect series, this Bioware RPG is, imo, an underrated almost-masterpiece of a game.\n\nAs to the bad news: Getting this console port running on Steam and modern Windows machines ain't like dusting crops. A true PC gamer distinguishes himself from his console rivals by his literacy; he reads the forums (no, reads, READS the forums, you idiot, not reposts the same question that's been answered a million times, thus ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ off the veterans who could help if they thought you would/could actually read their response), finds the solution, and implements it, like a big boy. That's what you're going to have to do for Jade Empire, and it's probably a fair price.\n\nThe great thing about Jade Empire is the great thing about Knights of the Old Republic: You, the player, form your character. I'm not talking about a customization screen at the start of the game, or even stats and skills (Jade Empire actually falls short on these compared to Knights of the Old Republic, with its "streamlined" system), but the combination of the morality system with the diversity of fighting styles. There are weapon styles, martial arts, nuker magic arts, transformation styles(!), and a remarkable collection of creative "support" styles (things like mana draining strikes, various disorients, slows, DOTS, etc.). A large variety can be known, and you can transition between them on the fly, setting up the game's "harmonic combo" finishing moves or unleashing your own improvisational strategies. And Bioware didn't lay these arts out as a menu for you to wearily pick through; many of them are made available through questing or optional discoveries, or like the transformation styles, by defeating particular enemies. One of the best parts of the game, or any game, is an episode in the Emperial City, where you face down a foreigner by the name of Sir Roderick Von Fontlebottom, the Magnificent ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, voiced by John Cleese(!). After defeating him in a series of trials of wits and martial skill (if you can, the man's obviously your superior) one of the available rewards is Mirabelle, his muzzle-loading blunderbuss, as a weapon style. You can thenceforward barge through the game's normally-fluid martial arts combat, blasting first like a Harrison Ford character.\n\nMirabelle isn't a "necessary" skill to get you through late game; there's no such thing as a critical path of skill development. Which means you just take what's awesome. And there's lots and lots of awesome. There's the secret perk of the maxed-out double axes. There's the stunning power of White Demon martial style. There's the crazy OP speed of focus mode. There's the mighty disables of Storm Dragon. There's Red Minister transformation style, with crazy vampiric healing. You can get ALL of these, map whichever you want (up to 4 within easy reach) and then put upgrade points into your favorites without forgoing the others. Because styles provide benefits aside from raw damage, you're not confined late-game to your most upgraded techniques. They're your big guns, but even without upgrades you can still make practical and clever use of a wide variety of styles right up til the last fight. That's just good game design right there.\n\nAnd then there's the writing. When Bioware's on, they're on. And this game is a top-shelf balance of drama and humor, one that is in my opinion, still unmatched. One of the major achievements is the integration of the morality system and your plot choices into your relationships with your many followers; that's about all I'll say about that. I'd just cheapen it with many words.\n\nI could really go on and on; dat morality system! Dat follower! Dat other follower! LOL Black Whirlwind! FML Death's Hand! John Cleese! Nathan Fillion! LOL Kang the Mad! Holy ♥♥♥♥ the part with the inn! LOL come at me 50 foot tall golem! I don't even know how to tell you how my mind was blown when I played this game on the original XBox, before modern graphics jaded my eyes. For those who were lucky enough to enjoy Jade Empire back when 5 character models for an entire game didn't bother you, or for those who can project back to those days and enjoy a game on the basis of its storytelling, creativity, and humor, Jade Empire is a true treasure. Put it on your wish list and grab it on sale.","February 11, 2014","true","34.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Drakevarg/recommended/7110/","Drakevarg","Drakevarg","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Drakevarg/","94 products in account","I've heard Jade Empire described as BioWare's awkward teenage phase, and I'm inclined to agree.  Jade Empire is basically KOTOR as filtered through the wuxia genre. While the setting is a refreshing shift from the space-opera-or-European-fantasy split of most BioWare RPGs, the story is the exact same one they're always telling and this experimental phase leads to a lot of stumbles.\n\nAfter NWN and KOTOR's simplistic Good/Evil dichotomy, but before Mass Effect's Idealistic Good/Ruthless Good dichotomy, Jade Empire experimented with the notion of Open Palm vs. Closed Fist, which in theory was a more interesting philosophy of "help people to the point of coddling" vs. "be self serving so people don't become dependent on you." In practice, however, Open Palm was still White Hat and Closed Fist was still Black Hat, which is shown best just before the climax where you press the Big Bad's right hand man into your service, and your only possible responses to your party's objections to that are "let your new minion go" or "mindrape everyone who disagrees."\n\nAs with most of BioWare's works, the story is filled with these false dichotomies, where you're allowed no middle ground between all-loving saint and sadistic bully. The writers seem to have some sort of outright contempt towards the notion of neutrality, a point that seemed to be poorly parodied in KOTOR II, but that's neither here nor there.\n\nAll of this would probably only warrant Jade Empire my usual unenthusiastic recommendation I give for most of BioWare's more mediocre titles, but the gameplay mechanics solidly push this game into the "can't recommend" bin. Jade Empire entirely does away with BioWare's usual RPG standbys, starting you off with a selection of predesigned character models that never change, and the only equipment you ever accrue are either combat styles - which each level independantly as if you were taking a dozen different prestige classes - and gemstones, which provide extremely minor stat boosts, with extra slots opening up as you progress through the plot. None of this is BAD per se - certainly less interesting, to the point where I kind of wonder why they even bothered with the gems instead of focusing entirely on honing your martial arts skills - but the problem just boils down to the fact that combat is clunky and not really fun.\n\nCombat basically boils down to four things; punching your enemy in the face, using a heavy attack when they block,\nhealing when you're injured, and using the Spirit Thief style when you're low on chi. Unfortunately, some enemies (demons, mostly) are immune to Spirit Thief, and chi only restores from certain spirit fonts or by using the Spirit Thief ability. The biggest annoyance though, is the recurring issue with your attacks slowly knocking your opponent back at a rate slightly faster than you can walk (which is obscenely slow in combat, as if your character had a ball and chain on each ankle). So every few strikes, you'd be forced to awkwardly hobble your way back into melee range before continuing, often leaving yourself open to blows in the meantime.\n\nIt's not a dealbreaker, as the combat ultimately proved so easy for the most part that I barreled through almost every single threat in the game with very little effort. But "easy" does not necessarily equate to "fun," and while manageable every fight in the game felt like swimming through jelly. The fact that your allies are almost entirely useless may be justified by the ease with which you can solo everything, but that begs the question of why they're even there other than a few moderately interesting character designes to piddle about in the background of your fights half-heartedly holding aggro for one or two of your opponents.\n\nJade Empire isn't really a bad game, it doesn't do anything wrong so much as it does a lot of things poorly. Ultimately I can only sum it up as a very ANNOYING game. Give it a miss.","March 10, 2015","false","16.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

That doesn't make it bad, but there is a reason the developer turned Mass Effect and Dragon Age into trilogies and we haven't heard a word about Jade Empire 2.\n\nParadoxically, this is also Bioware's most unique RPG.  It is a martial arts RPG set in a high fantasy world inspired by Chinese folklore.  The combat animations are very good, creating using motion capture technology of actual martial arts professionals.\n\nHere's the problem: the combat is bad.  For a game with a heavy focus on combat, that is very problematic.  The animations look great, but as a player all you do is push a few buttons to either: quick attack, power attack, block, or area attack.  While the player can obtain other styles, almost everything combat has to offer in the game is experienced in the tutorial.  Combat then becomes a routine affair of whitling down enemy health while jumping around trying to avoid damage.  Pro tip: don't use the "Thousand Cuts" style, as a result of its animation timing (seriously), it is notably inferior to the other starting styles.\n\nMore problematic: character creation is incredibly linear.  As you level up, your Health, Chi, and Focus increase.  You then can assign 3 points to either Health, Chi, or Focus.  Pro Tip: Chi is probably the best option.  Meaning, multiple playthroughs will feel very similar to each other.\n\nStill, the game does have a story similar to other Bioware hits.  If you liked Knights of the Old Republic and Mass Effect for the story, you will enjoy this game for the story alone.  It is suitably epic, has a pretty big twist towards the end, and frankly there is nothing else quite like this game.  The characters are well written, and Henpecked Ho and Black Wirlwind provide good comic relief.  Protip: For combat, just use Dawn Star's support mode, which replenishes Chi.","November 26, 2013","false","14.5"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

It is a very predictable story. You are a student to a great, but unknown master with a dark past that wants to keep you safe until the hand of destiny itself sets you on a path to restore balance in the empire. There is a twist that feels telegraphed and a bit of mystery surrounding one of the characters that gives itself away before you're even two hourse in, if you're paying attention. It is short, but in this case it's a good thing, as the story is so generic it would feel like wading through a pool of undried cement. At just about 25 hours, give or take, it paces itself rather well and is coherent, but for a game with conversation options, it's extremely linear, especially once you enter the fortress. The biggest let down is the conversations. Each conversation you are given a number of lines you can choose which amount to nothing unless it's an obvious good vs. evil type of choice. Each character you speak to reacts almost the same way and says the same things regardless of your answer, with some exceptions with the three romance options (two per gender). Also, every important character that you encounter more often than once will repeat themselves almost endlessly. In one conversation I had with the Water Dragon, she told me the same thing no less than seven times, to the detriment of my already dying brain.\nThe combat is, well, annoying. On one hand it's dynamic, keeping you involved in every fight, which is a good thing. On the other hand it's repetitive and even outright annoying. Your attacks have this bothersome ability of knocking back the enemy you are attacking just out of reach of your next attack, unless you pin them to the edge of the fight zone. Fast styles are almost hands down superior to any slower style because each attack interrupts your enemy (unless they are a massive enemy like the toad or elephant demons or the jade golems). The mechanics of each enemy, while interesting at first become a nuisance the further you go into the story, especially ghosts.\nThere is one mini game (thankfully) in the game, but I won't go into it as you can effectively skip all of it unless you want to finish a character's quest line. The other ones are useless, or next to.\nThe redeeming quality is the game's companion characters. For a short game they are rather one dimensional but interesting enough to last you the first half of the game after which you won't get anything more than remarks out of them, with the exception of your romance option. They will comment as you adventure and then when you all group up again will act like they were just then hearing about what was happening for the first time. However, they are colorful and fit very well within their one dimension, fleshing it out very well.\n\nI understand that the review seems rather negative, but I rather enjoyed the game, with some glaring exceptions. Jade Empire is akin to that somewhat annoying dinner guest, who is pleasant enough company but you can't quite wait for them to leave, as much as you might wish to feel otherwise.\n\nOverall this is a game that, in my opinion, desperately needs a sequel to redeem itself.

I'm a huge fan of everything Bioware, but this is just plain awful. The story is good, along with the writing and voice acting, but the gameplay feels like pre-street fighter 1 levels of terrible, unrefined "action" combat. It's like whoever designed this game had never heard the phrase "button mash" or "stun lock". Which is fine for every other Bioware RPG, but not one that for a game with a fighting game style combat system. Combine that with an atrocious PC port with controls that fight you at every turn and visuals that, while good looking, are inconsistent (certain prompts and information would simply disappear during combat some of the time) and buggy, and you get a heaping pile of crap that Bioware deserves more ♥♥♥♥ for than Mass Effect 3's ending. I stopped playing this game half way through and uninstalled it.","December 5, 2013","false","26.5"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","10","21","0","0"

It is a brilliant game that is just beautiful. I absolutely loved it on the xbox and was overjoyed to find it here on steam. I would truly love nothing more than to highly recommend it to anyone and everyone... Sadly though I can not as it does not work on steam nor does it look like that will change anytime in the near future. There are a few lucky souls who after hours upon hours of tinkering have gotten this game to work for them... Sadly though they are a very, very, very small percent. If your PC happen to be running anything remotely new do not expect this game to work. Expect to see many, many "Failed to find steam" messages. I bought this game back in March and I have tinkered with it for countless hours, have tried every work around that exists on the internet and have yet to see it work. IF this game ever gets fixed (and that is looking like a very big IF)... IF by some miracle this game ever does happen to get fixed I would highly recommend it but at this point that looks like it will never happen. For now save your money and buy something that actually works.

Before you uncover the truth about what goes on and what's your role in it, you will have to travel through cities, valleys, forests, swamps, caves and mountains, meeting interesting characters on every corner.\n\nEven though the main focus of the game is story, the action-based combat doesn't lag behind and is enriched with different weapon tactics, various techniques and (eventually) transmorphing into mythical beings during fights. The only problem is, there doesn't seem to be enough time to really try these out, since by the time you collect most of them, the game is nearly over.\n\nJade Empire implements the aesthetic and mythology of the far east while building an intricate, believable world with great characters, mesmerizing environments and exciting quests.

You play as a kung fu student who goes after his master's kidnappers. Along the way happens a lot and you get meet lots of interesting characters.\n\nBasically Jade Empire is what you expect from Bioware: lots of dialogue with your crew, simple battle mechanics and interesting lore and world. It takes its lore and world from chinese history and makes it its own. By today's standards graphics don't scare you away but they are nothing special.  Battle mechanics were almost merely one-button-smashing but there were also little bit strategic elements behind it.\n\nIn my opinion the main aspect in the game is the story. I found it starting up slowly with firt couple of hours but then it was hard not to play it 'till the ende by one sitting.\n\nI recommend it with 9/10.

It has something to offer for everyone; fast-paced and fun combat, great story, interesting characters, RPG elements, fun "minigames" (for lack of a better word), possible relationships with other characters (and especially Sky). The graphics don't look as amazing as they seemed several years ago, but the visual side is still pleasant to look at and very characteristic.\n\nWhat made this game one of my favourites was the story. Even though it may seem a bit boring at the beginning, soon the story grips you and doesn't let go until you finish the game. Not only you visit interesting locations and meet various people (who actually seem like real characters and not just something generated for a game), you also make significant choices that affect the game's ending.\n\nThe last element I would like to mention is the combat. As for my character, I chose the Leaping Tiger style and after upgrading it to maximum, I think it's the best I could have chosen, maybe with an exception of Crimson Tears, but they require a lot of focus. But I loved the way you could learn new styles (Drunken Fist was hilarious) and that you could choose how your companion would support you (active/passive).\n\nThe only downside to this game is that the Steam version is somewhat buggy. In my case, the game was in slow motion. I managed to solve the issue, though I can't remember how. If you're unsure whether you would like this game, I recommend waiting for a Steam sale. If it's below 5 euro, you won't regret getting it.","March 26, 2014","true","0.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Once again Bioware doesn't dissapoint with their masterful storytelling, plot and gameplay.\n\nGraphically, this special edition has improved the textures of the original and added in extra features not present in the original game. Even though the game is years old, the atmosphere is colorful and vivid with very well done asian influenced concepts.\n\nIn the gameplay department, the controls are a bit stiff even when playing with the gamepad. Controls are very much like "The Legend Of Zelda", everything is in real time and most enemies will gang up on you. Red bar is obviously health, Blue bar is for healing, magic attack or add damage to physical attack, Yellow bar is for weapon or bullet time.\n\nI highly recommend this game to people who enjoy Bioware games and/or people who are into games with a near perfect blend of story and gameplay.

Sure, it was serviceable enough of an RPG to keep me coming back until its conclusion but the game's flaws are too numerous and damaging to make it truely enjoyable or worthy of recommendation.  From its exposition-choked opening hours to its final moments which can be replayed quickly to achieve all possible endings, thus cheapening the experience, Jade Empire just feels weak and overwrought.  Dialogue is so ridiculously heavy and voice acting sometimes so poor that it had me angrily jamming my finger into the LMB repeatedly within ten minutes of starting the game.  Despite the game's insistence that I use various martial styles to deal with different combat situations, I rarely needed to do more than equip my longsword and spam the LMB in order to win fights.  Meh.  Jade Empire is clearly the result of a young Bioware biting off more than it can chew.  Add to this the fact that Bioware and Valve released a broken and unplayable version of this game onto Steam, requiring the consumer to do the necessary legwork to get it working and the result is a very resounding NO.","August 25, 2015","false","23.6"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

I purchased it upon recommendation from some friends. I was initially rather frustrated due to compatibility issues with modern machines - be warned, this game has some issues with Windows 8. If you are running W8, make sure you go into your SteamApps/common/Jade Empire folder, then run the "Jade Empire.exe" as an administrator - this usually fixes any issues you have with it. It also tends to be a bit disagreeable with dual monitors and alt-tabbing.\n\nThe game itself is typical of BioWare, before they really solidified their RPG formula. It is very reminiscent of KOTOR, minus a lot of the polish. The story is fairly predictable and cliché - it's almost to the point where I startred treating it as a martial arts parody. The big "twist" can also be seen a mile away, and it wasn't all that great either. Generic good vs. evil morality system, characters are fairly flat and one-dimensional. Difficulty is all out of whack and oscillates with little predictability, with some fights being frustrating, and the majority being too easy.\n\nOverall, it's... okay. It's not great, but it isn't a bad game either. Definitely worth a try if you can pick it up on sale for cheap.","March 19, 2014","true","17.1"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

To make it quit I had to set Steam.exe to run as Administrator.  Which Steam warned me I shouldn't do, but it was the only way I could play the game.  Another thing that was a tad off putting was I had to adjust the resolution to get the mouse cursor to show.  Which was a slight pain, but worth doing.

But I did all but one quest that I came across and the game seemed a bit small. Most of the exploration and adventuring you do is only available to you for the first three chapters where afterwards you are basically locked into the main plot.\n\nJade Empire feels smaller to me than KOTOR and is significantly smaller than Mass Effect, but it stands firmly by itself and is a good game.

Honestly, I was pretty angry when I originally wrote my review below, but now that I have a clear head, I wanted to clarify something:\n\nI dont' give a ♥♥♥♥ what your experience with this game was.\n\nMY experience was that this game was so agonizingly terrible that I didn't feel it was worth my time to keep playing long enough finish the tutorial.\n\nSo if you ask me "Hey Dubhe14, would you like recommend this game or whatever just askin'"\n\nI'd be like "no, this game makes playing Too Human with beer goggles sound fun by comparison"\n\nThe story was bad.  The combat was bad.  The game mechanics were bad.  Graphics were pretty alright considering its age, I can't really complain.  Dialogue was bad.  Characters were bland and uninteresting.\n\n"well maybe dubee14 just sucks and is totally jellz that he wasn't good at this game like I am" betch I have nearly 200 hours on Dark Souls don't bring that "u jus suk" nonsense in here.\n\nJade Empire is like your second playthrough of Knighs of the Old Republic, where you purposefully make all the bad choices just to be 100% evil, except they did it with design choices instead, and the result was a game that is 100% poop.\n\n------------------------------ORIGINAL REVIEW:\n\nI was really excited to play this game, since it gets unreal praise from everyone.  Too bad it's terrible.\n\nCombat:  This game has the most unintuitive, unengaging, clunky, button-mashing-dependant, wtf-was-that-unfair combat system I've ever seen in any game.  The combat system is built for 1-on-1 fights, but the game constantly pits you against 6 people at once, some of which will invariably be wielding weapons.  Since there are no area or sweeping attacks, and you're forced to damage one enemy at a time, this means you'll get surrouncded and stun-locked to death.  Oh, and wielding weapons depletes your "Focus" bar - when it gets empty, you are restricted from using weapons, a limit not placed on your enemies.\n\nDodging: In the game options, you can change the dodge controls - you can have your character dodge when you double tap in a direction, or when you move in a direction while holding down "Block".  Choosing double-tap means your character will dodge forward whenever you change directions mid-run outside of combat - only forward, though, that's the only direction you're allowed to doge in outside of combat.  Needless to say, this gets very aggravating very quickly.\n\nCamera:  All the game's problems are exacerbated by the game's camera, which hovers right behind your character, but low enough that you can't see your hands.  This basically makes it impossible to judge how far away you are from an enemy, and whether you're close enough for your attack to hit.  It's a crap-shoot.  Easily fixable if you could angle the camera to one side, but it resets right away.\n\nMaybe it's a bad port to PC, and that's the reason for all these problems?  I can't belive this game came out 2 years after KOTOR, which had none of the issues above.  I can count on one hand how many games I've willingly abandoned, and now Jade Empire is part of that list, right next to Fable 3.  Maybe the story becomes AMAZING a few more hours in, but this game is absolute agony to play through - not worth it to me.","November 1, 2014","false","3.7"," 3 of 18 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","3","18","0","0"

I did buy this game legitimately though (3 times to be precise)\n\nConfession over.\n\nNow then, do I like this game? Yes. would I recommend it to my friends? Yes. But the best way to describe this game is that it's akin to an uncut gem; still beautiful to look at, sure, but there is so much potential that's not quite realized. The game was clearly made as an "in between game," something that can keep the developers busy while the think-tank works on the next big project.\n\nThat said, this game is one of my favorites, and I have a short list of favorites. My most love aspect is the combat, as it's not the "choose an action" type from KotOR 1, but neither is it the "Pause and command" type from Mass Effect. It's more free flowing and it gives me the feeling of being a wushu master, or in this case, the Spirit Monk, and I love how each style can flow so smoothly into each other. Some better than others, but finding the best combo for you is part of the fun.\n\nOne major gripe for me though is that, for the sake of time, the story was made FAR to predictable. Granted, I still felt the happiness and sadness that I was supposed to feel, but there was always that underlying thought that I knew it was going to happen...but then it makes up for it somewhat with the unpredictable side quests, so it's a little for given.\n\nOverall, I love the game, and if anyone that has a Mac wants to play this, here's what you do.\n1. Buy the game. Doesn't mater from where, but this is Steam, so lets say from here ;)\n2. Go to Paulthetall.com, and find the games wrapper. No, you can't buy from him.\n3. Fallow his instructions. He outlines what to do on the page, and with a youtube video, so both should help.\n4. Download Direct X 9 when prompted. The game MUST have this or IT WILL NOT RUN! Other games need this to, so it's no real loss anyway.\n5. Make sure to use a two button mouse. I know from experience that the Apple Magic Mouse will work with the game, but the right mouse function does not work, and trust me, I was able to make the game a lot easier by just switching mouses. (mice?)\n6.1 You may need to turn down the graphics a bit, but I've found that just turing the shadows off is enough for the overworld if you still want to have some nice looking polygons.\n6.2 To play the SHMUP portions of the game more effectually, but still have some nice graphics , just turn down the graphics during those sections to zero and it'll play like butter-nice and smooth. Then, when thats done, just turn them all back on again (remembering to leave shadows off of coarse.)\n\nThis has helped my gameplay immensely and I hope I just made you Mac users happier by showing you the way to play this uncut gem.","January 26, 2015","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The overall framework.  The way you gather and interact with your party.  The interface.  The dialogue choices and morality system.  All are very typical Bioware.  If you like those things, great.  If not, be warned.  If you've never played a Bioware game, then I'd probably recomed that you start with either Knights of the Old Republic, Dragon Age, or Mass Effect, all of which are better games (over all), than Jade Empire.\n\nJade Empire excels over other Bioware games, in my opinion, in three areas.  First, the combat system is above average for a Bioware RPG.  Similar to, but much smoother than, KOTOR.  Less tactical, but also less frustrating, than Dragon Age.  In fact, I think this is what they were going for with Dragon Age II, they just didn't get it quite right (given that Dragon Age II was rushed out the door, this is not surprising).  Combat is fun and fluid, and yet still tactically interesting.\n\nThe other area, is that the basic mini-game (a bullet hell, bomber-run style airplane game), works better than most Bioware mini-games.  Admittedly, this is a low bar.\n\nFinally, the setting here is easily the most original that Bioware has ever done.  I really hope that they readdress it.  We don't see a lot of respectful, well-crafted, Asian-inspired fantasy settings in North American produced RPGs--and certainly not ones where all of the characters look Asian and have Asian-sounding names.  Yes, it's a hodge-podge of Chinese art, archetecture, and fantasy traditions--but Dragon Age is a hodge-podge of European-inspired art, archetecture, and fantasy traditions.  This is a great world, and I hope that they come back to it.\n\nSo what's the down side?\n\nThe minor complaint is that a few of the fights (less than 5) are wildly imbalanced.  As in, everything else will be trivially easy, and suddenly you will hit a fight that feels almost impossible.\n\nThe more serious complaint is that the game is really short, for a Bioware RPG.  My first playthrough of most Bioware RPGs takes between 40 and 70 hours.  My first playthrough of Jade Empire took less than 20 hours.  The game just felt TOO streamlined.  For example:\n- Large sections of the Empire were mentioned, but the player was never allowed to visit them.\n- Only 1 party member has a side quest.\n- The romance (whichever option you take) feels very rushed, because of a general lack of interaction.\n- One playthrough is not enough time to explore the corners of the combat system, but the storyline is too linear and the game too lacking in side-areas to explore, to encourage much replayability.\n\nIf anyone else had made Jade Empire, it would be a very good RPG.  Heck, it's still a very good RPG.  But for a Bioware game, it's a bit disapointing--which is sad, because it has a tremendous amount of potential.","January 7, 2015","true","36.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No let me rephrase that, if you do, make sure it's from Grandma's bank account or a Gift Card you got on the holidays, do not waste you good-earned money on it, and make sure it's ON SALE! Because $14.99 is not worth the trouble your going to have to go through.\nOne of the common most problems would be "Can't find Steam"\n...\n....\n.....Really?\nWhat you need to do is:\nComputer->  Program Files(x86)->  Steam->  steamapps->  common->  Jade Empire->  data\nor do it the easy way Right Click game on Steam, Properties, Local Files, Browse Local Files, data\nGo to Notepad.\nSave your blank note as SystemInformation.xml in *All files* not .txt\n\nWhile your there, you might want to change the compatibility of JadeEmpire, JadeEmpireConfig, JadeEmpireLauncher, and TestApp to Windows XP (Service Pack 3), and also select run this program as admin, and you'll do this by right clicking all of them, properties, compatibility, and so on and so forth.\n\nCool. kay. if it works great!\nIf it doesn't, though you should probably just do this just in case, then you'll have to go to Control Panel search for Advanced System Settings, a window will pop up, you want to click Environment Variables, another window will pop up, you'll see User variables...what you want to go to is system variables which is right below user variables, scroll down until you see Path, *not PATHEXT*, press edit, a window will pop up, press end, put a semicolon: ; and copy your Steam address, paste it at the end of the semicolon and press okay, restart and then run Steam as admin, and you should be able to play the game, I have YET to get Jade Empie Configuration to work, but the game works.\n\n(Thanks to the countless of threads and youtube video I had to zoom through to get this game a-working)\n\nAnd then after all that, if your lucky you'll probably get through the game before the 'Stutter' kicks in, that, your on your own with.\n\nALRIGHT!\n\nThe reason I would recommend this game is because it's fun, I loved it, even with all it's problems.\nIt's a pain in the butt to get Sky to kiss your male characters butt, but the fact you can choose your own path, be a hero or a tyrant is  just extremely fun to me, also the game is fairly easy, but this is coming from the person who LIVES on Student difficulty, other than it's many problems, it's A-O-KAY!","December 28, 2014","true","54.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/caylana/recommended/7110/","caylana","Crynn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/caylana/","133 products in account","I really feel like I should bother to write a review for this game.\nBack in the days, I used to play this game quite a lot on my Xbox, so I was really excited when I realized that this game was also getting released on Steam.\n\nFirst off, let me address all the people saying that they could not get this game to run on Win7 and above. I myself also use Win7 and have played it multiple times without even a single glitch or bug. The game runs just as smoothly as it did on my console, if not even smoother.\nAnd if you had sacrificed a mere two minutes of your lives searching for a solution to the infamous "Steam not found"-error you would be able to enjoy this game in its entirety as well.\nFor those too thick-headed to look it up themselves:\na) Either replace the JadeLauncher.exe with the JadeEmpire.exe or\nb) add your Steam directory as a path in Win7 (and above).\nIt really is not that hard, guys.\n\nBut enough with the whining. I came here to write a review about the game and this is what I will do.\nI'd really like to compose some kind of list of the pros and cons of the game but unfortunately, I cannot think of anything that'd fall into the latter category.\n\nEven though this game might not be up to the modern-day graphics standard (also meaning that there is no HD remake ... yet), the game makes up for it with an intense and engaging story, an entertaining combat system and a wide variety of different combat styles and techniques.\nThe choice, as with many Bioware titles, is complely up to you:\nWhether you prefer the classic martial arts, like the brute force of a wide arsenal of different melee and (one...) ranged weapons, fancy being a ranged spellcaster or even prefer to transform into a various amount of demons to squish your foes in an instant, the game does offer you every single one of these possibilities.\nThe choices you make on your way to your ultimate goal do, of course, affect how the story develops and how the people react to you. There are the two big classic sides of good (the so-called Way of the Open Palm) and bad (The Closed Fist). Depending on those you gain different trinkets and skills and shape the climax of the game.\n\nBut you don't have to travel alone. The game helps you out with several companions, each one with an interesting back story and unique abilities. Don't like dragging someone along the whole time who is only getting in the way? It's not a problem! Almost every companion has two different ways to aid you in combat: Attack and support.\nBut I do have to say that most of the compnions fancy you being the nice guy, so you might have a hard time dealing with them when walking the dark path.\n\nUnfortunately, there are some techniques in the game that cannot be accessed and learnt during the game (and of course, these are mostly only the cool ones). Nevertheless, some talented modder thought of a solution to this problem and released the best and most popular mod for Jade Empire: Jade in Style. If you already know the game and are looking for a little more variation in styles you should certainly check out this mod.\n\nThe world of Jade Empire seems somewhat like a mashup of many different clichés of medival Asia but it really doesn't matter after the first few minutes of gameplay.\nSadly, you cannot explore most areas - the game basically tells you where to go and the progression through the different areas is rather linear, especially when entering a dungeon.\n\nI'd really like to talk about its main feature - the story.\nBut I won't because I do not want to spoil anything and I am not quite sure I would be able to say something different than "OMG, it's so epic!!" (you get the gist).\nLet me just say that the game contained the most WTF plot twist of my childhood.\n\nSo, in conclusion, I'd like to say that I highly recommend this game. I have by far not talked about all the features this game offers because I feel that some things should be yours to discover.\nOnce you get it to run, the whole experience is at least as good as it was "in the olden days". It even offers full (Xbox) controller support, but is just easy to play with a mouse and a keyboard (it's what I did).\nI hope that a few of you will not be deterred by the vast amount of negative reviews regarding the PC adaption because it really is a very good game.\nBut go and see for yourselves!","August 13, 2014","true","36.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They are effective in making an Asian-influenced world with a fun and unique combat system based on real-time kung-fu combos and a sort of chi magic.\n\nOverall, it feels like an experiment for trying out many of the features and ideas they would make into Knights of the Old Republic.

JE was published and developed by BioWare, which many may recognize as the company under EA which is known to deliver on immersive, story rich games which often include innovative gameplay mechanics, such as the Mass Effect or Dragon Age series. Jade Empire is no exception, as the fighting is very rewarding and, surprisingly, does not get repetitive nearly as fast as you might expect it to. Different martial arts styles are very distinctive from one another, although certain martial arts and weapon styles outshine others, which means most players may opt out of changing styles due to the success they have with a certain one. Decision-making is a pivotal part of the game. The decisions you make will branch the story out to a certain extent, affect how characters react to you and also affect the ending too.\n\nJade Empire's story is long and immersive. You take the role of a student in a martial arts school lead by your mentor, Master Li. You can choose your character from a selection of different toons, either going with a pre-selected loadout (Starting styles and stats, like in many MMORPGs) or making your own loadout. Your own character isn't voice acted, which is a shame, but it's not that big of a deal.\n\nJade Empire is quite a long game and it takes you through various cities, villages and wildernesses throughout China. The game has a companion system, which lets you be accompanied by one character out of many others who you meet on your journey. You can switch out companions at nearly any time you wish, as they all follow you during your journey in the background. (Appearing in a camp when not selected). The story takes many turns and if you are into Chinese mythology or history, you will definitely enjoy Jade Empire. The game is a bit old, but it is not it's fault and I still warmly recommend it to anyone. It requires some patience from the player to listen to the narrative and get immersed in the story, as all BioWare games do anyway. In my opinion, the combat is very fun and rewarding, as for some bosses and enemies you really have to plan ahead and switch styles during the fight in order to survive.\n\nThe characters and the plot are what shine in the game the most for me. Some provide comic relief, some provide moral guidance for the decisions you must make during your journey, and some work to intrigue you and astonish you. My favorite character is hands down is Henpecked Hou, an awkward chef who acts as comic relief by complaining about how he will get beat up by his wife and who also provides a unique drunken martial style by throwing wine bottles at you during combat. A great guy indeed.\n\nAll in all, there is only one thing that I can think of that Jade Empire really, really needs. A sequel. Seriously. The game has a great story as long as you have the patience to play through it. The game is great and the main factor that makes it great is that there aren't many games like it out here in Steam.","July 27, 2014","true","35.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A real diamond in the rough. It is by far Bioware most intriguing and original piece. The Eastern setting and the lore behind these fantastic world is just vibrantly alive with bright colours and characters. The influence of Chinese mythology, history and fantasy is pure delight providing something new. Although there is nothing new regading the story saving the world premise, the story is told rather well and the progression of the characters purpose is done briliantly. I will not say more as to keep the suspense but despite its briliance, there are some mind numbing flaws that might cause you to lose patience with it.\n\nJade Empire has not been ported well by LTI Gray Matter, and the starting up of the game is the first problem. The steam community has been  extremely helpful in providing the details to make it run as smooth as it can be however problems such as missing mouse and the occasional crashes may and can deter you from playing it despite the assistance. From the way it is ported, it is clearly design to be played in a console. Its combat mechanics is also rather weak and fairly easy.  In conclusion Jade Empire is a unique  experience full of lore and mystical beings but only if you get passed the  technical problems that persist it.\n\nPros\n- Great Lore and Worldbuilding\n- Great sense of character development for the main character\n- Some very fasicnating side quest\n- Eastern Setting is fresh\n- Bright Colours\n\n\nCons\n- Crashes and startup\n- Recycle story of saving the world and clinches\n- Weak Combat mechanics","March 26, 2015","true","36.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

JE was published and developed by BioWare, which many may recognize as the company under EA which is known to deliver on immersive, story rich games which often include innovative gameplay mechanics, such as the Mass Effect or Dragon Age series. Jade Empire is no exception, as the fighting is very rewarding and, surprisingly, does not get repetitive nearly as fast as you might expect it to. Different martial arts styles are very distinctive from one another, although certain martial arts and weapon styles outshine others, which means most players may opt out of changing styles due to the success they have with a certain one. Decision-making is a pivotal part of the game. The decisions you make will branch the story out to a certain extent, affect how characters react to you and also affect the ending too.\n\nJade Empire's story is long and immersive. You take the role of a student in a martial arts school lead by your mentor, Master Li. You can choose your character from a selection of different toons, either going with a pre-selected loadout (Starting styles and stats, like in many MMORPGs) or making your own loadout. Your own character isn't voice acted, which is a shame, but it's not that big of a deal.\n\nJade Empire is quite a long game and it takes you through various cities, villages and wildernesses throughout China. The game has a companion system, which lets you be accompanied by one character out of many others who you meet on your journey. You can switch out companions at nearly any time you wish, as they all follow you during your journey in the background. (Appearing in a camp when not selected). The story takes many turns and if you are into Chinese mythology or history, you will definitely enjoy Jade Empire. The game is a bit old, but it is not it's fault and I still warmly recommend it to anyone. It requires some patience from the player to listen to the narrative and get immersed in the story, as all BioWare games do anyway. In my opinion, the combat is very fun and rewarding, as for some bosses and enemies you really have to plan ahead and switch styles during the fight in order to survive.\n\nThe characters and the plot are what shine in the game the most for me. Some provide comic relief, some provide moral guidance for the decisions you must make during your journey, and some work to intrigue you and astonish you. My favorite character is hands down is Henpecked Hou, an awkward chef who acts as comic relief by complaining about how he will get beat up by his wife and who also provides a unique drunken martial style by throwing wine bottles at you during combat. A great guy indeed.\n\nAll in all, there is only one thing that I can think of that Jade Empire really, really needs. A sequel. Seriously. The game has a great story as long as you have the patience to play through it. The game is great and the main factor that makes it great is that there aren't many games like it out here in Steam.","July 27, 2014","true","35.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a great RPG and incredibly underrated. The story is a bit cliche but fun and the combat is excellent. One could argue that this game with the real time combat was a blue print for what Bioware would eventually do in the upcoming Mass Effect games. I love this game and wish more people could get into it...unfortunately the steam version doesn't do this title any favors.\n\nI cannot recommend this title through steam as it is a hassle to get working. There are several steps you have to go through just to get the damn game to load. Once that's done you may experience problems with in game cut scenes and the music going out of sync. After about 30 minutes of editing and doing some homework through google I got everything working, but the fact that people need to go through all this effort is  totally stupid. I also noticed that you can play the game with the gamepad. I gave it a shot for nostalgia, and it's functional but the auto targeting system is a mess.\n\nFor any newcomers interested in this title, unless you're willing to take a chance and have some decent PC skills, try and give it a shot, but only if the game is dirt cheap on sale. For everyone else, I've been told the GOG version of Jade Empire runs fine without any problems, so you may want to check them out instead. Steam really needs to pay more attention to the games it offers its customers.\n","September 7, 2014","false","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nightengaleVII/recommended/7110/","nightengaleVII","Hazel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nightengaleVII/","249 products in account","This is a great RPG from BioWare that fuses beat-em-up elements and the RPG-style gameplay you've seen from other BioWare titles. While it might feel a little clunky if you're coming off the heels of a Mass Effect or Dragon Age title, it still holds up well. It also happens to be the last game BioWare made before selling their souls to EA (who I guess never had any interest in this IP, given that it never did get a sequel), so if you want to see how things have changed it could certainly serve as a little case study.\n\nOne big problem is that the PC port (which was done by a company called LTI Grey Matter, which I can't find any info about online at all) is rather sloppy. Playing in widescreen stretches the UI out and I had some issues getting it to run at more than slideshow framerates on my GTX 960 (a perfectly capable card for a game like this). There's also some issues that seem to be particular to the Steam edition of the game, but you can find a few guides around to mess with the files necessary to fix that. The game has full controller support though, being that it was on the Xbox at first, so that's cool. I would actually recommend using a controller if possible, since the mouse camera movement is way too fast for me even on the lowest sensitivity, but maybe that's just me.","November 18, 2015","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Every second you play this game you will want to be playing the exact same game except done better.\n\nCombat is slow, clunky, unbalanced, and clumsy and the second you fight enemies who can outright ignore your attacks you will yell foul as they become undefeatable without very specific strategies.\n\nWhat the game does right is create its world and mythology where even the philsophical nature of ethics is different from our own, albiet with the standard Bioware silly morality systems. The martial arts are diverse and interesting and some even awe inspiring. Sometimes you will just want to continue with the game just to see what you will get next and that is when the game is doing its best.\n\nOverall this game is a solid 6/10 I probably most want to see done right.","June 20, 2013","true","22.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Your character starts out as the star student of a martial arts school in a remote village, and in typical RPG style, you and your companions are quickly caught up in Much Bigger Things - to wit, the aforementioned ghouls, firebombings, and balance of heaven and earth - and sally forth to travel around the Jade Empire putting things right.\n\n","July 23, 2012","true","9.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yes, it is a bit aged. But it appears to have aged well. The fights are more twitch based than turn based, so I don't have the opportunity to pause the game as in KotOR or Dragon Age.

The dialogue system, the alignment system, the influence over companions, etc. is all inherited from the 1st game.\n\nThe only serious deviation is askewing of realtime-turn-based combat, for 3rd person combat. You click, and your character attacks, you can move and manuever your character at will.\n\nThere is also a shoot-em' up mini-game which, at times I think clashes with the rest of the game in tone, but otherwise is memorable where most of BIoware's mini games were either boring or insufferable.\n\nPerhaps the most memorable feature to this game? The Cast. Alot of star power arrived for this outing, Nathan Fillion, Brian Doyle Murray, Armin Shimerman, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly John Cleese, and anyone whose played adapation titles like Devil May Cry or Final Fantasy 9 or Armored Core 4 will recognize Kari Wahlgren.\n\n\nI honestly can't recommend this game enough, but be warned, Imperfect Customer has it right, you do need to mess with some files inorder to get the game both to work, and for your cursor (the mouse pointer) to appear.\n\nIf you're experiencing this problem download this file and put it into your Jade Empire directory:\n\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/22012712/JadeEmpireLauncher.exe\n\nIt's an old Jade Empire exe renamed "JadeEmpireLauncher" so steam will launch it instead of the launcher which can end in error.

Like the renaming fix, only the main exe works as workaround.    To fix, you need to add "steam" to your win8 environment PATH variable.\n\nHere's how for windows 8:\n1. control panel -> system icon -> Advanced system settings -> (this launch windows system properties)\n2. Advanced tab -> click on "environment variables" button.  (this launch environment variables user interface)\n3. on bottom section, inside system variables, select "PATH" variable from list.\n4. click edit button at bottom to edit PATH variable that you select above (3).\n5. append to variable value the text ";C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam;"  Make notice semicolon before and after and no blank space outside of ;\n\nclick cancel to abort anytime.\n\nstep 5 is important, do not mess up.  Or you may have to reinstall your computer.  Do not click okay until you are sure you did not mess up.   You can always come back and fix if you can retype the whole entire  string content from memory.   Click cancel to abort anytime.   Click okay when you are sure you did it right.  FYI: the entire string content is similar on most computer...you are fine if you make typo, just go back and edit.   Deleting and forgot entry is where re-install windows is a fix.  Here is what entire string content looks like on mine minus qoutes minus ":\n\n"C:\WINDOWS\system32;C:\WINDOWS;C:\WINDOWS\System32\Wbem;C:\WINDOWS\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\;C:\Program Files (x86)\ATI Technologies/ATI.ACE/Core-Static;C:/Users/Nhan/AppData/Local/Smartbar/Application/;C:/Program Files (x86)\Steam;"\n\n\n6. reboot computer to get environment path variable updated.?  play.","April 9, 2014","true","64.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In this world where most of us are - face it - pretty ordinary, it's great to be able to spend some time in a fictional place where you feel like you are truly making a difference. And in Jade Empire, this is not just a feeling that dawns on you when the credits start rolling. It's there from the very first minutes, and stays with you throughout the game.\n\nJade Empire is a typical, if slightly aged BioWare RPG. You can play the game in different ways depending on your preferences, and there are plenty of interesting characters to interact with. I wasn't too fond of a few companions initially, but they ended up growing on me. By the end of the game, I was happy to have all of them by my side.\n\nOn the downside, I ran into a bug that made the camera point at the floor a little more often than I'd like. This seemed to happen randomly and was pretty effective at breaking my immersion, but it could be fixed by saving and reloading.\n\nThis game is not as famous as most other BioWare RPGs (think SW:KOTOR, Mass Effect or Dragon Age), but it is interesting and unique in its own way, especially due to the Asian setting. Although not quite at the level of those blockbuster games, Jade Empire is more than worth your time.","June 19, 2014","true","20.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Upgrade them to become more awesome, and use your spirit amulet to enhance your core stats. Followers help by either fighting along side you, or offering support.

JE was published and developed by BioWare, which many may recognize as the company under EA which is known to deliver on immersive, story rich games which often include innovative gameplay mechanics, such as the Mass Effect or Dragon Age series. Jade Empire is no exception, as the fighting is very rewarding and, surprisingly, does not get repetitive nearly as fast as you might expect it to. Different martial arts styles are very distinctive from one another, although certain martial arts and weapon styles outshine others, which means most players may opt out of changing styles due to the success they have with a certain one. Decision-making is a pivotal part of the game. The decisions you make will branch the story out to a certain extent, affect how characters react to you and also affect the ending too.\n\nJade Empire's story is long and immersive. You take the role of a student in a martial arts school lead by your mentor, Master Li. You can choose your character from a selection of different toons, either going with a pre-selected loadout (Starting styles and stats, like in many MMORPGs) or making your own loadout. Your own character isn't voice acted, which is a shame, but it's not that big of a deal.\n\nJade Empire is quite a long game and it takes you through various cities, villages and wildernesses throughout China. The game has a companion system, which lets you be accompanied by one character out of many others who you meet on your journey. You can switch out companions at nearly any time you wish, as they all follow you during your journey in the background. (Appearing in a camp when not selected). The story takes many turns and if you are into Chinese mythology or history, you will definitely enjoy Jade Empire. The game is a bit old, but it is not it's fault and I still warmly recommend it to anyone. It requires some patience from the player to listen to the narrative and get immersed in the story, as all BioWare games do anyway. In my opinion, the combat is very fun and rewarding, as for some bosses and enemies you really have to plan ahead and switch styles during the fight in order to survive.\n\nThe characters and the plot are what shine in the game the most for me. Some provide comic relief, some provide moral guidance for the decisions you must make during your journey, and some work to intrigue you and astonish you. My favorite character is hands down is Henpecked Hou, an awkward chef who acts as comic relief by complaining about how he will get beat up by his wife and who also provides a unique drunken martial style by throwing wine bottles at you during combat. A great guy indeed.\n\nAll in all, there is only one thing that I can think of that Jade Empire really, really needs. A sequel. Seriously. The game has a great story as long as you have the patience to play through it. The game is great and the main factor that makes it great is that there aren't many games like it out here in Steam.","July 27, 2014","true","35.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The overall framework.  The way you gather and interact with your party.  The interface.  The dialogue choices and morality system.  All are very typical Bioware.  If you like those things, great.  If not, be warned.  If you've never played a Bioware game, then I'd probably recomed that you start with either Knights of the Old Republic, Dragon Age, or Mass Effect, all of which are better games (over all), than Jade Empire.\n\nJade Empire excels over other Bioware games, in my opinion, in three areas.  First, the combat system is above average for a Bioware RPG.  Similar to, but much smoother than, KOTOR.  Less tactical, but also less frustrating, than Dragon Age.  In fact, I think this is what they were going for with Dragon Age II, they just didn't get it quite right (given that Dragon Age II was rushed out the door, this is not surprising).  Combat is fun and fluid, and yet still tactically interesting.\n\nThe other area, is that the basic mini-game (a bullet hell, bomber-run style airplane game), works better than most Bioware mini-games.  Admittedly, this is a low bar.\n\nFinally, the setting here is easily the most original that Bioware has ever done.  I really hope that they readdress it.  We don't see a lot of respectful, well-crafted, Asian-inspired fantasy settings in North American produced RPGs--and certainly not ones where all of the characters look Asian and have Asian-sounding names.  Yes, it's a hodge-podge of Chinese art, archetecture, and fantasy traditions--but Dragon Age is a hodge-podge of European-inspired art, archetecture, and fantasy traditions.  This is a great world, and I hope that they come back to it.\n\nSo what's the down side?\n\nThe minor complaint is that a few of the fights (less than 5) are wildly imbalanced.  As in, everything else will be trivially easy, and suddenly you will hit a fight that feels almost impossible.\n\nThe more serious complaint is that the game is really short, for a Bioware RPG.  My first playthrough of most Bioware RPGs takes between 40 and 70 hours.  My first playthrough of Jade Empire took less than 20 hours.  The game just felt TOO streamlined.  For example:\n- Large sections of the Empire were mentioned, but the player was never allowed to visit them.\n- Only 1 party member has a side quest.\n- The romance (whichever option you take) feels very rushed, because of a general lack of interaction.\n- One playthrough is not enough time to explore the corners of the combat system, but the storyline is too linear and the game too lacking in side-areas to explore, to encourage much replayability.\n\nIf anyone else had made Jade Empire, it would be a very good RPG.  Heck, it's still a very good RPG.  But for a Bioware game, it's a bit disapointing--which is sad, because it has a tremendous amount of potential.","January 7, 2015","true","36.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In this world where most of us are - face it - pretty ordinary, it's great to be able to spend some time in a fictional place where you feel like you are truly making a difference. And in Jade Empire, this is not just a feeling that dawns on you when the credits start rolling. It's there from the very first minutes, and stays with you throughout the game.\n\nJade Empire is a typical, if slightly aged BioWare RPG. You can play the game in different ways depending on your preferences, and there are plenty of interesting characters to interact with. I wasn't too fond of a few companions initially, but they ended up growing on me. By the end of the game, I was happy to have all of them by my side.\n\nOn the downside, I ran into a bug that made the camera point at the floor a little more often than I'd like. This seemed to happen randomly and was pretty effective at breaking my immersion, but it could be fixed by saving and reloading.\n\nThis game is not as famous as most other BioWare RPGs (think SW:KOTOR, Mass Effect or Dragon Age), but it is interesting and unique in its own way, especially due to the Asian setting. Although not quite at the level of those blockbuster games, Jade Empire is more than worth your time.","June 19, 2014","true","20.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A real diamond in the rough. It is by far Bioware most intriguing and original piece. The Eastern setting and the lore behind these fantastic world is just vibrantly alive with bright colours and characters. The influence of Chinese mythology, history and fantasy is pure delight providing something new. Although there is nothing new regading the story saving the world premise, the story is told rather well and the progression of the characters purpose is done briliantly. I will not say more as to keep the suspense but despite its briliance, there are some mind numbing flaws that might cause you to lose patience with it.\n\nJade Empire has not been ported well by LTI Gray Matter, and the starting up of the game is the first problem. The steam community has been  extremely helpful in providing the details to make it run as smooth as it can be however problems such as missing mouse and the occasional crashes may and can deter you from playing it despite the assistance. From the way it is ported, it is clearly design to be played in a console. Its combat mechanics is also rather weak and fairly easy.  In conclusion Jade Empire is a unique  experience full of lore and mystical beings but only if you get passed the  technical problems that persist it.\n\nPros\n- Great Lore and Worldbuilding\n- Great sense of character development for the main character\n- Some very fasicnating side quest\n- Eastern Setting is fresh\n- Bright Colours\n\n\nCons\n- Crashes and startup\n- Recycle story of saving the world and clinches\n- Weak Combat mechanics","March 26, 2015","true","36.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No let me rephrase that, if you do, make sure it's from Grandma's bank account or a Gift Card you got on the holidays, do not waste you good-earned money on it, and make sure it's ON SALE! Because $14.99 is not worth the trouble your going to have to go through.\nOne of the common most problems would be "Can't find Steam"\n...\n....\n.....Really?\nWhat you need to do is:\nComputer->  Program Files(x86)->  Steam->  steamapps->  common->  Jade Empire->  data\nor do it the easy way Right Click game on Steam, Properties, Local Files, Browse Local Files, data\nGo to Notepad.\nSave your blank note as SystemInformation.xml in *All files* not .txt\n\nWhile your there, you might want to change the compatibility of JadeEmpire, JadeEmpireConfig, JadeEmpireLauncher, and TestApp to Windows XP (Service Pack 3), and also select run this program as admin, and you'll do this by right clicking all of them, properties, compatibility, and so on and so forth.\n\nCool. kay. if it works great!\nIf it doesn't, though you should probably just do this just in case, then you'll have to go to Control Panel search for Advanced System Settings, a window will pop up, you want to click Environment Variables, another window will pop up, you'll see User variables...what you want to go to is system variables which is right below user variables, scroll down until you see Path, *not PATHEXT*, press edit, a window will pop up, press end, put a semicolon: ; and copy your Steam address, paste it at the end of the semicolon and press okay, restart and then run Steam as admin, and you should be able to play the game, I have YET to get Jade Empie Configuration to work, but the game works.\n\n(Thanks to the countless of threads and youtube video I had to zoom through to get this game a-working)\n\nAnd then after all that, if your lucky you'll probably get through the game before the 'Stutter' kicks in, that, your on your own with.\n\nALRIGHT!\n\nThe reason I would recommend this game is because it's fun, I loved it, even with all it's problems.\nIt's a pain in the butt to get Sky to kiss your male characters butt, but the fact you can choose your own path, be a hero or a tyrant is  just extremely fun to me, also the game is fairly easy, but this is coming from the person who LIVES on Student difficulty, other than it's many problems, it's A-O-KAY!","December 28, 2014","true","54.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It still has that compatibility bug that requires downloading a patch launcher and config.exe that is available in the forums but the game itself is enjoyable. The special edition adds only minor things  compared to the original (mostly graphical and AI improvements but also some style upgrades and a new higher difficulty) which is disappointing as it still means the main quest and all side quests can be finished in under 20 hours.\n\nCombat is fun and smooth though the transformation styles are still incredibly OP when maxed out and the martial styles can feel weak late game unless you use chi attacks. There are occassional graphical errors and they can require reloading the game, going into another area, or going into combat to fix. The amount of lore explored in the game is impressive and some of it will play a major role in the main story.\n\nGoing down the Closed Fist path can lead the player on a much darker course than the Dark Side from their previous game KoToR but the game does suffer from the fact that a major choice made at the end will decide whether you get the Open Palm or Closed Fist ending (props to Bioware for a 3rd choice to let the antagonist win) no matter your 'alignment' before this choice, though there are multiple endings for the party NPCs. There is good characterization and interaction with and between the party's NPCs and a late game choice can add a serious twist to your relationship with them. I'd say Bioware built upon this in their development of their next game Mass Effect.\n\nOverall an excellent game, if a bit short, and a recommended one if you don't have it or have never played it before. Why a sequel has never been produced is baffling though likely due to Bioware focusing so heavily on the Mass Effect and Dragon Age series, and on Star Wars: The Old Republic.","October 4, 2014","true","29.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/notsue/recommended/7110/","notsue","I'm Not Sue","http://steamcommunity.com/id/notsue/","465 products in account","This game is one of Bioware's earlier RPGs before Mass Effect and Dragon Age modern fame.  Like a lot of developers, all their works share similar themes.  Good characterization, good humor, binary good / evil (although in this case its styled differently), good voice acting, etc.  The setting and music are characterization are all good and very well enjoyable, and quite amusing at times.  Bioware is very good at that, and I applaud them.\n\nThe problem with the game is that the actual -game- portion is just not very fun.  The combat is downright awful because there is no balance or flow.  Most enemies could be button-mashed to death, and those that can't usually have some sort of rediculous advantage over the player such as no hitstun, extremely high damage, or extremely high health.  There are two types of MP, one for magic + healing and the other for weapons + bullet time... but considering that there is no other way to restore your health aside from generous cutscenes I can't see magic being useful.  Leveling up a weapon style makes it use almost no MP but bullet time drains MP like pouring water out of a cup.  Animations are VERY clunky and often uncancelable, and each style only has one combo and one guardbreak attack.  Controlling your character in fights is a pain because being locked on to an enemy makes you extremely slow, and free camera makes it impossible to hit enemies reliably.\n\nLevelling up gives points to spend in combat styles and other points to spend on stats, but there's no way to really know if you're going to get a good style later down the line and spent points are permanent.  Its a pitfall of RPGs, not knowing how well-spent your resources are because of a lack of transparency in the system.  Luckily stats are more easily corrected as you can swap equipment to boost the little used conversation stats and your primary stats, but nothing boosts your damage or defense directly.\n\nThere are scant few puzzles in the game that really only pad or are otherwise obnoxious (get out a pen and paper because you'll need to memorize), and a seemingly pointless Galaga minigame that occurs often and produces no non-Galage related rewards.\n\nThe game runs fine on Win7 / HD6850 / 3.2GHz * 6 / 8gb RAM system.  Its was made for the original XBOX and it shows, but the game controls perfectly fine on PC as a port even in the few fixed camera scenes.\n\nI'd say pass on the game unless you like Bioware titles or the asian setting.  The combat in the game holds the whole package back far too much to be a robust title.  It's not worth suffering through for the story, which is only okay, even if well presented.","July 6, 2013","false","15.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Like a lot of developers, all their works share similar themes.  Good characterization, good humor, binary good / evil (although in this case its styled differently), good voice acting, etc.  The setting and music are characterization are all good and very well enjoyable, and quite amusing at times.  Bioware is very good at that, and I applaud them.\n\nThe problem with the game is that the actual -game- portion is just not very fun.  The combat is downright awful because there is no balance or flow.  Most enemies could be button-mashed to death, and those that can't usually have some sort of rediculous advantage over the player such as no hitstun, extremely high damage, or extremely high health.  There are two types of MP, one for magic + healing and the other for weapons + bullet time... but considering that there is no other way to restore your health aside from generous cutscenes I can't see magic being useful.  Leveling up a weapon style makes it use almost no MP but bullet time drains MP like pouring water out of a cup.  Animations are VERY clunky and often uncancelable, and each style only has one combo and one guardbreak attack.  Controlling your character in fights is a pain because being locked on to an enemy makes you extremely slow, and free camera makes it impossible to hit enemies reliably.\n\nLevelling up gives points to spend in combat styles and other points to spend on stats, but there's no way to really know if you're going to get a good style later down the line and spent points are permanent.  Its a pitfall of RPGs, not knowing how well-spent your resources are because of a lack of transparency in the system.  Luckily stats are more easily corrected as you can swap equipment to boost the little used conversation stats and your primary stats, but nothing boosts your damage or defense directly.\n\nThere are scant few puzzles in the game that really only pad or are otherwise obnoxious (get out a pen and paper because you'll need to memorize), and a seemingly pointless Galaga minigame that occurs often and produces no non-Galage related rewards.\n\nThe game runs fine on Win7 / HD6850 / 3.2GHz * 6 / 8gb RAM system.  Its was made for the original XBOX and it shows, but the game controls perfectly fine on PC as a port even in the few fixed camera scenes.\n\nI'd say pass on the game unless you like Bioware titles or the asian setting.  The combat in the game holds the whole package back far too much to be a robust title.  It's not worth suffering through for the story, which is only okay, even if well presented.","July 6, 2013","false","15.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It still looks great on my computer as it did when I first played it on my original Xbox.\n\nI personaly feel, combat itself is what hurts it however. Each of the fighting styles has one heavy attack and one light attack with the same blocking animation, with no real combos. This can make the combat feel boring at times if you are only using one or two fighting styles. You will be wanting to increase the number of fighting styles and hotkeying them so it does not feel as repetitive.\n\nI do prefer this version on my PC since the load times are not as bad as the version on my Xbox.
