Don't know how I survived, but I think I caught a glimpse of some strange tribal man before I lost consciousness. After I awoke I set to the business of building a shelter. Who knows how long it'll be till I'm rescued.\n\nDay 2: The tribals seem unfriendly. They showed up at the edge of my camp and eyed me while growling. They have clubs made out of human skulls and seem to be wearing teeth around their necks. I'm going to set up traps tonight.\n\nDay 3: Some random skinny tribal tried to eat me! He came into my camp giggling and laughing, I had to kill him with my axe! Its the first time I've killed anyone. I dumped his body outside of camp. I don't like to look at it.\n\nDay 4: The more healthy tribals tried to siege my camp today. Attacked me uprovoked but a few of my traps caught them. I killed the last man with a more modern axe I scavenged from a camp. They'll not catch me unprepared again. I'm not dying on this bloody island.\n\nDay 5: After seeing that they have some kind of displays made out of human remains, I decided to do the same. It was disguisting and unthinkable but maybe now they'll realize this place is dangerous and give me some peace. Got a little hunting done too.\n\nDay 6: I've been forced to build a wall around the perimeter. The healthier, smarter tribals seem to be warded off by my effigy but the starving ones are desperate enough to risk attacking. I'm going to fortify this place. I'm not becoming somone's lunch.\n\nDay 7: While checking my traps outside camp I was attacked by some kind of weird tribal leader with armor made out of human arms. He and his war party were no match for my defenses. I stuck their heads outside camp. Maybe now they'll learn what will happen should they come here again.\n\nDay 10: I've been a little too busy to write in my journal recently. I decided to take the fight to them and burned one of their camps with molotovs. A week ago, their screams would have bothered me. Now I was just relieved. Maybe now I'll be able to sleep at night.\n\nDay 11: A huge monster with a ton of legs busted in through my outer wall. Fortunately I'd stashed away some explosives, so that made quick work of it. On closer examination this thing seems to be made out of...people. Sewn or mutated together somehow. What is happening in this place!?\n\nDay 15: I cut off the heads of every tribal leader and put them on sticks. The sticks litter the outside of my camps. They'll regret the day they attacked my camps. I'll kill every last one of them if I have to. Even those mutant monsters will die.\n\nDay 20: I decided to start adding legs to the effigies. It seems to complete them a little more. Even the starving tribals are wary of attacking me now. They know that death has come among them.\n\nDay 30: I'd been so busy fighting off these tribals I didn't get a chance to hunt for days at a time. Haven't had time to write in my journal either. I'd walked into one of their camps I'd ransacked and saw an arm stick cooking on a spit. I was so hungry I took a bite. It wasn't too bad actually. I'm trying not to think about it.\n\nDay 45: I added arms and legs pointing in different directions to each of my effigies to spell out "YMCA". Nothing really else to do to pass my time here. When I was putting them up, I ate one of the legs. I was very hungry and none of my traps have been yielding any fruit, but these perfectly good limbs have been sitting here all this time...\n\nDay 62: I'm starting to like it here...All the limbs I can eat. Good sunshine by the beach. This island isn't so bad.\n\n10/10 would decend into madness again.","October 14, 2015","true","83.5"," 602 of 627 people (96%) found this review helpful 491 people found this review funny","96","602","627","491","8"

Cooked a rabbit, but it started raining so I couldn't keep the fire up, so I found some berries and luckely, they were not poisenous.\n\nWent to sleep woke up early morning and there was 3 naked guys stalking me outside, they attacked me and I ended up slaying all of them. I built one statue with their heads and legs.\n\nLater in the morning, 3 other naked guys came near my shelter, I burned the statue and they ran away. They came back 5 minutes later with 3 more. I couldn't handle their attacks, so they kidnapped me. I woke up in a dark cave with only a lighter to show me the way. I heared a distant shouting that scared the living crap out of me and I saw about 30 passengers hanged upside down above me.\n\nI tried to find my way out of the cave, I almost couldn't see anything and I could hear them, I know they were watching me. Then after a lot of stress and sweating, I found the exit. I was so glad to finally see the sun, then some extremelly weird texture rendering just started spawning trees, flowers and life in front of me.\n\nThen went on a run trying to find my shelter but I was very low health. Got cold. I got jumped on by a naked girl who were on top of a tree. She took me by surprise, I shouted in real life, I saw my cat running out of the room scared of me.\n\nFinally, I take a close look at the naked girl just before she gives me the final blow, the last comment I have before to die: '' Hey!!! I can see her tities''.\n\nI survived 2 days.\n\nThis game has a lot of bugs, they still have a ton of work to do on this game. But if you are not the kind of person that expect a finished game when you play an early release, you know this game is going to be great. Keep supporting it, make your friends play it and this could be without a doubt the best survival game ever.","May 30, 2014","true","6.6"," 4,521 of 5,035 people (90%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","90","521","5","11","92"

Like a grownup Minecraft, but with nice graphics. Boy was I wrong.\n\nI'll never forget my first encounter with the cannibal tribe. I was out checking the wonderful graphics, looking for loot, setting up shelter, minding my own business when I heard that scream/laugh... I'll never forget it. I turned and saw him staring at me and for the first time in my life, I was having a miniature heart attack from a video game. I ran to my cabin but was shaking so badly that I couldn't use my mouse to direct my guy to safety. I played for a few more hours then went to bed.\n\nThat night I had nightmares about the cannibals.

Nothing more romantic than strolling down a sunset beach being chased by a bunch of naked cannibals. Makes you feel like a celebrity.\n\nDepending on your nature I would suggest, if you are patient: You don't mind set backs,and have a good sense of humour. Get it now. It's pretty awesome even with all the flaws. Regular updates mean you're generally not stuck too long with one issue.. of course with each update you'll generally stumble upon something else to perplex you.. think of it as hurdles.. But everything looks pretty so that's okay.\n\nIf you don't enjoy being murdered by flying tables, eaten by land sharks, dislike leviatating geese, backwards rabbits and other such oddities then I suggest you wait it out till the game is more developed.\n\n\nThe Forest:\n\nDay 1: I awaken from my inflight nap to find this creepy looking kid clinging to my arm.. I knew I should of paid extra for busniess class. I look around the otherwise empty plane. Where the ♥♥♥♥ is my inflight meal and booze? there's a little turbulance and next thing we are minus half a plane and going down. Lol that kid isn't wearing his safety belt. He's screwed. We crash and I black out.\n\nI awaken once again, to a near naked oiled up man-thing scooping up the unconsious child, this upsets me somewhat because now I have no one to offer as a peace sacrifice to the natives. After he runs off into the bushes with the kid I yell "SHOULD OF WORN YOUR SAFETY BELT YOU LITTLE ♥♥♥♥" I help myself to numerous trays of inflight meals and booze glorious booze that due to some miracle survived the plane crash and are still sitting neatly on seats and shelves. I pick up random pill bottles and devour the contents and collect a pedometer from a foot, how ironic. Lucky for me, I am a paranoid survival enthusiast and was wearing my outdoor back pack complete with survival guide in preparation for this very event.\n\nExiting the half a plane, grabbing a conviently placed fire axe fitted snuggly in that slack flight attendants chest, I raid a few luggage cases of the non existant passengers, mmm sexy panties. Wandering the beach at sunset, alchohol lines the beaches, natures natural drink cooler and notice a group of nudists. ♥♥♥♥ yes. This island is awesome. I run up to them waving my drink in greeting. The god of ♥♥♥♥ and wine has blessed this place!! They stare at me like I am some kind of freak, probably because I'm wearing clothes and this has obviously offended thier religon because the nearest native attempts to claw my eyejellies out, shocked I hi 5 him in the face with my axe and the natives flee, shiny butts bouncing in the sunlight.\n\nI keep moving, being the survivalist I am I slaughter a few fluffy bunnies and a lizard, skin them and find a nice spot to set up for the night. I start a fire with my trusty everlasting lighter. Thank goodness they kindly let me bring my lighter aboard the plane! I build a small shelter out of sticks and cook myself a lizard, you can just taste the intestinal parasites!\n\nDay 2-4:\n\nNot only am I a paranoid survival enthusiast. But I'm also an architect and master of construction! I have found a nice spot to start my new life here on this island, no point trying the planes radio, salvaging and rebuilding the yatch or boats I spotted on the beach or any of that ♥♥♥♥.\nI have lashed together some sticks to form a sturdy log sled! I have about 6 logs stacked ontop of the tiny twigs and another 2 logs carried by myself, with one arm. I push the sled along with the mere power of my pinky toe thankful for my Russian hertiage. I build myself a snazzy tree house because daddy issues meant I never had one as a child. I stash my porn in it along with the panties I salvaged from the wreck. I've got 4 walls, a drying rack, a fire, storage facilaties for my supplies, a freaking gazebo and a bunch of death traps surrounding my walls for those pesky natives, who despite the abundance of wildlife and edible plants, have opted for human flesh instead... Gotta hand it to them though, they have some really inspiring art peices, the man shoved through his own tennis rackets and every orifice crammed with tennis balls is my favourite, brings me to tears every time I see it. If I was going to make any effort whatsoever to return to human civilization, I'd totally steal some of thier work and sell it for millions. I've been working on my own style using the cannibals body parts, my centrepeice being 'head on a stick' I just can't seem to capture the same passions though.\n\nDay 5:\n\nWalls seem to be a weakness to the cannibals, they are in awe of them as they repeatedly ram thier faces into it, and growl at it. Small minded barbarians hahah.\n\nIt's not so funny when they walk through my wall... the sole source of my security.. but it's funny again when they walk into my campfire and burn to death. My emotional roller coaster of fun and fear may have something to do with my wandering through the forest earlier eating shrooms.\non my return to camp I accidentally walked into a fire, and caught fire to myself. In the rain. Adeles song has so much more meaning to me now.\n\n*TO BE CONTINUED*","October 10, 2014","true","84.6"," 440 of 462 people (95%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","95","440","462","4","29"

Thank you everyone for supporting good reviews and motivating the few that do so to continue making quality reviews!\n\n***THIS IS A PRE-ALPHA. This review and the final game are subject to change**\n\nMain Menu & Options\nhttp://imgur.com/a/Dqypy\n\nThe Forest is a unique survival game that pits the player against a bunch of mutants in a forest. Chopping down trees, foraging food and staying warm are just some of the survival aspects that can be found within this game.\n\n[4.5/5] Gameplay - For an early access game, you're spoiled for choice when it comes to building. It's interesting to note that every plane crash/new game puts you in a different location, at a different time of hour. I found pleasure in cutting down the trees in the game, as well as carving off the flesh of animals and wearing it as armour. The backpack system is pretty neat, especially how it's laid out. What's interesting is how you can get infected from having blood on your body, and needing to wash it off. I thought that was a pretty neat feature. Stealth actually works if you aren't already seen, and I've snuck up on my fair share of mutants and initiating....\n\n[3.5/5] Combat - NO, there are no conventional guns (only a flare gun) and never will be (although bows are something that might be implemented I hope). I can see how that would ruin gameplay. Now that's out of the way, I feel as though this could be improved or at least more forgiving. It takes a considerable amount of hits to kill each one, so it's best to tackle one at a time or run if there's a group. The mutants are pretty aggressive when in close proximity, and god forbit you attack one and more will come. Whether or not this is a feature or a bug is beyond me, but in it's current state I can say it's not as fleshed out as I would have thought. In addition, blocking is not implemented, or if it is I don't know what the controls are because...\n\n[3.5/5] Controls - Are not shown anywhere! Yeah this game doesn't hold your hand (which is great, but at the very least provide a control scheme or something!) I checked the options menu as well as the in-game survival guide for instructions but to no avail. Hopefully they do patch this into the game, and I will update the review accordingly. From what I've deduced from button mashing and relying on other games for a template, the controls are pretty accessible. In the future I wouldn't mind rebinding them however. On the forums, I hear of mouse input going awry or latency issues, but I haven't experienced any as of yet so I cannot comment on that. What I can comment on though is the...\n\n[4.5/5] AI - Which I might say is very polished. I didn't expect much from the alpha, but everything the developers said about them was true. Sadly I haven't seen any mutants other than the naked female/male and tribes ones, no "ugly mofos" as of yet (probably due to a distinct fear of delving into these caverns). They travel in pairs, attack/go toward manmade structures, climb trees (which freaked the ♥♥♥♥ out of me at first, pardon my French). If you get close, they will aggro and may call for reinforcements. They WILL watch you from afar, they WILL hide in tall grass. And god forbid, you will most certainly die if you don't hide from them. Vulnerability is key, which leads to...\n\n[4/5] Immersion - This is a survival horror game. You can survive, and it has spooky elements that makes it a horror game. One minute you're building a base and nightfall comes, the next you hear sounds of leaves crunching around you. Night time really does shine in the sense that you truly feel more alone. What does fail to bring me to more of a heightened experience is the lack of ability to toggle/remove the HUD. I wanted to be able to feel like it was first person, not like Dead Island. Another issue at the moment is clipping through some objects in the world, but that's more focused on the...\n\n[4.5/5] Map - It's big, even for the "little area" they confine you to in the Alpha. Jesus, I feel like I've only seen 1/3-1/4 of it, because I hear people talking about there being an ocean they're living on but I've hauled my ♥♥♥ through the woods only to find berries and potential death from mutants. Map design wise, it really feels like a forest. Extensively, the cave systems are really fleshed out, and light sources work beautifully within. There are bugs in the ground and rocks where you can fall/clip through, but it's not game-breaking unless you are intentionally clipping through them. Especially if you spend your time noticing the...\n\n[5/5] Graphics - For a four-person team (2-3 programmers, 1-2 artists), the attention to detail really shines. Day/night, lighting, shadows, even the flora/fauna are amazing. It really goes to show how much effort they've put into it, and how much it will in the long run. Not only this but damn, the...\n\n[4.5/5] Audio - Perfectly orchestrated in most areas. I say most because there are some issues such as the intro scene not synchronising with the cinematic. You really have to play for a few hours to not develop anxiety issues, trying to differentiate between mutants footsteps and animals scurrying on the floor. I have to give my applause to Endnight Games for making me yell "whatthe♥♥♥♥" at my screen every once in a while. What I DON'T like are the chimes when a tree breaks into chunks of logs, that doesn't feel right. I also believe a bit more ambience might be necessary, whether it's wind or chirping or something else.\n\n[NA/5] Developers - I don't want to rate this category as it's not relative to the gameplay or other attributes. EndNight Games have been developing this game for years now, and this release was worth the wait. Deducing from Q&A, feedback and input from developers, you can tell this studio really cares both about the consumer base and the game. I feel as though they are handling complaints and bugs very well, and have already stated bug fixing has commenced, with a patch out very soon! I always purchase early access games for reasons both in receiving continuous content updates to games for fresher experiences, and for determining whether the game will succeed or otherwise. This is one of the fewer rather than latter from what I've gathered.\n\nFinal verdict: If you were expecting a polished game with little to no bugs and fleshed out AI, you thought wrong. And if you purchased it and complain (read:whine in an entitled sense) about this, you have the right to be ridiculed. The game promises on what it currently delivers, and although the game is riddled with bugs, you get what you pay for, and then some over the course of the game. If you understand what "early access" is, and have faith in the developers, I can safely say that $15 now will be a worthy investment (for both parties involved).\n\nHowever, if you don't want to deal with bugs, provide feedback and travel this journey from early access to full release, I would not recommend the game in its current state. Although the game is very much playable, do not feel obliged to give up 15 dollars, because for some people that's a lot, and you want to get value for money from it, which is understandable.\n\nI give the game 4.25/5, based on what I think of all the categories combined. I will leave the review in a recommended state because most people are deterred from reading/looking into a game if it has even 1-2 not recommended reviews. This game at least deserves some recognition, don't you?","May 30, 2014","true","40.2"," 4,038 of 4,606 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","038","4","0","186"

Walrus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BrigadierGeneralWalrus/","126 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nHow many people have you seen in the review section with 100 hours? That's right. But I'm not just going to be one of those people who just says, "Yeah, its ok i guess," hinting at their 10000 hours. Before I go into the review, I would like to give some context. So, I bought this game around v0.03, and I spent a lot of time just base building, not really caving 'cause I be a wus. Finally, a while later, I saw the game was at v0.29. That was when I added 80 hours to my game time.I know the location of every useful item, I have gotten down into the sinkhole, found and alternate route to the katana, ect. I have enjoyed every last bit. I'm a bit bored, and waiting till v0.31 to see what it brings, but for know, I will just review.\n\nPros\n-Can run on a potato, but expect some VERY scaled down resouldtion. I mean like 520x420. But that is an extreme.\n-Can be very smexy, at 1080p with ultra settings, it is truely gorgeous, but you need a supercomputer.\n-The building system is very flexable. There is very little snapping, and that is somehing I like.\n-I know it was added forever ago, but multiplayer was probaly the most beneficial thing to this game. Ever.\n-It's fifteen f*cking dollars! FOR ALL OF THIS!?\n-Still in alpha stages, so more could be added. (Though I have played more hours of this than there are hours of Dishonored's campaign, so its already worth my money.)\n-Great community, unless you join a game with a five-year-old who says, "Your in big trouble," and kicks you from game. That legitimately happened before I wrote this review. Srsly. Give me a reason.\n-Multitude of collectable items.\n-Interesting lore, or so I think. There is no wiki page, so you have to explore and find all the burial sites and photos to figure it out yourself. I could be way wrong. Look at the end of this review for my personal opnion on the story.\n-Devs are fantabulous. Thats not a word.\n\nCons\n-It is in alpha, so there is more to be desired.\n-When running The Forest on PotatOS 6.7 [Like that pun :3= ?] and you have it in low res mode, it is so pixelated, my friend thought that a tennis ball was a lemon, and proudly proclaimed, "This is my lemon!"\n-Feels a but empty once you have gotten to the sinkhole. So don't rush to get in there.\n-The inventory system is set up so you can carry a certain amount of a certain item. It is always the same. The katana goes to the upper-left, the rebreather next to it, you can only carry 5 dynamite, ect. The downside in this I find is the lack of inventory management. It might just be me, but I relish in the orginazational pleasure of shifting item around in my inventory to make room for new ones. Maybe it is just me and I'm a weirdo, but it's a con for me so it's on the list.\n-Want an axe for a weapon! No... well, tough luck. Katana is a bit later game so...\n-I like a heavy focus on the range of items and fauna to be found in a game. The game is doing better, but my soul is a void, so keep adding to fill it devs :3=\n\nLore- The sinkhole is called a cetone` in the patch notes, which is a Mayan word for abyss. These cetone`s formed in the yucatun peninsula in Mexico. This said, the area is not an island, but is blocked of by a mountainous region, indicating it is the southern yucatan peninsula. The compass points north to the mountains, so it must take place in the southern region of Guatamala. The Cetone`s were worshiped by the Mayans. This must mean that the massive Cetone` in the middle of the map was a hub of mayan civilization, as the cetone` there is many times bigger than any one in our knowledge, as they are generally only 30 feet deep. Perhaps a strange a race had hid in these caves and slowly mutated over time to adapt to cannibalistic dietary habits. As the Mayans discovered the place, they also discovered its unruly inhabitants. Perhaps that was why the Mayans disappeared. As memory faded of the hellish place, the sinkhole was rediscovered and put on the front pages of caving magazines worldwide. As you explore, you can see evidence of early 20th century spelunking equipment. After the explorers never returned, the incident was forgotten, and became a sort of\nbermuda triangle. In 1982, a family went on a boat trip to explore the region. They lost thier son and looked for him. It is assumed he was eaten. The grave near the yacht may show that one of the parents died by starvation. The final parent is gone without trace. The several campgrounds indicate people who explored the region, not believing the rumors of cannibals. A film crew's camp can also be found by Goose Lake. James Blanc (you) and Timmy Blanc (your relative) crash in the forest. The Virginias, or six-legged female mutants, are the only cannibals with genitalia, indicated that the malformed cannibal babies surrounding them are its offspring.\n\nLike this review so others can see and revise my theories.

Great Dev support as well.\n\n======\n\nI woke in a broken plane, only to scavange what was left because I was hungry and hurt. Popped a few pills and jumped out of the plane's hull before seeing scattered suitcases everywhere. Each one of them seemed locked, but my trusty axe I found made quick work of them. Found tennis balls in a few, didn't know Roger Federer was onboard. Must of been in first class.\n\nBeing the Natural hunter I was, I beat Lizards and a few bunnies to death with a makeshift club I wrapped in cloth. Skinned them and saved their meat for later. Slapping the freshly carved Lizard's skin on like armor as a sick man I am, I continued to kill its bretheren until I was covered with their protective armor. I dipped myself in a fresh found pool of water near a large tree I couldn't cut. Oddly, I found a makeshift spear inside. Mine. Totally took that ♥♥♥♥. And then I was met with a shriek off in the distance. Wolfs? Cyotes? Roise O'Donald? Either way, I was scared ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ as night started to fall.\n\nFast forward a day, after finding a large cliff side with one walkway from behind me for anything to sneak up, so I decide to build a defensive wall to close it off. I take to the nearby forest with a newly made log sled to transport trees back to my new base. A fire pit and Hunters shelter is made. I stow away rocks and sticks I have in excess there incase I need to build anything else. I light up the fire pit and cook a bunny on it, eating it before I huddled up in my shelter for the night.\n\nI woke in the night, only to be met with two sets of beady eyes glistening across my fire pit in the darkness. I pull my axe out in hand, hearing them hiss. Humans? They looked the part, but said nothing to me. One cries out as it dashes for me, I raise the axe and block his advance. I chop the axe into this crazed man, beating him back a few times until he fell to the ground. His friend hissed at me and ran on all fours away into the woods. What the ♥♥♥♥ did I just kill, Smeagol?\n\nFast forward about three more days, I have my rear and front defensive walls built out from the steep cliff side to the oceans waters, only one way in. Its safter to light fires at night now and sleep, since the locals seem afraid of this place. I set out on foot, spear in hand and covered in mud and deer hides to keep me warm. I had to find their village. After evading a few patrols of the locals, I stumbled into three huts and what looks like to be a large den. Looking into said den after ghosting around the town to make sure no one is there, I enter to only find a noose to greet me. And another man hanging. I cut the rope to use to my gains. I quickly pull a stick together with cloth and rope to make me a shortbow. And all those ♥♥♥♥ing feathers, now into arrows. Seriously, I had about two hundred of them. Making a few I test fire the bow. We're good to go. The srieks come back in the distance, I bolt back home.\n\nDay... I don't even know. Sun has come and gone so many times now. Traps lingering in the forest just ouside. Effigies planted about fifty yards out from the front of my gates, only to be mimicked the same way by the locals across the way. They want to show their territory. I disobey. Covered in my lizard armor and deer pelts, I stalk upon a patrol not far from my home. I wait until two break off from the group, while I keep my watchful eye on them from the hilltop bushes. Bow in my hand. The two stop near a pool. I pull tension on my bows string, lining up a shot. Release. Arrow pegs the local in the head and drops. His friend panics, only to be met with me, silently springing from the bushes with spear. His limp body drops into the pool of water. I make effigies of their corpses.\n\nWar rages on and I begin hunting at night. Traps litter segments around the forest closest to my home. I draw them out of hiding with a simple fire. I wait. I watch. They come. Throwing a rock their way grabs their attention, turning towards me. I shoot a arrow at the leader of this five man pack. All hell breaks loose. I slink my way down hill side in the darkness, as they follow close behind. I slip past two traps. One of the locals gets hung up in my noose trap, as two more grouped together and get impaled on my spike trap. Leader and croney is left. I peg the leader two more times with arrows until he drops. Small one begins to run. I draw my bow, having a clear shot. I don't take the shot. I let him run. Let him tell the others that I will not be hunted so easily.\n\nIn this forest, you either die as the hunted, or you live long enough to see yourself become the hunter.\n\n10/10 - Would Crash Again.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n(( Serious number: 9/10 )) Game is in /alpha/ and already this intense. I was thinking 8.5/10, but for the $15 I spent on it? And its only getting better every day with constant updates and helpful feedback from the devs? No. It deserves the 9. And it can only really go up from there. Cannot wait to see final product and additions made.","December 21, 2014","true","54.8"," 370 of 386 people (96%) found this review helpful 137 people found this review funny","96","370","386","137","13"

Now, I don't usually like horror games/films/anything scary because I get minor heart attacks if someone as much as speaks or claps suddenly. That being said, my husband bought this game and I watched him play it. I was scared to death, but the more I watched the more I just couldn't keep my fingers off of it!\n\nBut to the point. Here are some pros and cons, but keep in mind that it is an alpha game.\n\nPros:\n- Stunning graphics and environment. I was absolutely blown away, and I still am.\n- Very real environment with wildlife offering food and crafting materials, nice weather and sound effects and more.\n- The cannibals are an amazing and unique enemy. A breath of fresh air from zombies (which I am not very fond of). They are clever and tactical as well as primitive, and I am completely terrified of them! They have very smooth, elegant and agile movements, and they can be very sneaky. Watch your back while chopping wood for your constructions!\n- While the environment is beautiful, you constantly feel tense and threatened by your sorroundings, whether it's movement in the distance, a shadow, a rustling of leaves or other sounds.\n- The crafting system is lovely. You can spend a lot of time creating a nice base, and the crafting possibilities are ever improving with new content being added. Custom building can be slightly buggy, but I'm sure they will fix it and add to it.\n- The game has a creative mode. I've seen a few people requesting this, probably not knowing that it already exists. At the start screen, simply type "veganmode" and you will not see any cannibals at all. This allows you to just enjoy yourself in peace if you feel like surviving and building. You may also type "vegetarianmode", if you wish for the cannibals to only be out at night, giving you a breathing space during the day. This is very lovely.\n- The co-op version is a bunch of fun. It's a great experience to share with your friends - although you must beware that the co-op version is currently very buggy and laggy.\n- Last but not least it really feels like the developers want to make this a top notch game for the final release. They regularly fix bugs while also adding new content like crafting and new places to explore.\n\nCons:\n- I mentioned the co-op in pros, but as I also briefly said, it is very very buggy and laggy. Hopefully they will fix it, which I feel confident that they will. Also, you should note that there are currently saving problems with co-op. The host can save the game while in multiplayer, but your co-player won't be able to join the game again after quitting. The host can continue the game in solo mode, but not with friends. This is a shame. I very much hope they will fix this soon. [EDIT: I just managed to re-join a game that my husband had hosted earlier, so maybe it is possible. However, I started back in the airplane each time I rejoined. Either way, I'm sure all of this will be smoothed out eventually.]\n- Buggy, glitchy, blah blah. It's alpha, it's to be expected. I don't think there are any game breaking bugs or glitches, though. If something is bugged, I haven't experienced not being able to fix it with a quick reload of the game.\n- Currently you might be running out of content a little quickly. I believe they are working on making more content for the game. The boy from the plane who I believe must be the survivor's son is not currently to be found anywhere as far as I can tell from what I've seen and read. I would think they are working on making it a goal to find and rescue him from the cannibals, which would give the game some more sense of purpose. For now, it's just, scavenge, build, eat, drink, fight - survive. But I enjoy that :)\n- The map is the same everytime you start a new game (although you crash in different places, and I think some cannibal buildings also are in different places). I don't necessarily dislike this, even though a new world every time would make exploring all the more exciting. However, I do hope that they make the map quite a bit bigger. If they don't you end up knowing the entire island in and out quite quickly, and then there won't be much exploring left to do. Making the island itself bigger would work, but making more islands to explore using your raft or whatever would be even more awesome. I have high hopes, but we'll see what the devs have in store for us. :)\n- While the developers seem to be doing a magnificent job with regular updates, the game still seems to be far off beta. I am not sure how long we will have to wait. However long it is, though, I am completely sure that the end result will be breathtaking in every aspect. Keep up the good work, devs, you are doing so well!\n\nI don't know if I covered everything, but this is all I can think of for now. I may update my review as more additions are made to the game. Overall, The Forest is a keeper. 10/10 shining stars from me despite the bugs and what not. I would highly recommend anyone who like survival/sandbox/horror games to buy this game - also during early access. The devs are clearly putting the money to good use, so I feel good about having offered them some support at this early stage. In fact, I was very surprised at how cheap it is. It almost feels like I robbed them!\n\nOnce again. 10/10, Buy it. Now.","June 9, 2015","true","25.1"," 281 of 291 people (97%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","97","281","291","19","13"

There were only three survivors: Myself, Anthony, and Josh. We gathered what supplies we could from the wreckage; food, cans, circuit boards, and a nifty axe. After grabbing everything we could carry, we made for the coast. I don't know what direction we went. Eventually we found ourselves on the beach. It started raining and we were all freezing. It was miserable. Night came, we huddled close together against a rocky outcropping, munching on snacks and downing sodas. We weren't the smarted when it came to nutrition.\n\nDay Two:\nThe sun came up and warmed our bodies, it was the best feeling in the world! We discovered that we were actually quite good at chopping down trees with our tiny little axes. And the trees conveniently turned themselves into logs once chopped down. We had to chase them, as they tried to roll away very quickly. Even so, we discovered that we could carry TWO giant logs at a time! We put the Mountain from Game of Thrones to shame! And we also discovered that the plane crash gave us wonderful construction skills. We had a large cabin built fit for a ski resort in no time at all. And the most wonderful gift of all: FIRE!\n\nDay Three:\nFound berry bushes, good thing too, our food supplies are dwindling. NOTE: DISCOVERED THAT SAID BERRIES MADE US VOMIT UNCONTROLLABLY AND DID NOT MAKE US FEEL ANY BETTER. We set about looking for more food and fresh water sources. Anthony found a lizard and roasted that sucker over a fire. Tasted terrible but filled us up wonderfully. Josh spent an hour chasing a rabbit, ended up getting lost and we had to go searching. We found him hiding in a hole and screaming that we weren't alone on this island. Anthony and I just figured he was losing his damn mind. We eventually calmed him down and got him back to camp and had some more lizard meat. Still no fresh water though, still living off of sodas. We ended up building a large bonfire with logs and sticks but ultimately failed at lighting it. Oh well...\n\nDay Four:\nEarly morning I awoke to find that Anthony was gone. Josh and I gathered a few things and went out searching. It felt like hours before his screams echoed through the forest. We rushed to the source but were intercepted by Anthony breaking through the brush like a mad man, urging us to turn around. We did, he wasn't normally one to overreact. Josh's sarcasm ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off. "Now do you believe me?" He had asked in a smug tone. I was still skeptical. Anthony was shook up bad, claiming he was abducted and taken to a cave full of half eaten humans and full of weird mutated cannibals. Whatever, these two are going nuts. I need to start planning on ways to get rid of them...\n\nDay Five:\nI was wrong! I WAS SO WRONG!!! These ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s came from the trees by the dozens! I had a bow with some arrouws but the damn thing was difficult to aim! I used up what I had and switched to my axe. That worked much better. These things are fast though! Josh ended up lobbing Molotovs at them and Anthony smacked them with a skull club he had made. We drove them off but suffered some nasty wounds. They'll be back, and next time we will be ready...\n\nDay Six:\nWe weren't ready, halfway through building a defensive wall around the camp they came again. With many, many more. Anthony was taken down at the start, they mobbed him viciously. Josh ♥♥♥♥ himself and made for the water. I turned in time to see him devoured by a damn shark. What the hell is wrong with this place?! I am hiding inside the cabin we built, I hear the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s outside. Their screams and grunts will not allow me any sleep. I hope this isn't the end...\n\nDay Seven:\nI'm still alive. The cannibals are still out there, I hear them. Hell I can smell them. I dare not stick my head out the window to look. WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥!?

This can be just a survival game as you can turn the cannibals off on the main menu, but to me the cannibals are the meat and potatoes of this game and I find myself sorely missing them should they not come visit me a couple of times a day.\n\nThe AI in this game is honestly the best I’ve encountered. The game now features different types of cannibals with tribes that will fight if you watch silently, but will mostly unite in their hatred of the guy deforesting their land, (you). The cannibals will still throw a couple of punches at each other if there’s enough of them around however. There are starving cannibals who will try to stalk you to find out where you live and try to scavenge off any kills you make, scouts for larger tribes who will often simply run away to alert others of your locations, hunting parties (though I’m pretty sure they’re only hunting you), and cannibals just trying to live out their lives in peace that you can finding sleeping in camps or caves. Cannibals will duck and roll to evade attacks, climb trees to escape, light tennis balls on fire and throw them at you, wreck your base if you’re not careful, but they’ll also do things like drop effigies which you can catch them praying at if left uninterrupted, they’ll drag their wounded out of battle if they can, and will run off to retrieve others if you let them escape.\n\nBeyond the normal humanoid cannibals there are mutants who can always be found in caves, but will surface more frequently the more you ♥♥♥♥ the cannibals off. These (with the exception of the babies) are significantly tougher to kill and do a lot more damage. If they come near your base they mean business and while the spider mutant takes a couple of hits to tear anything down, I’ve seen armsy rip a tree OUT OF THE GROUND and slam it into my base, destroying multiple defensive spikes and walls allowing the small army of ten or so he brought with him entrance into the base. The sumo dude doesn’t even need to do anything super special to wreak havoc, if he runs at your base everything in his path will be destroyed until he stops running.\n\nHow the cannibals interact with you is highly determined by your playstyle, though I don’t think they’d ever be friendly with you. If you escape the plane crash quickly before they find you and are not stalked, you can have the opportunity to build a base without their knowledge if you pick a private enough location not on one of their common routes, and they generally won’t find it unless you are followed home. If in contrast you do everything you can to ♥♥♥♥ them off (mass cannibal killings, mutant killings, effigy destruction and creation, burning their bodies in front of them), they will be significantly more inclined to bother you constantly. In my current single player game I see at least 4-6 spider mutants a day somewhat near my base, 1-2 armsies, and the sumo dudes have only just started coming out so luckily it’s been one at a time. Even though I am absolutely plagued by mutants, I can always ghost them and move to a different part of the map. You’re in control of how much you see them, which really makes the game AI feel more real and dynamic.\nMultiplayer is significantly less “scary” but if you wanted to build massive bases it’s SOOOOOOOO much faster. It’s a lot of fun playing with friends and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mutants off but there is some charm lost from having others about in the forest with you. In single player the fear comes from the cannibals coming out of nowhere and overwhelming you, which really doesn’t happen in multiplayer. Sure when you’re in the caves they’ll still drop from the ceiling but when it’s two against three your odds are a lot better and you know it, diluting the terror.\n\nI know this “review” was all over the place but the game is definitely worth full price.

Plane goes down, nobody has seatbelts on because they live dangerous.  Plane snaps in half, but you're such a badass you are the only survivor and you're doing pretty damn well.  A blue electric guy comes and takes the kid next to you while you stare at him, but you stay silent, because Social Darwinism is life and you are going to amount to more than that child would have.  You wonder around hopeless and ravage through people's luggage because when sh** happens, common sense goes out the window.  You run aimlessly with an axe and kill a few monitor lizards because wherever you are, they are abundant.  Soon after, a little bronze person appears and stares at you, naturally you're instinct in unrealistic situations is to kill him.  He hits ya once or twice and you are knocked out because you just 'cant even'.  You wake up in a cave in which an Octo-lizard is giving birth and the babies kill you.

The game gets rather bland for me in single-player mode, and it's all ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles until you or your friend gets their ♥♥♥ whooped by some naked guy with a club.\n\nI also don't recommend this game for the easily frustrated. When you die, you lose most of your items, and all of that hard work you did gathering and crafting materials are flushed down the drain (like your dreams). And please, don't come in expecting your character to have the strength and endurance of Batman. Because he'll die. Very many times. And his hunger (and hydration) bar depletes faster than that of a Sim.\n\nIt's not your average hack-and-slash-everything-to-survive game, either. The Forest has implemented impressive and dynamic AI. The cannibals (the primary antagonists) have emotions, morals, religions, etc., and they come from different families and tribes. How one tribe of cannibals react to you will vary from another tribe; some will avoid you out of fear, some will come after you out of anger (for killing members). They change their patterns to accommodate you, and they utilize different strategies and members of their tribe to take you down. It all depends on how you choose to interact with the environment and the AI you encounter.\n\nIf you're looking for a decent, somewhat stressful survival game without the massive multiplayer feel of Day-Z and Rust, The Forest is for you. The game manages to keep you on your toes without it ever feeling too safe or too easy.\n\nArrive in the forest. Thrive in the forest.

Finding my son is my number one priority but I am shaken up. Just what was that who took him? I take a few moments to collect myself and gather what I can from the plane. I then walk out of the plane only to find what once belonged to my fellow tennis players. All of their suitcases, all over the ground. I take what I can and leave the crash site. I notice night is approaching. I find a small cliff and set up a small shelter with a campfire. Before I get ready to sleep I hear something out in the Forest. Like . . . moment, lots of it. I keep one eye opened while I sleep tonight.\n\nDay 2: Morning is here and I am hungry. Outside my camp I found bushes with many berries that I can sustain myself with. After finishing these berries I am ready to start looking for my son. I don't know what is waiting for me out there but for his sake I will be brave. I spend the entire day searching. Hours of searching and nothing. I notice night is approaching and run to my camp. I feel as if I am being followed and do not want to be out here at night. Night is here and I just made it back to my camp. But . . . this night is different. There is a full moon out tonight and I see people. They are just standing there . . . watching . . . waiting . . . They do not get close to my camp tonight but I sleep with one eye open again.\n\nDay 3: Mere berries will not sustain me much longer. I am hungry . . . so very hungry . . . However, I cannot let something like hunger bother me. I must find my son. He must be so scared . . . so . . . alone . . . While searching for him I came across a deer in the Forest. Half mad with hunger I pulled out my hatchet, ran up to him and started swinging. I skinned the deer and wear its hide. I return to my camp with its meat and eat like a king tonight. It is good . . . so very good . . . Before I fell asleep I noticed the men in the Forest are here once again. They are getting closer to me each night.  I don't know what they want from me . . . I sleep tonight with both eyes open.\n\nDay 4: My son . . . my son . . . it has been days now and I am starting to lose hope. I don't think he could have survived this long on his own. I have not the energy to look for him either. I am tired . . . I am cold . . . I am alone . . . I sleep tonight with both eyes closed. After only getting 2 hours of sleep I wake up in the middle of the night to find 2 men within arms reach staring at me. I slowly reach for my hatchet . . . I grab it and start swinging. A blow to the head drops one of them while the other runs off. I am covered in blood. I do not sleep any more tonight.\n\nDay 5: My son is dead. I am sure of it. I will kill everything on this island. I spend the day preparing for what is to come. I hunt down lizards and wear their skin as armor. I drag their bodies to my camp, rip the flesh from their bones, and cook them in the fire. Night is approaching. I see about 7 people in the Forest. They are watching me . . . I do not sleep tonight . . . for I . . . am watching them . . .\n\nDay 6: I am ready. I do not need sleep anymore. I spend the day hunting down small groups of these . . . animals . . . I drag their bodies to my base one by one. A stack of bodies lie in front of me. I start hacking away at them. The arms, the legs, the head. Everything can be used. I mount their body parts on sticks to let all know that I am not to be messed with. The smell of blood and human flesh fills the Forest and my camp. Night is approaching. I don't see anyone. I sleep on their torsos tonight.\n\nDay 7: Hungry . . . Need food. I will hunt for food. In the Forest I find small group of men. I run in with hatchet in hand and kill them. All of them. I drag their bodies to base. Stack them up and chop them in to pieces. I cook these pieces and eat them. They are good . .. very very good .. . .\n\nDay 8: i am alone. .. i am enraged . .i  hungryy .... . found sleeping man in tent . dragged him to base.. ate him. he was good\n\nDay 9: son, ware r you . son. .. .must be tasty . . . s-son .. . dont enter  … .. the Forest.............\n\nDay 10: ……\n\n\n7/7 Would go crazy and eat people again","August 5, 2015","true","22.6"," 236 of 255 people (93%) found this review helpful 180 people found this review funny","93","236","255","180","23"

Without realizing it I made a huge mistake, "I'm not going to buy The Forest. ♥♥♥♥ looks lame. I'm going to go play Dayz and Rust" I said reluctantly. Well as the days went on I kept seeing over and over again in steam store calling to me with a vicious whisper. As I continued on with my regular day after day routine of ignoring that The Forest was even there, I stumpled upon something. It was a User review from another steam player who had played for less than an hour. He stated that "Who would play a game where you ♥♥♥♥ your pants every 5 minutes and you can't do anything because of getting attacked by cannibals." All of the sudden Jason DeRulo's Talk Dirty started playing.(Hate that song btw) Even though all signs in the universe point to purchasing it, I say Nay once again, and then as if god reached down and touched my computer moments later The Forest went on sale. So I said "ok if I buy this and it sucks i will never buy another OW Survival Horror game again. Now it has been  approximately 1.5 weeks and I am 80 hours and 10 pairs of soiled underwear in and I don't think I could be happier. This game is so AMAZING that even with all the bugs and glitches it is still an amazing game. Awesome graphic quality, highly immersive gameplay, intense atmosphere all the things I look for in a great game.

(BAD IDEA) the freaking thing jumped at me at full speed (Scared the crap outta me) I chose to defend myself and was knocked out by him. woke up to two men dragging me across forest...then woke up in a dark cave next to a rope where i quickly climbed up and found myself running for my base camp at full speed i noticed there where lots of cannibal's quickly running aside me and in distance i did not stop.. i finally made it to base camp and decided to seek revenge. I heard screams near camp on beach so i healed up and made some fire bombs and got my axe. I found 4 of them on Beach burned 2 of them and beat the crap outta the other 2 with my axe. chopped off all their body parts brought it back to camp and stacked their limbs to sticks show my victory!\n\n\n10/10 cant wait for game to fully be finished.","May 23, 2015","true","75.3"," 179 of 188 people (95%) found this review helpful 56 people found this review funny","95","179","188","56","1"

They are curious, fierce, and unrelenting.  While combat is tough and fun, the occurance of the mutants I feel is too high right now.  I find now you have to hurry even more than in previous versions to establish a fortified base.  Have had to restart several games after being swarmed within the first two days.\n-Multiplayer:  Another pro that is also a con.  Multiplayer has come a significant way since fall of 2014.  Back then multiplayer was practically unplayable.  Now, multiplayer adventures are fun yet there still exist syncronicity issues with host and client.  Still enjoiyable, but has some kinks to iron out.\n-General Early Access bits:  Some annoying glitches and crashes still exist, and The Forest still needs to be fully optimized.\n\nOverall, The Forest is a great game to play alone or with others.  A year ago I would not recommend The Forest, but would adivse prospective buyers to wait.  However, the game has made huge hauls and now I do recommend The Forest.\n\n8.5/10 as of v0.28","November 28, 2015","true","100.3"," 166 of 175 people (95%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","95","166","175","7","0"

Me and my friend started a coop game and frantically scrambled for supplies before night time. We were too late. I ran out of energy so we built a bench for me to rest on, as I sat there regaining my stamina, we realized that we were no longer alone. 2 Tribal parties stumbled upon our camp just as night fell. Considering we were so close to their camp, they came to investigate. Terror and regret filled my bones. As the damp rain soaked our skin, we struggled agaisnt the horde.

Well, after a while at least.  How long has it been dearest Margaret?  Today in the woods I found the bracelet I gave you in Nantucket.  I hope you don't mind I had to eat your arm to get it, but we'll get to that in a moment.\n\nAfter the crash I searched for you everywhere and I did run into...some people.  They proved a bit of a nuisance at first, what with the dragging me through the woods and hanging me upside down in their cave.  How rude, and to think they don't even have a valet.  I'll never get the stains out of my shirt.\n\nThe first few days were indeed a bit daunting, I'll grant you that Ole Margie.  Covered in blood for one thing, and another, I awoke to find I'd spilt scotch all over my brand new knickers!  Ah well, C'est la vie non?  Anywhoo, I got out of that dreadful plane, of course after relieving it of any useful supplies, and right away found the luggage - yours and mine!  Why, I rather didn't expect to find our bags after a safe landing in Monaco, let alone here in this dreary place.\n\nWell, Margo, you know me.  Mummy & Dad didn't pay good money for finishing school for me to be some boorish land-groper, no my dear, right off I set about to a bit of exploriing.  I'd found this trusty axe you see, ah, liberated from the chest of that lovely air waitress, what was her name again?  Oh bother, I can't recall - still the same problems with the old bean eh?\n\nSo I found this lovely handbook, and in it's pages I found the key to suriving here on this most unusual island.  As I said, the first few nights were indeed a bit terrifying, natives howling in the night, pangs of thirst and hunger gnawing at my stomach, why, one of these primatives actually screamed at me - and naked as the day they were born I tell you!  I gave them the old once over with the trusty axe and they settled right down I tell you that.\n\nA few days later and I'd managed to build myself a small walled enclave, I fitted it proper with some traps, a firepit, Margie it was perfectly prehistoric!  I'd eaten most of the energy bars I'd found in the luggage, and gone through most of the pop.  I eyed the booze, but really thirst wasn't my biggest threat, it was the dreadfully low energy from not having had a decent meal.  That savage I, hee, well rather savaged days earlier was a bit ripe, but as I was dragging it across my compound I must have dragged part of its hand through my fire...\n\nWhat a curiously delightful aroma!  Oh Margo, for a Pinot or even a nice tart Bordeaux!  Ahem, a left bank varietal of course my dear, let's not throw all civility away?  Anyway, soon after that my problems were solved!  I hummed and sang as I whacked away - a bit more loin?  Why yes, I do believe so, and is there any of that lovely kidney left?\n\nWhen I finally found your bracelet dear Margaret, I was well on my way to how would you say cannibalinary greatness, so I do hope you don't mind - mixed in with some chicory and a pinch of Aloe, you could swear you were back in Hastings, missing only the bread pudding!\n\nI must sign off now dear Margie, it's been lovely talking to your skull and thank you again for sitting so fiercely atop of this stick, it's been fantastic warding off those beastly savages!  Though in truth, the sounds in the forest get louder and closer every day, and I could swear I spotted some large misshapen thing stomping through the underbrush.\n\nAh well problems for another day - I hear a scream which can only mean my neighbors have come calling again!  As usual, I'll invite them, ahem, for dinner as it were.  They will decline in that awful gutteral way they do but...\n\nI'm afraid I'll have to insist.  I'd be crazy not to.\n\n(**Seriously perhaps the best survival game there is and I've been playing less than 24 hours.  True anxiety, realisim, fear and triumph!  And really, after a while, you can't tell it isn't Chicken...**)\n\nGREAT JOB GUYS, 5 STARS!","November 6, 2015","true","92.7"," 236 of 265 people (89%) found this review helpful 230 people found this review funny","89","236","265","230","10"

Tons of potential, and playable with a ceiling right now in single player, but like most of this genre's early access titles, it depends where they go from here.  Seems like a great team is behind this though.\n\nThey just released multiplayer, which as you can imagine, requires a LOT of adjustment to code.  But you can easily see the potential here once its fully implemented.\n\nFor those that are considering this for multiplayer as of Jan 7th 2015:\n-Players that are not the game's host cannot save their progress (each time the game is launched they will lose all inventory/upgrades)\n-As the host of my multiplayer instance, I can pull an unlimited amount of logs/sticks/rocks from holders after a save.\n-loot is not shared (only you can loot what you see on the ground, you cannot give food/items to another player)\n\nAnd some Pros that make this game standout from the rest of the genre:\n\nEnvironment:\nThe graphics and atmosphere are actually amazing.  The Forest is beautiful and alive during the day, and perfectly creepy and unsettling at night.\n\nBalance:\nWhile this is preference-based, I appreciated the balance balance between resource gathering, building, hunting, and combat.  The right mix leads to a sensation that you are not only surviving, but constantly building towards thriving.  Its setup perfectly for multiplayer assuming they work out shared items.  (We had 2 players chopping down trees, and 2 running log carts back to the base, and we felt all effecient about it!)\n\nPotential:\nMy favorite review of this game is easily "Bad Parent Simulator 2014" (c: Barry Scott)  At the beginning of the game, you hazily watch your son being taken from you by a cannibal.  The story ends there at the moment.  All it would take is one good writer to add a rediculous amount of substance to the single-player, and possibly mutliplayer as well.\n\nIn conclusion, this team has so much of the difficult aspects of the game complete.  From the graphics, mechanics, overall environment creation, and its easy to see that with just a little more love, at worst, this will be a must-own for the genre, at best, a trendsetter and genre-defining.","January 7, 2015","true","53.4"," 154 of 161 people (96%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","96","154","161","15","1"

The Forest barely does this, however there is just something about it that keeps me coming back.  Don't get me wrong here, it doesn't stand too far from most of those games, but in the key areas it does stand out on, are the area that are simply the most important.\n\nThe key point as to why I am recommending this ---> CONSTANT updates with content and bug fixes.  This is huge for an Early Access game.  It went from being a nifty OKish single player adventure game, to an amzing co-op survival open world game in a mere 6 month span.  Content constantly get's added, AI re-worked(which is interestingly impressive as is), new crafting recipes, parts of the Island reworked are all updates that come out in regular intervals.\n\nI won't go into the game details other than that the game is actually very fun to play.  I highly recommend this title, even if you are skirmish about Early Access titles, this one is in a good, fun, playable state to try out and feel as  if you have had a full gaming experience.\n\nI would also like to add, make sure you pick up two copies because multiplayer is a must!\n\n","January 18, 2015","true","18.4"," 148 of 155 people (95%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","95","148","155","10","8"

The game does its job as a survival horror game, you collect materials such as woods, leafs, stones..etc, and food and water from the remains of the crashed airplane you come from, or by hunting animals (which really feels great killing them, i know I'm a bad person) . the horror aspect of the game is no joke, filled with blood and gore, crazy humanoid primitive creatures out to kill and eat you, and the game doesn't go easy on you, if they're coming after you, you're most likely dead.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/DZao0GMoRCo\n\nThe bad about the game that in the begging is really hard to survive as it doesn't give you a chance to make a good shelter for yourself, but that will probably change over time. The baseline is, the game is great and is worth the asking price and more.\n\nWill update the review as i play more of it\nSo far the game plays great, and now they released the save fix, go nuts and buy this game. Just remember though, it's still early access / alpha so there will be bugs and possibily frustrating moments, if you can't hand that then don't buy it, but if you can and will be supportive and report bugs and concerns, tehn buy it.\n\nMore info here: KSalue[www.ksalue.com]","May 30, 2014","true","13.1"," 536 of 656 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","536","656","0","20"

Bob was my best friend.\nWe ate lizards together, killed cannibals together and survived together.\nOne day my hunger bar got low, and i was outta food.\nI ate Bob.\nRiP\n\nReal Review\nI have decided to edit this review one more time, to help you guys to decide on buying this game.\n\nPresentation\nYou play as some random man whose plane crashes into some random island which just so happens to be infested with mutant cannibals. The point of this game is to just survive as long as you can in the enviornment around you. Looks really nice for a project like this, plus it was made in Unity.\n\nGameplay\nLike I kinda stated above, the point of this game is to survive. In order for you to survive, you must craft shelters, weapons and other stuff to make it easier to live. The current amount of craftable objects may not seem like much, but they will add more over time. You will be constantly hunting for other valuable resources like food and water. You will also be defending yourself from those mutant cannibals that roam around the island. The game ends once you die. The game is still a bit glitchy but still seems pretty good.\n\nOther\nNot much else to say for this one; the sound is fine, the game has a good amount of settings. The last thing you should know about this game is that its in Early Access, the game still gets updated constantly but it may be some time until its done. I can garentee you this game will be done since the consoles have teased this game and every game that is in Early Access (that I know of) that was teased on consoles have been released at some point.\n\nConclusion\nA very nice survival game, it may not have a lot of content at the moment but it does look very promising. Updates are released constantly but it will be just a bit more time before this game can be considered offically released.","June 10, 2015","true","12.3"," 566 of 698 people (81%) found this review helpful 866 people found this review funny","81","566","698","866","38"

Even in Early Access, The Forest is at the top of its genre. I first played many months ago and the very early stage of the game was evident. But I was intrigued and set it aside, hoping that the devs wouldn't join the growing throng of abandoned or semi-supported titles, and that they would actually live up to the purpose of the Early Access program. Now, easily sinking 100 hours into version .031 in just a couple weeks, I can honestly say that Endnight has been very, very busy. It is an understatement to say that The Forest has come a long way. At this rate, it stands to rival popular AAA titles.\n\n"...deeper and deeper into the heart of darkness”\n\nPlaying this time around, I was immediately impressed by the graphics and optimization. The options available make it possible to play, and still enjoy, on nearly any pc. And it is stunningly beautiful, so well complimented by the audio, both ambient and situational. This combination, along with some of the smartest AI I've encountered, makes for a worldspace that is among the most immersive I have ever experienced.\nImmersion...\n\n“But his soul was mad. Being alone in the wilderness, it had looked within itself and, by heavens I tell you, it had gone mad.”\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=611561423\nWhen you can build and decorate a cozy cabin by a pond and set up a little bench to just sit upon and listen to the frogs chirping in the soft rain of sunset, lulled by the crackling of the campfire... that is immersion par excellence. As you watch the raindrops dimple the surface of the pond, from somewhere in the pitch black of night, beyond the glow of your lanterns, an inhuman scream shatters your idyll... something bellowing from the pits of Hell. Then another, and another, and you realize they are communicating. They are hunting... and they are headed straight for you with lightning speed, raw fury and an insatiable hunger. Hopefully you prepared well for this onslaught. Because it will be unrelenting, horrific, and your new routine almost every night. The things I've had to do to survive... bathed in the blood of butchery. I will never be the same again. There is no going back from this...\n\n"He cried in a whisper at some image, at some vision--a cry that was no more than a breath: The horror..."\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=607430795\nIn short, The Forest is Early Access done well. It truly epitomizes the spirit of what EA is all about, and this is worth remarking because we all know that so many do not. The devs maintain a regularly scheduled updating discipline, continuously adding new content, fixing bugs, and optimizing. They listen to the community and actually implement the input. Already on my list of all time favorites, I will easily devote another hundred hours. I am convinced that The Forest will get finished, and that when it does, it will be an exceptional game without rival in its genre.\n\n“It was written I should be loyal to the nightmare of my choice.”\n\nTonight I stack their corpses like cordwood on the flaming pyre. I build walls from their bones and stuff their skulls with burning embers. And now, the mad howling I hear piercing the night... is me.","February 4","true","263.0"," 183 of 203 people (90%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","90","183","203","17","16"

Some are well fortified and if the natives choose to attack on a large scale these locations will surely be the choices for my retreat. I can't decide if they are all part of the same clan or if the "Shiny Ones" and the "Mutations" are seperate from the others. From what I have seen so far, this group is the only that dwell under ground through out the cave systems. To date, I have never seen the surface group enter the caves. I have witnessed on multiple occasions, openly violent attacks on the "Dwellers" from the "Surfacers" leading me to believe they are seperate. Of course this is only speculation.\n\nHaving the multiple camps has proven a must. This has allowed me to travel to the farthest reaches of the island in search for clues of my son's where abouts. I can only speculate on the accuracy of these findings as well as the location of my son.\n\nFrom what I have seen thus far. I am holding out hope that he still lives. I have found pieces of his toy figure leading me to think he is leaving clues in hope that I still breathe and am in search of him. He is correct. I will tear down this island from shores to mountains until I have exhausted my options........ Or my life.\n\nI fear to speak of the other things I have seen.  Clearly, as an attempt to ward off either myself or the creatures, from their villages.These surfacers are readily willing to set up effigies of mangled, mutilated, severed body parts of the copses from the crash. I can only hope that for their part, the victims were deceased prior to these savages locating them. From what I can tell, they have not, I'll say that again, They Have Not eaten any human flesh that I know of. However, as for the cave dwellers,......... well let me only say that I have a stronger constitution then I had thought.\n\nIt's going dark and I must prepare for the nightly hunting from both the surfacers and the dwellers. They seem to prefer the evening for killing. Make no mistake though, if you find this journal.... If I do not find my son and I am fallen, do not trust the day anymore than the night. They want blood.... for what ever reason. I can hear their calls off in the distance now and the sun has lost its' hold.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zkratt/recommended/242760/","zkratt","zkratt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zkratt/","263 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nYes, I recommend it... BUT...\n\nWhile I direct this towards you consumers  just about to spend your money on this product, it's also viable feedback for the developers. So, in short: Yes, I recommend it. BUT for the average gamer it's NOT worth picking up at it's current state. The game is in alpha and needs some serious overhauls.\n\nHere's why:\n\nAs it is, one might wonder if the game is made by fat, lazy people. Simply because you have to eat food and drink soda every five minutes in order to have any energy to work and also, not to starve.\nOne could argue, with reason, how the player needing to eat more frequently than one does in real life, fits the sped up daycycle of the game. However, even if a day passes by in 15 minutes or so, the time needed to scavenge and work in order to gather resources and proviants (to set up a camp with a fire to cook food) is proportionally wrong, feels obscure and out of place.\nIn order for all the walking around, working and scavenging to fit the time-format, the inventory cap needs to be increased atleast threefold. There's just no reason why carrying seven sticks two hundred meters should take several in-game hours. A solution would be to slow the daycycle down at least five times, or better yet, include a slider at the 'new game' screen, where one could adjust the speed of time according to personal prefference.\n\nAlso, I wouldn't really mind those tribesmen showing up this often if it weren't for the fact that I feel completely helpless against an unarmed tribesman, despite having hit him or her three times in the head with an axe. I also wouldn't mind those tribesmen being this extremely dangerous and able to take me out easily, if it weren't for the fact that they show up way too often. Either one of these two extremes is acceptable and could be a niche game-gimmick, but the two of them at once is just terrible. Actually, I preferr none of them, but I suppose some people might, so making this customizable at a new game creation would be a great idea.\n\nPersonally, I'd appreciate if this island didn't feel like a weird place where time is warped, overpopulated by annoying, overpowered cannibals, and a place where I have to constantly eat and drink in order to be able do do anything for two minutes before the day is over and I still need five more sticks. Imagine if this game included having to take a dump aswell! Needing the bathroom every five minutes is equally realistic...\n\nI hope this game comes with a ton of settings to personalize your own experience.\nI, for one, would love if I could actually have strength and time enough to carry out a days work, then sit down by my newly lit campfire and enjoy my freshly grilled lizard before going to sleep.\nAnd if those cannibals didn't show up to kill me this often, perhaps their enhcounters would be a bit more interresting rather than a shallow, obvious and expected, frequent and annoying nuisance, that's being a regular part of every (15 minute) day I get to keep playing.\n\nAs an additional sidenote: For some reason, the textures of skin, like the skin parts of the body (hands etc.), and the skin of the tribesmen is currently glowing. While this makes your enemies easier to spot in the dark, it also makes it a pain to carry logs and such in the dark because of glowing arms taking up half of the screen. I've tried every setting in the options menu to fix this with no luck. I've never experienced anything like this with any other game so it is most likely a bug that will be sorted out. I somehow doubt that selfillumination like this is part of the gamedesign, judging by the screenshots. Running AMD Radeon HD 7870 and the game runs smoothly otherwise.\nEDIT: Check mong my uploaded screenshots to see what I'm talking about.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=331030615\n\nI realize this might have seemed like I'm hating on this, which I'm not. I still stand by my opinions: I recommend it because it has so much potential, but only to people who really are in to these kind of games and wants to try it out anyway. Otherwise, it's a given pass untill the game is done.","October 24, 2014","true","10.5"," 213 of 245 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","213","245","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hyper213/recommended/242760/","hyper213","Strawbunny","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hyper213/","289 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game has it's issues, but once they are fixed, this game will be amazing.\n\nQuick story: You play as this guy on a plane with a child (maybe yours?) holding onto your arm. Plane crashes, some naked tribal guy takes said child, and you're on your own.\n\nEvery time you start a new game the plane will be somewhere else so you wont know where you are every time. You start off with the basics, candy, beer, a fire axe, a heart monitor (that you'll never use) and food. You'll have a survival handbook that is very useful, itll tell you what to do as well as give you a way to build things like a fire or a place to sleep, even walls to keep you safe.\n\nWhen you hop off the plane (and taking the fire axe out of Stacy's face) you will either be greeted with sunshine or greeted by 3 naked people about to destroy you together.\n\nAt this point, if you're lucky, no one will bother you. If you're unlucky however, and the naked tibal people see you and run after you, good luck defending yourself with a fire axe and some snacks (oh and pills).\n\nI love the visuals of this game, it's very beautiful. The sunshine, the darkness, all close to realistic. I love the level of darkness at night, it's just enough to hinder vision, but not enough to be annoying. The weather is pretty awesome too, the only problem I have with the weather is the rain, I got tired of this routine:\n1. You are cold and wet\n2. Get warm by fire\n3. Rain stops, ventures out of base/camp\n4. Rains again 15 seconds later making you run back to camp/base just to get warm\n5. See step one\n\nOn to the enemies: I hate them. They are annoying, buggy, and overpowered at times. I would be in my camp that is surrounded by big tall walls, and suddenly *INCEPTION MUSIC BWUM*. I would look around and see no one, then suddenly a bunch of them run through the walls and runs right back out. This gets annoying, especially when they warp into your camp and hit you from below your log cabin. When you finally have the balls/girl balls to venture out of your camp/base, you see a single naked woman watching you, then walking up to you, then hits you once taking over half your health (perfect time to look at that heart monitor!!). You swing your axe at them but your attacks are SO slow that she hits you 2 times before your next swing.\n\nOther than the things I mentioned, I love the IDEA of the enemies, they watch you, study you, instead of attacking sometimes. I love the idea of stealthing around these naked people or being stalked by them. I know it sounds weird, but these elements are not implimented well in other games, I would love this open-world survival horror game to have a moment where you hear a sound and if you're lucky, you'll see one running away.\n\nThe food: You have only a few choices on food that I've encountered: Candy bar, fish, rabbits, and plants. I hated that more often than not I'm being forced to stop everything just to eat a bunny. I have trouble getting the fish, they swim too far from where you can stand and fish from, meaning you have to stand and hope they swim close to you and not swim out into the ocean. Don't get me started on the sharks in the ocean, they spawn a safe distance, SOMETIMES, once they spawned right at the edge of the water, you can't go in without being eaten. Honestly the hunting, other than the tech issues, is amazing compaired to other games. To fish (at the moment you must find a sharp spear, can't make it yet) you get a sharp spear and go look for the ocean or a pond. You stand over the fish and stab them, making them stick to your pole. This is amazing, it's small but it's great that you don't just go up to a fish and press "take". To hunt (there are only rabbits to hunt and eat at the moment) you either grab your fire axe and start running after them and swinging away, or you make a rabbit trap.\n\nThe building: I love the fact that you can make yourself a camp and stay safe. When you look at your survival guide, you can build walls, cabins, steps, a tree house, and other things. They keep you safe from those naked people that want to sacrifice your body to the "Bieber" they keep seeing in the magazines on planes. I love that if you build a fire, they will come and try to kill you. If I were a tribal naked person and this guy that was in a plane crash made a camp out of 50 logs that are bigger than him in less than 2 days all by himself, I would avoid him completely.\n\nThe game is in development, so there are some bugs that I've run into, here is a list of a few:\n-Gets killed by a naked Leelo and I wake up in a cave surrounded by 3 more naked girls and gets pummeled by them almost instantly. This isn't normal, you have a bit more time than that to recover.\n-End of the level, missing textures, trees in water, a message that says you can't go this way yet, it's not available in this version of the game". When that happened, I was staving looking for fish in water, and never saw one for miles.\n-Made a big base with large walls and stuff to keep safe, but a bunch of enemies run straight through it and attack me.\n-I suddenly start swimming while I was cutting down a tree, I am able to slowly swim off into the sunset above the ground and over the trees. Felt great but it was a game-breaking bug, I can't save and come back, the glitch will still be there.\n-I walk into a cave, start slowly rising upward, looks like I'm swimming then suddenly dropped from a high place and dies.\n\nAll in all, I loved this game, it needs a lot of work but if they continue to build it even after the alpha is released, it would turn out to be a outstanding game. I recommend this game because it has potential to be a epic game, if they put love and care into it.\n\nSuggestions (keep in mind these are probly added by the time anyone reads this):\n-I want to make a strong spear, adding a utility knife would make things a lot easier, you can cut the sticks to make a spear\n-More things to hunt. This is more than likely added very soon.\n-Don't make caves seperate than the main world. Every time you go into a cave, the world outside isn't there anymore, causing issues with framerate and crashes.\n-A story. Surviving is it's own reward, but where did that kid go? Did they mistake him for their idol "Bieber"?\n-Random events: Imagine this, you are walking in the forest, you hear a sound, you look around but see nothing, then when you turn to look in front of you there's a guy and he grabs your neck or tries to stab you, QTE moment. Or imagine this, you made a base, heavily fortified with big walls. One night you are eating your rabbit with a side of Butterfingers when suddenly you hear some chanting. You look over your wall and see a bunch of naked people with a very large log making their way to your wall, threatening to knock it down. Events like this make the game a LOT more fun and random.\n\nI hope you enjoyed my review, thanks for reading! <3\n\n\n","October 28, 2014","true","14.2"," 123 of 129 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","123","129","0","2"

Me and my friend fended off the tribes people all night until the framerate dropped to about 5 frames per second due to the many many teeth/legs/arms/heads littering the floor. I then set myself on fire and died.\n\nConclusion: Fun game, just needs a ♥♥♥♥ ton of optimization and bug fixes.

The core concept and execution of the game are excellent thus far. The Developers for this game are very active in the community and regularly release updates. Detailed breakdown:\n\nWhat we know about the Story:\n\nThe story is in development. This means the whole Story is not there. You cannot "beat" the game as is. While exploring the island you will find clues as to what happened to "Timmy" (who is assumed to be your son). Parts of his toy, pictures, cave sketches. The game has basically zero handholding and refuses to point you in any direction at all. Most people will never find all the hidden story components. If you do find them, you will learn where "Timmy" has been taken\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe game is played in First Person. The core aspects of the game are survival based. Hunger, Thirst, Rest, and Energy all make an appearance. You must hunt for food (or forage, alternatively), drink water, and sleep. So far, the survival aspects are pretty well balanced, and always being improved upon.\n\nYou are going to establish a "base" or camp of sorts. Shelters, fires, walls, traps, gardens, resource management, and food storage all come into play here. There are quite a few creatable structures/devices already, and more are going to be added. Base creation takes time. You must gather resources to build things. Many people feel this is "grindy" but I enjoy it a lot. You will find yourself collecting rocks, sticks, logs from trees, leaves, and other objects and transporting them back to your base. This takes time, but seeing your base take shape feels extremely rewarding.\n\nCombat is a necessary part of the game. You are stuck on an island populated by cannibal tribes. Hungry cannibal tribes. There is so much to say for the AI in this game. They are already impressive and quirky and only getting better. The cannibals are currently broken into three tribes.\n\nStarving/Skinnies.  These cannibals are very thin/lanky, often naked and covered in blood. They are almost always hostile to the player and have even been seen killing and eating fellow cannibals. Often acting as scouts, it is common to see solo skinnies roaming the island. When they find something of interest (deforestation, foreign structures, you) they will often hide and observe for a while. When satisfied, they will run back to their camp and alert fellow cannibals. If they located your base, expect to see patrols coming and going from now on. Skinnies are the weakest of all the cannibals, but they are EXTREMELY fast and agile. It is very easy for skinnies to dodge your attacks and get behind you when in combat.\n\nCannibals. The regular cannibals look like normal humans, with a few skin tones, often covered in dirt or decorations. They usually travel in groups of 2-4. They are not always hostile to the player, but it's always safer to assume they are. If they know your location it's common to see them roaming around the edges of your base. they are slower than skinnies but they usually carry clubs and hit much harder. They are prone to splitting up in combat, flanking and coming from behind the player.\n\nCave Cannibals. Gray skinned aliens, basically. Stronger than regular cannibals but a bit slower. use the same tactics and skills as above.\n\nThe AI is so awesome. They stalk you, they observe you, leave effigies outside your base (body parts on sticks) to mess with you, ambush you, scare you. You will find yourself fearing them, looking over your shoulder when doing even the simplest things. there are special varieties of mutants deep in the caves, but I'll leave that for you to discover.\n\nAll in all this game is excellent. The core concept and foundation are very well done. The developers add more and more, and try to stay on top of glitches and bugs. More is being added and the game is only 14.99 on Steam. 10/10 for me, I love this game and would recommend it to anyone.\n\n\n\nEDIT:\n\nI have been playing this Multiplayer with a buddy of mine and it's amazing. This game is 10x better with a friend. We've had so much fun and I recommend anyone who enjoys it to try it with some friends. Beware though, the difficulty is increased for multiplayer. 11/10\n\nEDIT 2:\n\nI feel I need to take a moment to commend the Devs on this game. For a two man team (now 15-17 man team as the dev pointed out) they put an insane amount of work into this. There is an update timer on the main menu and anytime they go past the scheduled time, they always explain what happened and why. Every time they release an update there is always a hotfix for most of the new bugs the update causes within a day or two. This Dev team is literally a personification of what Early Access should be. They are such a great team and they really take the wishes of the community to heart. You will not regret the purchase, and these guys deserve support. Thank you to the Devs!","October 7, 2015","true","81.5"," 98 of 99 people (99%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","99","98","99","10","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LeSharkeh/recommended/242760/","LeSharkeh","Schlechte ᖘlumm 🐝","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LeSharkeh/","375 products in account","Early Access Review\n\n(Last update was July 22nd, 2014)\n\nIf there is one thing I would tell Dean Hall about his Survival game "DayZ" is that I don't see the point of surviving when you are just shooting everyone in sight.  When I think of a survival game I think about a band of people coming together to overpower whatever the hell is on the planet and to fight back against it, as well as to survive and get food, and then I would hit him over the head with a sledge hammer and tell him to do his game right.\n\nPROS:\n\nThe Island: When I started it up I was plopped into a jet with a kid next to me, pretty much KOed, then we started divebombing towards the ground and crashed, with some naitive guy coming and taking the child, then me getting up a hour or so later with bruises and cuts, so I grabbed everything and ran outside to see what happened.  Well the plane is cut in half and the back half where I was at is broken to high hell except the body.  I must say that the island looks really nice, and actually looks like a Forest, not just a place I got dropped into and expected to win at.\n\nThe Cannibals: These guys are creepy, and actually act like a tribe which kind of threw me off, I was chopping some trees down with my little Hatchet, and all of a sudden 3 of them came up to me, I was actually kind of terrified cause I had no clue what they were going to do, so I just stood there and stared, they started to get in closer and closer, so I readied myself for a fight, then they all ran away like they just saw a ghost.  The creepy thing is that they try to surround you and flank your sides which I really didn't think they would do for how early this game is.  Also, has anyone else noticed that the silouette of a bush looks like a human? Keeps scaring me thinking someone is there.\n\nA Interactable Environment: If you noticed I said in the last pro "Chopping some trees" I wasn't kidding, you can ACTUALLY cut down every tree on the island, which is really cool feature since you can actually chop down bushes for leaves, break suitcases for items, the trees down for logs for your shelter, it's really neat, I didn't think they would go this in depth.\n\nEasily find your house: Once you make a hut, log cabin, etc, you'll get a icon on your hud showing you where the house is at, which I admire, that way I can go explore all I want and easily find my way back to the house, cause with me and my Adventurous nature I tend to get lost a lot and that icon is very nice so I can find my way back to my house.\n\nMolotovs are OP as hell: Not kidding, a Molly can kill 3-4 of them as soon as the fire touches them.  I was building my hut on the beach since they couldn't flank behind me and had only 1 way to get to me, well a group of 3 came right up to me and I froze again, I was kind of afraid to move cause I had no clue what they would do, then 3-4 more came up behind, first thing that came into my mind was "F$#k me..." I looked into my inventory and realized I could make some molly's, so I made a few and started to toss them at the group, 1st molly hit 2 in the first group, the 3rd guy ran back towards the others, I threw a second at the other group and caught 2 more on fire, the 2 that survived ran off.  So if you get cornered, Molotovs are the way out.\n\nMissing passangers(?) (Spoiler warning): I realized I was the only one on the plane in the back end, but I figured there were more than just me and a kid, so as I was wondering the island I found a hole near the beach that led to a cave, I figured "Eh what the heII, I may as well look inside." I threw up my lighter and walked around, I couldn't see much other than some suitcases and a rusty hatchet, I took the hatchet (Which does more damage than the red little hatchet.) Turned around, and looked up, there was about 30-40 bodies hanging upside down in the cave which scared the s^%t out of me, I realized I found most of the passengers on the trip it would seem...\n\nWeaponry: Other than the molly's, you get a hatchet, then later I found the Rusty Hatchet in the cave, I don't know if the Rusty Hatchet does more damage (i'm assuming it does), so you may want to find it.\n\nEffigy's: After I had killed some of the members I had dismembered them, and got their bodyparts, I thought "The f^#k am I supposed to do with these?" I figured I would make a effigy out of them like the book said, and I Just put it near my house and just kind of left it there, some more naitives came after me there was quite a large group, I didn't have enough cloth for more mollys so I lit the Effigy on fire and they all backed away and ran, I guess the effigys show you aren't to be f**ked with.\n\nInventory system: I really liked this, it organizes things when you open your inventory and show's how much of what you have for what item, like 50 leaves, 10 candy bars, etc, and you can craft items together, like me making the molly's it's just with a beer bottle and a cloth and you are good to go!\n\nPerformance issue fix: They fixed a lot of performance problems, it does run much better than what it was when it first came out, can't wait till they fix it all though.  Although now it is running much better than it had a few weeks ago or so, so good job on that end, I can even put the shadows on High again, yay.\n\nCONS:\n\nMap: This is NOT a con, but I just feel like this has to be established, the map isn't fully used and honestly I feel like i've only found about 1/4 of the bloody map itself, so when it becomes a full map i'm gonna get lost to high hell, but I can't wait for that to happen!\n\nDraw distance sucks, same with FOV, and FPS: Not trying to sound like a d%#k or anything, but the draw distance is just terrible, litterally, you have to be within 10 feet of cases, rocks, etc. it's rediculous, not to mention the FOV (Field Of View) Is just awful, it's not Call of Juarez: The Cartel bad, but it's pretty bloody close.  Ontop of that even though it's been fixed the FPS is still at a cap of 30, which feels so weird considering with all of the close draw distance, bad FOV, everything, I think it would run MUCH better than what it is.  Thankfully they did some performance tweaks and now it runs smoother, so yay on that end.\n\nDrop a Molly on your feet: This annoyed me quite a lot, when you take out a molly, and don't use it, but try to equip something else, he just drops it on his feet, and it scared the s%@t out of me and made me run into the nearest pond, so if you are going to make Molly's then for the love of god only make 1-2 that way if you use it you won't have to worry about dropping it on your feet and run around like a idiot.\n\nNo Control page: I can't really find the control page, if there is one, to check the controlls, I would like to know what buttons I have to push to do things instead of f**king something up.  I don't mind the fact it DOESN'T tell me, but i'd like to know if there is some buttons that are very useful or that I might need to use at one point or another.\n\nWHAT I THINK:\n\nThis game, for a early alpha game, is REALLY good, props to those 4 people doing this, compared to other people doing survival games like Rust, DayZ, and Nether, these guys know what a survival game is about, they are even going to implement a Co-op at one point to play with friends which I can't wait for.  This game, in it's alpha stage, gets a 8/10, there are some really annoying things but those are gonna get patched out quite quickly now, and it's worth every penny I spent, honestly it's half the cost of DayZ and I feel like i'm getting more.","June 2, 2014","true","7.7"," 130 of 146 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","130","146","0","8"

I look, to my left, out the window and see clouds. Turbulence, and now the front of the plane has come off. I look back at my son, who is now rocking back in forth in his seat. We hit the ground and my son goes limp. Shortly after, I black out.\n\nI awaken to what I can only assume is some sort of Tribesman picking up my son, and carry him away. I play dead until he leaves. When he does, I get up and notice that I am all of a sudden very hungry, and very thirsty. Amazingly, I find trays of food that seem to be unharmed from the crash. I eat three or four trays and had some soda to wash it down. No time to mourn the loss of my son. I must survive.\n\nI walk to the front of the remaining section of plane. I find a flight attendant with an axe stuck in her chest. I removed it like King Arthur did with Excaliber. I notice I have survival guide on me. After reading through that I begin collecting resources. While bashing luggage open, I spot a light in the near distance. Upon aroaching I see that it is another tribesman, and he is running at me.\n\nMy first reaction was to charge with my axe. After a few good hits, the tribesman retreats to a tree and begins to climb. I watch as he jumps from tree to tree, slowly getting closer. He makes it to a tree close to me and pounces down, much like a tiger. I begin frantically swinging my axe, and soon he is on the ground with no pulse. I hit just one more time, and the corpse explodes into limbs and other bits. Night is now falling, I better make shelter.\n\nWith my hunters sheltler built to survival guide standards, I make fire with leaves and sticks. With my fire lit, I notice the many animals that run and fly by, even at night. Ballsy birds begin perching atop my shelter. Wielding my axe, I slaughtered all birds who dare cross me. I look back at my fire just in time to see the cutest little bunny running through and setting himself ablaze. I watched as that furry little fireball ran away into the woods. I felt that was as good as a time, as any, to go to bed and rest up for my first full day of survival.\n\n[UPDATE]\n\nIt is now my second day. I awaken to find three tribesman stading outside my shelter. Two with skulls on sticks as weapons. The third with a torch. Thinking that he is unarmed, I attacked the torch wielding man first. In hindsight, this was not a good idea. I was set a flame just like that furry little bunny I saw last night.\n\nAfter passing out from the pain, I awaken inside of a very dark cave, with nothing but the lighter I had in my pocket when the plane crashed. I assume that the tribespeople that attacked me earlier brought me here. I look around and find a flare gun. Shortly after, I see another on of these tribespeople in this cave. I shoot him with the flare gun, and it lights up this section of the cave enough for me to see many bodies hanging above me.\n\nI move closer to the tribesman that I had killed. I see a body on the table that looks like it has been disected, like some sort of biology project. Im begining to think that they have plans for me. I better get out of here before its too late.","May 30, 2014","true","0.8"," 141 of 163 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","141","163","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/melancholymastermind/recommended/242760/","melancholymastermind","TemplarGFX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/melancholymastermind/","201 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI have spent the last 4 and a half days reading through ALL of the code, and I mean all 1500+ source files from 19 compiled binaries that came with the Alpha.\n\nWhile the engine, its systems and all the various functions across the entire game show that it is EXTREMELY early in the games development timeline (almost to the point you could say only-just-started). HOWEVER, and this is a really big HOWEVER, hence the caps. The different core functions that create the game (Physics, AI, Crafting, Environment, Survival, Graphics) are impressive in their construction. They have used some of the top add-ins for unity to speed up the games creation and improve the complexity of several core systems, and built on top of that base to create the alpha we are playing now. It is likely the integration of these systems so that they work together in unison is the reason for the initial release delays. Likely the graphical side.\n\nThe bits we really care about, Items, AI, Crafting, Survival Mechanics and World interaction are all setup in such a way that adding new things, improving current stuff or replacing parts entirely is easy from a coding perspective, thanks to the methods they use to pass information and trigger functions across entities in the game world.\n\nMost of what we are experiencing in the Alpha is what I call place-holder code. Simple versions of what the function should do once it has been developed. Just enough code so that the function will not crash the game, or another function if it is called. SO MANY functions do not even have code written for them. They do nothing when or if they are even called.\nSome areas are of course further developed than others. Building structures and crafting is quite fleshed out fundamentally, the AI is all ready for family based societies and most of the complex roaming and searching code is not being used. Combat is not even their really. being able to collide with things and pass functions calls allows the simplistic fighting and moving we have in the game, and I seriously think this will be replaced entirely.\n\nMy guess is that the first few patches will be stability and integration patches. These will improve the functions in the areas most reported and further integrate the different add-ins with their own code, and finally customizing those add-ins further to support the game they want to create. Further content, like additional craftables and buildables, and more complex AI (like family society) will probably not come until another patch or two has past. Depending on the assets they have ready now, and the complexity of how those are used in game, we will see a handful of craftables, items or buildings added in any patch, but big content will be later. We are likely to see movement, collision, combat and item interaction improve dramatically in the next two patches, as well as performance increases and general stability.\n\nI also assume that the integration of these add ins, and customizing them would be quite complex and time consuming. Working with other peoples code can be time consuming and unpredictable until you are as familiar with that code as you would be your own. These add-ins are not simple little modules, they are advanced highly developed and quite complex systems. As time passes, the dev's will get more and more familiar with the coding of these, and development speed will increase.\n\nI found no evidence (in my mind) that suggested any aspect of what they advertised was false or misleading as far as what the game is becoming. In fact the code suggests that the game is going to be a lot more than what we know already. There are some really cool things that just are not used or spoken of at all.","June 4, 2014","true","112.6"," 96 of 102 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","96","102","0","8"

I've tried swimming to the middle of the lake during the night -- it rained and my character began to get hypothermic. I tried building my shelter on an island -- I kept running out of food and fire tinder and eventually sharks began appearing in the surrounding water and the mutants were waiting for me on the shore. I tried to build my shelter on a mountain -- they got suspicious after I was picking too many blueberries.\n\nThe AI in this game is incredible. The only way I can manage to escape them is to build a new shelter made of sticks every day, but then the game loses its horror aspect and becomes a scavenging game (not a bad thing, imo).\n\nThe only downside to this game is that I'm too scared to play it normally. I've tried building a log cabin, but I got a bit chickened out after groups of 4 of them started appearing and their legs multiplied .. so there's that.\n\nThis is the only game to have scared me other than Amnesia and Exmortis, so needless to say, I am impressed :)\n\n10/10 would press 'esc' key again","December 29, 2015","true","7.6"," 85 of 89 people (96%) found this review helpful 44 people found this review funny","96","85","89","44","9"

I'll keep it relatively short whilst trying to do it justice. Do I reccomend this game? Hell Yeah!\nSure it's Early Access and there are little buggy things here and there getting worked out, but updates are pretty much every 2 weeks with hot patches daily if necessary. However the enviromental effects are superb and improving all the time. I have 250ish screenshots just because as you are playing the game you just say to yourself "wow that looks amazingly realistic" and bang goes your finger to the screenshot button. Although the storyline is still developing there is plenty to keep yourself occupied (it is a sandbox type experience with survival elements). You can experiment with building bases, or if you tire of that you can go walking/exploring/rescource gathering, or diving/swimming/rafting or even caving.  At the same time you must attempt to fight off the hungry/angry natives/cannabals/mutants or wildlife, and maintain your levels of hunger/thirst/heat and health (assuming that you are not disabling this via a cheat code/or you are playing solo and not multiplayer which obviously alters the experiance).\nAs far as graphics go, obviously as I said earlier it's really good, but to further touch on this I have to say that the textures are sharp and clear and believable even when close up, and the effects such as looking in the water (objects move and distort with the motion just like real water) the wind blowing through the trees/grass etc make a truly immersive experiance. And of course the believability is further enhanced by the sounds of animals (incl bird songs at dawn) waterfalls and seaside/ocean sounds and falling leaves/crackling fires, and of course the spooky mutant calls/breathing and muttering noises that'll keep you on your toes ready to run/fight. Of course there are some placeholder effects here and there, but it is Early Access.\nSo what do you have to lose for the current price? You would already get more hours of playtime than loads of fully content complete AAA titles and it's only going to get better. In fact it has the potential to become one of the best survival horror sandbox games ever.\nI rate 8/10 current, 11/10 expected!\n\nP.S. After curiously looking to see what some people give negative reviews for, I would say this...\na.) You cannot do bugger all in this game in only a couple of hours, and if you are writing a review from that experiance, you are not qualified.\nb.) If you have trouble surviving or evading the cannabals or having your buildings destroyed, you need to improve your tactics and not blame the game, 1000's of others seem to manage ok (my current game is at day 37), that is not to say it is totally easy, it is a survival horror after all.....and gameplay balancing/AI etc is still being developed.\nc.) Glitches or bugs (wtf?) Do you not understand the concept of Early Access? Instead of critically reviewing the game, post your bugs and suggestions on the appropriate forums and help this game become the masterpiece it can be. And you're also moaning about what? $15, yet would pay $80-90 for a supposedly complete title of comparible next gen quality.","September 8, 2015","true","010.6"," 101 of 112 people (90%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","90","101","112","7","3"

It has so much potential and many great things are still being added to the game to make it even more awesome!

The first day begins gathering basic supplies: food, water, sticks, rocks, and setting up a basic shelter. It might even seem peaceful at first. Lonely, but peaceful. Then the cannibals arrive. Its the middle of the night, you wonder why sleeping only lasted through half the night as a leader and others in the night patrol encircle your pitifully undefended camp. This is one of the few games that forces you to flee in that situation, leaving everything behind. But then a new day comes! You harvest lumber, you hunt, and you build to survive. But beware, as your impact on the forest becomes more obvious, the cannibals bully you more and more.\n\nTruly a spectacular single player experience, and once more bugs are fixed, the same could be said for online play. The only reason this game isnt a perfect 10/10 is some annoying bugs, but it really does feel like a finished product to me, so final rating: 9/10","December 22, 2015","true","30.9"," 78 of 81 people (96%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","96","78","81","3","0"

The gameplay is VERY immersive, GUI is rarely in your way and every point of the game it feels like you're in it. As someone who also likes horror games, this one goes high in my list for that genre, the atmosphere can be very creepy and I've spent many days huddled in my treehouse listening to the screams of cannibals in the distance. The combat is also great and there are many possible tactics you can use to suppress the cannibals. Now there are a few annoying bugs here and there but nothing very game-breaking. The graphics are also INSANELY good for a game made by such a small group of people using the unity engine, it definitely makes the game much more appealing.\n\nOverall I'll give the game 8.5837/10","December 9, 2014","true","52.3"," 114 of 132 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","114","132","0","3"

The A.I. is great and has ironicly been the cause of some bad reviews because people simply haven't understood that the natives have so many different character traits and responses to your interaction with them. Sometimes you cause fear, sometimes intrigue, these natives don't act in a singular 'standard' manner. Your interaction with them and the habitat around you all contribute to the circumstances you will find yourself in.\n\nEarly Access can be a minefield, I know, I have supported quite a few but I would like to point out that the developers of this game are the most hard working and dedicated team I have come across in the Early Access Genre. (If you don't believe me, go and check out their changelog for the last 12 months) As soon as you boot the game it will tell you when the next update is due (on average, every 28 days) and every update consists of a massive list of changes, fixes and tweaks.\n\nThere is no good reason I can think of not to buy this game if you like the survival genre, it ticks more boxes than any other game of it's type.

The primary goal of the game is to quickly ignore your kidnapped child and set about building tree houses and gazebos. to build your gazebos and cabin mansions, you need to deforest roughly 2/3rds of the forest to acquire enough logs. This is proven easy, however, since the plane crash has rendered both Tim and Richard the ability to chop down trees and run with logs at record speeds.\n\nAs well as extremely inefficient carpentary, Tim and Richard have taken cues from Martha Stewart, and you're given the ability to decorate your weapons with teeth, or make festive human effigies that spruce up the now tree-devoid camp site. you can also decorate yourself in raw lizard skin and deer hides.\n\nyour main adversary in the game are the birds. songbirds will swarm you like angry bees, and seagulls will fly out of your mouth from time to time. a proven method to deal with the birds is to surround yourself with a fire, which will burst the offending birds into flames, or simply standing next to a fire will suffice.

Yum yum.\n\n\nPROS\n\nEnvironment/Atmosphere/Mood\n- Very nice graphics. The flora of the woodland - from the grass and ferns to the tallest trees, and pretty much everything in between - transports you away to a rustic, lush green island and thoroughly immerses you there.\n- Truly pitch black conditions at night (apart from when the moon is out) and in caves. THIS is what Skyrim should have been. Navigating at night is difficult and very dangerous. Do you just sleep through the night or press on with your work?\n- The best caves and cave exploration I've ever seen in a game. The general design for them is great, and you truly do get a sense of clautrophobia that hightens the tension of an already scary game. Some of the caves are very long too so you have to make sure you're thoroughly prepared before you dare disappear into the blackness.\n- The wind blows through the forest, pushing all the leaves and bushes and creating wonderful rustling sounds all around you. You must experience it to feel how atmospheric it is!\n- The distant running of underground streams and the dripping of water from the ceiling create a wonderful sense of being deep in an ancient cave. The sound effects are truly great.\n- I was chasing a raccoon with a spear and it jumped up onto a tree and ran up the trunk to the top. How cool is that? I wasn't expecting that and it surprised me immensely (in a good way).\n- The best inventory system in a game I've ever seen. All your items are laid out on a sheet of tarp as if you've just emptied out your rucksack onto the ground. You can then place different items in the centre area to try and combine them into new things. This is an excellent crafting system, as you have to experiment to find out what will combine to produce what.\n- The cannibals make some truly disturbing noises, especially when they're asleep in the caves.\n\n\nCombat\n- Very satisfying first person combat with melee and ranged weapons, molotovs and even DIY explosives. Everything you could possibly need to get rid of those pesky cannibals.\n- You can craft and lay traps to capture or kill the cannibals. Just place them on the ground and then sit back to enjoy the view.\n\nSurvival\n- Excellent survival experience. You'll have to become very good at chasing fast rabbits if you don't want to starve to death. You'll also need to be looking out permanently for sources of fresh water - I almost died of thirst during my first in-game day. Other factors to take into consideration are the cold and succumbing to illness/infection. Although these last two still appear to be in development at the time of writing.\n\nGameplay\n- A free building system (similar to that in Rust) that allows you to build pretty much any kind of base you'd like.\n- You can build an Ewok village in the trees! :D\n- A survival game with a story and end game scenario quest. Moreover, not just any story; but one you will care about and will want to work towards completing. You will want to survive, adapt, and rescue your kidnapped son.\n- Lumberjacking is a strangely satisfying and soothing experience.\n- The devs have meticulously hand-crafted a large island with unique places to discover (No procedural generation here!). You really will have to work to discover quite a few of the hidden things in caves and in amongst the dense foliage above ground.\n\n\nExtra Info\n- VERY polished for an early access title.\n- Great value for money at the current asking price. I would have happily paid 2 or 3 times as much - even in its current state.\n- Very stable for early access. I've experienced only a few minor issues.\n\n\nCONS\n\n- It's still only in early access stage :'(\n\n- Objects that you can pick up (sticks and rocks for crafting) glow and flash - this truly does break the immersion. Please give us the option to turn this off!\n- Combat still lags and jerks, and also freezes for a second (this seems to be most obvious when a cannibal jumps at you). This is frustrating because you lose the flow of the fight and you'll have to spin your character around desperately looking for your attacker before they hit you from some completely unsuspected angle.\n- Occasionally, a cannibal will hit you and you'll go flying 100 feet into the air. The punch won't kill you, but the fall sure will.\n\n\n***Multiplayer Review Update***\n\nPersonally, I prefer the forest in single player mode, as it gives you that true feeling of isolation on a hostile island. But multiplayer, with up to 8 people, is very enjoyable. It's definitely easier, as you can fight the cannibals together (3 of us took down a group of 5 of them very quickly) and building is much quicker. With extra pairs of hands you can build elaborate structures rather quickly.\nThere are some bugs, however, e.g. sounds and certain textures not working/triggering properly. These seem to occur when your CoOp partners are interacting with the environment and enemies. I think it must be because of some sort of lack of synchronisation between the server and players.\nI've deliberately kept this part of the review short, sorry, but mulitplayer is definitely recommended. Especially if you have some good friends to run around and hack and slash with :)\n\n\n***10th December 2015 UPDATE***\n\nAfter this latest update your actions in the environment really seem to affect whether the cannibals can find you.\nI lit a fire (just as an experiment) and then ran away to a safe distance. Sure enough, one minute later I can see an enemy running around my makeshift camp clearly searching for who or what built it.\nI also started lumberjacking in a remote area - again as an experiment. Five trees later, and one stump destroyed with an explosive, and there were loads of them just flocking to where I'd been working! That put me in a lot of danger, and in the end all I could do was run away to safety, abandoning what could have been my new home.\nThe Forest just keeps getting better and better! :)\n\n\nIf you'd like to know more, especially about multiplayer, feel free to leave questions below and I'll get back to you.\nIf you didn't find this helpful, do let me know why - thanks :)","November 16, 2015","true","29.6"," 88 of 98 people (90%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","90","88","98","6","8"

This my first 8 hour impression of The Forest.\n\nI play too many survival games, its the genre of the hour these days it seems.\nI have problems with survival games... I love them, but they're broken, culturally in most cases and mechanically in others.\n\nI've owned The Forest for 6 months now and never put an ounce of time into it. I've played Rust, I've played Landmark, Ark, DayZ (modded well before all this alpha crap started). The list could contiune on for quite some time.\n\nI'll be honest, most days I want to go back to the time when Steam asked us to vote on "Steam Greenlight" and change my vote... but for The Forest this is not the case.\n\nThe Forest is well done for an alpha of nearly 6 months, I played by myself, but not co-op yet as I don't expect much from a partially finished game, especially in a multiplayer environment.\n\nIt seems there is a very interesting story developing underneath all these neat mechanics they have. Crafting is relatively easy and some of the hand-made tools make it challenging at first to figure out what the hell to do. They all seem to work to some extent though.\n\nWhen I played there were 4 types of housing, 4 fires and multiple tools to make, along with other stuff to do, it was enough to keep me busy in single player mode without the cannibals until I had nothing left to build. The game itself is visually stunning - runs great with minimal bugs (FOR AN ALPHA KEEP IN MIND). I expect to see them so I'm not going to ♥♥♥♥♥ about the time I fell through the world, or the time I "woke up" dead.\n\nThings I liked:\n*Trees fall organically, as in - it doesn't just spray you with materials... the tree falls and then explodes into logs *neat!*\n*World looks AMAZEBALLS - even on medium settings it looks nice.\n*Lighting works, mostly. I expect lighting errors during development, this had... very few in the 8 hours I played.\n*Focus on Co-op -- from the very little I played against the cannibals... I can tell this game is going for force a cooperative experience rather than shove ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s down your throat like other survival games do. I like that.\n*The AI.... acts scary... as in, I was followed by a scout, who took great care to hug the bushes... first few times I thought I was seeing things... until I squarely saw him run from bush to bush.. sneaky son of a ♥♥♥♥♥... The combat was... a little bit to get used to at first as it seems the hitboxes might be off -- however its more likely that I just suck at it.\n\nThings I didn't like:\n*Eating and drinking are broken like in EVERY survival game - this game does a far better job of managing it than others, still I find myself wondering how one man goes through 7 lizards in one day... big ♥♥♥ lizards, not your garden variety "Oh how cute its a lizard" -- I'm talking Bearded dragon status...If it were a normal day, I've have eaten 7 times in 16 hours...\n*Climbing ropes was... awkward, you can use your lighter but not your weapon (thats odd, I have two hands..)\n*Explosives useage was... disappointing, dynamite for a piece of rope... c'mon... I assume this will be fixed later.\n*Fire does not burn nearly as long as "The Forest" name would suggest... I'm not asking for the entire place to burn down, but those 3 molotovs certainly would've brought Smokey the Bear out in my neighborhood... He didn't even know it happened here.\n\nThe devs have obviously put some time and thought into this game, I'd liked to have seen more from 6 months worth of development however when you consider its basically a basement coding operation (2 guys from my understanding) I am quite impressed with what they have to offer.\n\nIf you're looking for a full survival experience I am confident that when this game releases it will be one of the better versions of that experience, right now I found myself simply wanting more from the experience - more to build, more to do, more to... oh god, whats that?!    "GET AWAY FROM ME CANNIBALS!!!!!!!" Did I mention the AI is.... scary good?\n\nAlthough I was able to spend nearly 5 hours exploring the island... just exploring and still had a good time checking out the world they built. Some parts seem a little lifeless still but its obvious they're still fleshing this world out. I'm banking on this game being a 9/10 when it finally releases.","October 28, 2015","true","16.8"," 83 of 91 people (91%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","91","83","91","6","4"

There's nothing worse than playing an open world, exploration game and seeing there is an area that is not yet available. The crafting and building aspect of the game is very fun and the learning curve is very quick to figure out. The Cannibals are very realistic and diverse in the way they approach you, and each of them have their own unique way of dealing with you as well. I like the fact that when you do die, you have a chance of waking up in an underground hold, which is either lightly guarded or not at all. But your health is severely reduced along with your hunger pains, but you do keep all of your crafted weapons, medicine, food etc. I'm not sure if this is right or not, but when my health is depleted and have armor left I usually end up alive in one of the underground camps. The "Calm Mode" is okay I guess for people that want to use it as a building simulator, but there just isn't enough content to keep me interested or entertained without having the Cannibals as company. You are able to use "Calm Mode" as a crutch, so that you can set up your whole camp to a tee; and then use it in regular mode with the Cannibals with a huge advantage, if you wish. The atmosphere and constant weather changes are very nice to look at as well.  So I have mixed feelings about this game. The positives outweigh the negatives for me, but I will say that this game is not for everyone, especially if you crave constant action, or a narrative.","January 23, 2015","true","18.6"," 75 of 80 people (94%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","94","75","80","6","2"

( a bit faster, but if you wanna do it like real life, i suggest you go out and do it, in real life)\nThat same day, my brother asked me do you get damage if the tree falls into your head ? i smiled a bit, and told him sure why not, thinking to myself that a game like this wouldnt do that.\n\nBut not only have you done this, you have taken my breath away countless times now.\nI keep relogging every now and then, and read your updates to see what's new, and whenever i see something that i REALLY need to do, i get the crew back and we build, expand and explore !\n\nThis is propably one of the best well though and well designed games, i've seen in a while.\nThe passion theese guys have for the game is amazing.\n\nagain and again they take our breath away with survival aspects, not like any other game.\nAtleticism, custom buildings, ramps and a roof above your head.\nConstant upgrades to the game that you just can't complain about.\n\nNot only do they have what you think should be here, but the research is so good, that they are doing stuff i never even thought about myself.\nTurtles, use their shield for water collector,\nRabbits, use their skin to collect berries,\nDeer's, well let's make a water pouch\n\nI won't spoil to much, but i like that everything that is in the game, is there not only for being watched at, beacuse god the graphics are beautiful, but they also have a purpose.\n\nSo if you look away from the glitchy buggy stuff, that all of us (gamers), know can and should be in Pre-alpha, let's look at the game and give that some grades.\n\nFirst the graphics :\nThis is an easy one, the graphics is 10 out of 10, again there is unpolished areas, but the trees beeing cut into, cannibals and the island itself is an absolutely amazing place, it is almost like wonderland, and this game will surpass alot of the other ones out there once it's done.\n\nSecond the Audio and the mood of the game :\nI had to add that beacuse thoose two are one and same, without the other they won't do.\nAgain they've nailed it, from crazy thunder, to water dropping down from the ceiling in caves, or crazy screams throughout the night, this game sets the mood for you, not vice versa.\nthat's another 10 out of 10\n\nNow on this one i was trying to figure out something, beacuse we can't give a game grades on what it has, when it is developing everything it has, so sadly for thoose pessimist out there, this is going to be for how good they are at developing their game.\nWhich After being here for 24 updates i have to say, they'r doing better than H1Z1 and HoTS by far !\n\nSo "The forest" gets 30/30 !\n\nBUT THAT BEING SAID:\n\nThis is a game still in development, DON'T expect a fully polished game, where there is no errors or bugs.","December 22, 2015","true","51.8"," 74 of 81 people (91%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","91","74","81","16","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/themeahatter/recommended/242760/","themeahatter","TheMeaHatter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/themeahatter/","34 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFrom the time this game was released I did not play it until November 1st for the simple reason I knew it was in early stages of Alpha and had a long road ahead of it. With that said I feel like I have done about everything there is to do in the game after playing it for less than a week when I started.\n\nThe graphics are astounding, and the ease of blueprints and controls are really a plus for me.\nThe mutants are challenging but it can be EXTREMELY frustrating for a new players in Single Player Mode not knowing what to do. I have come across several people who "just bought the game" and they joined co-op to figure out how to simply survive regardless of the mutants.\n\nThe survival guide gives you very basic information, and up until the last patch I was googling some of the most basic weapons to craft and now they have added the materials needed in the back of the survival guide.\n\nSure pick up some soda, drink some dirty water from a pond, or boil water if you can find the pot - Sure it sounds easy to a veteran player, but for somebody new to this game they are completely oblivious. I will say I am seeing a trend like this with Survival games where the developers want you to figure out things on your own. Either you continously die until you give up or join coop or you survive to see another day.\n\nWith all that said, the game could really use some major improvements. There are some simple bugs like the log glitch that can be duplicated without using cheats or mods. Theres the log issue where the trees do not generate logs after so long. There are times when a player will go down and is not "saveable" or resurrectable. The traps and tree houses do not disappear if the trees are cut down. "This is recent as they did before the last patch"\n\nPlayers need the motivation to complete missions, explore caves, craft new items, customize their bases. Everything in this game is quite primitive. The most technological item is a bomb or a explosive trap. The bow weapon is very simple. It could easily be upgraded to a compound bow, or you could find an upgraded bow off of a chieftan or a boss.\n\nIf there is a spawn of an armsy for example there should be an alert that comes across your screen to where everyone can hunt it down and kill it. Then the Armsys only drop certain kinds of materials to craft certains things. (Just a thought)\n\nThere needs to be locations on the map where players stumble upon different tribes with different technologies. The compound or upgraded bow is a good example. Blowguns, tommahawks, Spiked clubs, slingshots, bone armor, helmets that are craftable out of animal hide or bones.\n\nOne thing I would be very happy to have craft is....  a SHEILD, SHEILD SHEILDs!!!!! Give us a sheild!\n\nThe mutants or tribes are distinguishable by their posture, heigth, effigys, and color of their skin. The tribes and buildings need to be more distinguished and unique compared to each other.\n\nSome people complain that this game is too easy while others complain that it is too hard. I am an adult and have over 100 hours logged on this game or close to. I will say that by about day 5 the mutants, cannibles, whatever you want to call them easily overwhelm you if you do not have a simple base or unless you are living in a cave.\n\nIt takes roughly 4-8 hits to kill a mutant while it only takes them 3-4 hits to destroy you. The fire mutants fire damage only takes about 1/8th of your health down which seems like it should take more down if they are burning you for 8 seconds. While if I get touched by a pale mutant im down in about 2 or 3 hits.... So in a nut shell I have to use the traps or hit them from a distance. I really don't think there is close combat in this game unless you have all of your armor or you can burn them OR you have a weapon you can swing fast enough and does enough damage to knock them on their butts. Otherwise they roll over you easily.\n\nThere needs to be more wild life. Sure boars, deer, sea turtles, tortoises, rabbits, lizards, racoons, crocodiles, squirrels, and fish are great. Lets add some mountain lions that prowl low and can randomly attack you when you least expect it or maybe some coyotes at night that are in packs that are sounding off and cackling arounding you.\n\nWhat happened to the sharks? I have yet to see a shark in the sea. I don't feel threatened at all unless im freezing. Maybe even a prehistoric sea creature in the sea would be amazing.\n\nThe game doesn't have a leveling aspect. Meaning that you don't have to spend time to unlock blueprints, structures, or craftable items - I REALLY LOVE THIS.\n\nWith everything said, I can tell you (The Devs) really put alot of time and effort into this game. I am pleased with the product the way it is for $15.00 bucks. I am just hoping that the game is more customizable, and adds a variety of different crafting items... LIKE SHEILDS, house blueprints (like fireplaces) and chimneys, and the tribes need to be more unique and distinguishable.\n\nIn the current state im not 100% happy with the game, but I know its in Alpha and the Devs have plans. With that said im going to recommend this game to friends which I have already done.\n\nKudos to The Forest Creators and Devs","December 1, 2015","true","198.2"," 73 of 81 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","73","81","3","2"

You have to combat them.\n- The graphics look quite amazing.\n- And as this game still in Alpha version it has some bugs, but these devs works on it on coming updates quickly. Each update is full of cool things.\n\nThe Forest is one of the best open world / survival games that i have, i'm 100% sure to recommend this game for you if you want to have fun, or get some jumpscare.\n\nLooking forward to seeing where the game goes.\n\nIf you have enjoyed this review, please consider to follow our Curator page\nThis review was written for : The Panda's Corner","August 24, 2015","true","358.3"," 73 of 81 people (90%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","90","73","81","5","0"

It started off with many bugs, but has come a LONG way! The reasons I like this game:\n1) The AI: The AI is extremely impressive. The natives apparently climb up trees (I say apparently because I have not seen it myself), have hunting parties and scouts, are creepy and it's hard to predict their next move. E.G I encountered a group of 3 natives once, and they ran around me and made some form of a triangular shape around me. I went forward to one of them who backed away. Then I turned to another one who dashed forward, and instead of attacking me like I thought they would, they stopped closer to me, where I then attacked them. This time one of the others came at me from behind and the other made a load roar/shrieking sound alerting their friends of my presence. The hit from behind stunned my character and I was brought down by the natives.\n2) The Atmosphere: The game produces an eerie atmosphere, especially at night. When I hear a native laughing or screaming it sends me running to my base, or hiding from them wherever I can. Even when there are no natives around, I'm still at the ready, as I never know when I might come across a native hunting party.\n3) The Graphics: For an indie game the graphics are amazing! The light coming through the leaves is a nice touch. The graphics are stunning for an indie game. End of.\n4) The Gameplay: Now the most important part of the game. The gameplay. I do like good graphics but when there's good gameplay ,good graphics aren't NEEDED (THIS DOES NOT MEAN EITHER OR. I LIKE BOTH TOGETHER!). The game is a great mix of horror and survival, not making it like a horror game where you find a few cool items and nothing else, but at the same time not making it like a hardcore survival game with some enemies, hardly capable of stopping you. It balances the two just right. It is best to gather resources to build a base, and then look for resources to make more tools to aid my fight against the natives. There are still a few unique tools, that cannot be crafted, but I won't say what they are because you might  want to find out for yourself and get a great feeling when you find them. The natives are powerful, creepy and terrifying. Now scores!\nThe AI: I think they are a great enemy to have in the game, and this is in an alpha build! Some little glitches but overall they're great. 9.5/10\nThe Atmosphere: It's eerie and suits the game perfectly! I like a good atmosphere in a game, and The Forest really deserves a mention for the atmosphere it creates. Obviously co-op is a little less scary, but they can probably find a way to make it a creepy a singleplayer. 9/10\nThe Graphics: The graphics are brilliant for an indie game, but there is room for some improvement. Also playermodels are limited but who really cares what you look like in a game? 8.5/10\nThe Gameplay: The atmosphere and the gameplay work very well together. Obviously some room for improvement. 9/10\nOverall: I've had so much fun playing The Forest. I will have a lot more fun playing The Forest. The game is a great game overall. It has many elements to it, and will still get better... 9.5/10\nP.S I don't really write reviews for games, but The Forest definetely deserved one.","April 15","true","99.6"," 60 of 62 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","60","62","0","1"

Don't know how I survived, but I think I caught a glimpse of some strange tribal man before I lost consciousness. After I awoke I set to the business of building a shelter. Who knows how long it'll be till I'm rescued.\n\nDay 2: The tribals seem unfriendly. They showed up at the edge of my camp and eyed me while growling. They have clubs made out of human skulls and seem to be wearing teeth around their necks. I'm going to set up traps tonight.\n\nDay 3: Some random skinny tribal tried to eat me! He came into my camp giggling and laughing, I had to kill him with my axe! Its the first time I've killed anyone. I dumped his body outside of camp. I don't like to look at it.\n\nDay 4: The more healthy tribals tried to siege my camp today. Attacked me uprovoked but a few of my traps caught them. I killed the last man with a more modern axe I scavenged from a camp. They'll not catch me unprepared again. I'm not dying on this bloody island.\n\nDay 5: After seeing that they have some kind of displays made out of human remains, I decided to do the same. It was disguisting and unthinkable but maybe now they'll realize this place is dangerous and give me some peace. Got a little hunting done too.\n\nDay 6: I've been forced to build a wall around the perimeter. The healthier, smarter tribals seem to be warded off by my effigy but the starving ones are desperate enough to risk attacking. I'm going to fortify this place. I'm not becoming somone's lunch.\n\nDay 7: While checking my traps outside camp I was attacked by some kind of weird tribal leader with armor made out of human arms. He and his war party were no match for my defenses. I stuck their heads outside camp. Maybe now they'll learn what will happen should they come here again.\n\nDay 10: I've been a little too busy to write in my journal recently. I decided to take the fight to them and burned one of their camps with molotovs. A week ago, their screams would have bothered me. Now I was just relieved. Maybe now I'll be able to sleep at night.\n\nDay 11: A huge monster with a ton of legs busted in through my outer wall. Fortunately I'd stashed away some explosives, so that made quick work of it. On closer examination this thing seems to be made out of...people. Sewn or mutated together somehow. What is happening in this place!?\n\nDay 15: I cut off the heads of every tribal leader and put them on sticks. The sticks litter the outside of my camps. They'll regret the day they attacked my camps. I'll kill every last one of them if I have to. Even those mutant monsters will die.\n\nDay 20: I decided to start adding legs to the effigies. It seems to complete them a little more. Even the starving tribals are wary of attacking me now. They know that death has come among them.\n\nDay 30: I'd been so busy fighting off these tribals I didn't get a chance to hunt for days at a time. Haven't had time to write in my journal either. I'd walked into one of their camps I'd ransacked and saw an arm stick cooking on a spit. I was so hungry I took a bite. It wasn't too bad actually. I'm trying not to think about it.\n\nDay 45: I added arms and legs pointing in different directions to each of my effigies to spell out "YMCA". Nothing really else to do to pass my time here. When I was putting them up, I ate one of the legs. I was very hungry and none of my traps have been yielding any fruit, but these perfectly good limbs have been sitting here all this time...\n\nDay 62: I'm starting to like it here...All the limbs I can eat. Good sunshine by the beach. This island isn't so bad.\n\n10/10 would decend into madness again.","May 22","true","21.1"," 68 of 75 people (91%) found this review helpful 60 people found this review funny","91","68","75","60","11"

At first you might see a cannibal acting curiously around you; following you around, yet keeping a safe distance. After a little bit they will test you... Maybe hit you once, then run away to see how you react. Another interesting example, is when I encountered a couple of them surrounding a corpse. They seemed to be very protective of it, running in circles around it, as to say "This is mine. Stay away". After a little bit of playing around with them to see how they would react, I found myself surrounded by several more and mauled in a territorial dispute. Another awesome feature in the AI is that you can go many days laying low, without them even knowing of your presence, while if one spots you near your base, they will come back later in a larger group to investigate, marking the area with effigies to warn others of your presence.\n\nNight time is absolutely terrifying before you establish a solid defensive base.  Even then, while remaining undetected, there are warring tribes fighting amongst themselves throughout the night.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this game. If you are a fan of survival or horror games, you owe it to yourself to check this one out!","June 13, 2015","true","71.4"," 53 of 53 people (100%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","100","53","53","5","0"

I highly recommend playing it with a friend too although multiplayer can be somewhat laggy sometimes. Fantastic game with great devs who care about the game and haven't let up since release.\n\nNOVEMBER 1ST UPDATE: This game is what early access games should be. Since my last update they have piled on gigabites of patches and the game is fully playable and optimised. I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys survival games, but beware, do not expect to survive long. This game is hard and if you don't play smart, you will die within the first day. I'd now give the game a 8.5/10.\n\nJUNE 16TH UPDATE: The devs for the game just optimised the absolute crap out of this game. I have gone from getting 15 fps on maximum graphics to a steady 50 fps on maximum. Before the game was terribly optimised and would lag, even on the lowest settings, now it feels literally like it looks in the trailer! Fantastic job dev team! You guys are awesome!\n\n\nORIGINAL RELEASE REVIEW: After playing 10 hours of this game, I can safely say that this is going to be one of the best survival games you could likely ever ask for. It is missing a lot of things and game isn't really stable right now, but this game is going to be amazing, mark my words. If you want to get in early, spend the 15 dollars to help the devs because it's going to be between 30-45 dollars when it is released.\n\nIf you're after a Minecraft/Rust/DayZ experience with a side of horror, you will enjoy this when it's finished I guarantee.\n\nI'd give this game a 7/10 as of the very first release. I've been following the 4 man dev team for The Forest for nearly 2 years now and I honestly expect great things from this game.","May 30, 2014","true","17.6"," 110 of 139 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","110","139","0","5"

Had to start over several times and got so annoyed I've stopped playing.\n- The enemies are very easy to kill, not scary at all, and far and few between. Not at all like the trailer and getting attacked is a rarity. Making setting traps feel useless.\n- It's basis of survival is very easy to achieve. Took me about 3-4 hours to have a log cabin, a ♥♥♥♥ ton of traps, wood/sticks stockpiled, and a wall all around my area. I think I was attacked maybe twice over the entire time and it was by singular enemies.\n- Zero objectives. The intro makes it out like you're gonna try and find your child while fending off this enemy horde and trying to survive on this remote island but there's literally nothing to do. I got so bored that I explored the entire island, collected all the pages of my survival book, attacked large mobs of the weird people with only an axe and lived.\n- Physics are off. I'll walk into a random zombie encampment and the tables and chairs will randomly shoot straight into the air. When I chop down trees the logs explode and I'll have to chase them down.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nIf you got the money and the patience, go ahead and buy it; even if you don't plan on installing it for awhile. It's got a lot right going for it. A few bugs that are easy to work out and some difficulty/objective issues to smooth out but other than that it's a great game for being in just alpha. The developers give frequent updates on the game that make it easy to follow even if you don't decide to install it just yet. I feel like my money is actually going toward a great project with this game instead of others I've invested in that turned crap (Rust, Nether, etc.)","October 4, 2014","true","31.6"," 71 of 82 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","71","82","0","3"

The   hit detection seems to be somewhat lacking on the smaller objects and there is a large ammount of bugs which is to be expected for a game in it's alpha.  At this time the map is not complete and i do admit feels rather small once explored which takes maybe an hour, this would not be so much of an issue for me if they made these areas less accessible ( For example walking into a cave which seems to go on forever only to find it leads nowhere only to find yourself falling through the map.) Apart from this and some rather incomplete structures and tools the creation seems rather fluid so far.\n\nMusic\nThe music is amazing, it really feels like you are there hearing what the player hears, the effects all sound really solid and realistic, and the screams from the Cannibals are just chilling. It makes for some really intense moments.\nGameplay\nThe forest is a horror survival game wherein you are crashed on an island inhabited by Cannibles and mutants, the key is to well ...survive. You will have to scavenge around the map for crafting materials where you can then proceed to build a range of shelters, traps and storage Etc. The building system is really nice and the structures look good in environment, (give or take a couple).  There are a variety of supplies and debris from previous inhabitants and the plane crash scattered around the island generally containing crucial items for you. The one thing I dislike about this is the lack of variety, once found there is no challenge to find the items again.\n\nThe Cannibals have scattered villages strewn across the island, with totems and effigies marking patrol routes, I personally found the Ai really good in this game, they will circle you; retreat; patrol; and even give the illusion of planning attacks. They are one of the best features of the game and hopefully more will be added to the villages as they are really empty right now and some future developement could prove very interesting.\n\nWhen killed you will be transported to a cave system which can sometimes be infested with Cannibals or mutants which seem to only exist in the caves for now. It's a nice mechanic, like a second chance to escape and survive without losing straightaway, the notion being that after being beaten you were dragged into the Cannibals "nest". The only problem I have currently is that the cave systems all look incredibly similar and lots do not have a clear exit. (Which may be interpreted as a part second chance) But personally I found it downright frustrating at times.\n\nMulitplayer\nRecently added was a multiplayer feature, really nice addition but feels badly incomplete, player models look clunky and animation is not done well as of yet. No real objective means that there can be a lack of things to do, and too many players makes the game way too easy. Nice is the fact that a large ammount of players can join a single server, although brought down by the small map size.\n\nConclusion\nGraphics 8.5/10 - Looks amazing but Areas not complete, or textures too repetitive.\nMusic 8/10 - Really immersive and rich sounds, unfortunately lacks variety after a while.\nGameplay 6.5/10  - Very nice Ai , If you build away from the designated patrol areas you simply won't see any cannibals, Some bugs with combat and death\nMultiplayer 5/10 - Nice that it has been added, sorely lacking in completion, models are glitchy and look bad, game does not incorporate for different levels of people\n\nThanks for reading\nHope it helped, If i missed anything or if you don't agree on anything please feel free to let me know\n\n","March 22, 2015","true","46.7"," 81 of 98 people (83%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","83","81","98","14","1"

The game has terrifying moments from both jumpscares and just gritty, stark atmosphere. I can't play this game alone, only co-op. I would never leave camp.\n\nThey come for you so fast. Small groups at first, but then they learn that you are building and advancing. They start to come in larger groups and mutated versions that will haunt your dreams.\n\nSome improvements I wish to see:\n\n*Balancing of some of the sounds (sometimes they are too loud and the ones that are too loud can't be heard when they should be audible).\n\n*Less AI dumbness of walking into the fire (sometimes its useful, but othertimes you just run around a fire until they eventually touch it and burn).\n\n*The bow and arrow is inaccurate and hitboxes on the mutants are difficult to hit when you know you are hitting them. (Add some headshots).\n\n*Colors/textures on Effigies and stronger mutants (they look like blobs, still terrifying, but could use some features).\n\n*Exploded gibs/limbs are silly random looking polygons of the tone of flesh.\n\n*There are random pockets of "Air" underwater that you can stand in and it is difficult to traverse when it acts as though you are not underwater until you can magically find the water again.\n\n*Some slips of the map where you can fall through, namely, when you go into the Sinkhole on the ledge, you pass the little camp and go to the other end, if you attempt to traverse the ring, you will fall through, thus resulting in the impossible retrieval of your backpack.\n\n*Random character skins.\n\n*When you pick up the mutants, they change to default model.\n\n*When you are bleeding out, the breathing sound fx sounds like a woman (old audio I believe).\n\n*The islands seem useless, thus the rafts seem useless. The Islands should have something lol\n\n*I hate to say this: I can't wait to see flopping wangs when the nekkid mutants are running at you. It will add to both comedy and horror. I would certainly run in terror.\n\n\nI am better at nitpicking negatives than telling the Pros: but to summarize, it has been one of the best developed games out there. The Inventory is awesome. The graphics are pretty. The world is explorable and there aren't many crashes anymore. The Co-Op works and is fully functional. You can TRADE items now instead of dropping stuff. Caves are terrifying and a unique experience that haven't been introduced successfully by other games yet.\n\nIt's dark and terrifying. It is unfair and challenging. It is fun.","January 24","true","35.2"," 59 of 65 people (91%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","91","59","65","20","0"

I remeber vividly looking up to see a large, nude man. I could almost hear him whisper "Prepare Uranus" when, much to my dismay, he instead took my son, Coral. I then proceeded to rant random lines from "Taken" until I once again blacked out. I woke up in my plane and stepped outside, only to see a thousandish lizards staring at me. I screamed into the air "ITS OVER 9000" and shreked them easily. I was about to apply lotion to there anal cavity when I heard the scream of smeegle. I turned around in time to see a naked she-gollum assault me with her claws. I was dragged away by two men, only to wake up in a cave. In that cave, I found a giant creature made almost entirely out of legs. I named him Legman-Magee and ordered him tofollow me around. As I was exploring the cavern I turned around to see Legman-Magee kick me in the face with the force of a million legs.

Never been so scared by a game, or movie for that mather. Slowly I learned how to survive the first nights and how to build a quite decent life. This is a beautiful and fun game and all other survival games should learn from it! It got an unique feel to it that is hard to put in words.\n\nOver time there has been added alot more features, heck when I first bought this game you could only build a basic shelter and firepit. And the intromovie was just a demonstration with bad graphics and animations. But the developers have really made progress and added alot of content since then! I'm really excited for the future!\n\nI have to admit I don't play it very often and when I do it's in short bursts(its been more than the 6.3 hours that steam is showing tho).

The survival genre is one of my faveorite and The Forest did its self justice. It incorporates crafting systems, fighting, and exploring in such inventive ways. It has many versitile facets that lets the user customize their experience and play. As it goes with open world games this one is great. It lets you chop down almost any tree in the game, hunt a varity of animals (Lizards, Rabits, Fish), and build housing. With the new release of co-op play people can combined survival ideas with friends and pull the game to new heights. The Forest is a game i would recomend highly to anyone who wants a challenge, likes the suvival and horror genre, and anyone who wants to have fun. I Would rate this game 9/10. Despite its many key facts for being a great game there is some room for improvement. I hope for the future release of things such as a customizable character, more buildables, a large map and so on. The Forest is coming up on its beta release and i hope to see many new assets factored into the game and in the future. With time The Forest Will only get beter and better.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kwonkickerofficial/recommended/242760/","kwonkickerofficial","Kwonkicker","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kwonkickerofficial/","16 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThe Good (as of v14):\n- Open World, Semi-Sandbox\n- Full survival features: thirst, hunger, hypothermia, sleep, infection, etc\n- In depth crafting: trees can be cut down, plants harvested, animals hunted, weapons ugraded. etc\n- Homebase: Can build a variety of structures, including a home/fort\n- Highly intelligent enemy AI\n- Beautiful Graphics\n- Addictive and engaging\n\nThe Bad:\n- No crosshair.  This makes aiming with projectile weapons extremely difficult.  This is compounded by the fact that obtaining the materials to craft/find said projectile weapons is time consuming and arduous enough on its own.  So you can imagine the irritation one gets when you think you are throwing a molotov or shooting a bow/fare at the enemy, but instead it veers off in a completely different direction.\nSuggested solution:  Have a crosshair appear as soon as a projectile weapon is equiped.  Or, at the very least, allow a crosshair to be toggled on or off in the options menu.\n\n- Lack of motivation to keep surviving.  Reason 1, no quests or direction.  There needs to be a driving force behind the survival.  Otherwise once you've built a fort and explored and collected everything (which isnt much) the game is simply, eat - drink - sleep - mess with cannibals - repeat.  Which get boring fast.   Reason 2, very little possible items to find.  There needs to be at least 4 or 5 times more variety of items to find/craft and weapons to be found.  If there is no story to drive me to the play the game, then there needs to be the promise of an abundace of rare, hidden loot to drive me to keep exploring and surviving against the elements and cannibals.  Right now, there is simply a miniscule amount of this.  There are literally only 2 clubs, 3 axes (which are very weak against enemies, oddly enough), a stick, a rock, a weak sauce stick-spear, a molotov, weak-sauce bow, and flare gun.  And the melee weapons all do very similar damage amounts.  Also, like I mentioned before, the projectile weapons are almost impossible to use without a crosshair.\n\n- The island is not large enough.  We either need an island about 3 or 4 times larger, or multiple islands/areas we can explore.  Another solution would be to have the island seed be completely randomly generated on each new game.  Not just have the pieces of it be re-arranged each time you start a new game (like it is now).\n\n- The cannibals take WAY TOO MANY HITS to kill.  If realism is what they are going for, I shouldn't have to hit a cannibal in the head with a hand axe over 8 times to kill it.  The cannibals should go down with half the hits it currently takes.  Conversely, if it takes me 8 hits to kill an unarmored cannibal with a hand axe, then why does it take a cannibal only 2 or 3 hits with their club (or just 3 or 4 with their bare hands) to kill an unarmored player?  That makes no sense.\n\n- There are far too many bugs with the traps you can make.  Particularly the noose trap and birthday trap.  Cannibals who get caught in the noose bug out and spin in giant loops around the map.  And cannibals that get stuck in the birthday trap appear to be dead, but when you reset the trap and try to retrieve the corpse, they either come back to life, or change into a completely different cannibal and start attacking you.\n\nFinal thoughts:\nI completely recommened this game as a low cost early access title.  You'll get a good 10-20 hours out of it until you run out of stuff to do.  However, I cannot justify paying any more for it at the time of its release unless they add much more content and address some of the issues I mentioned.  But, if they do fix what I mentioned, this game has the potential to rival the popularity of Skyrim/Minecraft.","March 17, 2015","true","121.8"," 55 of 60 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","55","60","3","2"

I could list a wide variety of potential gliches but they are constantly being fixed, and being created; and everyone exsperiences different ones. Some exsperience near none (Like me, thus all reviews are bias as a result)\n- Enemys, despite being mutated humans, they have a strong resistance to weapons in a way that makes little to no sense.(Large no longer huminode mutants exlcuded, those things are hulks of flesh amd should be a threat)\n- Some crafted items make littles sense in the real world (Such as the timed bomb, Upgraded spear using bone and not stone)\n- The canibals will sometimes glich out after hiting traps and permantly be gliched.\n- It is normaly required for you to start over after each update, this happens (on adverage every ten days)\n- Animals have no sense of self preservation. (I watched bird after bird fly into my bonfire)\n- The terrain has a few graphical gliches (Ground is invisible in some places, though very minor in size)\n- The plane crash (starting area) use to be random, now its not.\n- Few feet equals death while jumping\n\n\nTo clarify, this game is still IN DEVELOPMENT and I can't stress that enough.

Even with the limited crafting recipes implemented so far, there is still a lot of creative ways to defend yourself and survive. Exploration is also very rewarding, both in the pretty landscapes you can see and in the rare/useful items you can stumble across. Visually, it is a very nice looking, atmospheric game. The multiplayer is also coming along quite well, although it is still noticably unfinished.

Soon you realize you're on an island in nowhere. Unlike the overestimated tv series, TheForest simply does everything well by letting U decide over your own stranded survival story and not some lazy story writers. Especially for such an early stage (Alpha v.0.09) TheForest offers already a good amount of craftable&buildable stuff, for a start. That's why I write this review but now. At this current stage I finally can recommend it - to people who don't bother to get an unfinished game! You can easily have fun for at least 10 - 20hrs, additionally about every month a new update comes out (fixes+new stuff). Latest update introduced online 2player coop...

Even FULL price like 50€ or so.\nSure, there are still some minor alpha bugs, but I've honestly seen released games (at 50€) that had way more problems! And nothing game breaking here, mostly glitches, lighting or stuff that still has to be added.\n\nPros / What I like/love about The Forest:\n\n- Freedom! This really feels like an open world in which YOU decide what to do.\n- Adventure! Really feels like you're out there, lost in the wilderness, trying to make it through the nights and building shelters, collecting rain water, hunting small animals, exploring, washing off the blood/dirt to avoid infections etc.\n- Beauty of nature! I didn't expect it at first, but the game looks awesome! Finally we have a "real" forest that is dense, thick, populated, immersive, green, overgrown, realistic, scary and dark at night etc.\n- Gameplay! It's smooth and feels good! Really fun to play and good accessibility!\n- Coop and Single Player! This game and the terror of being lost and alone may work best at Single Player, but I LOVE to have the option to play with my friends!\n- Sense of achievement: Making it through the nights and slowly building an encampment, adding your little habitable space to that harsh forest is great fun. Really feels like that's your part of the woods now, your hunting grounds! But still scary at night sometimes! ;)\n- Immersion! It's like I'm really out there on an adventure in the wilderness. This game must be great with Oculus Rift or sth. similar! :)\n- Details: You can feel Endnight's love for details when you chop down a tree and it really falls and isn't just added to your inventory or when you open said inventory and your backpack is spread out on a blanket on the ground in front of you etc.\n\nCons:\nMight become too easy over time? Don't know but it doesn't feel as brutal as other survival games (just played The Long Dark e.g., which isn't nearly as much fun, but way more challenging). For some people this may not be a Con but a Pro, but it feels a bit too easy too get food, potable water, to deal with the cold etc. I'll have to keep an eye on that. On the other hand this increases accessibility and lowers your frustration levels ;)\n\nAlright, I'll add more to this review later on. Check it out yourself, it's a great game already with more features being added on a regular basis! Unbelievable that this is done by only 4 people... Very often feels like an AAA-title.\n\nDefinitely recommended!\nThis is the survival / building / open world game I've been waiting for! :)","March 2, 2015","true","18.2"," 45 of 49 people (92%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","92","45","49","5","0"

My first try I looted the luggage from the airplane I was on that crashed.  I encountered a primitive that quickly ran off.  I began gathering lumber to try to make a shelter, however, I noticed another primitive.  This made me cautious so I became hyper vigilant, always looking over my shoulder.  The next thing I knew there was some sort of hunting party of primitives chasing after me.  I ran for a while until I found a beach.  Out in the ocean there was a boat.  I was starving so I figured I'd see if maybe there was some food.  What I found were sharks.  They ate me.  My next try I gathered supplies again from the wrecked aircraft and then took off.  I ran for a while until I found a small island out in the middle of a lake.  I set up camp there and painstakingly constructed a shelter while swimming to and fro from the island to the shore to gather lumber.  There's blueberries on the island so that's what I've been eating.  I seem to be outside of the primitives' territory.  For now, I'll stay on Blueberry Island until I figure what I should do next.  However, the clear and present threat of death persists.  It's only a waiting game now...","October 6, 2014","true","6.3"," 54 of 64 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","54","64","0","0"

I cannot recall the last time I was so excited to purchase a PC title. $15 for this beautiful game? How could I not buy it? 90% rating on Steam? How could I not buy it? Recently added multiplayer mode? How could I not buy it? An open world game with survival and horror elements? That's right up my alley! Unfortunately sometimes we as humans become enamored with items that are hyped and advertised heavily. Often times we might even suffer from buyer's remorse. I'm not going to bash the developers or "trash this game." I just want to throw out my honest ideas and feelings about this game.\n\nThe game really is visually stunning. I can only think of a handful of EA games that can compare. Shader details are good and the attention to detail is extremely impressive. Game mechanics are buttery smooth and make for an enjoyable gameplay experience. Interacting with objects is quite nice and just in general has a realistic feel to it. Optimization (for me anyway) is quite good. I get decent framerate while having the game on max settings. No one is going to dispute the graphics, mechanics or optimization for this game.\n\nBut can a game thrive simply by giving you solid graphics, mechanics and optimization? Unfortunately for The Forest, it just doesn't have a whole lot more to offer. Crafting and gathering gets repetitive quite fast and the balance of thirst/hunger is just bad. I feel like my player is constantly hungry or thirsty or just doesn't have any stamina left despite eating large quantities of food. The balance of combat is also leaves a lot to be desired. Hitting a mutant can take 10, 11, or 12 times just to kill it. I'm hit 3 or 4 times and I'm dead. It's so unbalanced and needs a whole makeover IMHO. Speaking of mutants, there are just so many of them it gets overly frustrating trying to battle 5 or 6 at a time. It just really takes away from the game knowing you have zero chance of surviving against that many mutants. My biggest problem with the game is that it just lacks content, direction, creativity and variety. This game has been out for just over 18 months and while updates are released, they seem to be for only minor things (bugs and hot fixes). There doesn't seem to be any sense of urgency from the devs for map expansion, character customization, new weapons/tools, missions, enemies, or the like. The game just feels bland, boring and seriously lacking in creativity. That's the most frustrating thing to me. They have this beautiful game but they just don't seem to know what to do next. I've only played for ~3 hours and I'm pretty certain I've done everything there is to do in this game. This shouldn't happen IMHO. Give us more to do, give us customization, give us a sense of purpose, give us more to explore, give us more crafting and base building options. Keep the players more interested and engaged with the game. Adding more content and a reason to keep playing will ultimately make or break this game. I'm not recommending The Forest in its current state, but I would be more than happy to change my tune if and when the ball gets rolling on the creative end of things.\n\nI will definitely appreciate the likes. If you disagree with me, please comment and tell me why. I'm an adult and have no problem having civil conversations. I feel like thumbing my review down and explaining why could actually be helpful in the overall development of this game moving forward.

I thought to myself, "This is going to be great! I loved this game when it first came out, and now, I'm going to love it more!", I was right in thinking that, but there is a darker side to this tale.\n\nAt first, everything was smooth. I did my usual method of surviving by first off, looting everything I could from the crashed plane and the luggage around it. Then I did some recon, working out if there were any cannibal camps nearby and locating a good spot for my own camp site. I found a good spot, near the beach so there was fish nearby and also the abandoned boat. I was lucky that I came across some rope so soon, so I set up some molotov tripwires around my camp, built a fire pit and a sleeping point.\n\nAll was good, I was avoiding the cannibals just fine. I was spotting them off in the distance every now and then while I was hunting for food, but they never seemed to come too close to my camp. At least, until one day.\n\nI was skimming along the beach, killing lizards for their skin and meat, and as I made my way back to my camp, I heard a blood chilling god awful screech. imagine a pig cross bred with a cat that had just been stabbed by a blade covered in lemon juice, that's the kind of scream it was. Saying it made me jump would be an extremely light way to put it!\n\nAnd of course, I soon found what made the scream. Near my camp, sitting on a rock and just studying my home was a cannibal scout leader. I could tell since he was decorated with arms galore! At this point, a staring contest began. We both just watched each other, and I can't lie, I was terrified that he was going to attack. But then I realized something! He was alone. I made sure, looking around carefully to see if there was any others. There wasn't, so I made the first move! I struck him, whacking him with my hand made axe until he was lying on the ground in agony, breathing heavily. Then, I took out a rock, stood over him and cracked his skull in until he was dead.\n\nDoing this, I did feel a bit sick since I had just caved in a living things face with a rock, but I was safe. He hadn't alerted other cannibals to my campsite, so I felt relaxed at least. In case this happened again though, I cut up the cannibals body, taking his head and sticking it on a spike as a warning to any others that may come across my camp. I figured that should ward them off if any come too close again.\n\nI think I made a huge mistake... That night, I was sleeping, my characters sanity having gone down a little from when I cut up that corpse. But as I rested, expecting to wake up the following morning, I was stunned to find myself waking up inthe middle of the night. "What the... Why isn't the sun up?!" is what I first said. And then I remembered.\n\nYou can't sleep if there's an enemy nearby...\n\nWhen I realized this, I dropped a brick in my underwear... The first thing I did was crouch, staying in some bushes right near my bed, looking around constantly. What was worse, the only light was the moon, since lighting a fire at night is one BAD idea if there's something nearby. I knew I couldn't do anything to draw attention, and I knew something was out there.\n\nI was constantly looking around, hearing twigs snapping, bushes rustling, things moving all around my camp, all the time I was just constantly whispering, "What the fu*k?!" over and over. Every now and then, I could see a glance of something moving around the trees. My blood pressure must of been crazy high at this point, but it was about to get a lot higher...\n\nOut of no where, like something from a nightmare, another monstrous scream rang out! It was so sudden and so terrifying that I actually screamed myself. Not like a man, either. I screamed like a little girl and yanked my headphones off, shaking my head going "No, no, no, no, nope, nope, nope, nope!" I closed my eyes, breathing and panting heavily, my hands were shaking on my keyboard and mouse...\n\nWhatever kind of cannibal was out there, it was close. That I knew. And the worst part was, I couldn't sleep until it was gone. So... I put my headphones back on, determined to be as brave as I could and I statyed where I was, hidden in some bushes, shaking like a nervous wreck as I looked around constantly in a panicked state. You have no idea how terrifying it is to have no light, everything around you completely darkened, making it so hard to see any little thing, and all the time, you hear things moving around you and you have no idea if it was a raccoon or something that could kill you...\n\nI don't know how long it took, but when the sun finally came up, I breathed a sigh of relief and gave thanks to the gods as my panting finally stopped. I was covered in sweat! Still shaking! And I looked around my camp, making whatever was out there in the night was gone. It was, so I saved my game and quit to windows until I'm next feeling brave enough to venture into The Forest.\n\nAs a man in my 20's and a huge fan of horror, having loved the genre for over 10 years, I'm used to all sorts of things and this isn't a boast when I say this, but I am extremely hard to scare.\n\nHowever, this game, The Forest? It's the first thing in years to make me sream like a little girl. Impressive!\n\n10/10 would make my underwear brown again.\n\nAnd I'm so buying this game when it comes out on PS4 as well!","January 22","true","28.3"," 42 of 47 people (89%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","89","42","47","30","0"

I grab all i can and run in to the woods, the lanescape is so full of wildlife, but i hear a strange sound to my right so i decide to to investigate. When what evers making the noise comes into sight through the tree line i can see 3 tribesman all crouched in a circle, i choose to push forward to get a better look. I am as close as i can get and i am shocked, the 3 tribesman are EATING SOMEONE. Theres another close to them with a skull mounted on a stick above his head just watching, i think he's the captin. I'd better leave, im in no position to fight 4 men with just a axe.\n\nNight has fallen and i have almost contructed a basic shelter, it's starting to rain I should build a fire to cook the meat i've hunted. i continue to chop wood when i hear a new strange sound behind me, I turn instantly to check it out and theres a tribesman just stood there. Watching me, he says nothing he does nothing we stand for about a minute staring at each other locked in this gaze. Suddenly he howls turns and runs, i pick up leaves to wipe my ♥♥♥♥ (♥♥♥♥ myself).\n\nDay - 2\n\nSince i was discovered theres been alot more patrols around my camp it's becoming increasinly hard to gather precious resources, but i press on starting to see if i can start on a cabin when i hear a scream in the distance. It sounds like a womens in trouble, against my better judgement i go to seek out the source of this skin scrawling screech. I heard it again i am getting closer, i come to a clearing and decide to duck down behind the tree's to check the area out. I can see a total of 6 tribesman 4 in a pack and 2 wandering (appeared to be anyway), when all of a sudden i see the captin arch his back and let out a bellowing scream (the same i heard that made me investigate). ♥♥♥♥ it's a trap! I turn to escape before i am seen but my fears have already been realised, theres a tribes-woman behind me, god knows how long she was there but as soon as she knows i've seen her she turns and runs. I run in the oposite direction but it's to late, I'm being hunted! I take a breather to eat to recover stamina and i have a quick look to see if their still on my trail but i can't see much. I can see a single light in the distance well out of reach, it's the captin looking for me then all of a sudden i hear a loud THUD. I frantically turn in every direction to see what it was but theres nothing there...\n\nHOLY ♥♥♥♥ THEIR IN THE TREE'S\n\n3 men drop down around me and instantly signal the captin, theres no more running it's now or never. we all start hacking at each other franticly, i need to drop one before the captin closes in. I manage to kill one and wound another, but before i could finish him a tribes-woman appeared from the bushes to drag him away. I still have two of these ♥♥♥♥ers trying to cave my head in i can't afford to turn my back to chase, I'm about to die, the captin is unscathed and the grunt is so close to death when i knock him down. I instantly raise my axe when (CRUNCH) i am dead.\n\nDay - ???\n\nI awake in a cave in complete darkness, i use my lighter to check where i am when to my horror i discover i am in some sort of meat gathering chamber. Theres bodies handing from the ceiling everywhere, atleast 40 all dismembered differently. The floor is littered with the body parts of previous victims, How long have they been here? There wasn't many people on the plane, no where near enough for this. I check my inventory and to my supprise i still have all my gear not that i have much that can help. It's to quiet nothing but the sound of water drops, after a quick search i find the exit and a flare gun THIS SHOULD HELP! Ii have to crouch low to leave this cave and follow this route. It's never ending cave expansion after expansion limbs after limbs when will this end! I start to hear a new a very ♥♥♥♥ing freaky sound from the next opening, Luckily theres ambeinent light coming from a pool of water so i switch my light off. I can see something in the distance and it's big, I tread closer at a snails pace around the slight corner to get a better look only to find theres another 2 meteres away.\n\nI am unsure if they can see me or let alone at all so i decide to get the ♥♥♥♥ outta dodge and make a dash for the exit, i can see light and i've been going through room after room i have to be close to the surface! I make it to the next section without them noticing but it's not getting any better. the light turned out to be a fire, a fire being used be at least 12 of the grunts and women. Bricks were ♥♥♥♥. I make a dash for the exit (or atleast what appeared to be) OH MY GOD as i run crouch run through the space to escape i notice teeth dangling from strings. I don't have time to look i have to get out and now, as i am escaping i come into more rooms like the last filled with more grunts. it feels like im being chased by the entire tribe and i dare not look back. I finally come to the surface, it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ down with rain and pitch black i can use this to my advantage and escape through the tree line stopping for nothing.\n\nI escaped with my life for now....\n\n10/10 i know this is not a review but i wanted to share my first experience with the game and i am so impressed.\n\n£10.99 well spent i look forward to content updates","May 31, 2014","true","6.6"," 40 of 44 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","40","44","0","1"

I decide to push the raft along and find a more suitable beach for life. I dock my raft in a little pond of invisible water right by the shore. I immediately place a large house. It requires 82 logs. I slave away until night time lumberjacking my hands off. After I put the last log I had into the house, I still had 12 logs left to collect. Then it dawned on me. I had no shelter made. I hastily put together a ramshackle standing fire and huddled by it as the natives gathered closer. Eventually the fire died as did I. By now, I was just so done.

You guys have been one of the very few developers out there with a true vision to create the best product u can with what u have and not run away with the money, HUGE KUDOS for that!!!\n\nI've been following the development of this game since months before steam release last year and it was during a time when multiple survival genres were coming out ( Stomping Land to name one, 7 Days to Die another ) and the developers behind 'The Forest' have truly been honest and genuine with how the development has gone. Frequent and good updates that improve the game every so slightly but enough for the everyday gamer like myself to notice a clear difference.\n\nI've played as of today roughly 40hrs and enjoyed every minute of it. To first load the game without knowing what the night brings is terrifying and seeing how the world interacts  is brilliant. I've probably spent a total of 10 hrs just walking through "The Forest" and just been amazed at how incredible it looks, it's truly one of a kind sensation to see how birds interact with the player and really, how the world interacts with you. This is a must have for any survival genre fans out there as this is by far, the BEST survival out there, and it's still in ALPHA!\n\nBest game of my life, hands down. Very much worth the moneyz!!!","April 30, 2015","true","41.2"," 39 of 43 people (91%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","91","39","43","6","0"

Unlike most early access game, the devs work around the clock to find and fix new bugs, review consumer feedback, implement new features into the game, and generally improve the game in each and every update that they release. The major updates are usually released once every month, while smaller updates (bugfixes) are usually released about 2-4 times a month.\nThere is a ton to do in this game. The building takes such a long time, but it's because of this long arduous process that when it's finally done it's all the more rewarding. The buildings look practical; like something that you could, and would actually build in the wilderness.\nNow on to gameplay. The game feels very relaxing at first. The sound of the forest will build up a false sense of security. It's for this reason that the horror aspect is so effective. When I say horror I mean horror. This game will make you afraid of the night, and when you do finally build that fortress you won't want to leave it. The combat is rough, but it's not impossible to take on 3 mutants and survive leaving all of them dead. With the right tactics you can bring the fight to them. The resource gathering is probably the most unique of any game; very realistic and enthrolling. The inventory system works great too, and you can find everything you have in the first glance. The crafting aspect of the game is simple too, but it feels like something that could be done in real life with the same ingredients.\nDon't let the system requirements dissuade you either. I play this on my laptop when I'm on vacation. My laptop has 4 GBs of RAM, and no graphics card. I set all the settings on the lowest I can, and still play the game. It doesn't look very good after that, but it's still a fun game to play.\nIn short, this game is fun, arduous, unforgiving, and rewarding. It stands out among the many titles being released these days. It's a shiny diamond in a bed of coal, and it's well worth 15 dollars US. Buy this game. You won't regret it.\n\nJust want to add even more to this review. The Dev's are awesome. They've added loads of new content and fixed tons of bugs since the release of this game. It's 100x better now since I upgraded my GPU. It's a truly beautiful game.\n\nIt's also truly terrifying if you don't build a base. If you want pure horror, just run around in the woods and scavenge for food. Christ, the mutants are probably the scariest thing I've ever encountered. You never quite know when they are there, and you want to stay out of the woods, but you know you need to go in for food/supplies, and that's when they get you. The weakest ones, the starving mutants, are definitely the scariest. They are skinny and bloody, run at you really quickly, and overall just make you crap your pants. Even worse, there are ambient sounds in the woods now that sound like leaves/branches falling, so it's even harder to tell when they are running up behind you. I don't think i've ever been so terrified while playing a game before. It's not even the mutants most of the time, it's the idea that they are lurking behind me.","December 1, 2014","true","82.7"," 34 of 35 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","34","35","0","2"

But it's beautiful and expansion of freedom makes it very interesting. Although it's just one map, it could be very interesting if it was open world-like or randomly generated terrain. Im not implying that it needs to be like that. Bu the game already has it's own freedom and limits. Now, about the horror. It genuinely had my friends and I screaming and questioning the giant baby-like monster and the four legged creature with like, twelve arms. The sounds and audio is crisp.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/antilucid/recommended/242760/","antilucid","antilucid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/antilucid/","2014 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSurvival games have become the hottest genre as of late. It does not matter if you are trying to survive alone against the wilderness, zombies, or other players. Survival will often make you do things you might not. This game is no exception.\n\nYou are sitting next to a window on an airplane with a little boy holding your arm. You are given little clue as to who you are or who he is before the front of the airplane is ripped off and you are falling fast to the Earth below. Upon landing, you see a native (given the number of body parts on the island, I would say cannibal) take the little boy and leave. As you get up, you have little time to gather what you can scavenge around you before others are sure to come. And come they will.\n\nStarting off with only rocks and sticks, I grab a huge rock and began to bust open luggage, managing to find some rations and supplies. As I wandered, I could find other make shift camps but no one around, at least no one I wanted to bother with...yet. After starting a fire to cook a rabbit (seagulls, turtles, and other animals can be killed), nightfall began to set in. I had began to make a shelter but lacked logs to complete it. Then came flashlights waving around in the dark.\n\nI was not ready for a confrontation yet so I ran and began to explore. The island I landed on had caves to explore, water all around, another another island nearby with snowcapped mountains. Upon realizing I lacked any means to get logs for my shelter, I doubled back to where the flashlights had been to find my hunters were still near by. Armed with a makeshift spear, I began to attack them, killing two before the lights out.\n\nI awoke to a macabre horror. I was trapped in a dark cave, half filled with water, with bodies hanging from the ceiling all around me. With a lighter that constantly had to get lit (water will do that to it), I found a lot more supplies along with an axe, and a few other weapons. I found this helped my struggle quite a bit as I was able to escape underground after awhile, surfacing at last the claustrophobic tunnels.\n\nFresh air and daylight, my new day began with heading back towards my shelter I was trying to build. I had started it on top of a cliff with a giant tree nearby, making it easy for me to find when needed. I learned my new found weapon doubled as a means to chop down trees to help me finish my shelter. Before I could finish, another group of cannibals found me. This time, I did not wake up in a cave. This time, it was the end.\n\nWith this being an alpha build, it is easy to pass off graphical glitches (water in the game often looks off and broken when in it). I once had a turtle I could not smash with my rock and when viewing my inventory, the turtles image never left my screen, covering up what it was I was trying to see. The game sounded authentic once on the ground but I had hoped for more of a build up leading to the crash (the front of the airplane disappeared without a sound and I never once heard the boy next to me utter a sound). The natives are incredibly quiet and I had expected to be able to hear them once they got close, but this was not the case. Not even when I was attacking them did I hear them utter a grunt. I had one guy I beat on repeatedly and he eventually ran away despite the number of times I impaled him with my spear but the next guy went down with just a few thrusts.\n\nThe game is very intuitive in that it was easy to learn how to use what was around me very quickly. On screen prompts when seeing berries to eat, supplies to scavenge, or and how to duck were very helpful. Despite not being very good at survival games, I found what I discovered in this game to very enjoyable, even at this early of release. I definitely look forward to seeing what the developers have in store and the game has a handy count down on the main menu to let you know when to expect the next update. And expect I shall. I look forward to my next trip to The Forest as I learn from my mistakes and work on my survival skills(Tip: don't build your shelter too far away from logs you will need to cut down, if you can find an axe that is).","June 4, 2014","true","1.2"," 42 of 49 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","42","49","0","3"

(if you want to avoid it i recommend to save after every 15minutes and if somebody destorys your base you can always leave immediately and host server again) But if you meet nice people you can have a lot of fun.\n\n• Singleplayer is pretty much same as multiplayer exept you play it alone(NO $HIT Sherlock) and you don't have to worry about toxic or salty people. There isn't really a story, ok there is BUT basically you have to find Timmy but you can't find Timmy...wierd, isn't it? It's unknown that is he alive or not, all what we know is that:\n1. In the v0.02 changelog posted on June 15, 2014, the developers mentioned the child's name: Timmy.\n2.

Your fellow passangers, who by judging from the contents of their suitcases were tennis players that were hopped up on prescription drugs.  You obviously were not one of them given how you whine and complain about being cold and wet hungry and thirsty and tired all the time.  It's ironic that you were the one who survived.  The island itself is beautiful and you can choose to live in the snow capped mountains or a tropical beach and it's not without its cast of colorful characters- mainly cannibales in various stages of mutation.  Would I recommend this game absolutley!!! I have almost 200 hours logged in playing.  Given that it's an alpha build you have to be patient with the devlopers its not without its glitches and bugs but unlike other games I have played, the developers are always working on it to fix problems and add new content.  If you like survival games where you have to build cabins, tree houses hunt and fish or explore caves then this is the game for you.  One of the BEST features that is included are the cheat modes- put in by the developers.  If you just want to play as a survivor with no mutants you can.  If you want to play with them just coming out at night you can.

But somehow, this game designed by a small team, runs smoother and has greater gameplay then some of the damn major company releases that are failing miserably (Ubisoft AC:UNITY comes to mind...).\n\nThat being said, if you plan to purchase the game: IT IS ALPHA. This isnt the final product, so keep that in mind. You are basically paying so you can test the game and aid the dev team.\n\nSystem Specs:\nAMD FX6300 3.5ghz\n8gb DDR3\nGeForce 770 OC 2gb\n1TB WD Black Sata HDD\n\nOne thing I will say, is the way the AI works for enemies. Now there are still a few bugs; Cannibals getting stuck on a rock here and there, or blatantly ignoring you until you slap em. But the AI is actually pretty entertaining. Scouting parties will roam around with a flashlight in the dark and actually appear from a distance like survivors. They will roam and look for you if they see a fire. They sometimes leave a person behind that will remain in the area to keep scouting while they move on. And they are F*ckin Vicious lol. If you want to break away from the mindless, boring zombie apocalypse survival games that just launch slow moving easily killed zombies, check this one out.\n\nI haven't gotten to build much, but I like that the game provides a mini-survival book with some essentials and guidelines - but also provides the blueprints to enable self-made homes and barriers instead of jus "Your shack must look like this". Oh and don't run over your firepit... bad things happen.\n\nGraphically, for how intense and detailed the game is, it runs very smooth on high for me. As well as looking MUCH nicer than most of the newer games I played. There is still some glitching with water and such, lightning as well, where it wont exactly sit directly where it should. But it is alpha, I can overlook a tiny part of a lake floating a little above the land... I can't overlook a graphical failure that causes FPS below 10 on a well-built gaming rig.\n\nCombat is kinda interesting. The cannibals hurt... so get ready for it if you plan to beat on one... Made the mistake of thinking these would be just like the zombies. Not so much. If you do get beaten by one, enjoy what happens next ;). There isn't much else to say here - Youre not a battle god dual wielding thors hammer, so don't think you can just simply walk around all day/night without worry. The encounters are random, the scouting parties patrol to find you and your camp, and yes - if you keep fires burning... they will start bringing more enemies to take care of you.\n\nI like that I cant just punch a tree down, or build huge houses in a matter of moments after punching down said trees. The game will entice you. There isnt a moment you actually feel safe, even after you get into the shelter. Even with a molotov cocktail in your inventory. Since the second I loaded it up, till early this morning when I started again... I always felt out-manned and out-gunned lol.","November 24, 2014","true","15.1"," 37 of 42 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","37","42","0","0"

You exit the plane after you wake up fully and see a beautiful forest, light shafts peering through the leaves. You have a survival book, some soda, some protein bars, and an axe you found lodged in the head of an innocent flight attendant in the plane. You need to survive, if you don't you die. (No ♥♥♥♥) Now that i'm done with the summary, let me just say, this game is amazing. Yes, it used to be buggy, but it really has come a long way. I, as well as many of the other backers/buyers of early access are VERY proud of the developers for getting this far in development.

The tribe doesn't just want to take you down... Not at first anyways)\n\n+Natural Fear as Opposed to Forced\n\n+Co-Op (Haven't tried it yet, but that's the next step)\n\n+A Constant Sense of Urgency\n\n+A Clock of When the Next Update is\n\nCons that are possibly related to it being in Early Access:\n\n-Extreme Lack of Content at this point (There is no story besides the intro cutscene. Currently the only thing to do is to.. survive and explore. I'm hoping for the different optional paths in the story. Such as saving the kid who is probably your son, escaping the island, joining one of the tribes, eliminating the mutants or sealing off the caves and other such things)\n\n-Bugs (Nothing gamebreaking for me so far. Some floating rocks, the ability to walk through dead trees and drying racks, but nothing big)\n\n-Would greatly benefit from random events! The enemys are great, but as of right now there is no motive to put yourself in the action... I think I stayed up only one night and nothing happened. Would be interesting for a Bermuda Triangle type deal! Electronics stop working in the area, resulting in many plane and boat disappearances... which you can explore and rescue survivors and they become companions(yes/no?) The point is there isn't a whole lot of action yet... (I'm sure they will add content of some sort)\n\n-Not many weapons (There are axes, clubs, bows, spears and one katana. You can only craft axes, bows and clubs. The other stuff you have to find. The bow doesn't do anything to mutants, so that leaves axes and clubs, which the club for me is too slow, so really my only option is an axe.)\n\n-Death isn't anything to worry about, making the game... not as scary. When you die, the mutants drag you to a cave and conveniently leave you with all your stuff and right by the entrance of the cave. Not only that, but the cave and village above the cave are full of powerful loot (Dynamite and Modern Axes). I've died 3 or 4 times and everytime there were no monsters anywhere so I just grabbed loot and went back home. It is almost rewarding to die. The only way to fully die that I've seen is to die and be taken to the cave and then die again inside the cave... so the creatures don't scare me anymore. (Maybe they haven't finished the death sequence?)\n\n-Creatures become much less eerie after getting a pattern. At first it feels like you can't even kill one monster, but really if you set them on fire or knock them to the ground and pound on their head it's pretty simple. Especially since their AI isn't very unique during fights. All they do is stay a small distance and circle you and then when confident they come in and attack. When they attack they do more flailing then anything strategic. Would be nice to see the packs surround you and take you out. One man shouldn't be able to take on two, let alone 3-5. It would be nice if they were dangerous enough to make me want to hide. (Could be fixed with additions to AI)\n\n-No destruction of enemy bases (I don't think they are going to add this, but... it would be nice to be able to disable the tribes foothold.\n\nCons?:\n-I'm kind of on the fence about this one... there are the normal tribesmen and they are beautifully done (except the linear combat), but there are also "mutants" that are part of the tribes... they are basically big tanks and me personally... I think it kind of kills the scare factor. It doesn't scare me that a slow, giant made of multiple arms and legs is swinging in my direction. It's kind of creepy that I have to throw three sticks of dynamite to kill him, but other than that... not really. I want enemies that are smarter and faster than I am. The normal tribesmen aren't scary because of their looks or strength. They are scary because there are hundreds of them, they not only want to harm you, but they stalk you... you are their prey. They are hunting you... and they are... well they are supposed to be good at it. I think I'd prefer just the tribe, but the big mutants also have their pros. For instance, in the trailer I saw one break down a whole wall to let the rest of the tribe in... I would've **** my pants... but I haven't seen anything like that happen so.\n\n-I'm just being knit-picky here, but seriously what are the chances that not only your plane crashes and you survive, but you land on an island filled with cannibal mutants and find a convenient survival guide and hatchet?\n\n-I can't really think of much for cons that aren't just because it's in early access... There is no toggle crouch button!\n\nSummary: Great game that is only $15! Right now, I got 8 hours of singleplayer gameplay just from the survival aspects. It is my opinion that when the full game is released, it will be AAA quality. I bet by full release, you will be able to get 10 (If you only do the story, some exploring and basic survival) to 30 hours of gameplay on one playthrough, but this is the type of game that you can be able to play again and each time have a unique experience. (Especially if they add procedural generation)... There is one guy in the reviews who has 400+ hours of gameplay as of now... I think that is a little excessive, but you get the point.\n","October 1, 2015","true","22.9"," 35 of 39 people (90%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","90","35","39","4","0"

They didnt need it, I did. After I had my arms around 4 sticks and 2 stones, I found a convenient survival guide in my back pocket. It stated that a fire was good for morale, and I've seen Bear Gryllz, so I could confirm it. But, to aimlessly build a shelter out in the open is a bad idea. So I took a moment to gather my bearings, and placed a campfire behind a hill, near a bottleneck formation of rocks. This place was perfect. Fire was up, I caught a lizard (It was petrified from my manlyness) and cooked it. What a boost to my morale. I had heard these forests were dangerous, so I took no time to doubt, and hurried to build defensive walls around my rock formation, to keep me safe. I lost sunlight fast, and decided to call it a night. Something in the dark, deep forest was screaming, I dont know what.\n\nDay 2: The screams from last night kept me up. I've gotten close to no sleep, my water is running out and I am low on food. I must think of something fast if I'm to survive in this unforgiving habitat. Then I remembered a technique known to noone at all. Slaughter a threatned species to use its shields to gather rainwater in. Now I had water. A human can survive for three weeks with water, and barely one without it. I made an axe out of what you would expect. Stone, some bindings and a stick.  Now I had a weapon, I was ready. I awaited the twilight, built traps and stocked up on all my most vital resources; it was going to be a long night.\nAfter a battle in the darkness I was defeated, I dont know what I fought, but it was tough. And it dragged me to a cave. Luckily, my time in the Elite Gamer's League taught me a thing or two about survival in caves. DONT EVER USE A LIGHTER or a FLASHLIGHT; Use a torch, they are reliable. So I did. I finally saw some distant light in the cave; civilization. I was saved. I had found human beings. Here my adventure en-.. Wait, why are they naked? Hello? Why are you growling at me?

The sounds are amazing they are pitched perfect and give me the creeps when I'm waiting it out during the night and the creatures are crazy xD The leg thing gets me every time I see it, the only issues I've ever run into are the following,\n\n1. The Mutants Glitch run through the water and back out, even in the deep end where even the player is suppose to be swimming.\n\n2. Multi Player where your have a friend on the boat and if they go into the inventory they glitch off and can slide off the boat.\n\n3. If you make it far enough to get on "Betsy" Which is the boat in the water some feet away, If you load back in sometimes, at least if you are the second player and not the host. The boat is filled with water making your player swim.\n\n4. You can also see "Fish" Swimming through Betsy and kill them with your spear which really if you need the food isn't a bad thing!\n\nThese are just the few things I noticed on the game. I know it's still in Beta [ or whatever it is before Alpha release] but the game is quite amazing, So far I've traveled to the colder region where the snow is. My friends and I are setting up a camp and diving more into the world, it's great and a large area to explore.

Mostly, I play in Vegan Mode which disables all the cannibals and turns The Forest into a creepy survival game rather than horror survival game. I enjoy exploring the map, building stuff and trying to find enough food and water to live on while avoiding freezing to death. In fact I didn't buy the game until I discovered that it could be played with cheats. However, I do think that there is a lot of the game that I miss out on because of my hypersensitive nerves. There is also Vegetarian Mode which only disables cannibals by day and Ironforest which prevents destruction of your base by cannibals/players.\n\nI like that the mutants have their own culture and lives and one day, I swear, I will find the courage to find out more about them. If there was a cheat where I could infiltrate the cannibals and move amongst them without being attacked unless maybe I attacked them first that would just make my day.\n\nIn the meantime, the map is quite stunning, visually. However, even with the cannibals themselves disabled, the artifacts that they leave around the island can be quite disturbing so I don't recommend to someone who just wants a pretty map and no crawling skin factor.\n\nSurvival is challenging even without cannibals trying to eat your face. You need to get set up with shelter, fire, food and water pretty quickly. Saving is only possible on a bed (separate from sleeping). If you want to explore you need to make sure that you find a campsite well before dark as you can't carry enough to make a shelter in one go and trying to build at night while freezing and suddenly realising that you can't find any sticks where you are is not so fun. The map is large, but not massive, so after a while you can get bases set up around the map and things are less challenging in that respect.\n\nI have never played the multiplayer, but I imagine that it would be a great game to play cooperatively. There are plenty of resources and it's always less scary to have a friend along when mutants are trying to kill and eat you.\n\nSomehow, this is one of the game that I play most often, there is just something about it that keeps drawing me back. So, yes, I do recommend it. I only have 40 odd hours on record, so far, but it's one of the few games on my favourites tab, because I know I'll go back there before long even if it's just to see what the developers added in the latest patch.\n\nTL;DR It plays well, it looks great and updates are regular. There are cheats. And cannibals.","May 11","true","43.5"," 32 of 36 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","32","36","2","0"

Everytime you try to collect materials, try to explore, or even try to gather food, your nerves are stretched and stressed. This is mostly knowing that there could just be that large group of cannibals nearby, who are more than willing to gnaw on your ankles. I highly reccomend doing the single player before going into the multiplayer, as it has a much more survivalist horror feel to it, a feel that almost every other Early Access Game i've played attempted but in the end failed to achieve.\n\nMultiplayer\n\nThe Multiplayer is fantastic, although that is mostly due to how much you need to expose yourself in order to gather the most basic of items, players can fully take advantage of this, and become much more of a threat than any cannibals could achieve. Although if you are working together with other players on the multiplayer, you will likely power through the game, something which is a huge issue right now with a lack of content for the 'endgame'. Don't be disheartened however, as so far the game even in multiplayer can keep it's horror-survivalist tones.\n\nAdditional Thoughts\n\nAlthough this is in early access, we need a lot more content, this game has the current capabilities to become a very great game, however, that does not gaurantee it will become that.  Same as with every other Early Access. I do really hope the Devs work hard on this game, giving us more content, hopefully even allowing the game to be modded. Such content introducing things as this will create a very good game.\n\nGraphics - The current graphics of the game are very beautiful, the skybox and rain effects are much better than i've seen in most 'AAA Titles'. Although there is some unecesary blurred textures in some areas this is an Early Access so these hopefully will be fixed.\n\nSound and Ambient - The sound and ambience within this game will not help to calm you, surroundings will react to you being nearby, animals will run over sticks and through bushes when your gathering, making you worried of what may be around. This adds to the theme of the game greatly.\n\nTLDR:\n\nSingle player is gud but need some sort of endgame\n\nMultiplayer is gud but needs more of a challenge for multiple players\n\nNeeds Mod support!\n\nThe more content that is released, the more I will enjoy this game, and I currently highly reccomend it.\n\n","February 4, 2015","true","12.1"," 28 of 30 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","28","30","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JBSud/recommended/242760/","JBSud","Krap","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JBSud/","39 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nTo Long; Wont Read: This game is an 8.5/10 from me, with a great potential of one day being a solid 10/10. IT feels like a survival game that you actually have to work to survive.  Would recomend to a freind.\n\nThis is my second review ever on a video game (Rust Legacy), I have been using Steam for multiple years. With that being said, a game has to be bloody amazing for me to take the time to sit down and right a review.\n\nI had my doubts about purchasing this game, after having watched multiple youtube video's it seemed like the game was not has hard or "scary" as a few videos had made it out to be. The graphics looked nice, but it looked like a.. as a previous review called it: "Lumberjack Simulator"\n\nAfter recieving some Christmas money, I deceided to take the plunge and get it. No Regrets.\nI described this game to a buddy last night, and I think my description was pretty accurate:\n\n"Imagine being on an island with a bunch of cannibals that have never seen technology before, have their own system of rules, and outnumber you severely. That's what playing this "Game" is. The AI in this game acts exactly as I would expect a civilization within those parameters (right word for that I believe) to act... And some of the most beautiful scenery/graphical detail that I have seen in a video game in a long time."\n\nIt should be important to note here, that I dont do Alpha games often, this is only the third I have ever done, and the first that I have enjoyed that FELT like an Alpha. There are some clear bugs in this game, none that are what I would call game breaking - that I have encountered - but some clear bugs none the less. Co-Op is a bit wonky, but its fairly new to the game, and should be hashed out within the next few patches.\n\nWhat I enjoyed most about this game is that it actually FEELS like survival. Rust was (is (Legacy Rust)) great but it didnt FEEL like a survival game, once you get a small base established, there really wasnt much that could threaten you save for other players, getting a base established wasnt that hard, and although occasionaly things went wrong, they never really felt like a struggle. In The Forest, from the moment you step off the plane it FEELS like you really have your work cut out for you. The scenery is beautifal in that Tropical Rainforest kind of way, the wild life feels a bit.. how to describe this.. not out of place, but automated, but it doesnt really detract from the greatness of the situation.\n\nAnd then you encounter the first Native. Its an odd moment, and one that I have never had the same outcome to. How you act, greatly sets the pace of the game, I wont ruin the reactions to you, but will give you something to think about. Actions have consequences that you will feel the vibrations from for your entire playthrough.\n\nFrom what I understand the developer seems to play their cards close to their chest, but has been reliable thusfar in patching the game and providing new content updates. It seems like (from what I have heard) that they dont always get the job done 100% the first time, but they DO follow through and correct any wrongs. In my opinion thats a great sign, no one expects a small team to deliver an A+ on every patch, but when faults are discovered, they deserve to be (and are) corrected.\n\nI mentioned previously in the review that a few video's on youtube have made this out to be an incredibly scary game, but I dont believe the viewer really gets an understanding of that without being in the game themselves. The game is not scary, and I dont think it intends to be. With that being said, the game DOES have a large amount of.. ( I sat here for a few minutes trying to put a word to the feeling you - I - get when playing this game, because I am unable to do so, I will describe the time when I get this feeling) The feeling is the same one you get when your watching a horror movie that ISNT scarry, but is full of jump scares. The feeling when you know that something is getting ready to leap out at you, there is no suprise about it coming, you just dont know when its going to happen. That feeling is present in a large portion of this game, and it does it very well. EDIT: Suspenseful.. that would have been a good word for this (lol)\n\nI compared this title to the only other title in the same or similar genre that I have played and enjoyed (Rust) even though their are vasts differences between the two. With that being said, I expect to spend just as many hours having fun with this game as I have had with Rust Legacy. (800 hours at the time of writing)\n\nJust in case you were wondering about performance- My Specs: Playing with everything maxed out I never noticed a drop in framerates or any other visual performance issue (although the terrain sometimes has issues with Boulders/Cliffs from what I can tell, Animals sometimes have no collision with them)\n\nGTX 760\n2- 120GB SSD (which this game is installed on)\n1 TB HDD\n2x4 GB Ram 1600hz\nMSI 970A-G46 Mobo\n\nPro's:\n\nSurvival game that feels like its a survival game\nAmazing AI\nNo set strategy, different outcomes based on different actions\nLarge amount of craftable items that have clear benefits/purpose\nJust enough in game support (like the crafting manual) where you arent totally lost, but can still experement with things yourself.\n\nCon's:\n\nNo ability to draw or create a map (from what I have found so far) so getting the layout has been doable, but difficult.\nNo hostile animals (from what I have found) other than sharks\nHas enough bugs that you remain aware that the game still needs work, nothing that makes it unplayable (imo) but enough that immersion is sometimes broken.\n\nThings I would like to see in the future:\n\nBetter Rafts/Houseboats\n3rd Person (Im torn on this one, I think 3rd person would be awesome, but it might break the Fear Factor)\nBetter Bow (the Bow is really strong, but wildly inaccurate, would rather it be a tool to use where the hitting factor is determined by Skill, not RNG. (or maybe it is and I am just really bad with it)\nBetter realisim on wildlife","December 28, 2014","true","15.0"," 26 of 28 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","26","28","2","0"

Pepe-roni","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheHypestGameplayOnYoutube/","639 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nWell, I've officially played enough of this game that I feel like I can give a solid reveiw (and a TL;DR version). I played this game a lot on a friend's computer, and logged in over sixty hours before I bought it myself. So, with over 100 total hours of play between single and multiplayer, I have to say -  I love this game, and I cannot play it enough.\n\nTL;DR,\n\nPros\n>Get to survive a plane crash\n>Fight hordes of savages with some of the best AI I've come across\n>Option to stay peaceful and coexist with said savages\n>Cannibalism\n>Sick crafting action\n>Mad raft drifts\n>Frequent updates with countdown to next update\n>Dope Spelunking\n>Horror is 11/10 levels of Nope\n>You can lumberjack down the whole The Forest like it's Pioneer Simulator 2015 Elite Edition\n>Looks better than Crysis 2\n>Mad survival simulation; you have to keep warm, dry, clean, hydrated and well fed. Good luck.\n>Close enough to reality that you'll never want to go to Vancouver Island (the island looks like its in BC, to clarify)\n\nCons\n>Occasionally an update will be bumped back a day or two\n>Official wiki is poorly maintained\n>Game loses it's sheeit when you're hosting a large game\n>Can't viciously murder Canadian Geese\n>...\n\nThis game is fraking amazing - I really love survival horror games, and this game was the first game to give a great balance for both. I have never been truly unsettled by a vidya as much as I have The Forest. No spoilers, but there is a great and unexpected amount of body horror and truly unsettling caves. the crafting and building in this game are great, and as of version 0.18b they have both been incredibly fluid. There are frequent updates that add great new content, and every new update has cemented my love of the game. Oh, and it's fraking gorgeous. Like, for real dood - it looks better than Skyrim and a big chunk of other AAA games.\n\nAnd the freedom dood - you can completely avoid conflict (a new breed of stealth) or hunt down every single other person on the island and murder (and cannibalize) them. Wanna live on a lake? Make a houseboat. Wanna live in the woods? Make a log cabin, or a treehouse. Explore the mountains and caves, looks for signs of other survivors... or just chill out and farm. The fact that there is such a small dev team that are so involved and hard at work is impressive, and as a Canadian I am astounded that they're based in British Columbia (it's great to see Canadian Content that isn't amateur as frak).\n\nI can't recommend this game enough - it's like an HD First person version of Don't Starve,but way more indepth and a lot more realistic.\n11/10, the greatest video game to come out of Canada (including GTA III and Mass Effect, yes).","June 24, 2015","true","179.5"," 27 of 30 people (90%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","90","27","30","8","0"

The tribal A.I. is fascinating from afar. Few games have ever captured an A.I. that tries to spy on you but covers up the fact. When you catch them unaware, just remember that they can do the same to you. The first night that I realized a guy was 15 feet from my camp, watching me in the dark, was an expericance like none other.

During the day you will be able to see pretty well, but so many things around you look like the cannibalistic mutants that hunt you down.

Many features in the game are quite simplistic, such as the crafting menu and your player's inventory. There's almost no hassle when using them, and you won't get confused. The only bad thing about the crafting is that once you place a blueprint down, you can't remove it to build somewhere else (at least I haven't found a way to yet).\n\nThe atmospheric tone of the game is excellent. It's very dark and creepy, especially if you venture into the cave systems. The lighting is well done, both inside the caves and outside, and the sounds are simply brilliant. The mutants/tribesmen--whatever they actually are--add a more ominous element to the game, and they work surprisingly well early on in the game's stage.\n\nIf you're a fan of survival games, The Forest is definitely for you. You can get a spear and use it to go fishing, or just run around with it attacking things like a madman. Aside from fish, I've only seen lizards and rabbits so far as a food source, as well as energy bars.\n\nThere are quite a few bugs that I've noticed while playing, but that is to be expected in alpha. Certain objects, namely some rocks and containers, have no mass and you can walk straight through them. Some tools, such as the second axe you find in the game, can be replicated repeatedly. I had amassed a large stack of them at my camp by accident while switching to other tools. I wouldn't worry too much about the bugs right now. The development team of this game seems very promising, and I have the utmost faith that they will fix them to the best of their abilities.\n\nOverall, I would definitely recommend this game to any survival or horror fanatic.","May 30, 2014","true","7.7"," 42 of 57 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","42","57","0","0"

You get hungry and thirsty in painfully realistic intervals. "Oh I'm famished again, let me just pick this delicious looking mushroom..." Game Over, you made it 1 days!\n\nOnce you get the hang of it though, the stark, real-yet-unreal presence  of The Forest itself begins to take over as the main character, for which you are at best a temporary witness. Perhaps it's a kind of pergatory, or another dimension, but whatever this land is, it is also unquestionably beautiful.\n\nBuild a ringfort, or the ultimate tree-house, or some other way of staying warm and safe from the ever-curious and ever-hungry mutants (they really like the airplane snacks, and you happen to have eaten nothing but said airplane snacks for a week).\n\nNo matter what you build, or where you go, or what you kill or call into being, the most compelling piece of this game is that you remain alone, in a fetchingly hostile place, which drives you toward answers that are as yet unknowable.\n\nWhatever the metaphoric weight of all this might mean, simply taken as a work of art, it doesn't get more lovingly rendered than this game, which makes one believe that this small team is capable of even greater things.\n\n9/10","May 31, 2015","true","148.4"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","92","23","25","5","0"

It is perfect for survival junkies and slates the special Itch I've been having for these types of games.\n\nThe gameplay, though a bit clunky when you encounter a glitch, is still very responsive, and evey swing with your weapon has a very real weight to it. Every encounter with the mutants are usually jarring especially when they sneak up on you, Props to the developers that made it so chopping down a tree can be a tense click session so you can get the supplies and get the hell outa there.\n\nThe AI is a bit clunky and it gets a bit weird, But when it works it's a good scare when the Tribals come to eat your lovely manflesh.\n\nAfter a Few recordings I truly see how beautiful this game can get and graphically it is lovely, but you might need a beefy Graphics card and processor to run it at max.\n\nThe blood feature is also a good nod to show that you also need to keep good hygene and keep from getting mucked up with blood can get a wound infected, and the gathering of food is rather nice, Spearing fish and skinning rabbits and lizard to get armor and keeping yourself well fed.\n\nThe Stealth is rather responsive, hiding behind trees and ducking behind rocks to keep your location unknown you your visitors is good, and I find it interesting that the tribals Will actively watch over their territory, sending patrols out that can locate your camp, and will at times wait in the trees for you to return.\n\nThe Forest it's self is a enemy to you, you can easily get lost and end up stumbling upon Hungry Tribals, or just loosing your barrings in General.\n\nBut of course there are some hiccups, at times you can pick up items but they end up deleting out of your inventory, The inventory system could also use a fix so I'm not panicing trying wo switch to my axe when ambushed at the pond.\n\nWhat I want, Coop, and some better tools and weapons, and a Gilly suit would do nice for the stealth.\nThose and some more building options like Tree houses or Hidden homes\n\nBut besides that the game is worth your time, and 15 bucks is a good asking price for this Rather lovely game.\n\nSo give it a chance and let yourself get lost in this True Survival Horror.","June 14, 2014","true","7.6"," 24 of 27 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","24","27","0","2"

We complete it the next morning after making a poorly made tent to sleep the night away. We're both starving. I suggest hunting Bambi. The land is rich with wildlife. The first deer I approach runs off at around 50 mph straight off a cliff, leading into the ocean... The second runs in circles, taunting me, it knows how exausted I am. It's confident in it's abilities, but I however am not. We spend the rest of the day hunting, but to no avail. I suggest a new approach. I have one bottle of liquor. I make a molotov. Things get intense. We approach a deer, we're in a bit of a rush, "this is murder" I said.  My friend replied saying it was what we had to do to survive. I feel my throat getting dry. I grip the molotov, I take a breath... I throw it at the deer. The bottle crashes against the deer, hitting it in the head. The deer stops, dazed, and runs away.

I find an axe and proceed to chop down enough trees to be able to construct a small, crude shelter and a fire.  I then busy myself setting snare traps to deter any unsavory people from invading my home.  As I examine my traps, I am unsettled to find a friendly tribesman strung up in one of my snares, much to the horror of his two comrades.  Being the gentleman that I am, and wanting to show that I mean these fine men no harm, I free the distressed man by severing his legs.  He flops around for a bit before lying completely still; I take this as a sign that he is relieved.  My act of good faith seems to have further upset the two mobile tribesmen, and it comes to my attention that perhaps good deeds mean less to them then combat prowess.  Still desperate to prove my worth, I step forward and begin to swing my axe in a wonderful display of weapon mastery.  I may have impressed them too much, as they run towards me in an attempt to get a closer look at my beautiful axemanship.  They run directly into the path of my axe before they, too, fall over and cease to move.  I am deeply upset at the unfortunate accident, and I wonder if perhaps there were other members of these men's tribe who will miss them.  I begin to set up a memorial using the limbs and heads of the deceased and light it ablaze; a true warrior's funeral.  In minutes, I find myself surrounded by tribesmen and women, who are presumably here to mourn their fallen comrades.  I kneel before my effigy, a sign that I was honored to know these men.  A young woman steps forward from the group and looks at the burning pyre; I can only assume that she is the wife of one of the dead warriors.  I still have one of the men's arms, and I attempt to present her with it to remember her husband.  I tap her on the head with the stiff hand.  She turns slowly and looks at me with sad eyes.  The entire crowd goes crazy.  They pounce on me.  I am torn asunder like wet toilet paper in a firing range.\n11/10, would hold crazy native funeral again.","May 31, 2014","true","10.3"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","22","24","0","1"

It is so realistic made forest. You begin on the plane with your son and suddently your plane crashes to island with mutants and canninbals. The canninbal takes the child and your goal is to save him, but as you begin to explore and survive you begin to face the mutants, canninbals, weather changes...\nYou can built an awesome bases around the crashed plane, on forest, on mountains, on beach and even in caves (BEWARE: Each time you save or spawn there, the mutants an canninbals will spawn too. If you build your base right between where canninbals have camps, then expect to have attacks, they will come everytime). Also making traps against canninbals is sweet idea, so you can protect yourself against them and finished them with normal or modern axe.\nI gaved three copies to my friends and we created a lot of bases and traps but theres more to explore :3\n\nYes the game is in alpha stage, so expect some funny or weird bugs for example like:\n\n- Throwing TNT on the ground around 5 trees and suddently 10 more trees fall down but in the end you get a lot of logs,\n- Canninbals no clipping through trap when the trap isnt activated,\n- When you chop down the tree, few logs launch into air high,\n- Spider Mutant or Armsy Mutant destroys one part of your base but can accidently destroy other side of your base somehow,\n- Trying to hit canninbals while they just stand and you somehow get hitted once or twice.\n\nMe and my friends are enjoying this game so much because its fun and open world and exploring so much new things.\nAnd in every update this game gets better and better.\n\nIf you love forest and exploring on adventure to find and built stuff, you should get this game right now :D\nKeep it up developers, you did an amazing job on this game.\n\n\n\n","May 2","true","217.4"," 19 of 19 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","19","19","3","0"

This ended up after the crash with one of the cannibals appearing infront of me with my child.\nHe runs away and you are alone, other than a few rabbits.\nSo i pick up my axe and get ready to chop some tree's, i chop away and the whole tree come tumbling down, showering the floor with logs.

You will be building your house and see people suddenly around you climbing the trees.\nThe atmosphere is superb.\nThe graphics are very nice too, considering this is an indie game in alpha i am VERY impressed.\nThe sounds are a little bat at times, when the plane crashes it doesn't feel like there was much going on. The child is just sitting there not making a noise and so was i. Although this is most likely and alpha thing and there will be more when the game is more complete.\n\nOverall i would say even now in an alpha state this game is very muhc worth it's price as it captures what it is trying to do so well.

You can interact fully with the environment around you, and pretty much build an epic survival compound.\n\nSure, there are bugs, but not many that I've seen. The worst of it is there's a bloody table that seems to haunt my camp. It has a life of its own as it floats around and crashes into my house. No problem! everything else so far seems to be working fine.\n\nSo Jump in, immerse yourself and see how long you can survive.

The terrain looks much, much more realistic while barely affecting performance and framerate.\n\nI bought this game last year and recently started playing it again. I actually just bought a copy for my brother so that we could play coop. Let me just start by saying that this is a mixed review, though I will be giving it a thumbs up because it's improved tremendously since last May.\n\nPros:\n\n-The Cannibal AI seem to be much more intelligent and unpredictable than the last time I played. They chase you on all fours very quickly, seem to get used to burning effigies, and always seem to thwarth your plans at remaining safe.\n-There seems to be a few more animals and the crafting system is a little more polished.\n-The graphics and graphical options and presets are much more diverse.\n-The addition of co-op is amazing. Though it definitely needs more work, after playing for a few hours with my brother we came to the conclusion that the devs must put more focus on this aspect of the game.\n\nWhat I'd like to see in coop gameplay:\n\n-Sharing and giving items between players.\n-When hosting a game, the player I invited always spawns back to the plane after they die. I load at my last save point, see player 2 flash quickly, and they then reappear at the plane.\n-When a player puts meat on the drying rack, I don't see it. He doesn't see my meat. There is also a bug when we both make a log sleigh or carry cannibal bodies: They are invisible.\n-A bunkbed system in which the two players fall asleep at the same time. The lack of sleep in co-op is sort of unrealistic. I'd say maybe have it so that each player has to press a key within 5 seconds so that they can all fall asleep simultaneously and wake up at the same time.\n-When I host a game, I see a wild boar, but the other player sees a deer. This doesn't break the game, but it's quite a funny bug.\n-Knives. It's almost weird that they're not included in the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FuzzSlam/recommended/242760/","FuzzSlam","FuzzSlam","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FuzzSlam/","204 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThe Forest is a survival horror game that actually does survival horror right, from the sound to how everything looks, Thats why I instantly fell in love with The Forest, the immersion. If you have ever played the Silent Hill series, you would know of how good a job it makes you feel like you're alone, but not ALONE. And that is what seperates The Forest from the rest of the "zombie" survival "horror" games, it gets rid of the generic zombie foe that you don't mind putting a couple rounds into and gives you a native cannibalistic tribe that may make you think before taking them out incase one of them gets away and alerts the rest of the tribe.\n\nThis game is legitimately scary, from your first sighting of the tribe searching the plane wreck to the first time you get knocked out and dragged to their cave. It's purely atmospheric horror and It doesn't just rely on cheap scare tactics like jump-scares and loud noises like other survival horror games.\n\nNow on to the survival aspect of The Forest, I personally think this part was really well done, it actually makes you adapt and survive! From not being able to eat raw meat and actually having to put it onto the fire and wait for it to cook so you don't burn it, to simply how the tree cutting animations are and finding berries that are not poisonous to eat.\n\nAt the moment it's pretty buggy. But what do you expect from a pre-alpha? I'm really looking forward to seeing what Endnight games can do with The Forest in the future. This game would easily be Game Of The Year for me, normally I wouldn't even fathom choosing a game like this for GOTY, but The Forest is just perfect to me, and can definitely see this being one of my all time favorites.","June 1, 2014","true","35.0"," 22 of 26 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","22","26","0","3"

(which makes the first run impossible!) ...but crafting is more intuitive like this. (there is a forest crafting wiki) The player has to find out most recipes by just combining and trying. This brings immersion to crafting and makes you proud of your new upgraded spear or your personally crafted bow! (if you try it without the wiki of course.)\n\nenemies are weak overall... blocking is not op and will harm the player for 10-20% of unblocked dmg. BUT the AI hits like a truck. you can take 3-4 attacks from a normal guy and it is over. GREAT! this makes combat easy but also very rewarding! (the enemy movement is really weird and will make every fight unique!)\n\nthere is no endgame! there is just an atmosphere of fear and terror for lets say 20 cool hours. if you want to build your fortress in hell. this is your game. hold out forever! ...maybe give up your fortress, lay fire and flee on your boat... maybe you will find a cave and live there... just to find out it is THEIR CAVE! :)\n\nIf they can get you 2 times at zero HP, they will cook and eat you half alive! you got only 2 lives.\n\ndynamite, molotovs, a bow, spears, axes, katanas, lizard-skin-underpants for armor... a crown of leaves to be the stealthed bow sniper... or just be the naked axemurderer who invades them, hanging the heads of their leaders in the middle of their settlement.

I was playing co-op with 2 other friends. On our 1st play through we built a pretty large base with double high stone walls surrounding our buildings and a pond on top of a cliff near the sea. We also had a small retaining wall further out from our base. As our base grew larger and we cut down more tress and we attracted more cannibals. On the 4th night it was pure chaos. We were hit by multiple raiding parties and than some of the larger mutants appeared and starting wrecking our base. The attack went all night and we eventually died to the mutants. We re-spawned but the mutants would not leave the vicinity.\n\nAfter that crazy battle we decided to start a new co-op game as we felt we learned a lot from the 1st experience.\n\nWords can not describe how creepy this game can get. I always play videos game in the a darken room. This game, I always have the lights on.  Some of the sounds you can hear out in the forest at night are bone chilling.

The island is beautiful, not only sporting a lushious overworld but also a dank cavernous system underground filled with nightmarish creatures. Not to say that you are safe above ground either as packs of cannibal clans roam the forest, searching for their next meal. Unless you get your act together and locate a secure position in which to begin constructing your camp then that meal might be you.\n\nThe AI of the cannibals is quite simply disturbing. I am not usually unnerved by computer AI but these guys will hunt you, taunt you and test your resolve before either retreating (probably to tell others where you are) or closing in for the kill.\n\nThe crafting system is nice, combining various objects in order to create tools or weapons to help you survive. The building system seems solid however there's not a lot to play with at the moment. The ability to place your own foundations and build a shelter of your design is in there, but not quite working just yet (at least in my experience it has been a bit buggy).\n\nAll in all well worth buying if you are into survival gaming. As previously mentioned it has a long way to go but for what it is in alpha 'The Forest' is well worth your prolonged attention.","November 17, 2014","true","8.2"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","18","21","0","0"

The first one being it's Alpha and has PLENTY of bugs which can really ruin the immersion and excitement you get during your first playthrough and in my opinion that's a pretty big deal considering this game has every element it needs to be the best (Horror) Survival game of the year. Secondly you MUST have a good computer to run this game or it will be 15 dollars down the drain, If you can't run Rust then forget about getting this game as of now and start investing in one that can run this future Masterpiece of a game.\n\nWhen I first started playing this game I felt a rush of excitement and fear as I did when I played Minecraft for the first time, (These games are very different but have a similiar concept, to survive and craft) This game is intense already to say the least, but again the fact it's in Alpha and has many bugs can ruin that.\n\nIf you want the best experience for this game when you first play I suggest waiting a few weeks\n\nIf you want to help support the developers of this and be a part of the games journey to it's finished product then buy this, you won't regret it.\n\n\nGotta give this game a 8/10\n\nThings to keep in mind when you're actually playing this:\n1. Use the Axe to break open suitcases, good loot and food in there\n2. Take advantage of the stealth mechanic and listen for the noises Cannibals make, you'll probably know it when you hear it\n3. If you are killed by cannibals and taken to their cave, YOU MUST get the flare gun inside the room you wake up in, don't leave it without it because you'll most likely need it to escape and it has plenty of ammo\n4. And above all, have fun\n\n\nHappy hunting","June 7, 2014","true","43.9"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","18","21","0","1"

I've been eating berries and bars I found next to dead people. I wish I could find a rabbit or two. I just realized how to kill fish, but the frogs are still immortal and can't be killed. I belive it's magic.\nI met a naked, dirty man in the forest few nights ago. Most likely high on drugs cause he ran back into the forest again and after that I havn't seen a single soul.\n\nApart from that I've been building and crafting like crazy, got nothing else to do around here. The boat I made was a waste of calories though.\n\nI think I need to spend more time figuring out how to craft more powerfull items, and I really hope I can make some powerful, magical armor soon because I'm always cold and wet from the rain.

I tried a lot of the ones that focus on MMO-type gameplay, and quicky became bored with them. I can only walk around for so long starving to simply get shot by some guy with a cowboy hat as soon as he sees me.\n\nI finally decided to try out the The Forest, and it's the first one of the genre that I've been thoroughly impressed by. With an indie team of 3 devs, the game has a surprisingly polished look and feel. It creates the creepy atmosphere it's going for perfectly. I'm writing this review after my first night of playing, and I've only played co-op so far, so I can strongly recommend playing with a friend (but I'm sure playing alone would be just as satisfying and probably more creepy).\n\nI already have come to love the building system. Rather than punching trees endlessly, you design out your building initially and it shows you what resources you need to collect to complete the structure. You then go out to find those resources. It's amazing how much more immersive the game is when the tree actually falls and you carry a few logs back at a time to your shelter-in-progress.\n\nHad a great time after my first few hours, and I can't wait to get a little more confident to explore the more dangerous parts of the forest.","June 11, 2015","true","3.3"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","1"

The survival genre needed something fresh. Something that was survival, without the endless additions of survival mechanics, but with enough elements remaining that the game remained fun and challenging. Something that had the wonder and danger of exploration, with the terror of creatures in the night, without taking itself too seriously or not seriously at all. And something without zombies, but something that could instill just as many fears and nightmares if not more.\n\nEnter: The Forest\n\nIt's worth noting that The Forest was the first game on Steam to really start the "stranded survival" genre,  and there are many games out there currently "inspired" by its formula including Stranded Deep, Salt, Savage Lands, Better Late Than Dead, and more.\n\nAll alround, this is a fun early-access game that is worth putting down dollars on.\nGranted I still run into the occassional bug, but that is the nature of early access. What is good about this early access game though is that the developer is EXTREMELY active with making bug fixes along with adding new improvements, they are constantly listening and interacting with suggestions and feedback from the community, and most important of all is that they are taking whatever time is necessary to make sure this game is well crafted before they try to push it forward into further stages of release. The care and quality really shows, and I really look forward to seeing its continued progress.\n\nThat was all just a review of the game as it stands in the market of games however, so let me touch on the actual playing of the game.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nIt's a lot of fun, and has a very different feel compared to a lot of survival games. As a gamer who is also getting older and has more and more responsibilities in life, I find that the mechanics of the gameplay also balance really well with what time I can lend to play it. That is, it has numerous survival elements which keep the game interesting and challenging, while not requiring anything you could call grinding. The atmosphere and environment of this game is really well crafted too, and the effects of lights and shadows really add a lot to the experience, I especially like the feature that your characters eyes need time to adjust to different intensities (or absence) of light to see well.\n\nThe cannibals you survive amongst in the game also offer a good challenge, and a serious change of pace from most other survival games where you practically end up being invincible against ridiculous odds. In this game fighting one on one requires focus, and getting outnumbered in a fight can quickly lead to a scenario where your best option is to RUN. The cannibals aren't the only threat though, as every day you will need to come up with a way to get food, fresh water, stay warm from cold nights and rainstorms, and watch out for dangerous animals.\n\nAs you start getting into the rhythm of things you begin building up your goods, and can start taking the fight to the natives. Let them know you're not to be trifled with by butchering the limbs from a fallen foe, and skewering them on a burning stake as a warning to the rest. Some times this will backfire though and the cannibals will return with a raiding party to wreck your camp, forcing you to flee from everything you worked so hard for unless you can fight well enough to defend it. If you want to return the favor, you can venture deep into the caves where the cannibals live and discover why they are harvesting all the bodies from the plane wreckage...DUN DUN DUNNNNNNNN\n\nCo-op is also great because you can use your friends as cannibal bait! :D\nI'm hoping in the near future the dev. will have a deliberate FFA/PVP mode, where players can paint themselves to group up in rival tribes, and to native on one another.\n\nThis game is already fantastic, and it's only going to keep getting better.","November 3, 2015","true","101.4"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

Everything has been amazing; the graphics, audio (mood, etc), weather is really cool, and there is just so much more. When I found out that the trees fall down, I was astounded! Never have I ever played a game with physics like this.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nAlso, on to the gameplay, the way everything works is great. Everything has a purpose; turtle shells, deerskin, rabbit fur, and even body parts (LOL!). It's weird how one can use someone's leg to kill another person, but IT ACTUALLY WORKS!!\n\nAUDIO:\nThe audio in "El Forest" is decent. Well, not even decent, more like superb! Like the gameplay, every noise, sound, water drip has a meaning. The night sounds really set the mood, alike the day sounds. night is spoopy, day is happy (ish) . All in all, if you like nighttime sounds and have that one app on your smartphone that puts you to sleep, then you're gonna love this.\n\nWEATHER AND CYCLES:\nWeather is one of those lesser used things. Now, it may be confusing to implement, but in this game it's just great. When it rains you get cold and wet and at night you get cold, at day you start to warm up. I'm not entirely sure if the thunderstorms can zap trees, but it really sets the mood when they occur.\n\nGRAPHICS:\nAll I have to say about this is that the developers have paid a lot of attention to detail. Next time you hop into a game (or when you get the game), take a look at all the textures and scenery. THEY WILL ASTOUND YOU!\n\n\nAnyways, aside from the biggies, it's a great game. It's very enjoyable, and they have coop! Who doesn't like that?\n\nNow, it does have it's bugs (disappearing logs, to name one), but it's a very enjoyable experience nonetheless.\n\nI just bought this game during the sale, but that doesn't mean it's not worth the $14.99. Unlike most early access titles, the devs pay attention to what needs to be done.\n\n*** NON SPOILER SECTION ***\n\ntl;dr\nGraphics, Audio, Gameplay, basically everything about this game is great. When you experience "El Forest," you will see the work that was put into this masterpiece.","January 7","true","25.4"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","93","14","15","5","0"

Woke up covered in blood, brink of starvation and barely alive. I made it to my feet and looted the plane for goods. Nothing much, couple meals and some soda. Even found some booze which I've kept for later. Staggered outside to the site of a picturesque forest full of wildlife. I borrowed an axe from a stewardess who didn't look like she'd be needing it, and started hacking open some luggage. Didn't find much, some cloth and some granola bars. I headed out and ended up at a coast, which I followed for a while. Found some cargo containers with some circuit boards and a bunch of asprin. I took it all. Went further down and found a crashed Yacht, so I'm thinking this is somewhere in the ♥♥♥♥in' Bermuda triangle. Found some flares on that, and some rope. Headed inland but got lost, ended up at some small village with triangular buildings. Lots of dead people...some I recognized from my flight. Found a better axe buried in a tree, and more soda than I'll ever need in my life, as well as some dynamite. Headed in I think a northerly direction, found another village. Managed to kill a couple rabbits and lizards, made a small pouch for berries and glued some leaves onto the lizard skin and wore it for camo. I literally ran into some savage on accident. It ran away, laughing. Shaken, I kept heading down the hill and found some poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who looked like someone had run a sword through him. I took it. Katana, very nice. Kept heading that direction and found a small pond with a tent next to it. Found a cooking pot and a spear. It was getting dark and I was hungry and thirsty, so I quickly made a small shelter out of sticks and leaves as well as a tiny fire, got some water out of the pond and boiled it, drank that and cooked my rabbits. Put out the fire and slept through the night.\n\n\nDay 2: Woke up early and got out of there. Walked for a long time and got lost a bunch. Ran into another savage. He rushed me, so I sliced him with the katana, but the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ was just a diversion as two more jumped me from behind. I managed to take all three down but I was hurting pretty bad, so I took some asprin and that cleared it up. Kept going and ended up back at the guy who'd been run through. Noticed there was a cave behind him, so I started going through it. I haven't been using my lighter at all, even though I explored about half of last night. Hard as hell to see but I didn't want to attract any attention. In the cave, I only used my lighter when I couldn't tell where I was going, or to check for side passages. I found a fork in the road and went left, and found another fork. Went left again and found four human heads on the ground, still decaying. Past that was some poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with a Bible and a crucifix in his hand. Head looked to have been eaten off, possibly while he was still alive. Dead end past that. Headed back and was greeted with a wooden wall, with a skull hanging over it, a candle in each eye. Unnerved, I cut down the wall and found another one. Cut that one down and there was a massive open chasm past that. I heard some very loud footsteps, like a giant was walking around. To my left I saw two...things. The light was bad, but they looked like two massive pillars of flesh with about ten arms apiece. Keeping in my scream was the hardest thing I've ever had to do. I scrambled past them and found a climbing rope, and descended. It was very wet down here, and I was doing my best not to slip and drown. Kept going and there was another, even bigger chasm. I took one step inside and the most terrifying sound I've ever heard in my life pierced my ears. It sounded like babies crying, but it was too high pitched, too...alien. I stumbled inside and saw big tents in one corner, which was where the crying was coming from. I crouched down and went over, and sure enough there were deformed babies twitching and crying on the rock floor, a humanoid standing over them, hunched, apparently asleep. Surrounding them in a ring were big rocks, one of which I was hiding behind, and on those wooden crates. I cut one open but nothing was inside. I quickly moved away, but to my horror the babies lunged at me. I cut them down, whimpering, trying not to make any noise to awake anything in here. I ran as fast as I could away from them, flicking my lighter on to guide the way. I went down a passage that ended in a rope. I quickly grabbed on and climbed up, hoping this was the exit. It ended much too soon, and I pulled myself up and sprinted down the passage. To my utter terror, it ENDED. There was nothing, just a blank wall and a skull with a candle in it. I slowly turned back, towards the sounds of piercing baby cries and the wind passing through the damp, cold cave. I sank to the ground in defeat, and await death.","October 8, 2015","true","60.3"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","84","16","19","3","0"

Build, explore, survive in this terrifying first person survival horror simulator.\n\n\nWelcome to The Island. A Indie survival-horror game, and a pretty one too! You will find yourself easily immersed in The Forest's world, a world crafted with much care and dedication. Animations are greatly done, while the simple act of chopping down a tree can be a fun experience, since visuals are splendid in this game. But this isn't everything this game has to offer, we have a pretty big island full with stuff to see, from cannibal camps, tortured survivor, abandoned camps and caves. Gameplay wise we have a few factors and mechanics, you need to gather,hunt for food, build a shelter, build fire places to light up during the night, hide indoors when it rains and many, many others.\n\nThe cannibals are nicely designed, and you will find yourself interested in their background since they aren't your standard "zombies" unlike the other thousand of games with the same setting. The crafting part of the game is still basic, limited at the moment to crafting molotovs, small hunting cabins or large cabins, a small raft, a few traps and some more stuff.\n\n\nI will update the review once new features will be added to the game, so far I give it a personal rating of 8/10, due to the AI being a bit repetitive, lack of story (other than the plane crash, nothing more is explained or introduced) and the fact that the crafting system needs a whole lot more improvement over it. Anyways, if you're into survival games, this is a must buy for you. The developers are working with mind and soul on this project, and you will not be dissapointed.","July 30, 2014","true","7.4"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","16","19","2","1"

But in my opinion this is not one of the terrible ones. It has constant updates making the game better all the time, for example co-op just came out! But this is not only a survival game, it’s also horror. When you explore them caves for the first time with your little lighter that keeps going off you will be scared. Really scared.\n\nEnemies\nThe enemies are not zombies. Yes, you heard a survival game with NO zombies! This has mutants. The mutants are very well made and will take different approaches towards you, for example one mutant on its own tends to run off. It will then come back with its friends. They also attack in turns a lot. One will attack then pull back and another will try to hit you. They climb trees to ambush you and will also try to flank you. In the deepest caves you will find the really terrifying ones. These ones are proper mutants.\n\nSurvival\nYou will need to eat, drink, keep your energy up, keep your health up and build a shelter. You will also be defending yourself against mutants while doing all of that. To survive you need to hunt, fish, scavenge camps, chop trees and fight.  You will need to hunt and fish to eat and keep your energy and health up. You will need to scavenge camps for items you can craft and also for food. You will need to chop trees to build a shelter, create traps, and more. You will need to fight so you don’t die.\n\nEnvironment\nThe environment is amazing! From the forest its self with the high trees to the sandy beaches scattered with camps.  No matter where you are, you won’t feel safe. You will need to use the environment to help you survive.  The forest has the trees you need for the camp. Around the beaches you will find more rocks. In the caves you will find better equipment. Just remember the caves are home to the mutants.\n\nCo-op!\nI’ve played co-op with one friend, and in my opinion it made the game much better.

Shelter gets built and there's my friendly neighbor dropping by. So I do the sensible thing and hit him with an axe, he knocks me out and drags me to a cave where I'm killed by weird Octo Mutants.\n\nSecond Playthrough\nVainly try to build a bonfire on a small island, slowly die from hunger until nightfalls and I'm massacred by the enemy.\n\nThird Playthrough (Co-Op!)\nJoin some random players much, much better than me in building a camp, they mainly build, I chase flaming rabbits. Daytime comes and they go into the cave, I'm at the camp until the cannibal crew arrives, where I promptly haul ♥♥♥ straight to the cave to meet my pro players. I am once again killed by OctoMutants.\n\nAll in all, great game, good creepy atmosphere especially on singleplayer and the co-op's a nice touch. Still a but off feeling at times, especially with chopping down trees but I definitely recommend!\n","June 10, 2015","true","17.3"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","100","12","12","10","0"

You purchase your tickets on a cheap airline in order to save money because you are a cheapskate. When you get seated on the plane the stewardist seats an annoying 5 year old next to you. He screams kicks and bothers the heck out of you for 3 hours until you hit intense turbulence. The airplane crashes. A mutant takes the kid and you rejoice as you are free from the little demon.

One minute, I'm spearing fish in a crystal clear pond without a care in the world and next I hear an array of strange animal sounds. As the rain begins to fall, I direct my attention to the source of the noise and spot a patrolling party of around 10 tribal figures in the distance. However they seem unaware of my presence and march away into the overgrowth. Around a minute later, after I begin picking up essentials from the corpses strewn around a camp located right next to my own, the cannibals burst out of the foliage ahead of me, chasing me down, surrounding me and eventually killing me.\n\nIt's worth noting that the AI and animations in this game are significantly better than I expected they would be. One of the cannibals darted ahead of me from the side, abruptly skidding to a halt and preventing my escape while another realistically hopped from tree bark to tree bark above.\n\nIn regards to the crafting and resource gathering, I haven't experimented too much but it seems fairly straightforward and that's not a bad thing at all. Approaching and hacking down a small plant will provide you with branches and leaves and hacking down an entire tree will provide you with logs to carry which you can store in a log holder if you've crafted one. Creating a fire and shelter are essential and the fact that you have to apply leaves to the fire to keep it going adds to the realism. Overall, the crafting is fairly immersive and skinning an animal and then picking the meat up and directly applying it to the fire all seem pretty damned seamless.\n\nThe lighting seems quite advanced as well and the cavern segments remind me of the film, 'The Descent' in a good way, with the ambient sounds of water drops, stalactites, stalagmites, water reflections and numerous crystal groups.\n\nAll this being said, the game is in early alpha state and there are quite a few bugs which is to be expected during this stage, wherein the player can clip through certain objects and swapping equipped items can sometimes result in weird overlapping objects but overall, I believe that this game is easily worth the price tag and I eagerly look forward to the development in the future.\n\n\n\n","May 30, 2014","true","6.0"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","1"

By buying this game you should take into consideration you're purchasing a 'Beta' version, you won't get a completed game (yet) and there will be bugs.\n\nThe Basics\nHaving that said I really do enjoy this game, it's difficult, but not impossible, it's challenging, but never too unfair, surely there is quite a few bugs to be polished out of the way but that's why it's in beta. The idea is simple, gather some wood, craft some better tools, survive the night. It's more difficult than it sounds though and you will be facing numerous challenges; hypothermia, hunger, fatigue and of course cannibals.\n\nThe Gameplay\nGameplay wise this game needs some fixing, there's a few bugs when chopping down trees or mashing enemies in the face with a club fashioned out of a stick and someone's skull, not all hits will register and it can become a bit frustrating. Once you've learned to deal with these little things the game is pretty polished.\nIt's pretty easy to get a nice structure going, and it won't be long until you have yourself a nice base, just don't forget to make a fire.\n\nWith the new added in co-op feature this game becomes a LOT more enjoyable, it's double the fun when you're running around with some friends collectively hacking limbs off cannibals, and I think it's a great addition to the game. In fact, just the fun you could have in the co-op is probably worth buying this game.\n\nThe Graphics\nThis game looks pretty, the shadow bugs present in previous versions (your character having hollowed out eyes and neck in your shadow) are now fixed and I can't really think of any way to complain about the graphics in this game, it's imply outstanding. The world feels alive and immersive.\n\nTo Summarize\n+ Great gameplay.\n+ Co-Op is a blast!\n+ World feels immersive, with attention to detail.\n+ It's a challenge, but not unfair.\n- Minor bugs.\n\nThank you for reading :D","March 10, 2015","true","2.7"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","0"

Still has longer to go until all the content in, but this is one of the three foremost examples of a good pre-release program I can think of (others being Minecraft and Don't Starve).\n\nI'm not going to go on about the gameplay - standard survival stuff, but first person. A lot of fun, in my opinion, though I kind of like the zen experience of staying on the overworld and avoiding cannibals while I live a quiet version of Castaway. Has a lot of promise, and a lot of current content if you enjoy building and hunting and general survival stuff.","December 17, 2015","true","75.1"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","15","18","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/_Wheatley/recommended/242760/","_Wheatley","The Karma","http://steamcommunity.com/id/_Wheatley/","69 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis is one of the few early access games that I have faith in.\n\nThe Forest is more than just a game for me, after visiting Yellowstone National Park in upstate Wyoming, I could really compare the seemingly cold-ish forest environment to The Forest because the devs in my opinion have changed so much since v0.01 to make it FEEL like you're in the forest. They work with graphics and just amazing sound. The environment feels so natural that I don't want to even be interupted when playing this game, because it's THAT GOOD!\n\nStarting from the beginning plane crash, the 1 minute-or-so intro is better than my 48 hours on DayZ, and is more interesting. On top of that the devs nailed the in-flight ambience, me just recently flying on a two hour plane to Chicago it was something to truly compare. When the plane splits into thirds the sounds of seperation deeply add to the immersion, I'm already wrapped into the game before even playing this thriller.\n\nOn the surface, the atmosphere and environment is very well-done. I especially like stepping out for heavy winds blowing through the forest. At night the sound of cannibals screaming in the distance can also put one to a shiver. Cave environments are even more scary. The devs did so by adding fantastic ambience sounds and lots, and lots, of props that I won't spoil here.\n\nAlso, the reason that this is the only early-access game I have faith in, is because the devs, number one, let you know when the next update is, and they have a suggestion thread which they RESPOND to! This way, you can look forward to the next update and really see what the devs are doing, and how the work well. I actually think my grandkids would be able to play a sequel to a sequel, to a sequel, etc. Because the development rate and consistency is so good. The devs have a LOT OF POTENTIAL HERE! DON'T RUIN IT!\n\nYou may not like this, but the amount of content in this game, the amount of fun I've had in my -so far- 21 hours, is worthy of at least a 30$ game if not 40$.\n\nBy realease, if the devs don't screw up you could be looking at a 50$ game. This game could be like Alien: Isolation, I say this because they've gotten a base for sound, environment, and horror. They just need to do more.\n\nI rate this game, as of this state, an 11/10, especially for being a trusty early-access. WITH CO-OP! Another pro!\nTruly a fantastic experience and I expect myself to continue to play it for a long time.","May 17","true","44.2"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","15","18","0","0"

I know that a lot of Early Access games have turned out to be huge disappointments, but so far, this game has been meeting, if not exceeding Expectations. Developers, you should be proud of yourselves, for the progress you have been making, and while I don't know how much that means to you, I'd like to think that it means a lot coming from me. This game will probably turn out to be something absolutely amazing, and I think that the developers have a great game going on.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/-Frost_/recommended/242760/","-Frost_",".Frost.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/-Frost_/","241 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThe Forest is a great start out survival horror game. Stuck on an island with crazed cannibals hunting you down, you must survive in the primitive sense. Kill or be killed. The developers have thought about this quite well, ensuring tension but also allowing the player enough time to source survival stuff (wood for fires, fish for food, etc) to create their own journey. I have thoroughly enjoyed playing it so far, and though it is limited due to it's early access nature, I certainly think this game has large potential. Crafting items, buidling your own safe-haven and fighting to the death the creatures that lurk on the island is by far a true survival experience. This game reminds me very much of "Lord of the Flies" book, which is not a bad thing. Obviously being an Alpha version of a game, it is going to have errors, problems and long load times, but that is what you expect. The graphics is well done, especially the weather pattern and day/night system. A day feels like a day and a night feels like a night. They are long, drawn out experiences, giving the player the true sense of being stranded on this island. I cannot wait for them to make this game complete and there is talk of co-op, which would add a new layer to the game. I dare you to go and explore the dark caves and find out the truth beneath this beautiful island world. It is not 100% polished, nor is it a popular 'genre' of gaming, but to me, this is a fun, sometimes challenging and most importantly a real experience. No flash graphics, no big story lines, just a basic concept of SURVIVE or DIE. I will give this a 4 out of 5 Beers.

I'll keep updating this post once new versions are released.\n\nPros:\n\n--- Great concept! It is really nice to see where this is going and to have a settlement with many buildings / objects is just great. As there are no objectives we are free to do whatever we wish to do. The game requires some getting used to but I like where this is going.\n--- The forest itself looks gorgeous thanks to the Unity engine. The tribesmen show some great A.I. - most notable for me so far was when one of them was just injured and his friend took him away before I could perform a coup de grace. At this point this is overshadowed by the strange behaviour they show from time to time but the direction they are going is commendable.\n--- Lots of things to build and to craft. And the number will (hopefully) increase greatly as the DIY / Survival guide the player utilises has a lot of empty / blurry pages.\n\nCons:\n\n--- Some only noticeable once you reload the game. Either some or all the already chopped up trees simply reappear. Also, I do not mind being able to find a huge quantity of sticks and rocks but they spawn at my settlement regularly. This  is an issue in the sense that it makes gameplay much easier.\n--- Some objects are floating a bit and placement of walls can be difficult at times. I "installed" a wall with door and due to the surface not entirely being flat the door glitched out and started moving constantly.\n--- Building rafts is not possible? I crafted one and it shot me into the air. The view was great and I survived the landing but the raft disappeared afterwards. It was pretty annoying.\n--- Still lots of things to complete. There are a lot of animals - deer, raccoons, turtles - but beside killing them the player cannot really do anything else.\n--- Clipping is possible close to cliffs / hills. I can easily get under some huge rocks that surround my settlement to access it more easily. They are, however, meant to completely protect me from one side.\n--- While the AI can show progress there are some strange behaviour patterns I have yet to understand.\n\nOverall, The Forest is a great survival game and I look forward to the new updates. I really want to see this in its entirety. While not having any specific objectives / quests I want to see the option to save the protagonist's child and it would be nice to receive some guidelines from time to time as to where you are supposed to go to find some good stuff. For instance, a map could be useful.","October 30, 2014","true","29.8"," 18 of 25 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","18","25","0","6"

Explore get more equipment and crafting materials.\nWhile its dark it is spooky in some sense due to the dark "no ♥♥♥♥" and the whooping and screaming of the natives, there is a silly cheaty way though, you can sleep through the night and reload saves since there are no autosaves. While the "Natives"-Cannibal Mutant ♥♥♥♥ers-are around in the daylight it is not as troubling since you can see them and most likely in the day time you most likely got the equipment to hold off.\n\nMultiplayer:\nWell while still in Alpha this game copes, only problem is the occasional "every 30 mins" save and re log on a server hosted with 8/8 of us running around, etc etc V-SYNC FML.\nAnyway it is much more fun with friends since you can screw around and still get stuff done, since there is two of you(or more) its great. I've done like 5 hours straight (apart from V-Syncing).\nSome iffy points its always the same tactic, build an alpine treehouse near the Spawn point (plane crash) then a defensive wall, some stick'n'stone spiky protector and then traps, GG you win you are safe., have fun exploring. Caves though or even the just out in the dark together is great together, Gotta Go Deeper to find the Joke nevermind, goign cave diving miles underground with a party of you never alone, pls no. While spooky you have banter and explore and find new things, if theres 5 of you easy tactic two with katanas out, two with torches to light the way and the other well bomb carry for the well you got to see them to believe it.\nIts just great, I don't really know what to say.\n\nPLOT/Spoilers maybe?:\nTa da with only having 20 hours under my belt so far, pun intended (John Cena is ma name while typing this).\nYou Crash on this Island but "Forest" first off no idea why the plane would explode, then you pass out, wake up theres a red dude maybe covered in blood who picks up your son walks off, then you pass out.\nThese are "Natives" I would say uncontacted, but then you explore, you find Film Crew and Camping tents, were you the only survivor or not? With the only evidence of carcasses, effigys or did they become the "natives"\nCollectables of images and cassette players, some images dating "82" so is this set on real life, I doubt.\nOkay okay, the "natives" lets call them "mutant cannibals" cave dwellers, naked people who run around and have no genitals. There are different types I'd say normal, but no, its not normal, you got super fast ones who run on all fours, brutes, giant ♥♥♥♥er multiarmed weird ♥♥♥ things, crawling mutant babies and a spider ♥♥♥♥♥, I don't even know if thats all of them.\nAnywho why they only attack with there arms adn the occasional "club"(ain't seen any use one) they neglect ranged attacks, rocks or bow, please what sort of Civilisation is this?\nAlso Giant "♥♥♥ Hole" in middle of map, just go look at it seriously, its not human made I hope, so its something to do with the background/story/plot.\n\nI don't know why I even typed this review I wasted like half an hour I could of used to play this game, it keeps me up at night, due to the fact I think I'm addicted and that it sometimes horrifies  me.\nAlright thats enough, I'm off Please Rate review etc. :)","November 4, 2015","true","31.6"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","86","12","14","5","0"

Explore get more equipment and crafting materials.\nWhile its dark it is spooky in some sense due to the dark "no ♥♥♥♥" and the whooping and screaming of the natives, there is a silly cheaty way though, you can sleep through the night and reload saves since there are no autosaves. While the "Natives"-Cannibal Mutant ♥♥♥♥ers-are around in the daylight it is not as troubling since you can see them and most likely in the day time you most likely got the equipment to hold off.\n\nMultiplayer:\nWell while still in Alpha this game copes, only problem is the occasional "every 30 mins" save and re log on a server hosted with 8/8 of us running around, etc etc V-SYNC FML.\nAnyway it is much more fun with friends since you can screw around and still get stuff done, since there is two of you(or more) its great. I've done like 5 hours straight (apart from V-Syncing).\nSome iffy points its always the same tactic, build an alpine treehouse near the Spawn point (plane crash) then a defensive wall, some stick'n'stone spiky protector and then traps, GG you win you are safe., have fun exploring. Caves though or even the just out in the dark together is great together, Gotta Go Deeper to find the Joke nevermind, goign cave diving miles underground with a party of you never alone, pls no. While spooky you have banter and explore and find new things, if theres 5 of you easy tactic two with katanas out, two with torches to light the way and the other well bomb carry for the well you got to see them to believe it.\nIts just great, I don't really know what to say.\n\nPLOT/Spoilers maybe?:\nTa da with only having 20 hours under my belt so far, pun intended (John Cena is ma name while typing this).\nYou Crash on this Island but "Forest" first off no idea why the plane would explode, then you pass out, wake up theres a red dude maybe covered in blood who picks up your son walks off, then you pass out.\nThese are "Natives" I would say uncontacted, but then you explore, you find Film Crew and Camping tents, were you the only survivor or not? With the only evidence of carcasses, effigys or did they become the "natives"\nCollectables of images and cassette players, some images dating "82" so is this set on real life, I doubt.\nOkay okay, the "natives" lets call them "mutant cannibals" cave dwellers, naked people who run around and have no genitals. There are different types I'd say normal, but no, its not normal, you got super fast ones who run on all fours, brutes, giant ♥♥♥♥er multiarmed weird ♥♥♥ things, crawling mutant babies and a spider ♥♥♥♥♥, I don't even know if thats all of them.\nAnywho why they only attack with there arms adn the occasional "club"(ain't seen any use one) they neglect ranged attacks, rocks or bow, please what sort of Civilisation is this?\nAlso Giant "♥♥♥ Hole" in middle of map, just go look at it seriously, its not human made I hope, so its something to do with the background/story/plot.\n\nI don't know why I even typed this review I wasted like half an hour I could of used to play this game, it keeps me up at night, due to the fact I think I'm addicted and that it sometimes horrifies  me.\nAlright thats enough, I'm off Please Rate review etc. :)","November 4, 2015","true","31.6"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","86","12","14","5","0"

I thought they would offer to let me borrow their tools when one of them attacked me. With my trusty hatchet I killed him in self defense. Horrified in the terrible act I performed I cut off his head and made a trophy and stuck it in front of my future home. The friend of the man I murdered in self defense saw what I did and tried to claim revenge for what she witnessed. As she ran at me, she in turn ran into the burning effigy and burned to death. Understanding that she was trying to help her deceased friend I placed the trophy of her head next to her buddy. Every time I see them together I smile. I like to think that they're an the after life holding hands and picking flowers, and that they have forgiven me as their death was one of confusion and tragedy.","April 22, 2015","true","2.5"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","86","12","14","14","0"

I do realise that the game is in early alpha and I respect that. I really hope the "end game" choice with in the final product is really worth the wait.\n\nBut for better things... Can't wait for COOP, I'm glad the dev's are not making this a PVP game because then it would be just another dayz-alike game in the end.\n\nOverall, for being made on the unity engine the game just looks really beatiful (I haven't seen many game on unity that look as good as this). The light shafts through the trees really do make the enviroments feel more alive around you.\n\nGameplay is pretty solid so far (Besides the bugs. Buy hey, it is in alpha) and the crafting system is pretty simple enough. Only thing I don't understand is, the protagonist is smart enough to make a bomb out of computer chips and coins. But can't make a simple bow and arrow? I do hope they add a bow.

If you're alone and alot of them surround you, RUN FOR YOUR LIFE! xD It's hillarious playing with your friends though. We love throwing tennis balls at eachother and poking eachother with sticks XD. Had alot of fun trying to kill this spider/octopus like creature. Dying, being revived, friend dying too, both dead, wake up in the plane, run for our stuff, run around more and scream, the creature kills us again, waking up, burning that motherforker to death finally! xD\n\nOverall, it's a really great game!

I laughed when the first thing I saw was a settlement with canibals who didn't look to happy to see me.\n\nFor those who want some other ways to play the game, here are some code you can enter in the main menu of the game:\n(1) vegetarianmode (Canibals only come out at night)\n(2) theironforest (Makes all buildings indestructable)\n(3) veganmode (Disables canibal spawning entirely)\n\nThis game has a great gameplay experience for all players new or experienced. Also, for a safer way to play, build a treehouse. It's much safer then building on the ground.\n\nOverall a bloody awesome game.\n\n10/10 would make a very big effigy of body parts again.","December 3, 2015","true","16.0"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","11","13","2","0"

The ai is sometimes buggy (it's the nature of early access) but usally works well and better then some AAA games. While it needs work it is getting it, each update is noticeable.

We’ve all been so excited about it, and it finally releases.\nBut before you drop your hard earned money on it, know a few things. At the current time, you are unable to save. You play until you can’t play anymore, and then restart your game the next time. It doesn’t matter how far you get. Saving just doesn’t work right now. To me that is a huge part of the game considering it is a survival game, and you need to be able to save considering the expense of resources some of the crafting takes.\nSo purchase it at your own risk. It’s a fun game so far, but once saving is fixed, and some of the bugs are sorted it will be even better.\n\nEDITS AS OF JUNE 17, 2014\n\nSaving is now here!

Moreover, all the screenshots made it seem like this would be a very dark (literally no sunshine) game. I just recently got it, and I'm very impressed and first want to say this game is not just a night-time scary game like the pictures & intro movie suggest. Sure, it has all that, but it also has a whole world of daylight, sunshine, and good visibility.\n\nGameplay is beautiful and smooth for me, with lots to explore and a good deal of customization available in terms of building your base. As I mentioned, I've played several similar titles where you build a base, and I think The Forest does a really good job in terms of allowing you to place custom shapes, as well as place blueprints to visualize things before actually building. I was quite impressed by the ability to place a custom floorplan, and then automatically have walls placed around it, with the ability to toggle window/door/full wall in each section. Really well done.\n\nMultiplayer/Co-op works great, too, but could use a little refining. I haven't found a good mechanism for hosting a dedicated server, which is somewhat limiting. There's also some "instancing" issues, for lack of a better word, where some players' clients will display certain objects, like Native effigies, but other players cannot see them. This seems limited to just a couple of nuanced items. Apart from that, co-op gameplay was quite smooth; no other syncing issues or crashes (although we only have 3 people in our game).\n\nAll in all, I'd highly recommend this game. Even if you're not into the Horror genre and find yourself thinking "Man, I wish Stranded Deep, Subnautica, Long Dark, etc were multiplayer"... this is a good buy.","February 22","true","74.0"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

Moreover, all the screenshots made it seem like this would be a very dark (literally no sunshine) game. I just recently got it, and I'm very impressed and first want to say this game is not just a night-time scary game like the pictures & intro movie suggest. Sure, it has all that, but it also has a whole world of daylight, sunshine, and good visibility.\n\nGameplay is beautiful and smooth for me, with lots to explore and a good deal of customization available in terms of building your base. As I mentioned, I've played several similar titles where you build a base, and I think The Forest does a really good job in terms of allowing you to place custom shapes, as well as place blueprints to visualize things before actually building. I was quite impressed by the ability to place a custom floorplan, and then automatically have walls placed around it, with the ability to toggle window/door/full wall in each section. Really well done.\n\nMultiplayer/Co-op works great, too, but could use a little refining. I haven't found a good mechanism for hosting a dedicated server, which is somewhat limiting. There's also some "instancing" issues, for lack of a better word, where some players' clients will display certain objects, like Native effigies, but other players cannot see them. This seems limited to just a couple of nuanced items. Apart from that, co-op gameplay was quite smooth; no other syncing issues or crashes (although we only have 3 people in our game).\n\nAll in all, I'd highly recommend this game. Even if you're not into the Horror genre and find yourself thinking "Man, I wish Stranded Deep, Subnautica, Long Dark, etc were multiplayer"... this is a good buy.","February 22","true","74.0"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

Well not too huge, but there is A LOT of stuff to explore e.g the many hidden caves that you will find, or the boats and the fotos.\n- The  AI - The cannibals AI is just sick, I could notice how tons of cannibals were trying to surround my house when I was leaving it to explore the island. Also the cannibals send scouters to find out  WHERE  you live and  WHAT  you are actually doing.\n\nSurely there are more pros, but I wanna come to the cons asap.\n\nCons:\n\n- Way too many animals on the beaches like turtles and crocodiles. So I have build my base near to the beach and there are always way too many crocodiles or turtles on the beach which is kind of a problem since the alligators are not really friendly.\n- The strength of the cannbials - I have experienced how a normal cannibal has almost killed me with just ONE punch. That is really unrealistic, especially because I need about 3-4 hits with an airplane axe to kill a cannibal.\n- The Caves. So the caves are really big. Way too big..\n\nBut I surely won't mention more cons since that game is only in early access and I like the game in his current state a lot.\n\nI definately recommend the game to anyone who would like to be the extreme version of Bear Grylls and would like to see how it is to survive on such a dangerous Island.\n\n10/10","February 7","true","395.2"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","12","16","0","2"

The natives who attack you have startled me many times, which makes it a creepy and fun experience to play in the dark. There is so much potential for this game, I can't wait to see where they go with it in the future. At this stage I would still recommend it and if they continue to add content, and improve upon the bugs, this may very well be one of the go-to survival games out there.","May 17, 2015","true","10.5"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","12","16","0","0"

The developers of The Forest really show true dedication to the game by their consistent efforts in updating and taking suggestions.  The Forest has different modes you can play which increase the replay value significantly.  With high graphic quality, you are really put into the action at every moment of the game.  For an in Alpha build game, the game play is shockingly smooth and highly entertaining.\n\nTo start off, I think anyone who has played around with a few early access games has been greatly disappointed with developers who just don't keep up with the game.  With The Forest, there is a very active community with truly dedicated developers.  Updates are released quite frequently ranging from once a week to once every three weeks.  In the updates, you can expect fixes to bugs and new content.  This new content always adds a whole new level of entertainment to the game.  If you feel that you are getting bored with The Forest, then just wait a week or two and you will have a blast with the newly added materials.  The developers truly lure you back into the game each update which allows you to get the most out of your money.\n\nAnyone who has played survival games knows that the game is only as good as its replay value.  With The Forest, the replay value is very high.  One reason goes back to what I had said earlier.  The developers are always adding more content.  Not only that but you can play in two different game modes.  The first game mode involves fighting the classic and merciless cannibals which are always trying to take a bite out of you.  Messed up right?  Not as messed as their effigies but I'll keep to my word and keep specific aspects of the game a mystery (unless you have watched it on youtube).  Another way you can play is without the cannibals.  This adds more realism to the game but be aware that playing this mode may get boring after a while.  This mode can be enabled by typing veganmode in the main menu screen (there is no text box to type it in).  I would like to add that The Forest has made a multiplayer aspect to the game which can handle 8 people (recommended max).  With this said, I hope replay value won't be on your mind when you buy the game.\n\nThe last point I'm going to make about the game are the graphics.  The graphics in The Forest are outstanding.  This truly throws you into full survival mode with this addition to realism.  Don't worry however, the graphics can be lowered sufficiently to meet the needs of slower and older computers.  Laptops are even given a recommended mode so your graphics shouldn't be an issue.   Visual effects may be glitched at times, and as said before, bugs are to be expected.  The bugs will not take away from the game play and are normally fixed in the next update.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend The Forest to anyone who enjoys survival based games.

If I can give a couple pieces of advice, craft the bow as quickly as possible, makes hunting and fighting way easier (you will still die). have no less than 3 fires and 3 effigies surrounding your camp at all times. if you encounter cannibals and you are not yet rambo, run away and hide in your cabin. if you do all of this you may survive for 3 days.\n\nps.

I myself havent seen such active developers in a while that dont just abandon a game when they have cashed in.\n\nThe gameplay itself will be expanded alot. in a way that u can form tribes with AI, visit funerals, attack other  clans, help friendly clans killenemy clans, clans help againsts beasts, new weapons, new armor, new overall building, new traps, new items , animal interaction.breeding, the more animals etc u kill the harder it gets later on.

The gameplay feels fluid and not clunky to me. The video settings I feel are ample for the game and I can only imagine the options getting more in depth. I feel like there is a huge amount of potential within this game and I can see it being a big contender when finally finished and polished up.\n\nMoving more into the game itself, you will see a lot of bugs because it'a an alpha although there are a few which will require you to reload the save but fortunately I haven't had that happen enough to me that I have complained. The A.I in the game suprise me each time I load back into singleplayer or even multiplayer, although the atmosphere completely changes on multiplayer as the isolation factor of being stuck in a forest/island alone with no idea of what could be hiding in the tree trunks above you or following you at a respectable distance. After the initial "settling in" you might find yourself running out of things after establishing a defendable base and eco-system within it. Saying that there is a nice cave system with a definetly fear element (Atleast to me, personally) once you go deep down into them, regardless if on multiplayer or singleplayer, you will find yourself letting out a noise or two or possibly some bodily fluids. After doing the exploration of The Forest/Island you sort of run out of things to do really.\n\nWrapping up my review, The graphics on the game are stunning even on the lowest settings, The gameplay feels fluid and fun although turning bland near the end of the initial setup, could do with more things to do which I'm anticipating.","January 23, 2015","true","135.2"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

STILL A LITTLE BUGGY BUT the saving works fine, you can build whatever you want,whenever you want, wherever you want. Maybe I would like it to have more things to craft. You can only craft a few things like an axe, molotov, bomb, headbomb, stealth armor, bow and arrow, paintings(only three of them). The main point of the game is to find your son. I do believe that's where they're heading. I found a little boys toy that seems like a key object which I can use for crafting.\n\nPROs:\n-great great graphics. Lightning effects are EXTREME.\n-Open World.\n-Survival horror\n-multiplayer!\n-Up to 8 players.\n-You can build as many houses as you want.\n-Savings are not lost upon 2 death.\n-EFFIGIEES!!! ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AWSOME. GO AWAY SATAN! GO AWAY!\n\n\nCONs:\n\n-Since an update... everytime you find the  plane survivors deadbodies it doesn't counts them anymore. It seems they took that out.That was very helpful because since you don't know what the hell you are supposed to do, that feature somehow hint me that I must find all the bodies to find my son/kid that was beside me on the airplane. The one THEY took.\n-Traps don't work. THEY step into them and it doesn't kills them or do something to them.\n-BOW and ARROW. you cannot aim. What I mean is that there isn't any sight for the cross or any aimpoint or something to help you aim.\n-Since they make it harder "the bird on the hand" thing its kinda difficult to get some feathers for the arrows.\n\nSuggestions:\n-Body counter\n-Objectives besides surviving... Don't know, once you find some camp, spy them and follow them.\n-Aimsight for the arrow.\n-Fast Travel between safe houses.(Only the cabin, so it won't be THAT easy to travel to "important" places within the game so fast.)\n-More animal traps.\n-More animal variety in general\n-Complete the crafting guide already.\n-Gun/Flaregun crafting. If you are able to craft a bomb why not a gun? a wood gun maybe? :D\n-When killing the rabbit, make some trasition effects not the rabbit meat on the floor without doing anything.\n-stealth armor or  mud are not effective at all for hiding. Only hiding behind trees or bushes.\n-Include LADDERS so you can build tall houses or another tall building.\n-Which leads to more building crafting. Not only shelters.\n-Some kind of Delta Wing, mini plane, car to move within the woods.\n-Tree hiding/ Climbing\n-Tree houses\n-Stone Cabins\n-Shovel and sand to make glass\n\nBesides the suggestions and stuff(Its all because I survived over a 100 days or so in the game and Im bored waiting for something new to build/craft/kill XD) I totally recommend this one NOW. Since it has tons of fun and you won't be scared until you hear/see your first one. THEY are fast.

This has to be one of the most impressive games from an indie developer I have ever seen in a really long time and I thank them for that. For an indie title, this game looks so good that it kind looks like a triple-A title. Not only does it look so great but the crafting system is amazing too.

My mainlanguage is not English,\nso i hope you can excuse my mistakes. I will shortly notice the main theme and a longer explanation of "WHY".\n\n1. Lower the Difficulty OR Make it adjustable.\nWHY: I am experienced with survival games and it took me quite some time to figure out how to survive. I can imagine that beginners might even give this game up before they've even started to enjoy it. It started with the predators which you can easily 1o1, but in a group they are superior and if you don't have better weapons than your beginner axe, you are pretty much dead. Again and Again.\n\n2. Items reset when i load my saved game.(BUG)\nEXPLANATION: As this is the alpha, bugs are being expected and i'm totally assure of that. However, when i loaded my saved game, all collected things in my inventory were gone. Only the leaves and the Axe from the Airplane were left. My Buildings were all there, but my whole Inventory was gone, which resulted in a fast death. ||||| This bug makes this game UNENJOYABLE from the moment it appears. This was the point where i stopped playing (which shoud be understandable if you farm hours for something from which you know, it will reset anyways after you logout) so you better fix this fast. |||||\n\n3. A Change in "Saving the Game" OR/AND the ability to pause your game while being in the Menue.\nWHY: Currently you can only save the game by sleeping in your shelter, however if there is some kind of an emergency or people just want to leave the game fast, make a break or something like that the only possibility would be the shelter, but what if this shelter is being camped by a Crowd of Predators which you can't fight at the moment? Then you are FORCED to stay ingame until you solve this somehow. If you could just save the game instantly by going into the Menue and even create a pause while doing so, you would make the game a lot more comfortable for all players.\n\nThese are my 3 Points and i hope the Developers get to read them.\nNumber 2 is my minor Problem since i really found my addiction to this game but in an unplayable state.\nDespite these rather negative Aspects which shall be fixed soon, this game provided me an uncomparable experience and i'm looking forward on playing it again once the minor bugs are gone. I recommend it.\nGreetings","June 11, 2014","true","77.3"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","1"

Even fewer that make you genuinely afraid of the enemy to the point that hearing their call ring through the air puts you on instant alert and sends you straight into fight or flight mode. The Forest does all this and more.\nThe preset build options are excellent and can quickly allow you to build up a safe place to store weapons and supplies but the custom build options take that to a whole new level. At my current progress in my most recent save I've built a platform at the opening to the plane fueselage with a log cabin, fire pit and I am currently in the process of putting walls around it, once done I intend to build ramps up and around a tree so I can place a tree house near the top for a good vantage point.\nThe challenge in the game is to be able to do all that while avoiding enemies, catching or finding food to eat and locating or creating safe water sources to drink. The game has an excellent feature where by typing 'veganmode' at the games main screen you can turn off the enemies, build a base, go back to the main menu and type 'meatmode' to turn the enemies back on, reloading your savegame and you can use your newly built base as a starting point to go exploring but beware, the more days you stay alive, the more difficult and aggressive the enemy become.","July 25, 2015","true","61.3"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","0"

As I was playing it and building a massive log fortress, making bombs and molotov cocktails and cutting down trees with dynamite I started to compare this game and that film, and I also started to question my motives as well.\n\nIn the film, yes, they did find an actual cannibal tribe but the cannibals weren't ♥♥♥♥♥♥ or anything, I mean they ate people and stuff but that's kind of just a part of their culture, they didn't go and try to kill the film crew to eat them or anything. The only reason the cannibals killed them in the end was because the film crew was terrorizing them in order to make them look like the monsters we wanted to see them as.\n\nIn this game, you find a tribe of cannibal mutants that at first seem a little curious when they first see you, but as soon as nightfall arrives they find you and they try to kill you and eat you. But are they REALLY monsters? After all, they aren't actually human, so technically it isn't really cannibalism. As I played I realized that in this situation neither of us were monsters... I mean the ones that are like spiders are monsters but whatever.\n\nThen I realized that they were just acting like every other normal human being would given the current circumstances (besides the cannibalism). They came over to check me out and when they started beating the crap out of my cabin, something that they'd never even seen before and to them might be some kind of blight on their homeland, I killed a couple of them with an ax and lit another one on fire with a molotov cocktail. Of course they're going to send more and more guys after me in an attempt to kill me, I'm just slaughtering the poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s left and right singlehandedly. As far as they know I'm some kind of demon.\n\nBut then again I'm not really doing anything wrong either. All I'm trying to do is survive, and I don't think that cannibalism is good, so when they try to play me like that I have to cut one of their heads off and put a bomb in it.\n\nOkay, maybe I went a little too far with that. I think I might actually be the monster.","July 31, 2015","true","10.7"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","77","10","13","9","0"

It's so much fun, especially with friends. The game is extremely immersive to the point where when you actually get back to your home after exploring, it feels like getting back home after a day out. It builds a huge amount of tension when exploring caves or dark areas and geniune fear when you hear the screams of the enemies. It's been a long time since a game has made me excited to come home and play and The Forest currently fills that role. This being early access this is a sign of a top quality finished product (when it is finished) and a sure sign that the developers are fully invested in creating the best game they can make. You'll never know how much you like The Forest until you actually play it and it is well worth the current asking price (£10.99 in it's current state). The multiplayer although needing some tweaks (plenty of time, early access afterall) is the most fun I've had on a game in years and the in-game voice feature of using a walkie-talkie to communicate with your friends all over the map is a great idea. Don't review games often, this probably makes no sense but damn, The Forest is good and is only going to get better.","January 11","true","6.9"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

My favourite examples are the exploding body glitch where if you try cut up a dead cannibal body you get flung in the air like you're being rocket propelled and die, the ground disappearing act where you fall through the ground and end up somehow swimming under the ground with the trees sprouting up around you, and the roundhouse kick where the canniballs kick you and you whiz over the entire map and into the sea on the other side of the island.\n\nNow you may be thinking, well hang on you're saying bad things about it when you're meant to be reccomending it?\nThis is true, and so I just want you to know that despite the problems, it is a great game which keeps you on edge constantly and really incorporates you into the game.\n\nOverall I do recommend this game as it is very detailed and has surprises at every corner keeping you enthralled.

The creators of the game really care about the community too. I've posted loads of feedback/errors and most of the time, someone whos created the game or just the fan base responds quickly. If no one responds they go ahead and release a hotfix to fix the issue. The game is in alpha but who cares, buy it now and watch The Forest rise to its undoubted potential. seriously though xD\n\nThe game requires a decent pc to run, but all this will be fixed with optimization over time, so nothing to worry about there. I have a GTX 770 and an i5 3570 and have no problem running the game 60 FPS while recording. Think of this game as GTA 5 ( the open world aspect ) meets minecraft ( the survival aspect ) having a baby naming it johnny but then legally changing it to The Forest and constantly feeding it more and more updates to make it better. And there you have The Forest. I don't recommend this game, i honestly think everyone should own it. Like i said GTA meets minecraft.

It's time for an adventure.\n\nLater: I start building shelter, for the cannibals, so they can't find me.\n\nDay 2:\nHad a good night, only one cannibal patrol, so I'm good. Made a better axe, using a stick and a rock. It's faster slightly.\n\nLater: Killed a couple of attacking Cannibals in self defence.\n\nDay 3/4/5/6:\nI made a better base on the beach, with a head thingy to scare away some cannibals. It's kind of working. I hope\n\nLater: Saw multiple patrols. One ran towards me and I wiped them out. BIGGER SCARING AWAY THINGY.\n\nDay 7/8:\nI'm heading for a cannibal camp. I remember seeing it in the woods. I'm making a small shelter for the night.\n\nLater: No one in sight.\n\nDay 9:\n\nI attacked a camp, killing almost everyone, took some stuff, then got attacked and knocked out by a female cannibal on a tree. I find my self in a cave. WAIT. DON'T KILL ME!!\n\n---Extract Ends Here---\n\nFor the real review, that was my gameplay experiance, it was FUN, trust me. The game is suspenseful and requires you to use the most of your equipment and strategies to survive the says and nights, from dying of either natural or being eaten by a crazed foreign cannibal.\n\nThe graphics are beautiful, especially for an indie game.\n\nI haven't got much more to say really.\n\nPros\n+ Beautiful Graphics\n+ Suspenseful Gameplay\n+ Fun combat\n+ Easy to use Backpack\n+ Doesn't leave anything unused.\n\nCons\n- Can be buggy, but I won't let this affect the score since it's EA\n- A bit of a clunky AI.\n- Could be more easier to use Crafting system, and it should be able to show you recipes.\n\nOverall:\nThis game mixes Survival and Action into a hasteful battle between life and death. As you scour from the beaches to the forest, you are never safe. Be careful, out there, since I think this game is a MUST-BUY\n\n9/10","August 29, 2014","true","8.7"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

After awakening again I decided to put my serious cap on. I quickly looted everything from the plane. I jumped out of the plane and started gathering all the resources I could. After a few minutes I went straight into the forest.\n\nJournal Entry 2\n\nI found a large rock wall face, "perfect!" I exclaimed to myself. I logged some trees down and made a small hut to sleep in. After I had finished I had something catch the corner of my eye and pretty far off I saw three sprinting bodys quickly vaninshing through the trees. I quickly hatched a plan.\n\nJournal Entry 3\n\nI went off closer to where they were and made a small fire. I ate some rabbit tasted very good. I made note to myself there was a small pond I could maybe gather fish from later. I had gathered some rabbits and lizard skin preparing for the worst. I quickly ran back to my small hut which could still see the fire and after a few minutes of watching my plan had succeeded.\n\nJournal Entry 4\n\nThey had all gathered around the fire. I took this chance to go around and on top of the rock wall to get a better look at them. After getting to the top and walking for a little. I realized I was to high up and the trees were blocking my ability to see them. I thought maybe I could get closer and see them looking down the hill.\n\nJournal Entry 5\n\nIt's dark I thought to myself, and maybe I should go back. But then I saw what looked like to be a flashlight aiming up towards me blocked by a couple trees. I panicked and ran down the hill away from the light source, towards the fire I had made recently. I heard multiple screeches right behind me along with the light aiming at me.\n\nJournal Entry 6\n\nI had just made it to the fire, I got behind it. They were screaming and hollering at me a few meters away, scared of fire are we? I started getting extremely confident and started getting closer to the three of them. They started trying to make me run by running at me then stopping. I wasn't falling for it, they surrounded me, I didn't care I stared at the middle one which I assume was the chieftain.\n\nJournal Entry 7\n\nI watched him lunge toward me, keeping my clam, I sidestepped and smashed my axe across his face blood splattering all over my arms. I retreated behind the fire and laughed as the Chief full of rage, full on sprinted towards me and stepped in the fire and caught on fire. He started hollering, with his allies just watching me.\n\nJournal Entry 8\n\nThe Chieftan collaspsed presumably dead. I had inadvertently gained more confindence and charged at the other male and swung my axe into him. Making him stagger backwards at the same time the female lunged at me but missed, I took this chance to run back behind the fire. I got behind the fire just in time to see him running at me with rage.\n\nJournal Entry 9\n\nHe stumbled into the fire and caught fire, after he dropped to the ground. The female made a loud screech and sprinted away from me. I saw a flashlight beam in the opposite direction of where the female went. With my newfound technique of killing them, I boldly went towards the light beam with my bloody axe.\n\nJournal Entry 10\n\nI had easily gotten their attention and started sprinting back towards the fire. Only to see the female who had ran off brought back friends. I could feel my confidence depleteing. I got to the fire and was surrounded by three groups of three and maybe that female that ran off, I could not tell when there is nine of them surrounding me.\n\nJournal Entry 11\n\nIn my mind I was smashing the panic button repeatedly, but was able to calm myself a little by forcing myself to breath slower and deeper. I was running around the fire to "try" avoiding them to hit me in the back, which was sort of working but also making myself dizzy.\n\nJournal Entry 12\n\nThey all started getting bold and started to close down on me, as the adrealine flowed through me, all the sound drowned out and I started lashing out randomly with my axe while running around the fire in circles not touching it once astoundingly. I was smashing faces left and right while getting hit a few times. A couple of them fell in the fire, I think I had killed a few with my axe.\n\nJournal Entry 13\n\nI think there was only a couple left, I still felt great. But all of a sudden I got hit and blacked out.\nI awoke in a cave with my head hurting, I luckily still had my lighter for light and gathered everything down here. I had ate some snacks and rested a little bit. I started up the cave and took a turn and found some weird books and candles.\n\nJournal Entry 14\n\nI kept going down the cave and found a mutant monstrosity that was absoutly revolting with mutilated bodys put together.\nIt seemed to not notice my presence and I got right next to it. I was stricken with curosity and went in front of it. I'm not sure if it ever made a noise, but that was the last of my vison.\n\n10/10\nAl","June 4, 2014","true","18.7"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","1"

Immersion.\nI think the gaming experience in this is amazing!\nThe Hunger! The Thirst! How eating doesn't heal you (That much)!\nI find this to be an amazing experience so far.\nAt first I thought "man, I'm weak as heck, I died in like one hit". And then I forgot to save after quitting later.\nThen I came back and I was like, "Oh, I can block", which totally made fighting easier.\nAnd also, upgradable tools. Now even though it kind of sounds ridiculous, I like it.\nFeathers make your axe faster, and teeth make it more damaging. Also, those items can be applied to your weapons using tree sap! Pretty good.\n\nSecondly... Horror.\nNow I'm not sure if anyone would consider this horror, but I really like the whole "Dark and Alone" atmosphere. Real spooky guys. Its totally dark.. No flashlight? Well then you're screwed :D\nIts near pitch black at night and you can't really see much. And that's really cool, personally, I like the dark atmoshere in games. Totally dark and then out of nowhere.. HEY LOOK A PERSON.\nIts pretty logical that cannibals like that would come out at night for hunting. The only hard part is staying alive without a fire to drive them off. You better light it before you sleep!\nAlso you get the occasional day scouts..\n\nAnd Finally... Survival.\nNow I'm not going to go into detail because it would be nice for people to try for themselves.\nBut the components of the survival consist of Thirst, Hunger, Cleanliness, and Health.\nWhich each seem equally balanced at the time. Totally legitimate.\n\nAnyways, the devs did a great job, and I love this great game.\nIf anyone is in for some good survival, get this, you won't regret it.\nBut hey, don't take it from me, try it for yourself!","March 18, 2015","true","87.9"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/djsoulfck/recommended/242760/","djsoulfck","DJSF - off @ twitch.tv/sinlike","http://steamcommunity.com/id/djsoulfck/","416 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFirst off, I have to admit something very important: this game scares the absolute ♥♥♥♥ out of me. This has been the first game in a long time that actually made me scare quit in sheer panic, and I will provide some scenarios later.\n\nIf you like survival + needs management, crafting/building, horror, exploration, and death, then give this game a try - I think you will really enjoy it; or even really enjoy hating it for scaring/killing you so much, but also making you come back for more.\n\nAs an early access game, this has easily been one of the most impressive alphas I have ever played. The aesthetics are fantastic, and, if you can run it, you will be in for a very nice treat the first time you gaze out on the ocean from within a forest of dense trees and foliage. The music and sounds are very subtle, and a very faint scary-movie-like-noise will warn you when enemies are nearby (crazy story later on).\n\nThe controls are easy to familiarize yourself with - there are many button prompts as seen in the Dead Island games (ex: key bind "e" hovering over lootable items). At times, however, the controls may not be as responsive, and you may often find yourself repeatedly trying to pick up items on the ground (the key is to make sure you can see the button prompt; try walking around it and panning the mouse around until you get it). The learning curve is moderate to difficult if you aren't used to open-world survival games - you really have to balance securing your shelter/food and watching out for the enemy. You WILL die many times during your initial playthroughs - do not be alarmed, just take a deep breath and learn from each experience.\n\nAs the sole survivor of a brutal airplane crash on an island inhabited by cannibals, your first task will be to immediately loot the inside of the airplane and the immediate surroundings (you can use your axe to break open luggages). Be quick, as the crash site is randomized and so are enemy patrols - you could have several minutes to just one or two. A good thing to do is to loot the inside, run to the nearest collection of bushes, and hide. Wait until you see the cannibals (they will most likely come to investigate). When they leave, loot the outside, then find a place to establish your base.\n\nYou have to manage your needs, primarily hunger and energy. To do this, you can eat some of the candy bars you looted from the airplane wreck to satisfy your hunger. You can drink some cans of sodapop to regain energy, or go to sleep. Note that sleeping in any form of shelter is currently the only way to save.\n\nThe inventory management is really cool - you can see all your items laid out on a blanket when you go to your inventory. From here, information on each item is given, and you have the option of crafting items. One such item (very useful against enemy mobs, especially in the beginning when you are weak) is a molotov cocktail, made by combining one bottle of alcohol with one piece of cloth. Another thing I really like about this game is the fluidity of gameplay - when you are looking at your inventory or have pressed ESC, the game is actually still progressing - so you could close your inventory only to see group of cannibals ruunning toward you.\n\nCombat can get very difficult, but the latest patch allowing you to block with the fire axe (starting weapon) has made this element less of a suicide. I have been one-hit killed a number of times, thrown forcefully into a tree, and I am unsure whether this is part of the game or a glitch.\n\nThe AI is amazing! The personalities and tendencies of each cannibal can vary - some will cry over the death of their allies, others will bow before you, and many will pull and drag a downed ally away from you. Females seem to be the most aggressive, however, almost all cannibals will become extra aggressive during the night. Enemies will do different things when they encounter you - some will just watch you curiously, others will wait for reinforcements, and others might even run away.\n\nThe developers are very active, with times given right in the menu of how long before the next build is released. There is a peaceful game mode, with no cannibals to worry about - this can be useful for helping you get your bearings on the game mechanics.\n\nStory time!\n\nSo there I was, using my axe to open the luggages littered a good distance from the airplane crash. I had scouted and waited for enemy patrols, but saw no one. Since I was trying to open the luggages as quickly as possible, I had been looking down the entire time. I heard the faintest noise, but thought nothing of it. A few minutes later, I hear it again, so I look up (see nothing) and turn around. No sudden music, just a group of 3 cannibals staring at me curiously.\n\nI shouted "OH ♥♥♥♥!" in the psychology lab of my school. I rarely shout during horror games.\n\nRage quit story!\n\nIt was the dead of night.\n\nI had been a short distance from my camp chopping down some wood to build my cabin, when I noticed a group of 4 cannibals (one holding a torch) walking toward my camp. I immediately backpedal further into the forest to hide, almost running to a separate duo, one of which had a flashlight fixed to a pole attached to his back (like a lantern banner). I panic and backpedal some more before they spot me, but the lantern-man's ally sees me and rushes to engage.\n\nWe trade attacks and I am seeing red. I risk a glance to my left and spot the lantern-man rushing toward me. The fighting had caught the attention of the foursome at my camp, and I see them begin walking toward me.\n\nIt is at this point where my assailant decided to climb up the closest tree.\n\nI nope'd right out of there.\n\nIf you are a survival, horror, open-world, and/or crafting junkie, then get this game and give it a try.\n\nRecommend, and be prepared to die and get scared!","July 16, 2014","true","21.1"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/paulginis/recommended/242760/","paulginis","PaugiN","http://steamcommunity.com/id/paulginis/","55 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nToday is the first day I played this cool game. I survived for 3 in-game days!!! First my plane crashed and a naked guy took my son. Secondly I searched the half of the plane (the other half was far away from me) and then I get out of it. I opened every suitcase I found near the half airplane, but when I watch at the hill behind the airplane "tail" I saw three naked guys stare at me, one of them had 2 sticks stucked on his head with 2 skulls on them "THAT'S COOL I want one of these" and another one had also a stick stucked on his head but he had a skull with a flashlight on it "It's a good accessory for dark nights but it's so funny at daylight" ^^. These 3 guys were so kind and they just let me  farm the whole area and search for a place to set up my house. After 10mins of searching and learning how to play the game (and eating every single chocolate I had :P ) I heard a random creepy sound and I realized that I saw a cool canibal, then I looked around and there were like 15 canibals around me running and stalking me. So I walked in The Forest like a man walking in the morning on the way to job (cause my bro told me not to run when I see one of them, until they start running). After 3mins of walking i realized that nobody was near... so I continue searchin a place for my house. After 1min I was in a big peacefull plain, but when I looked around carefully I spotted like 20 enormous tents, some creepy statues, a lot of dead bodies and so many tennis balls (in the bodies and everywhere). I was in that area like 5mins (IT WAS THEIR BASE!!) and none of these guys came at me, but that creepy music was so unbearableness scary so I get away from there . After 5mins I found a hill (it was night... so dark), below that hill was the sea (with fish and stuff) so I decided to build my house there. I placed the "plan" of the walls and started gathering wood from the lovely trees. After 4 trees I was half way there... when I realized that I was covered in blood "wtf?" so I went down the hill to wash myself in the sea. When I get down there I saw 2 guys watching me behind the bushes, so I started movin backwards and then I get into my half house. (P.S the wall was facing the slope and  I was exposed at the side of the cliff). I was next to my fire for 30secs when I heard a breath from the other side of wall and I get out there to check it "BAD IDEA". When I get out there I saw a big guy with 3sticks-skulls on him (I think he was the leader), I was staring at him like 5secs and the he just screamed and call like 5 of them. I was f***ed up, I fight them with my stone hatchet, I hit each one like 3-4 times in the face but nobody died. Then one of them  punched me in the face and they get me in their "home". It was a cave full of dead humans. In this cave I found an iron hatchet and a flare gun (which had infinite ammo :P ). So I started to search a way out. I faced like 3 of them and set them on fire with my flare gun. Then I found a small room in this cave where 2 canibals with 6-8 hands each of them were dancing techno :P. I decided to not fight them, so I continue searching for an exit and I found it. It was a wooden wall which I broke down. Then when I get out I started running in The Forest and after 10secs I heard that music again and when I watched behind there were like 10 of them chasing me. I was running like 1min (and killed 3 of them with my flare gun) and then I was on a cliff again and I just turn around and start shooting them... I killed 5 more and then the others run away. At last I went down the hill and found a lake, so I tried to get in it and wash my body (cause I was covered in blood). I did it but when I get out, there were 3 of them staring at me and one of them punched me like a boxer and killed me :(. Not a cool end of the story but I have fun playing that game and I will play it more and more hours. I think you will like to play it w/e game types you like. It's a realy nice, cool, scary, exciting, tough and challenging game, which I highly recommend!!!

I survived for 3 in-game days!!! First my plane crashed and a naked guy took my son. Secondly I searched the half of the plane (the other half was far away from me) and then I get out of it. I opened every suitcase I found near the half airplane, but when I watch at the hill behind the airplane "tail" I saw three naked guys stare at me, one of them had 2 sticks stucked on his head with 2 skulls on them "THAT'S COOL I want one of these" and another one had also a stick stucked on his head but he had a skull with a flashlight on it "It's a good accessory for dark nights but it's so funny at daylight" ^^. These 3 guys were so kind and they just let me  farm the whole area and search for a place to set up my house. After 10mins of searching and learning how to play the game (and eating every single chocolate I had :P ) I heard a random creepy sound and I realized that I saw a cool canibal, then I looked around and there were like 15 canibals around me running and stalking me. So I walked in The Forest like a man walking in the morning on the way to job (cause my bro told me not to run when I see one of them, until they start running). After 3mins of walking i realized that nobody was near... so I continue searchin a place for my house. After 1min I was in a big peacefull plain, but when I looked around carefully I spotted like 20 enormous tents, some creepy statues, a lot of dead bodies and so many tennis balls (in the bodies and everywhere). I was in that area like 5mins (IT WAS THEIR BASE!!) and none of these guys came at me, but that creepy music was so unbearableness scary so I get away from there . After 5mins I found a hill (it was night... so dark), below that hill was the sea (with fish and stuff) so I decided to build my house there. I placed the "plan" of the walls and started gathering wood from the lovely trees. After 4 trees I was half way there... when I realized that I was covered in blood "wtf?" so I went down the hill to wash myself in the sea. When I get down there I saw 2 guys watching me behind the bushes, so I started movin backwards and then I get into my half house. (P.S the wall was facing the slope and  I was exposed at the side of the cliff). I was next to my fire for 30secs when I heard a breath from the other side of wall and I get out there to check it "BAD IDEA". When I get out there I saw a big guy with 3sticks-skulls on him (I think he was the leader), I was staring at him like 5secs and the he just screamed and call like 5 of them. I was f***ed up, I fight them with my stone hatchet, I hit each one like 3-4 times in the face but nobody died. Then one of them  punched me in the face and they get me in their "home". It was a cave full of dead humans. In this cave I found an iron hatchet and a flare gun (which had infinite ammo :P ). So I started to search a way out. I faced like 3 of them and set them on fire with my flare gun. Then I found a small room in this cave where 2 canibals with 6-8 hands each of them were dancing techno :P.

But this can be forgiven, the graphics are pretty sweet, and the game runs fairly smoothly, considering the forest is only in alpha, the prospects of the game are very promising, i have no doubt that these improvements/tweaks will be made in the forseeable future and the game will develop into an enjoyable and fun experience.","June 5, 2014","true","2.1"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/joelvn/recommended/242760/","joelvn","Joelvn [Streaming]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/joelvn/","2075 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nTo start of I'd like to say It's got a recommendation because of the potential this game has.\nWith that I would Like to add that if you are short on cash and looking for a game to play,\nI would pick up another game. Why? Simply because The Forest is In it's Alpha state, and with that\nhas a ton of bugs and flaws. It's barely playable in this state. so I would suggest you to buy it in a later state.\n\nAs for the game itself, not including the bugs,\n\nThe Forest is a game with lots of potential, and I'm sure the developers will build towards the expectations.\nThe Graphics are great, especially for an indie game. The enemies excist of cannibals, Mutants and wildlife.\nCrafting in The Forest has been kept simple, and for that I hope there will be improvements, more crafting options and more crafting materials, wich on that part I'm sure will come.\nWhat I love about the game is that there are patrols roaming around the island, giving you the feeling your never safe, and always watched. this mechanic is really well done. The cannibals also climb in trees, so you have to be constantly on your toes if you want to survive in this horror survival.\n\n\n\nThe story:\n\nThe Game starts you off in a plane with your son. unfortunately the plane crashes and you and your son are one of the few survivors of the crash. when you come to your sences you see a man walking up to your son, taking him with him. leaving you falling back to black out again. when you wake up later, wounded and dehydrated in the plane wreck, you start off with some handy supplies such as your backpack, Lighter and a axe found in a stewardesses body. you find out that you have little time to look around the plane wreck and you'll have to start gathering resources and build a shelter to save and rest in, and a fire to stay warm at and cook food.\n\nTips and Tricks:\n\nAlways be careful picking a location for your shelter since the cannibals patrol the island.\nIf you 'Die' in the game the first time you will be taken to one of the cannibals caves, with them probably assuming you were dead. but beware, if you Die a second time you will really be dead, and you WILL have to start all over again.\nYou are a really buff man, and you can carry 2 logs at a time!\nThere are suitcases lying around the plane wreck and some boat wrecks. they can be opened by hitting them with your axe.\nPress 'I' to open your inventory, and press 'B' to open up your survival guide.\nDo NOT let the cannibals flank you. if you encounter a group of cannibals, I would advise you to run and hide. if fighting is inevitable, keep an eye out for all the enemies. they WILL charge at you from behind. If they find your camp and they are attacking you, try to mak them run in the campfire, this way they will be weak enough to take out.\nBEWARE: some cannibal corpses are known to explode when you hit them.\n\nThis was my review of The Forest.\n\nI would rate it a solid 8/10 when the bugs are fixed, and if they add more features to the game I will reconsider this.","June 3, 2014","true","5.1"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","2"

Here's my lets play and full impressions of the game. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ozETWRAYPI\n\nThe Forest offers a visually immersive survival experience, with the addition of co-op it would become a staple for survival horrors. The AI are incredibly intelligent and frightening at the same time. There is great attention to detail within the game instead of just a large landscape without any character. Majestic mountains and secret oasis's can be found around the island. There are so many things to find in this game that it makes it worth getting simply for the exploration.\n\nThis is the first game that I have found in open alpha that hasn't disappointed me, with the exception of contagion. The game is obviously not finished, but it is poised to become an absolutely great game if the little bugs can be fixed. The game is ENTIRELY playable at this point however, I highly recommend purchasing it before the price goes up.","June 1, 2014","true","5.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

We started off with a small tree house and transformed it to a massivse fortress you can build amazing houses with tree bridges and large towers, boats (even though they are being worked on). Still many designs and ways to costomize along with many deadly unique traps and the hack and slash with cannibals. Chopping off heads and lighting them on fire. A quite large map and still growing, many caves (which are the best and make the game 5x harder) my expirence with the cave was exciting and had me scared every corner I turned. I wont even get started what i found down there, Ill leave it up to you.

I wish I had gotten my hands on it sooner.\n\nThe combat is fluid and responsive. From my experience in most other survivor genre games, the combat animations and mechanics are clunky, lackluster and usually down-right laughable. The Forest pays special attention to polish, making sure that immersion is never sacrificed. Animations and impacts are all very tangible and rewarding.\n\nThe audio is great too. Lots of variety in this department, and there's a casual increase in the amount of sinister sound effects that you hear throughout The Forest as the nights carry on and you expand your marooned empire.\n\nThe enemies are tough and will hunt you down until they knock you unconcious and drag you down to the caves below the surface, effectively into the mouth of hell. You must then fight your way back out in the pitch black armed with only your melee weapon and a lighter.\n\nIt's worth every dollar of the fifteen asked for it during early access.\n\nBought it yesterday and have already spent 12+ hours on it.. i've gotten lost in The Forest\n\n\n\n\n\n","October 3, 2015","true","38.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

The Devs are definitely making progress with the game pretty quickly I'd say, compared to a few others I and my friends have invested in.\n\nIn short and not really breaking the game down like everyone else, I recommend the game fully; Cannibals, Head Pikes, Your fellow passengers being turnt into contorted tennis ball dispensers, building tree houses, looting the Cannibals territories along with their makeshift camps, cave exploration (though honestly I haven't done that much cause well, being underground in a cave bearly lit by either a flashlight, torch, flare, or my handy lighter along with an unknown amount of cannibalistic mutants after my lucky charms, I tend to keep high ground.), Nature, Hunting and Fishing, Molotovs. I really shouldn't have to say more, Buy this game, Support the Devs, and Enjoy, I have a feeling there is only more to come.","April 16, 2015","true","24.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","5","5","2","0"

It seems anything you apply the noun of the location it seems to give it a type of pristineness, whether admerason or melevilance. The Forest lands on the latter.\nThe game experience is rather well put together in its current state (pre alpha). But where to start..\nThe graphics are are ok, to me the shadows will be the focus when in the woods trying to gather resources. The shadows are done well so far, the shadows move with the sun, diminish in the morning and thicken at sun set. I am sure these shadows will be your worst enemy out there in the future updates since this is where those crazy man eaters are hiding, so keep an eye out.Some of the graphics will seem dated in its current form but they do not take away from the horror/suspense.\nThe sound effects are quality so far, some need improvement. Right now there is a warning song played when an enemy sees you and changes when they enter attack mode. I wish they made more noise when walking and make sounds themselves. I think the music is a good way to know something is watching you but I would prefer to be able to hear them walking, breathing or talking in order to spot these guys but not yet (this kind of takes away the immersion effect). The rest of the sound effects work for the game, from chopping trees down, swimming, walking and jumping, The atmosphere also benefit from the sound design from rainfall to bird songs all give a good level of immersion to the game.\nThe Animations and models are basic right now. Swing hatchet at randomly chosen native trying to kill you (one of only 4 I see) , repeat. Now there are stronger enemies but they too also only share a few different models. With that said these models (or lack of) do not take away from the game play at all, the models are terrifying in any situation. The firee light and animations are also done well and the light from the fire does get blocked from an object and creates their own shadows. But don't get too close to your fire pit/fire pole or you will be burned. But these also burn the enemies and wildlife too. So place some fires around camp and they help fend off those bad guys.\nOverall the game is quite fun so far, tho a bit repetitive on building and crafting (as of now) there are only a few diff buildings you can make and walls to help protect you more will come I am sure, but after a few hours of play you will have built all buildings/traps that you have. So the main question is do you wait for the actual release or is it good enough to play and buy now?? I say buy it!! You will not disapointed in this survival horror game. With updates coming out almost once a month the content coming will keep you interested in the game. Each new start also creates a new starting location or new map (not sure on this part) but each start is a new place so far. Buy it be safe and get to chopping trees!! Its your only hope to survive; BUILD!\n~n00bz~  rating scale:\nGraphics (pre alpha) 6/10\nSound/music: 7/10\nGameplay: 9/10\nReplay value: 8/10\nGlitchiness (not factored in overall): 5/10 (just weird stuff happens at random times)\nCreep Factor: 7/10\nOverall pre-alpha:  7.4\nPassover or Buy: Buy\n","September 13, 2014","true","19.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I'm really excited for the new patch that is coming out, I cannot wait to see what fixes they do and what they add.\n\nHere are a few things to know about the game before you purchase it:\n-This game is in Alpha, which means that it is not even remotely close to being finished.\n-There are many bugs, especially in co-op mode. It is still playable, especially if you're patient enough.\n-You can only have ONE save right now. If you start a new game and save and you had a game going previously, you will lose your other save.\n-There are terrain bugs that will make it hard to do certain things (ie trees that are growing out of large rocks can be impossible to chop down)\n-The sunlight is obnoxiously bright at times and will make it a lot harder to see anything because it darkens anything around it if you're facing it (I'm hoping they fix this eventually because it can be a real pain)\n-This game is totally worth buying.

Also, one must keep in mind, there are no 12yo KOSer's running around becuase its a single player experience... for now. When they do plan on implementing multiplayer, it will be co-op based. I can also rest assured that the multiplayer will be localaly hosted, so you can pick who you want to play with.\n\nOverall, even with the bugs that are present, this is an exciting title. One I have been waiting for, for quite a long while.

It well incorporates the survival part with things such as hunger, energy and well death. As for horror.... I will be honest i am squimish when it comes to horror games but this by far made me scream at the top of my lungs when i was being chased by a pale nude man. The graphics are amazing and i have had no problem with starting the game as i have seen some people. The bugs though.... are how I shall say.... suprising for the least. Example: I am walking on the beach and i go to hit a turtle, i am then launched across the map into a tree in which I fall to my death. Also to add to the bugs is the cooking will not work whatsoever, falling through rocks (It is rare), some buildings wont place, cannibals freeze etc. ANYWAYS to sum this game up it is definitely a game to try for everyone even if you are squimish (there is gore). The gameplay and graphics highly outweigh the bugs and flaws as they will be fixed in 12 days from now with some new content being added. I cant wait till they add some new things to try and hopefully to convince you to buy this amazing game!\n9/10 For the idea and working gameplay alone.","June 3, 2014","true","19.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

Also, one must keep in mind, there are no 12yo KOSer's running around becuase its a single player experience... for now. When they do plan on implementing multiplayer, it will be co-op based. I can also rest assured that the multiplayer will be localaly hosted, so you can pick who you want to play with.\n\nOverall, even with the bugs that are present, this is an exciting title. One I have been waiting for, for quite a long while. As the devs continue to push out content and updates and get past the alpha stage, I won't be surprised if this title is entered as a "Game of the Year". 10/10","June 3, 2014","true","35.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

It literally seems perfect to me as far as optimization and content,\n\nPros:\n\nMusic- not much music, but the menu theme and when cannibals are close really sets the mood\nGraphics- very nice graphics, simple yet appealing, 60+ frames all the time. i'm running a GTX 770 with VSync enabled. Without Vysnc I literally run 200+ FPS, but I prefer my GPU to be stable and not overwork itself which is why I leave VSync on.\nGameplay- Outstanding, The crafting system is perfect compared to other survival games. This game doesnt require a billion materials to make anything. you can make anything you want at your fingertips pretty much. Also suprisingly to me the story is good.. just a plane crash on a deserted island with cannibal/skinwalkers on it. The cannibals can be a pain in the ♥♥♥ at times and they can be very ♥♥♥♥ing scary.. like holy ♥♥♥♥... I've played Outlast and other horror games.. but the cannibals in this game can be very terrifying (mainly in their numbers and how they appear so randomly).\n\n**NOTE TO NEW PLAYERS**\nWhen you first start playing this game.. get away from the plane crash ASAP. The faster you get away from the plane and toward the beach the better, So far I have started a new game 5 times to test some things and i found that the beach is the best spot and the quicker you get away from the plane crash, the more time you have to build your base up.","November 3, 2015","true","17.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","2"

The work being done here is beyond my highest expectations of this nature and after a long time of consistant performance this games quality and ability cannot be contested by even the big names out there..... in fact all big names out there are hard pressed to keep up with the level of skill being displayed here.\n\nAnyways. as I usally do i warn : if you dont know how to deal with beta games please wait.

It is one of the things that initially attracted me to this game besides a promising storyline for single player. Lately, the community is demanding a lot with co-op gameplay so it seems like each time the devs release an update the majority of it is dealing with co-op. I'm not complaining, I like playing with others but I would also like to see some major things being done with single player and building and crafting. Right now there is a limited amount of things to do as far as crafting and building and exploring and once you've done everything there's nothing really left to do but get creative and build a bigger, more elaborate base. I hope to see them open the map, add more things to craft and build, basically add more things to do, objectives, storyline, creepier caves, more monsters, etc. I'm really looking forward to the finished product.

Constantly being upgraded and evolving. Beautiful graphics. Overall this game is on another level from all other survival games. The greatest thing about this game is it's use of the dark. When it's dark it is really dark. You can't see your hand infront of your face. This is usually followed by a scream in the distance as they come for you.\n\nI cannot over-sell it. This game is truly beautiful and terrifying.\n\nI found that the game started to stagnate for a short while, but then I realized it was because I was too afraid to explore. This game can be so terrifying you don't want to leave you base. You just want to stay alive. You won't. Once you get better you will for some solid stretches of time, but eventually they find you. Save often.\n\nOnce you get over your fear of venturing out into the world, and grow a pair enough to start going down into the caves the game really comes to life...and the real terror begins. This game is amazing.\n\nSadly my game has somehow glitched this time not allowing me to pick up the rebreather. I can find it and pick it up, but it will not enter my inventory. I have survived nearly 80 days and built multipe large encampments. This rebreather issue limits where I can go so I will likely have to start over.\n\nHere is the thing...this game is so good I don't really mind.\n\nAs you learn in the game and explore your working knowledge improves so much your survival skills increase. You build smarter. You farm resources more efficiently. You become a better killer.\n\nNo mutants will stop me. I will rule this island.\n\nThis game is worth every penny.","December 22, 2015","true","126.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

If you're a fan of survival games such as Unturned and Minecraft, the chances are you'll really enjoy this game.

The Forest also features frequent updates which have a countdown in the main menu of the game, which seems to be a minimum of an update every 2 weeks. There's also talk of adding co-op to the game which I'm extremely excited for.\n\nWhile I think the game is great, I really can't recommend buying it unless you've got a great gaming PC as it's not very optimized at this stage in development.","October 26, 2014","true","62.1"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

You start off on a crashed jet plane filled with sodas, rags and food. As you proceed towards the exit of the plane you pick up a hatchet that was stabbed in a flight attendent's chest. While you are outside there's luggages that are locked but you can break them open with your hatchet and there's also rabbits and lizards which can be used as a food source later on. But make your decisions quick and get the hell out of there because the mutants will ambush you and scare the hell out of you and kidnap you (what they did to me). Assuming that you got out of the area alive, you have to find a place you find fit for shelter (I prefer the coast because you can see your surroundings better). Your survival book is a HUGE help, look through it in order to build fires to cook your food and keep you warm. But be careful cause they're watching!\n\nOnly cons are the bugs, the bugs are noticeable as soon as you start playing. I'm not going into specifics cause there are too many bugs to name one by one. But then again it is a Pre-Alpha Build so you can't quite judge it yet.\n\nOverall, this game is an amazing survival/horror game. It's definitely worth the price.

Brief encounters with natives that ended in simple staring contests left me feeling empowered. Started work on a cabin, all was well. But then..... disaster. Hostile natives came at me from all directions, even the trees. As I fended them off with my trusty axe I could feel the strain of combat taking its toll on my body, but I had gone this far and there were only two natives left. I could do this. I could claim this land as my own. They had taken my child and kidnapped me to show me their horrific ways. No more. I would eradicate this evil from my home. I turned to swing my axe. I was met by a club to the arm, I had miscalculated their speed! I staggered back, my armor gone. The native came in for another attack, this time to my chest. I braced for impact. His club hit me with unimaginable power. I felt my chest cave in and my skin burn as I was catapulted at supersonic speeds above the forest in which I had crashed.

As soon as you get out off the plane you are to gather as much supplies as you possibly can before the cannibals go and investigate, You can simply get all you need to survive for a day or two before you actually go and hunt right from the start. Building your shelter and such though will take some time, and building it at the wrong place can cause your life.\n\nThe forest looks amazing, will take you some time to get familiar with it with all the cannibals out there (And because is Huge!). Amazing thing is that the forest ain't even done, there are more areas to be made in the near future! it lacks a bit in the resources however, finding animals to hunt is a little difficult, but a update will be made later on where more animals to hunt will be added. Also there are some things that you can't build, and now that the infinite flare gun is out, there is no more advantages lol. My tip for you guys will be to make as much Molotovs as you can by combining Bottles and Rags. However this game is still in Alpha, and there are only 4 people on the process of making it.

It redifines and brings the 'survival horror' genre back in a big way.\n\nYou begin by crash landing on what appears to be an island covered by a dense forest. You awaken to a few items around you such as food, beer, an axe and other bits of what some would think of as junk. The thing of it is, from the moment of the planes impact, you are being watched and in some cases hunted. After grabbing all you can carry your best bet is to get as far away from the wreck as possible. Corpses of your former fellow passangers litter the land around you and while you may want to stop and admire the scenery (meaning the beautifully rendered foliage and lighting effects) however you MUST run.\n\nChasing you are a band of CANNIBALS. They are great in numbers but are merely studying you at first. You'll see them peering at you from the hill, or from behind a tree. Sometimes one, two, three or even more. Count your blessings and praise the sun for when the night falls, they will be braver.\n\nQuickly you make a small fire, then a small shelter out of the trees you have cut down with your axe along with sticks and rocks you find all around the ground. All the while, you're being watched. Then it starts storming. Your fire needs to stay tended to otherwise it will go out and you will surely freeze.\n\nThen the sun starts going down and the forest darkens. You hear screams in the distance and footsteps. There are 'warnings' made with the body parts of the airline's unfortunate passangers appearing all over your campsite that you were sure were not there 15 minutes ago.\n\nAgain, screaming. But this time, its getting closer. Suddenly, you see a light in the distance!! Could it be a rescue?\n\nAs the light gets closer you see shapes of scantidly clad beings walking twords you. The light is emmited from a bleached human skull one of them is carrying as they search for your exact location. This time, they are here for blood.....\n\nI could tell you more, but where is the fun in that? This game is at this moment PRE-ALPHA. There are bugs, glitches and a host of other game breakers. But it never ceases to be fun and exciting. The price in my opinion is worth everything you get in THE FOREST in its current state. It can only get better from here.\n\nThis is a game of survival, and fortune does not favor you in THE FOREST. You are the prey.\n\nGood luck, and hide well.","June 6, 2014","true","8.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","3"

Overall, they have addressed a few issues that people ahve had, while adding more stuff.  Obviously they cant't address every issue because this is alpha and they should worry about critical issues, and just adding stuff without breaking anything too badly.   For now, they have made a peaceful mode, which is great for those wanting something a bit tamer.   They are slowly adding more things to build, visuals are tweaked, and new things are added in the game itself.  However, there are still some issues with it that are annoying as hell, but are not THAT important.  The only thing Im worried about, is the length between updates.

The objective is to survive, then you need to use what you can find, trying to combine materials and build structures to do that.

I will wait impacient for more crafting abilities that promises a lot. I usualy dont buy games on early access or in alpha, but this one i see potential to be a great game.

This time, they are here for blood.....\n\nI could tell you more, but where is the fun in that? This game is at this moment PRE-ALPHA. There are bugs, glitches and a host of other game breakers. But it never ceases to be fun and exciting. The price in my opinion is worth everything you get in THE FOREST in its current state. It can only get better from here.\n\nThis is a game of survival, and fortune does not favor you in THE FOREST. You are the prey.\n\nGood luck, and hide well.","June 6, 2014","true","8.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","3"

After witnessing a child being taken away, I awoke to find myself on a plane. I chowed down on everything I could find on the plane and set out to find a tree to conquer.\nTwas then that I stumbled upon a tribe of happy locals, ready and willing to show about the island on a wonderful and exciting running tour, which ended in my falling over a cliff edge.\nIt was in that time that I noticed just how nice the graphics are.\nThe locals must have noted my fall, as they took me to an underground dwelling where they had tied up all of the other passengers on the plane, probably to keep them from getting sick from the water on the cave floor.\nSoon after I died, as it was too dark to see where I was going. The light I thought was the exit was a friendly local who beat me back to safety.\nI lasted 2 days.\n\nAttempt number 2 went a little better. I found an axe and set out to take down a tree again, but the lords of clipping failed me and I fell over another cliff. See attempt one for details.\n\nAttempt number 3;\nI was wise to the locals by this point. After devouring the plane, taking the axe and heading towards the best looking water I could find, I landed upon a beach. There was a dead local who I put to rest by blowing him apart, a tent with a stick I used to stab things, and plenty of beer.\nI found a tree to conquer, but the locals must have come back for their friend, as they were waiting for me. I immediately hit legs, hoping they had not noticed me. I was not being chased so I imagined I was fine.\nI found a boat and thought it would be a great place to hide, as these friendly locals did not seem to have a swimming school set up anywhere.\nNight fell and all was peaceful, but I was definitely wrong about the swimming lessons. The locals swam out to assist me off the boat, but I refused and ran as fast as possible after exiting the boat.\nIt began raining as I reached safety, and I was told that I needed to start a fire. I had all of the things I needed but leaves, so I promptly froze to death in a small, premade hut that I think belonged to a local.\n\nAll in all, hard but fun. I enjoyed the tense feeling right the way through and look forward to future editions of the game.","June 1, 2014","true","1.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

The crafting system is deep and satisfying. The atmosphere is forboding, and when it choses, The Forest can be legit scary. The devs seem like good eggs - the game receives very regular updates, issues and bugs are quickly addressed, and improvements always exceed expectations. I could details some of the frustrations I have had, over my hours with The Forest, but the vast majority were already addressed by the developers in recent patches. In particular, the recent graphical overhaul is substantial and welcome improvement to presentation. Spearing fish is neat. Chopping down trees is weirdly satisfying. The mutants are hella f'd up.\n\nThere's really only one problem with The Forest, as I see it - the game is still in Early Access, and will be for the foreseeable future - so I have to avoid putting in too many hours, so that the final build feels somewhat fresh.\n\ntl;dr - game is good, devs seem good, you should buy.","June 11, 2015","true","28.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It is by no means complete at this point, but what it has right now is quite good. The AI is functional and can be downright unnerving at times. I've encountered several situations where the enemies would just climb trees and watch me, rather than trying to fight me. After about an hour of playtime, you start to realize the kinks and bugs with the game and enemies no longer become a problem once you know how to deal with them. There isn't a whole lot to do yet, and in just a few hours you can pretty much accomplish everything there is and not have much left to do other than occaisonally collect food.\n\nAs of right now, this game is definitely worth buying so that you can influence it's growth and development and help shape it into a better game for everyone.\n\n8/10","June 7, 2014","true","26.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

They had found my nice little cabin, you see, and they didn't seem to approve of my choice in architecture, what with their questionable "garden improvements" of various severed body parts haphazardly smashed onto logs that are, in turn, smashed into my turnips. Or thyme. I don't know what I'm growing in my garden, damn it - I'm an adventurer, not a botanist! Andyway. Bloody ungrateful lot, if I say so myself, these cannibals: I bring them the marvels of modern technology and civilisation by graciously choosing to crash my aeroplane in their forest, and what thanks do I get in return? Why, they try to EAT me! The nerve of these savages!\n\nBut I digress. I had a delightful dinner of blueberries and raw rabbit awaiting me within my cozy cabin, and this delay simply would not do. So, I decided to drop the two heavy logs that were currently embedded in my chest for some indiscernable reason - the savagery of the island has started to have an effect on me, I fear, if I begin to carry logs like this! - on the brutes below. The logs careened majestically down the side of the hill, as if not hindered by the water at all. (Indeed, other than my shadow's clear swimming motions, it was difficult to discern that I was swimming at all, as the water seemed to have disappeared at some point, despite its bouyant properties remaining). Alas, they demonstrated some sort of remarkable ability to become insubstantial at the moment they came in contact with my logs, and the wooden missiles passed harmlessly through them. (If ever I return home, I must endeavor to find the secret of this chicanery... a secret jealously guarded by some raja far to the east, no doubt.)\n\nSo! My efforts at improvisational bombardment by way of logs a failure, I decided to to return to shore and give these primitives what-for. I drew my saber - or, in this poor, pathetic excuse for an island, a rather disappointing fire axe - and had at them! Although there were far more than I, using an ancient and sophisticated technique of sworsmanship I learned while traveling through the Far East known as 側身掃射了一圈，同時瘋狂地擺動 - or, in Queen's English, "strafing sideways in a circle while swinging madly" - was able to defeat the whole lot of them with but only a single admittedly deep scratch from one of their womenfolk. (Who, I should note, had no decency! None at all! She didn't even attempt to cover her bosom! The scandal!) At long last, my camp freshly festooned with severed limbs and limbless torsoes, I sat down to my dinner of blueberries and raw rabbit.\n\nAlas - and here's the worst of it - I was fresh out of tea.\n\n10/10","June 7, 2014","true","4.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","4","4","2","0"

Me ansd my lovely son Winifred were taking a trip to see my mother in Albequerque when all of the sudden the front of the plane comes disatached from the rest, thank the Gods no one else was on board. I was suffering from hunger as i got my fat self up off the ground to find that the only other person on the plane had a hatchet buried deep into her chest which i had no problem removing. I picked up more booze that could possibly fit into my designer jeans. As I began to journey about 5 feet into the woods i thought i heard footsteps and the screams of humans being dismantled in the distant. I soon found a beach where i could cook and rest for the night. While i had my nice little hut set up i began to see apperitions of humans in the distance but i thought nothing of it being in such a strange place, when suddenly i was attacked from behind by a group of canibalistic justin beiber fans. I assume they wanted to share my fish and didnt know how to speak my english language. I awoke in a dark cave where i quickly see my shadow cascading along the long floor,i didnt have a head but that didnt seem to affect me one bit. I found a hatchet and a flare gun by somehow picking up and throwing down again i had unlimited ammo for said falre gun. I eventually found my way out of the cave and began to adapt quickly to my surroundings. I built a nice log cabin with walls for protection and even a fire to keep me warm at night. One day as i was chopping down a tree, a log seemed to have glitched through time and space when it counteracts with where i was standing and shoots me HIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGH into the air.DEAD\n\nI didnt think anything of because it thought i could reload where i was at in my game when i found that the load bar was unclickable. So all that work, killing innocent justin beiber fans, chopping down trees and the mass extension of the rabit population led me to nothing.\n\nI definatly recomend this game because the women are naked\n16/10","May 31, 2014","true","24.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

The survival aspect is really demanding from being tired, hungry, hurt, cold and wet, and being able to construct shelters. The islands inhabitants just really blow your mind on the ai scripting they will stalk you hunt you and re-group when they are hurt. They are by no means lazy they will run climb and come from every which way. graphics the game is smooth and beautiful it is what i would expect from something similar to the cry engine games which power games like far cry and crysis. the detail is beautiful and impressive from the vegitation to the wildlife you can hunt.\nThere is the ability to co-op with your friends which i have not tried due to the fact there is no server search currently but co-op is done by using there ip and yours to create a lobyy(simple and elegant.).\nThere are a few problems at the moment with the game but remember this is an alpha build.  Water is very simply implimented with water layers meaning you can see to the bottom and the edges of water are usually grassy no river system implimented. Sometimes with tree platforms you can build the trees will disapear and leave you just a floating platform. The bow is a nice addition but i would like to see a bigger better bow eventually with more power and maybe an aimer.\nI would highly recomend this game its only 14.95 with the xmas sale and its better then most xbox one titles i play to date.","December 22, 2014","true","52.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","4","4","3","0"

The singleplayer is good but could ofcourse improve. As the devs mention in the section "Development roadmap" They will be making the game graphics better aswell as improving the "running" of the game. I like the game and can't stop playing.\nThere are some things that I think should be quite high on the dev priority list though. I am not a software developer but I think that the bugs in multiplayer should be fixed. First and formost the bug where you can play a game with your friend, both of you save in your shelter by pushing the C key and the you exit the server. When you come back in only the host will have kept his/her things like axes and food. The other thing that isn't really a glitch but a feature that would increase the gamplay experience is the ability to destroy or tear apart your buildings after you've started building or finished the build. My friends and I have realized that not being able to demolish your built stuff can be gamebreaking and make the gameplay less fun. Last but not least i would like to ask the developers to make it possible to share items with your friends in multiplayer (cop-op mode). This would make the gameplay more immersive and make the game a lot better. I hope the developers will take notice of these things and add them into the game although that is just my wish and I do understand if the developers want to chose another path for the game.\n\nTo sum it up. I like the game and would recommend it to anyone who is looking to play a scary game alone or with your friends. There are a few bugs and some features missing (according to me) that i hope the developers will fix/add to the game.\n\nI give this game a 8/10 because of the things listed above\nKind regards, Your fellow gamer","December 25, 2014","true","26.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","4","4","2","0"

The Forest is a Alpha game at this current time I have been playing and following since Alpha 0.01. The games updates are always so fun to see, its almost like playing a new game every update I love that about it.\nThe game has a different style of building compared to most games making it innovative. the AI of the cannibals can be so funny and scary at times making for a good mix. Being a Alpha game it will have bugs but the Developers always fix as many as possible each and every update. Probably the best part about the game is the ability to just jump in and PLAY no inventory sorting or thing that slow down the gameplay like that.\n\nThis was the first "real" PC game I played (I use to be only a console gamer) and I had no problem figuring out the controls and such was very easy to learn and play.

But I absolutely love it. I couldn't care less if I only survive 5 days, I love being able to build a camp and lay it out the way I want to. The mutant cannibal people are very well done and I like the fact that they make screaming sounds so you have some kind of idea if they are around. I love the tension while you run around trying to find supplies. You could be hunting bunnies and BAM, dead. I haven't seen any in game yet but I cannot wait to come across the other creatures on the island/in the forest. The random crash sites make me want to play it over and over to see if I get a bit more help so I can survive a bit longer (which I usually don't).\n\nIt's quite hard to see the way out of the cave when you first 'die'. Part of it's because you probably aren't supposed to be able to see that well, and the other part is the rendering that makes you think you are going the right way until a wall renders right in front of you. But that's okay, I'm sure they will patch all that kind of stuff up later.\n\nIt's early days and I cannot wait until it gets updated because this is a seriously awesome game and definitely my favorite at the moment.  10/10.","June 13, 2014","true","73.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","4","4","2","0"

(TL;DR at bottom)\n\nWhile most would say the story mode sets it apart, it's GIGANTIC island environment, or the stunningly intelligent AI, I think what sets this game apart from others is the amount of options you have.\n\nThis is key for any survival game, yet most miss out on it. With Rust, for example, you can play solo but chances are you wont get anywhere past a 2x2 home before getting raided by a group or another solo player OR you could be in a massive group, build a massive base and be touched by practically no one except other massive groups.\n\nThe Forest, however, has a plethora of options to choose from: you can live on land and fight off waves of mutants, move from temporary shelter to temporary shelter and hide from the mutants, build a house boat and live on the water, or just go on a rampage and hunt down every last mutant you find(they don't infinitely respawn) to claim the island yours.\n\nAnd the AI is simply the best I've ever seen(if I could buy this game once if it meant one other game gets AI as good or better than this, I would not stop buying this game) They are so unique they practically amplify your options: They don't know you exist when you start, giving you a chance to have different playing styles when encountering them.\n\nThey are programmed to calculate and strategize, so if one of them sees your house and runs away, just know that your security needs to be amped up.\n\nThe only things I complain about with the AI are that there are no projectile shooting mutants, which makes living on the water pretty damn OP if you don't have to return to the shore at all.\n\nAnother thing is that there are tribes of these mutants that do fight each other and I feel that hasn't been used enough. I hope this game does get to the point where you can befriend tribes and rival others in both single player and co-op modes.\n\nTL;DR:\n\nPROS:\n\n-Super intelligent AI(even for early access)\n-Options and freedom(which most early access games miss out on)\n-Story mode(it's being worked on but still)\n\nCONS\n\n-Optimization(pretty much the plague of every early access game. You could  just run it on low memory mode but it looks horrible)\n-The need/lack of tribe mechanisms(I cannot stress this enough, this would be an amazing feature if you could join tribes, rival them, etc)\n\nFinal rating 9.8/10 buy this game.

Only difference is there is no narrative.... Well, not much aside from your plane crashing and your kid getting taken away from you. The encounters are perfect, since it's not the same kind of thing every time. Cannibals vary(ohhhhh boy..), and their reactions to seeing you can differ greatly, too. A lot of this depends on the players actions and activities. For instance: if you kill every cannibal you see, eventually you'll cross paths with some that are better equipped(mentally) to recognize you for the 'one that got away'.\n\nI lasted 9 days my first game. Building and setting up was easy. Keeping my wits about me and maintaining high environmental awareness, was not. It was stressful and terrifying at moments. Sighting one feral cannibal is enough to send you skimpering back to your camp for the remainder of the day. "Did he see me? Is he going to get more friends?" Probably....    My one and only tip: Never assume you can predict the behaviour of the tribesmen. They will ♥♥♥♥ you up when you least suspect it.","October 26, 2014","true","52.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Perhaps even matching the level of DayZ.\n\nBut not the security of DayZ.\n\nYou see, you DO have weapons in The Forest. But these weapons are nothing but sticks and stones, which don't break your bones, but are a somewhat usable weapon. But you will never stand a chance against the mutants. You don't have conventional guns that headshot mutants and make you more secure. Nothing like that. Instead, you have to sneak around them to increase survivability to a big extent. Bringing it to the enemy will only cause you more problems than it is necessary.\n\nShelters and evverything are built by scavenging the world, which has lots of variety and interactivity. You can chop down nearly anything, from plants, to big trees, to mutants. It only adds to the fun factor.\n\nIf you get caught, the game's survival horror genre comes into play. You are kidnapped into a server of caves, which are the mutants' hold-out and home. Your only way out is running around with a horridly-low-on-fuel BIC lighter. If you manage to make it out, good job, you can return to your house and recuperate, but fatality is quite likely in a lot of cases, so good luck.\n\nAll-in-all, very nice game, but since it is Alpha, it has bugs, and it is not very recommendable unless you are prepared to face with them.\n\n9/10","June 17, 2014","true","3.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Whereas trees looked the same before, they still maintained a respectable detailed shape out to quite some distance. Now, the trees become blockier faster and the colors pop out instead of being occluded by the environment and atmosphere.\n\nNot game busting, and the advantages far outweigh the few cons.

Even though it has been in alpha for quite some time, it receives frequent and transparent updates. The developers seem to interact and listen with the community quite well, which is fairly rare for an early access game.\nLike all survival games, it has the potential to become tedious after a few hours. I suspect the developers are working to combat this by adding more objectives, like rescuing other survivors.\nOverall I can recommend this game to anyone who likes the survival-horror genre, building/crafting games, or unique co-op experiences.","November 25, 2015","true","51.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

A great open world survival game with the twist of canniabls to keep you on your toes. Even in the multiplayer world I have with my friend in which we have turned off canniabls it is still suspenseful enough while caving and walking through their camps to feel as if you are about to be attacked. The mechanics and concepts implemented in this game are interesting and whilst they are still being developed they still manage to add quite a lot to the game. 9/10 as the building mechanic can be quite frustrating and in multiplayer worlds that I host log sleds keep trying to kill me by throwing me straight up in the air.","March 27","true","52.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","5","6","3","0"

He really went above and beyond in creating new ideas that made a lot more sence.\n\nThe horror part of this game is also well though out, the mutants are pretty freaky, and if you explore any of the caves or their villages, its pretty badass.\n\nThe only thing this game is majorly lacking right now is the ability to save, and the inability to transport more than 2 logs at a time (Making some sort of towing system would make things much better).\n\nOnly sad thing is within a couple of hours I had killed all of the mutants on the parts of the island you can go to, so I never had to worry about attacks, and I could explore the item without even worrying.

You start off on a plane with your son, and you crash land on a suspicious island fulled with life and other creppy creatures. The first couple of hours you will be terrified tryng to hide from the cannibals and trying to find a safe spot to bulid camp.\n\n2. Bulding. For an early access game it comes will alot of stuff to bulid with. You want to start buliding a little house and walls to keep yourself safe. Also you can bulid rain collectors to drink and set up traps to kill rabbits lizards.\n\nPros\n-The way the open world is\n-All the types of cannibals from normal looking to down right the creepiest most ugly thing i've seen.\n-All the bulding and customizable options for your character and your house.\n-You can buld traps to kill the cannibals and for a source of food.\n-When you get captured by the cannibals and you have to escape their turf avoiding them being stealthy, it give you that tingling felling in your balls you know.\n-Each time you start a new game everything can change, the plane doesn't crash in the same spot and the cannibals can attack you right off the start.\n\nCons\n-The cannibals AI can sometimes be really bad to the point I stop playing for a while.\n-Also when you make a house I don't know if it's my game but the door laggs and it won't open or I get stuck in it.\n\nBut those are the only cons I have with the game. So I give this game a 10/10 does a 10 mean it's great no there are bugs that will make you mad. Sould you buy this game? HELL YES buy the game now.

I'm not a "horror" survival fan.  Crafting survival, co-op fun, sure. But most online survival games are player troll fests because there is no real AI threats.\nThis game the AI "troll" you. It's pretty creepy, and if thier movements and behaviors are any indication of the future AI they will be great! Seein tribesmen in the daylight, in the distance gets you going. Then all of the sudden you realize they are in the trees and all around... crap crap crap CRAP!!! RUN!\n\nCurrently there doesn't appear to be any "stealth" mechanic yet, but I am sure there will be. Hidding may be your only hope!\n\nBE WARNED: This was written during early alpha developement. Almost right after intitial access. MANY things may change before I return to update. And remember it is EARLY ACCESS, buy-in responsibly, do your research on this and any game. Be a smart Gamer and consumer.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=266039874\nYou will see some glitches, issues and stuff, but for so darn early it looks really amazing! Far more fluid and "life like" than Rust in it's current build (too me anyway, but it's opinion Only used as a comparison as Rust is a recent game currently popular on Steam similar in some features and looks). And the AI is FAR more intimidating than DayZ current Zeds (niether comment is a back handed insult, I like both).\n\nI have to say if you get scared of the Early Access burn like I am (and for good reason): Currently, The Forest may be worth the 15$. Plus it's still early enough that you can probably be involved in the developement of features and details. And honestly, it looks WAY better than I was expecting, but also expect visual oddities, sometimes lots. Yet STILL no where near as terrible as SOOOO many "alpha and beta" in later builds. But we'll have to see how the progress goes in the long term: EARLY ACCESS. Although I was at first very pleasently surprised. Trust me having the tribemen show up unexpectedly, day or night, is more than enough to scare 15$'s worth of sh*t out of you! It's not jump scare either, it's strange behavior, what looks like curiousity turned to horrific violence so fast!\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=266408476\nI have to say "yes", BUT ONLY if you understand that it is EARLY ACCESS, long way to go. But quite possibly far more quality and beauty than you would expect for so early. For the few hours or more I may have put into it I feel I got my 15 worth as the price of this time. I DO NOT say that lightly, and I KNOW I hope to get many more hours.\n\n[Quick Co-op Addition Update 12-24-14: From what I understand so far it's still a pretty glitchy feature.]","June 1, 2014","true","9.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","2"

It also plays super smooth.\n\nAudio: The audio is very well presented offering some real in depth feeling from the forest or the crazy people's.\n\nControls: Super easy to get ahold and master, seriously no complaint at all, pickup and go.\n\nGame: You crash land on the nicest plane crash ever, seriously watch it and it feels and looks so relaxing just a little bumpy... There is a few crazy people who are dangerous and thankfully the game has coop so you can play with friends and save it, so you both can return another time which is cool.\n\nSadly you can build a fort super quick and survive, but the game does not have much things to actually build though it seems. My friend and I built a big fort in under an hour and ran out of things to do because we built it all...

Here is why:\n\nI recently picked this game up again to see some awesome changes, last time i played it was a year ago or something. Guess what there are like 2 or 3 things new that are cool but nothing else. Its like the developers have a great time with the money but they dont use it for the game.\n\nSome things that are annyoing af:\n-Alot of Caves with nothing in it but big Monsters, which you can kill but you get nothing in return. (for example: i killed several monsters, like 2 big wobbly guys who tried to jump on me, i had to use like 20 molotovs to kill them, just to hit a dead end or find a cassette with stupid music instead of a storyline)\n\nthey could easy add usefull stuff which you could only find in caves so it encourages ppl to go down there. I got everything good just by fightig noob monsters or no monsters at all (flashlight, modern axe, diving stuff, dynamite)\nFinding stuff like a katana is cool but there is no use for it, i cant upgrade it and my upgraded axe is better in every way.\n\n-They added a ToDo list which dosent even work, so why put it in the game?\n\n-Coop is nice but for me as a the host i get freeze lags every minute or so, its kinda annoying. Weapon mods, the cavemap and ToDo list gets erased for the other player every time, which is also very annyoing.\n\netc.\n\nThey should have made enough money to make it a great game but if they keep their speed it will be maybe a great game in 6-10 years and i dont think they will develop it that long.\n","December 19, 2015","false","23.6"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","1"

However, disregarding its current development status I was pleasantly surprised to see the game still holds its own.\n\nIts fun, really fun for the first few minutes before you're taken by storm from the islands inhabitants. You're gathering firewood, collecting game to roast on an open fire and building a shelter for the night. Well sonny you aint spending the night in that tent if this is the first time you're playing.\nWhile I was constructing my necessities I saw in the distant way a patrol of these cannibals I have never encountered, because of watching certain videos on youtube about this game I knew stealth was an option so I crouched down and watched them go by. My heart was racing, my hands were shaking and I was finding myself still crouching as I continued on my merry way. Before long I saw another cannibal, I had already encountered this one as I remembered the destinct construct on its back. I had come to realise this was the tribe leader, as soon as I faced it, he ran away and climbed a tree.\n\nNot a few more seconds after that, a female of the tribe steadily approached me uncaring to the axe I was weilding. Mate her ♥♥♥♥ were proper nice, voluptuous and shapely and them nipples on her were perfectly placed. I slowly walked to her before she lunged back, thinking back I swear I saw her almost uncovered minge. While taking a second to recover from my sudden shock, she also recovered of her own and took long strides with her long, curvy legs. Jumping at me she prepared her hands for the grab. Time went by slowly as I felt her delicious, mangled mouth comming on to my arm. For a moment we were connected, but she was in me with her long, hard teeth. Then my bloodfilled meat was in her willing, hungry mouth.\n\nAfter this painful exchange my character feld dizzy and went for a bloody nap like the ♥♥♥♥ he is.\n\n\nBut yeah the games pretty buggy, expect to fall through the ground or suddenly die for no good reason. 8/8 though.","May 30, 2014","true","8.8"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

That means you should probably do that. Only buy this game if you understand that it's an Early Access, still being made, and that you are playing it to support the Devs. For all those people complaining on the forums and such about missing content and bugs, forget them. The game is still fairly cheap, and the Devs look committed to finish it, so I would recommend getting it now to save the trouble of paying more later, and to be more familiar with it.\nThe game is well-made at this point, there's a plethora of items and almost every tree can be cut down (save a few huuuge ones) to get locks/sticks and leaves. There's a lot of wildlife too, that all follow the idea of "Kill, Skin, Cook, Eat". Some skin like lizard skin can be used for protection, making it a bit variable.\nCrafting is limited but has a good system, just needs some more items.\nMutants are interesting. Their AI isn't so "linear", as they sometimes attack you straight out, or eye you up and run away, or then come back later with an army.\nBuilding is limited, but there's blank spots in the construction book, meaning there is definitely more to come.\nDon't have anything to complain about for the sounds. For those players who like immersion, there are strings and such that play when you are noticed by the mutants, which can maybe ruin the immersion for you, but for me that's fine. Sounds are pretty crisp, and reflect the nature of the island. I don't really notice it, meaning it's either quite boring or that it's totally what I expected so I don't notice any difference. Nothing else to say, really.\nThe game uses the Unity engine, and looks very good for unity engine. A good amount of settings ranging from "High" to "Laptop", which can help run the game on lower-end PCs. Due to there being a lot of stuff, and by 'a lot' I mean "A LOT" (since almost everything can be cut down or picked up), can cause some lag but I have a good gaming PC and it runs perfectly for me.\n\nOverall: The game can provide fun in it's current state for a good few hours, but will probably quickly become boring due to the limited things you can do in the game, but technically, there's always more things to do since no one's actually flattened the entire island yet. Although there is a plethora of bugs and glitches, that's what you were told to expect right next to the 'Buy' button, so if you read this review, don't go and then complain on the forums about how it's missing content or making you lose progress. You were told to expect this.\nI recommend this game because it is most likely cheapest now, and lets you follow the Dev's path in updating the game. If you're prepared to help them and play an unfinished game, go and buy it right now. It's unique, despite being a survival game - the craze right now - and has the potential to be the best.\nAlso it is one of the Top-sellers on Steam.\n\nThanks for reading this review.\n","June 14, 2014","true","6.1"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","1"

I have my positives and negatives about the game and I'll talk about the positive first. I like the way the game looks and the way it plays out is great. What I mean by that is I really like the AI for the Natives. It really gives me the idea that they are other players. There are times when they confuse the hell out of me by traveling to my camp in a group of 7 and then suddenly they're ganging up on one of their followers. I like the effigy's and how they actually stop and stare at it before they continue and sometimes they'll even turn around and leave. Crafting is simple and easy and as well as base building. There isn't anything in the survival booklet that is just a upgrade from the one above it, the Camp Fire cooks food and is reusable and the Bon Fire is just a light that can be seen from a great distance. The animal AI is kind of confusing right now, when ever I get within 5 yards of a Rabbit it begins running back and forth. It runs VERY well it's optimized extrmely well and I don't even have a great PC and I still run really well. I could go on and on of the things that were done so well but I'll stop there. Now for the negatives.\n\nFirstly, the Bow, it is very weak against Natives and I was so happy when hearing it was going to be introduced and now its worse than the club. I do like how 1 stick and 5 feathers get 4 arrows though. One time I had 8 sticks and I was trying to find feathers and it turned out I had 43 feathers the whole time :P. Also, I really want to see a actual firearm. I do really like the survival feel to this game but if it's done correctly to match the theme they could make it so that they can spawn a handgun or hunting rifle and make it make since on how it may have got there. I also don't like how they show that Cannibal take the child in the introduction sequence. It doesn't add to the story (not that there is one) and it makes people who were playing for the first time think that immediently they're gonna chase after the child, well at least thats what I thought.\n\nI know this game is in early access and I do not expect my opinion to apeal to anyone else, but I'd really like for the developers to take thought into what I said. Thank you for reading if you actually read the whole thing. I would deffiently recommend this game to everyone.

Right now theres not really any point to the game but the crafting is amazing. You gather supplies from the island like sticks rocks and wood which you chop trees down to get. There are traps to set to protect your base that you want to make. Your guy gets hungry, cold,  and needs energy to perform tasks so theres an obvious survival feel to it.

I have never seen a game based in a forest before. Nor did I know what was going to happen, my first day in *The Forest* went like this:\n\nClicked play:\nI suddenly noticed quickly I was in a plane, looking out the window into the peaceful puffy clouds. Soon realising that something had happen to the plane and we were loosing altitude quickly. Having my kid asleep next to me he woke up SO quickly and in shock. Then the glitch came about and he broke his back in the plane some how, I was devasted and so upset that he broke his back. But not to worry the plane soon crashed down and knocked me unconscious. After a bit I woke up to look at this..Person with paint and leaves as pants on them, picking up which once was my alive son. (Doesn't matter now his back broke through a glitch so who cares about my son)\n\nI then woke up, it was day time. I must of been asleep for ages. I found an axe,food,pills,circuit boards and a few other useless items to me at this time. I then went out into the wild. Looking around the environment and all I could see was tree's in every direction, I saw bushes,logs,grass and the wildlife. I explored a little in one direction I then came across a beach. I looked around and I saw people. 4 of them infact, I walked up to them not knowing what would of happend. I then realised they were after me, ready to attack me and probably eat me.\n\nI ran for my life, into the ocean and back onto the shore line. I then came back, they didn't know where I was. I was ready to surprise attack them with my trusty axe. I ran up  behind one hoping if I hit it in the head I would of killed it. That had not worked. It failed miserably, I decided to stay and fight against these people? I attacked them over and over and they took a while to die. I was worried I was going to die, after slaying 2 I felt I had this fight.\n\nI then realised I was very low on hunger and health. I was going to win. I then died. I was hoping they would be an easy kill not some tough ♥♥♥ thing that takes like 15 hits to kill.\n\nBut that was my adventure when I first played.\nEnjoyable,exciting,adventrous,amazing.\n\nI enjoyed the wildlife, the environment I was in and all together gives that suspense on what it going to happen next or during the night. I would recommend this game to anyone! <3\n\nThanks for reading Cubed<3","September 3, 2014","true","6.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This game has alot of bugs! So be warned before you buy this game. While playing this game can be fun it can also be frustrating at times. I have a lot of good moments and WTF moments but the WTF moments which can be fixed with some updates and time. My first day trying to survive was fun, I got off my crashed plane and found a beach where I would make home. During the day I made a fire and hut. Once night hit I decided to sleep. Sleeping is very helpful as it fills your stamina and saves the game for you. Once I woke up I was scared ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ when three tribes people were standing on the beach looking at me. Once I got up and pulled out my little hatchet I was ready to fight only to see them run off into the forest. Now I was scared and didnt know what to do. This was a very cool moment that almost no games offer these days. The next day I upgraded my base adding a wall and traps. When night hit I decided to stay up and see what would happen. As I was sitting there I looked into the forest and saw a light. The more I watched I could see that it was tribes people. They finally reached the beach and wanted to fight. So I went hatchets blazing....lol... my trap was useless as they didn't step on it but still cool I could make one. I fought them and the kicked my ♥♥♥. I feel like they need to balance the damage the tribes people take, as for I didn't kill a single one. When you go up against 3 or more tribes people your prolly gonna die. When I died I thought the game was over well it wasn't. I woke up in a cave covered in blood and could see anything. I pulled out me lighter and looked around and found meds, flaregun and a better hatchet. I had to find my way out of the cave. Once I did that I went back to my base. Luckly they added a base marker so you know where to go or I would have been screwed. On my way back I fell off a mountain and died. Some way to die after that adventure. Lesson learned about running through thick brush. Overall this game is fun I would pick it up for $15. Below Ill post some of the bugs I encountered. I give this game a 7/10!! I hope you enjoy my review of The Forest.\n\nReview Done on 6/8/14\n\nBugs\n1.Lost my inventory\n2.Nobody spawned including (animals and tribes people)\n3.When you make a new camp you cant sleep there ( 1 camp per save) ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T!!!\n4.Cant fill wood storage. It only allowed my to put 1 log in it\n5.Framerate drops and game is unplayable\n6.Walk though tents and trees","June 8, 2014","true","5.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/magicrecon/recommended/242760/","magicrecon","MagicRecon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/magicrecon/","62 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game IS in ALPHA and i have taken note of that and everything i reference is in light of that fact.\n\nOk so i saw the price was £11 for me, after all the hyp, i thought, you know what, that's good! So i buy the game.\nWhen i got to the menu, full of excitement i was a little diss-appointed at the lack of options and maybe the menu could have looked a little nicer, but hey, its alpha!\n\nAnyway i jumped right in after disabling the motion blur, personal preference. (you do have to do this every time you die, nothing saves, but more on that in a minuet) ok the opening scene is just how you see in the trailer. I won't give anything away but it's how it is portraid in the trailer as a plane crash. The opening scene isn't very long and your soon in for your first taste of the experience...\n\nNow i have jumped out of the plane realising i have been left to fend for myeslf with bare tutorials, just a few notifications telling me im hungry. The first thing that really caught my eye was the stunning scenery! The pure expansion of greenery foliage goes beyond description. I soon realised that you can harvest a good majority of that foliage too!\n\nMe being completely logical thought that using the plane crash as shelter is a good idea, only... you can't get back in the plane, i can only assume this is so it can't be abused and it forces you out to fend for yourself and build your own shelter! Which i like. Now something tells me these things are attracted to the lufthansa plane landing in there back garden and soon begin to investigate.... very soon...\n\nThe HUD is simple and personally i like the inventory, which is simply (i). The layout of the inventory is nice, it is easy to use, the only thing i would say is you can craft items, which there is no clear tutorial for which i have seen. There is very little help on this game. After about 5 minuets or so, i encounter my first jump scare, they are VERY sneaky! i turned around and there was a half naked man in my face. I hit him with my axe a few times... and a few more.... and a few more.... and a few more... yes these people seem to have an immunity to anything with a sharp edge! Eventually you can knock them down and kill them.\n\nAn issue ive encountered is once they aggro you it is VERY hard to loose them as your stamina will drain fast and they are TOUGH. It's best to try not to get seem AT ALL in the first place. So you WILL die probably sooner rather than later and it is not over there. You get taken to their lair... only to find more shinies! YES there are LOTS of collectables especially in the conveniantly placed suitcases lying around the wreckage... and the whole island. There is only one way in and one way out of the cave!  It is known to be able to fall through the map in the cave, again its just alpha. Once you are out the next time you die WILL be your last! Don't die again.\n\nMy advice is open the guide it does give you using (b) and build those first few basic items. My furthest so far is 5 days and it was enjoyable, however there are some underlining issues that are BIG in my eyes, these are as follows:\n\n- The save feature is broken (atleast for a very vast amount of people such as myself) I REALLY need to be able to save my progress, because if i die i HAVE to watch the cut scene again, do the cave AGAIN.\n\n- The log stockpile doesn't seem to work where you store logs for later use. Not sure if it's just me on that one but i can't anyway.\n\n- The tribal people are a little bit OP in the fact that they are tough and spot you vey easily. Make sure you always have food, that gives you stamina to run!\n\nWith that said, this game has a ridiculous amount of potential, im really enjoying it, at night sometimes i don't want to leave the safety of my camp, thats a GOOD thing, the atmosphere is awesome, very tense. I am REALLY looking forward to co-op, which they have put in the future features list!\n\nI am a bit unsure as to whether to recmmend thhis game simply because of a few big issues as stated above. BUT i WILL recommend it simply because when they are fixed this will be incredible. My advice is buy it whilst it's £11 or what ever your currency is and thank me later! Buy it now, enjoy it a small amount, enjoy it MORE when its public release!\n\nHope this helps...","May 30, 2014","true","38.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This game has alot of bugs! So be warned before you buy this game. While playing this game can be fun it can also be frustrating at times. I have a lot of good moments and WTF moments but the WTF moments which can be fixed with some updates and time. My first day trying to survive was fun, I got off my crashed plane and found a beach where I would make home. During the day I made a fire and hut. Once night hit I decided to sleep. Sleeping is very helpful as it fills your stamina and saves the game for you. Once I woke up I was scared ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ when three tribes people were standing on the beach looking at me. Once I got up and pulled out my little hatchet I was ready to fight only to see them run off into the forest. Now I was scared and didnt know what to do. This was a very cool moment that almost no games offer these days. The next day I upgraded my base adding a wall and traps. When night hit I decided to stay up and see what would happen. As I was sitting there I looked into the forest and saw a light. The more I watched I could see that it was tribes people. They finally reached the beach and wanted to fight. So I went hatchets blazing....lol... my trap was useless as they didn't step on it but still cool I could make one. I fought them and the kicked my ♥♥♥. I feel like they need to balance the damage the tribes people take, as for I didn't kill a single one. When you go up against 3 or more tribes people your prolly gonna die. When I died I thought the game was over well it wasn't. I woke up in a cave covered in blood and could see anything. I pulled out me lighter and looked around and found meds, flaregun and a better hatchet. I had to find my way out of the cave. Once I did that I went back to my base. Luckly they added a base marker so you know where to go or I would have been screwed. On my way back I fell off a mountain and died. Some way to die after that adventure. Lesson learned about running through thick brush. Overall this game is fun I would pick it up for $15. Below Ill post some of the bugs I encountered. I give this game a 7/10!! I hope you enjoy my review of The Forest.\n\nReview Done on 6/8/14\n\nBugs\n1.Lost my inventory\n2.Nobody spawned including (animals and tribes people)\n3.When you make a new camp you cant sleep there ( 1 camp per save) ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T!!!\n4.Cant fill wood storage.

Very buggy. Very unfinished and unpolished. Screams early alpha.\n\nBut god, what's there is AMAZINGLY FUN. The atmosphere of mystery and horror they've built up makes me feel like i'm playing my own version of Lost. Though every element present may be rather 1 note, they have the skeleton of what might be a truly amazing game.\n\nKeep it up, and keep your eye on this.","June 8, 2014","true","13.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
