I cry tears and rainbows.\n\n\nAlready tried it on mobile, so it was easier for me.\n\n- Not ported, but adapted. You can click on different places on the field to move your character for example.\n\n- Quick save of some sort. Works like a checkpoint system or something like this, not entirely sure. I just turned off the game occasionally without saving and when I turned it back on I just hit "continue" and it placed me on the start of the last screen I've visited.\n\n- New screen where you name your character. It looks good, I liked that.\n\n- Music. It is just original FF9 score in same quality that PSone version had. Not that botched ff7-ff8 piece of s~. This one is personal, so I put it last.\n\nGreat game. 100 impressed nobles.","April 14","true","46.0"," 778 of 852 people (91%) found this review helpful 168 people found this review funny","91","778","852","168","17"

To me, Final Fantasy IX is that game. And to me, this is the best game that a life being have ever crafted. Yes, I say “life being”, not “human”, because I’m assuming aliens have their own videogames. But they won’t be as good as Final Fantasy IX.\n\n---------------\n\nOkay, here comes a very long review. I’ve been waiting this for so long.\nFirst of all, completely ignore my time count on Steam for this game. I’ve put 1000h+ into it, and I can easily make a perfect run by memory. Do you know that particular favorite movie you watch every single year? Well, I do that but with this game.\n\nI have SO many things to comment about this game. And I need to spread them.\nFor those who are new into the franchise, Final Fantasy IX was a big contrast compared to the close older and newer games. Yes, they kept the turn-based battles. Yes, most of the same people worked for it. Yes, it’s considered to be part of the golden era of Square Enix. But let’s look closer to see the main differences:\n\nFirsly, and probably the first thing to notice, is that characters are more cartoon-based. They’re not that sort of adults anymore and some of them even have a very funny, friendly looking.\n\nThe world’s aesthetics also changed a lot. Final Fantasy titles are famous for combining magic and fantasy features with metallic, cyberpunk machines. FFIX crushed that second part and instead they put an antique, more steampunk-like background instead of the actual machines.\n\nThe last big noticeable feature is that the class and battle system went back to the deep basics, where characters have their unique role and can only fight strictly to that [for instance, on FFVII every character could cast anything if the skill (a.k.a Materia) was properly equipped].\n\nAnd now that I’ve just summarized the most basic info about FFIX… Welcome… TO THE MOST UNDERRATED TITLE OF THE WHOLE FRANCHISE!\n\nThat’s right. This game has been so irrationally denied, it makes me question humanity’s future. For Christ’s sake, even Square itself seems to be OK about forgetting this game! Lately, many hidden fans have appeared out of nowhere stating that this is their favorite FF game, but I’m not OK with this. Too late. You joined too late. The damage is already done and this title will probably never be on the top for most people. So I’ll put this game as the most underrated one. Forever.\n\nAs a vivid fan of the franchise, let me tell you something: I will NEVER understand why so many people put FFVII on Top 1. I’ve beaten that game for like 10 times already, and the question keeps coming to me every time. Have you paid attention on what you’ve played? For its year, the game was very good but the amount of flaws it has (even story-related) is just infinite. When rating a classic game, it’s just a failure when someone puts 90% nostalgia & 10% trying-to-be-objective review as their analyses.\n\nThat being said, I’ll try to detail every worth-mention thing about this game and why I think it has been so underrated. Here we go.\n\nTHE STORY\nI’m pretty sure many people didn’t understand it. I’m not telling any proper detail for spoiler avoiding, but the story starts being pretty simplistic and easy to follow but the more you progress through it, the more complex it gets. It gets so complex at the end most people don’t understand the final boss! I guess Japanese narrators love to make those sort of mindf*cks. With that in mind, let me tell you something: this is the only game that has managed to make me cry.\n\nI’ve never ever seen in any other game a party of characters that evolve and mentally grow as hugely as they do in FFIX. Everything is connected, from start to finish, and during your journey you’ll clearly see how much impact their personalities have onto both circumstances and other characters. Everyone has their way to see things, their values, and their past justifying their present and future actions… and somehow they all manage to change and mature. I swear this game teaches SO MANY life values through their characters.\n\nAlong with the characters, the story flows in a world that feels extremely alive and varied. Every place is just so different from the previous one. But I’ll talk about the map later.\n\nFinally, the story is long. Very long considering how short most games are nowadays. In case you don’t know, this game was separated into 4 CD’s on the PSX version, and in a blind run it can perfectly provide 40-60h, depending on how much you want to explore and how many secrets you want to discover.\n\nTHE MUSIC\nIt’s Nobuo Uematsu. And I could finish like this.\n\nI mean, come on. It’s one of the most iconic video game composers. How do you expect to be the music? With hundreds of tracts, FFIX soundtrack is just over the top and unique, and together with its partners (VI, VII, VIII, X…) it will be one of the most remarkable soundtracks from PSX. Ever.\n\nTHE CHARACTERS\nMy god, where to start…\nAs I have stated before, this game has some of the most powerful characters in the franchise, by far. All of them feel extremely unique and relevant, and you will PERFECTLY follow their progress and grow during the story. It is just amazing to see how varied every personality is, and how much impact it can bring to the plot. You might not like one particular way of thinking, but soon enough you’ll realize it’s there to make you think; everyone is different and we all have different points of view. And they have to be relevant. And yes, they are in FFIX. Just see all Vivi’s maturation and I dare you, I double f*cking dare you; I dare you to tell me you haven’t learnt anything from it.\n\nAlso, I want to highlight some aspects as well: Those are NOT your conventional Square Enix characters. That’s right. The main character (Zidane) is not the emo, cold-blooded guy from the famous FF games. Instead, it’s one of the first main characters of the franchise that constantly share optimism to his crew; stays on their side; puts himself and his life on risk (even when he knows he can’t do everything) to save the others, even people he doesn’t know, and he doesn’t hesitate to do so.\n\nLast but not least: the main villain is acclaimed to be one of the best of the franchise (together with Kefka). No more super-emo guys; this is the kind of cynic who’s always a step forward and who loves to make fun of the rest.\n\nTHE UNDERRATINGS\nSo why is this game so underrated? To be honest, I don’t fully know. I know the reasons that puts this game on top but not why it’s been that ignores for the media.\n\nMaybe the fact that every character has their unique role in fighting was not that appealing to people? Something I don’t understand either. To me, that makes MUCH more sense rather than seeing a brute-force guy casting a summon spell. Really.\n\nMaybe the friendly look of the characters? Is this seriously a con to you? They look amazing to me, and definitely much better than all those weeaboo-jpop-like characters Square keeps doing in the recent games.\n\nMaybe because it has no futuristic machines? In that case you’re just a close-minded person. And you definitely can’t appreciate how magnificent some places (like Lindblum) are.\n\nMaybe the story looked boring to you? Then there’s no doubt you didn’t understand it. It is INFINITE TIMES more robust than FFVII storyline, and definitely way more polished, and interesting. Seriously stop overhyping that game.\n\nIn the end, every time I replay this game I start it with a feeling of “meh, I’m sure I love it because of nostalgia”. But that banishes when I reach the credits. This is still the best game I’ve ever played in my entire life, and I’ve played THOUSANDS, and completed about 700 probably. So go and buy it, see what I mean, experience this masterpiece and overall enjoy every minute of it.","April 14","true","61.0"," 933 of 1,126 people (83%) found this review helpful 143 people found this review funny","83","933","1","143","101"

You will love the story, the characters and the locations you visit.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kosmozuikis/recommended/377840/","kosmozuikis","Kosmozuikis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kosmozuikis/","1177 products in account","A true classic everyone should play. Kupo!\nThis is my favorite final fantasy. It was when i played it on PlayStation and it still is now. This game is almost perfect.\nIn general by gameplay it's similar to Final fantasy VII and final fantasy VIII. The graphics and overall world design are very similar. This is the last open world Final fantasy game where you can travel freely around the world in a flying ship. After IX the series got worse. I‘m in no way saying that newer games are bad, i still enjoyed them but they lack so many things from older games and some of them shouldn‘t be called Final fantasy because the only thing they have in common with Final fantasy is moogles. But i must admit they have some improvements like no random encounters and faster battles.\n\nThe combat in this game is awesome. I think it‘s the best from all three (VII, VIII & IX). VIII was the worst because everyone could be a mage or a healer or whatever. In IX characters are who they are. Garnett is a white mage and Vivi is a black mage, same goes for every other character,  you can‘t change that. Only mages can cast magic for example. Also not everyone can use eidolons, they‘re something special now, not unlike VIII. The downside of combat is that it‘s a bit too slow. When fighting the same enemies again and again it‘s little annoying to waste your time on those long fights, but it‘s not a big deal, you get used to it.\n\nThis game has a game within a game. A card game. I really love it, i don‘t get why people are hating it so much? Is it because they don‘t know how to play? Of course it‘s not as good as Gwent in Witcher 3 but it‘s really fun.\nWhat slightly annoys me is absolutely no information on side activities or a way to track collectibles. I know it‘s good when the game doesn‘t hold you hand and i really don‘t need the game telling me what to do and where to go, but i really hate when i‘m forced to replay the whole game if i miss something. So it would be nice to be able to track your progress, to have some checklist or something.\n\nThe graphics are really improved. Character models look sharp and CGI is amazing. Even today CGI looks gorgeous, you can see Steiner‘s eyeliner perfectly clear. The background images on the other hand are untouched and they‘re low quality and blurry. I read that SE lost the HD backgrouds and couldn‘t do anything about it. Don‘t know if that‘s true. Anyway it‘s playable and the game is still good to look at.\nThe game runs at 4:3 resolution with nice black borders on the sides. It doesn‘t bother me, i‘m just happy i can play this game on PC finally.\nI see people complaining about this game how it is a bad port and everything is crap etc. Don‘t trust those people, they‘re wrong, everything is fine with the game. People just like to complain, some of them expected a complete rework of the game maybe. The port is really good, it‘s nothing like VII (didn‘t play VIII on PC yet). The controls are good, you can change button mapping in the config menu. The game runs at 30fps, world map is locked to 20fps and CGI is locked to 15fps. But i don‘t really care about fps in this game, it‘s not a fast paced game where 30fps is barely playable, so it doesn‘t have any influence to gameplay. And the game is really old, so it‘s understandable.\n\nA big thank you to SE for in-game cheats. You enable/disable some of them any time you want and some are permanent when activated. I really like no encounter mode, it‘s handy when you‘re looking for something. You can speed up the game which makes the grinding faster and your party level up faster. Also you can turn on 9999 damage, which again makes repetitive fights faster. Just don‘t use these on bosses and important fights and don‘t ruin the game for yourself. The three permanent boosters are: max gil, max level and max abilities. These should be helpful when you‘re replaying the game if you missed something on your first playthrough.\n\nThe story is another thing this game shines in. Every character has their story, there‘s lots of dialogues in the game so prepare to read. But characters don‘t talk some boring nonsense, everything is interesting to read and time flies fast. The character stories can be funny or sad, you will laugh and want to cry while progressing through the game. The characters are really different in this game. I think none of the game in the series has such variety in races. The main character Zidane is a boy...with a tail. Another character is a Rat and Quina...well i don‘t know, she/he has no gender and loves frogs.\nAlso i like that your party now travels separately. Your party members are separated by the story and for some time you play with one half of the party and then you play with other characters in other location. That way most of the party members are leveled up and you get to use them all unlike in previous games where you have 10 characters and you‘re forced to play with only 3 or 4 of them.\nThe world, the world is beautiful with beautiful cities and villages, each having their own stories.\n\nI recommend this game to everyone. Even if you don‘t like jRPG‘s. This is not a generic jRPG, this one is exceptional. If you like good stories, you‘re not against reading through dialogues and want deep and fun combat buy this game. Considering the price it should be a no brainer, the game offers a lots of content and you will spend hours playing it.\n\nPros:\n\nEnhanced graphics\nAmazing CGI\nGreat story\nDiverse and interesting world\nMusic is amazing\n\nCons:\n\nBackgrounds are poor quality","May 4","true","27.7"," 70 of 77 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","70","77","2","3"

Kupo!\nWhat can I say about my favorite game? Only positive things. Final Fantasy IX is definitely one of the best games and RPGs ever made. It's my favorite along with FFVII and VIII, there are other beloved FF games too like VI or X. But these three classics done by Squaresoft stand above the others. Playing FFIX always reminds me why it has a special place in my heart.\n\nOriginally released in 2000 for PS1 around the times when PS2 had released or just before. I remember receiving this back then <3 and I have replayed it countless times during the years, bought it for PS3 and Vita also lol. I fell in love with the story and characters instantly when first played this. I love the music so much too...Nobuo Uematsu is in my opinion the best composer for video game music, FFX was the last in the franchise he worked as main composer. His music just makes the games so alive. Even if FFIX don't have voice acting, the dialogue combined with such beautiful music alone makes you feel a lot just like with the previous games ;).\n\nFFIX tells the unforgettable story of amazing and likeable thief Zidane Tribal, who gets entangled in a epic journey with the lovely princess Garnet Til Alexandros ^_^, best black mage ever Vivi Ornitier <3, a faithful and often dumb/funny knight Adelbert Steiner and many other great characters.\nIt's a journey to save the world, while forming a strong bond of friendship and finding answers, for example to their existence or memories. The character development is excellent. A beautiful story with a lot of funny, light hearted, touching moments and also with many mature and dark moments. The cutscenes are epic too.\n\nGameplay is really great and IX has the ability system, where you can customize your party defenses etc, depending on the situation. It has my favorite Chocobo minigame too, Hot&Cold where you hunt for treasures.\n\nThe port itself is very good, graphics are sharper, xbox controller works perfectly if use it, lots of achievements, combat hud is a bit bigger which is okey, includes some boosters that can help newcomers (like no encounters) and also music isn't messed up like in VII or VIII ports. One downside for some might be grey bars at the sides of screen, it didn't really bother me as I've wanted to play this so much on Steam. But still experiencing this game without them is the best feel and there is a simple ReShade mod in community guides, which I installed. That removes them so can enjoy fullscreen better.\n\nI love how IX return to the more fantasy style with mages, knights etc and I feel like it has everything that a masterpiece requires. A game that I still enjoy playing after 16 years is something special. I always love returning to this game. The newer Final Fantasy games simply don't feel the same. They don't capture the magical story and give feelings that these good older games did, but maybe FFXV will return to the good ones. There are still some moments in IX story that make me shed tears <(T_T)>.\n\nI recommend everyone to play this <(^_^)> and especially those who like more old-school games. If you don't like other FF games, well you might enjoy this. Those born after PS1 era or who just didn't experience it much and that possibly can't enjoy older graphics, I hope you give this a try.

While the rating doesn't agree with me, I honestly believe Final Fantasy IX is a fun way to introduce RPGs to all ages, and being able to replay it remastered made me relive me playing through it as a child.  Definitely a contender for one of my favorite games of all time.\n\nMost reviews point out the mobile UI used in the game, but honestly, I like it a little more.  If you look at comparison screenshots between the PC/Mobile and PS1, the crisp, easy-to-read UI wins out for me.

This port is their best port yet (which is saying a lot, yet not much at the same time).  And they have another one (of X's Remastered edition) coming out in a few days.\n\n-The FPS is still 30, but that's forgivable on the basis that it's a PS1 game.  Definitely a lot less jarring than the 30-to-15 reduction that IV and III see during battle sequences.\n-Unlike the other PS1/PC titles, they actually used the PS1 soundfont, so the music on the PS1 and the PC is identical, unlike VII and VIII which used a generic PC soundfont.  The music even loops right (unlike I's iOS/Android port, or V or VI's ports!\n-The UI is a lot less intrusive than you'd expect, since this port kept the iOS/Android UI.  The battle menus in particular are large enough to be visible from several feet away even on a smaller computer, but still not big enough to really take up half the screen.  After a while, it actually, dare I say it, looks pretty good that way, since there's little empty space to be seen in these menus.\n-The GRAPHICS!  The original game had the characters look incredibly pixelated (not that that was really Squaresoft's fault), but this game looks absolutely amazing (as though they rebuilt the textures from the ground up).  Prerendered environments still look a bit out of place, but the models are pristine.\n\nAnd as far as the game itself goes, nothing has changed.  It's refreshing that they didn't add anything (boosters aside) but didn't subtract anything either, meaning there's no real sense reviewing the game itself here when you can look a really good one from 2000 up with no problem.\n\nIf you have never played Final Fantasy IX, or if you have and would like some amazing nostalgia, or if you're an RPG lover, or hell, if you're a human being with a soul, play this game.","May 9","true","39.4"," 37 of 42 people (88%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","88","37","42","5","0"

It doesn't quite edge out VI or Tactics, but it's right up there with IV and XII.\n\nThis is a port of the old Playstation game from 2000, and if you aren't a little baby, there's a good chance you've played that version. If you have, you don't really need any type of review, as nothing has really changed. If you haven't played this entry in the series for whatever reason, say maybe VII and VIII were too different for you, IX is very much a return to basics.\n\nWhere as in VII the characters are largely interchangeable aside from their limit breaks due to the materia system, in IX we're back to each character having their own set combat commands and feeling like a unique class. Extra abilities come attached to various equipment, and if you wear the equipment and earn enough AP from fights, you can master the ability and use it without having that piece of equipment equipped on the character. This still doesn't let you learn any ability on anyone you want; just because you can equip an item on a character doesn't mean they can use the abilities it has. You're probably not going to learn magic on a melee type character for instance, even if he is using a hat that has cure magic on it.\n\nLike the somewhat recent Steam port of VII (and I assume VIII, I don't have that one on Steam) this version has some added options to help you speed through the game if you just want to experience the story. You can easily make everyone max level, learn abilities instantly, and max out your gil. They've also given us higher resolution cutscenes and character models. These aren't actually new assets or new cutscenes, they just look better than what the Playstation version had since they don't really have to worry about disc space anymore.\n\nSadly, that's really all the extras we got. It really would have been nice to get some of the extras that VI had in its recent iOS/PC port. With that game you got some extra espers, a new dungeon that was much more difficult than anything else in the game, and a new in game bestiary. I know these weren't made specifically for the PC port, and were carried over from the older GBA port of VI, but still... I mean, couldn't they have at least added some small stuff, like making the right stick turn the camera on the world map?\n\nThe lack of new features / content aside, I can't really find anything bad to say about this game. I'm hardly what I'd call a fanboy of the series, and this is still a really good jrpg. If you're into this genre, you could do a whole hell of a lot worse than Final Fantasy IX.","April 17","true","9.7"," 37 of 49 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","37","49","3","0"

I won't comment on the actual game since it came out 16 years ago and y'all should have a pretty good idea of what it is. I will however comment on the quality of the Steam release. Now I know that it's been out on Android for some time now, but having not played the mobile version, I cannot compare the two.\n\n- After reading some reviews (both negative and positive) and the forums, I wasn't expecting my Xbox One controller to work without getting a Joy2Key and performing the "run the game, then connect the controller when you get to the options menu" black magic. To my surprise, the controller worked right away. No tweaking, assigning controls or any use of keyboard+mouse was involved while I was playing.\n\n- Some said that they don't have an option to choose the 1080 resolution, I wouldn't know why that happens since I didn't encounter that issue.\n\n- Reworked fonts and menus look crispy clean. I didn't think it would matter until I saw it!\n\n- I'm not a fan of filters/other emulation enhancements and I took a moment to compare the standard emulation to the Steam release. The difference between the two is colossal. Yes, the static backgrounds haven't changed all that much but the new character models textures make more than enough difference.\n\n- The new autosave feature is extremely useful and works flawlessly. For some of us who has gained real life responsibilities since the last time we played FF9 this is an actual lifesaver.\n\n- Unlike FF7 and FF8, it was never ported to PC before so the MIDI sound issue 7 and 8 Steam releases had is not present.\n\nTo sum up my first impressions, I think the Steam version looks fantastic. This does feel like playing a remastered game. I know there's a lot of disagreement on what a remastered game should look like since the level of expectations goes from low to realistic to unrealistically high, but in my opinion this is a remaster worth playing.","April 14","true","9.3"," 26 of 31 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","26","31","2","1"

A game I have really fond memories of. In a lot of ways it's a game all about nostalgia.\n\nFinal Fantasy 9 takes place in a very cutesy chibi fantasy world where steampunk technologies like airships are just starting to become a thing. You play as Zidane, an amusing rogue who initially starts his quest on a mission to kidnap a princess. A far cry from the cold and distant protagonists of Cloud Strife and Squall Leonheart. However the plot gradually opens up into a very long quest as you eventually explore the world and encounter it's inhabitants.\n\nThe characters are where the game truly nails it. All of the party members in Final Fantasy 9 are memorable. Your black mage Vivi is insecure and always nervous. And Zidane and Vivi gradually grow into this almost brotherly bond with one another. Your princess Garnet yearns for adventure and over the course of the storyline develops a very pleasant romance with the protagonist. You eventually pick up her bodyguard Steiner, a perpetually aggravated knight sworn to protect her. And even more fantastical party members like Freya, an anthropomorphic rat clad in armor who joins the party looking for her long lost love. And Quina, a bizarre creature who has abilities based on enemies you allow him to consume. All of the party members in Final Fantasy 9 are great. I remembered all of them and the way they interact with each other and develop over the course of the story is a real treat.\n\nThe battle system in 9 takes from the previous games in numerous ways. The ATB system returns and they increased the amount of party members you can have in a single battle to 4 just like the pre-7 games. What I like about this release of the game in particular is it allows you to select elements of the user interface using the mouse. Which is very convenient and reduces the amount of fumbling through the menu that it usually would with the controller.\n\nThis is the first time Final Fantasy 9 has ever been released off the original Playstation so there are a few things to note if you've played Final Fantasy 7 or 8's PC ports. It doesn't let you use linear filtering like the original PS1 version, it uses a bilinear filter. For most people this won't be that big of a deal but it does look different compared to how you're used to. Otherwise it lets you play the game either with a controller or with a keyboard/mouse. And lets you control the user interface using the mouse which is a real treat to me. They also added an autosave feature and numerous little quirks into the game like allowing you to skip cutscenes.\n\nOne other thing to note is this isn't a full remake of Final Fantasy 9. The FMVs are the same, as are the 2D backgrounds and the 3D models. The only major differences I've noticed in the port compared to the original PS1 version are changes in the user interface. And like 7 and 8's PC ports it lets you optionally enable cheats to make you super powerful at the start of the game. So far the only major issue I've noticed is related to controller sensitivity so I hope that gets promptly fixed.\n\nThe entire game has this feeling of going back to something special. The soundtrack especially is full of very soft and somber themes that hearken back to childhood. It's a game that makes you feel like you're a kid again, and makes you want to return to old games you grew up with.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbwqTgJjtE0","April 14","true","2.9"," 24 of 31 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","24","31","2","3"

So you may have to do a boss battle over again, no big deal. Thanks Square Enix for that.\n\nGraphics are no better than if you was to play this on a phone. (Although why anyone would do so because a tiny screen)  The only thing I disliked about this whole thing was them annoucing it to be out in Feburary but did not get release until April 2016. But I see why now. It is still glitchy hence the "black screen of death" I got and that BSoD did not  lose much other than repurchasing and equiping equipment.\n\nPeople have been complaning about the audio. "Sounding off" as they say or "sounds compressed" while YES this is true, it is NOT the Final Fantasy VII midi sound quality.  It is not enough to detract from the game itself tho. It sounds good enough for me. All I can suggest is either play the OST in the backgorund and time it.. mute your tv... or deal with it. Maybe they will come out with a patch to remedy this but doubt it.\n\nThis game is worth 20.99 so if you miss off on launch sale, you can get it for that, or wait till the end of the year sale or Squares publisher sale...\n\nOkay PROS:\n* Nostalgia Nostalgia Nostalgia..\n*Added cheats if you so desire to be lazy.\n*Grapics are better.\n*AUTO SAVE everytime you change screens.\n*Full USB Contoller support .\n*The ability to skip cutscenes.\n*Fast Forward button "F1"\n*Did I mention Nostagia (for us 30-40 something players)\n\nCONS\n*Has a menu glitch (will strike trough when this is fixed)\n*Compressed music, but it is very tolerable.\n*No auto detect to change what to press when you are playing via keyboard to game controller. I had to relearn a few buttons.\n*Frame rates are stuck at 30fps for non cutscene screens 15fps for the cutscreen...\n*Does not save the "Cheats toggles" on reloads of saves.\n*Having to click play after I chosen my resolution everytime I start up.\n\nThis little gem is one you should play even after FF VIII made you decide to stop playing after that game. I just do not like the mechanics within. Square Soft made up with it in FF IX. It is worth buying.","April 18","true","32.6"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","17","20","0","5"

I hope FFXII and FFXV will follow suit, especially now since FFX/X-2 HD is released. With that said onto the review!\n\nI was skeptical at first regarding this game because I've heard so much good things about it but on the other hand it wasn't really a "hit" in terms of sales (it didn't get to the popularity of VII),  but rather than it got a cult following which I can appreciate. And because of that I decided to try it out having never played it before but hearing good things about it.\n\nSo here I am at the end of it and I must say that it surprised me completely with it's characters that were very well developed (especially Dagger & Vivi and let's not forget how awesome Quina is). I got so much into playing this game for the past couple of days without stopping until I finally reached the finish line.\n\nIt's one of the most "complete" Final Fantasy games in the franchise that I have played and it has managed to reached 1# on the FF games list for me followed by FFVII and FFX.\n\nDo I recommend this game? YES! Especially If you are into old school RPG's with an ATB system, it's charming characters and a soundtrack that will make you sometimes sad and sometimes happy.\n\nPS: This must be mentioned, but the PC only features that Square have implemented in these Final Fantasy ports in terms of boosters have been a godsend for those who want to go back and play the game out of nostalgia or for those that don't have hours and hours to grind through and make the minigames enjoyable.","May 18","true","103.3"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","12","12","0","0"

Plenty of other people already have, and many can be found right on this page. So I'm going to assume that you already know it's a good game. (Although just to add my own two cents to that matter: FF9 is, to this day, the only RPG - and very nearly the only game - that I have played all the way through to the end multiple times, and since getting it, I don't think I've ever gone more than two years without finishing it at least once.) Instead, I'd like to talk specifically about this version.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it's still a great game (overall, I am still recommending it, after all), and everything that made it a great game is still here. But that's kind of the trouble - what makes it a great game is pretty much only what was already there in its original PlayStation release. Fun fact: the textures and backgrounds stored on the discs in the game's original release were actually quite a bit higher quality than the PlayStation was actually capable of rendering and displaying at the time. And sadly, it seems the devs were aware of this, because pretty much no effort went into updating anything except maybe the main characters a little. It seems like all they did for the backgrounds was simply blur the textures a little to hide the pixelation which probably works well enough at lower resolutions that are still higher than the original, but becomes pretty apparent at what I at least assume is close-to-standard gaming PC resolutions of 1600x900 and 1920x1080. Ironically, I think these would have looked much better had they actually put in even less effort, and just left them pixelated. I mean, they originals are almost pixel art as far as pre-rendered backgrounds go. The FMV cutscenes are spectacular however, and it's really great getting to see them without the resolution limitations of the PlayStation, however there are a few in-game cutscenes that use rendered models and the pre-rendered backgrounds and because of the slapdash update, these are borderline horrific. Thankfully, they are few and far between, and never more than a couple of seconds long, so they don't ruin the experience.\n\nAll in all, this supposedly "updated" rerelease is about what I had expected, though not what I had hoped for. Luckily, compared to plenty of other 15 year old games, it already had spectacular graphics that I, at least, think aged fairly well even in their original state, so it's probably only going to be hardcore fans of the game (like myself) who might be tempted to claw their eyeballs out. Ultimately, my recommendation is that if possible, you should actually get the original game. Just last year I finished a playthrough on my PS2 using a respectable 1080p widescreen TV, and it was just as beautiful there as I always remembered. However, if that's not feasible for you, I still recommend you at least get this version given that it is definitely what I would consider one of the must-play classics of gaming history - for its own merits, not simply its influences.\n\nAnd even slapdash and hasty as this rerelease was, I don't regret purchasing a second copy one bit. Just... be aware.\n\nP.S. Some other notes:\n- The sound seems to... I'm not sure what the technical terms are, but "cap out" at times, and gets a bit static-y with the higher pitches or louder sounds. It could just be that I was playing it with the speakers turned up a little louder than I usually game at, but I rather doubt it. (Incidentally, the original game doesn't have this problem.)\n- They seem to have basically cut out the stick-based movement controls. No matter how much or how little you push the analog sticks, you're going to move at the same speed and walking/running is based on the B button and which one you set to the default. I can see this potentially causing problems for veterans of the game since the analog stick and the D-pad controlled slightly differently. Basically, the analog stick moves you in the direction you move it, while the D-pad will shift so that when, for example, you're in a hall that is laid out at an angle, just pressing up or down moves you up or down the hall at that angle, rather than requiring you to keep tapping left or right every now and again. I haven't played enough to see which they've defaulted to for all movement, now, but either way I foresee some messy accidents, particularly in areas like Cleyra's trunk where you sometimes need to tread carefully.\n- On the brighter side, when naming party members you get this beautiful splash image of the character's face (from the those that appear when the title screen is idle, for those familiar with the game) along with a short (spoiler-free, even if it means occasionally lying to you) bio for the character telling you their age, species, and so on. Which I did appreciate.\n- Again, the FMV cutscenes are gorgeous in their full resolution glory.\n- Also again, it's still a fantastic game at its heart. Far and away the best Final Fantasy game (and certainly one of the best RPGs - J or otherwise), and I will only concede to Final Fantasy VI as a contender. Even then, I'd only agree to disagree. (And I say this as someone who has played every non-MMO Final Fantasy through to XII, as well as dozens of other western and JRPGs from Persona to Planescape to Elder Scrolls.)","April 15","true","4.8"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","0"

There were quite a lot of improvements though it seems some people hated the Borderline that was added and wanted widescreen but kinda defeats the purpose of bringing back the Nostalgic days.\nI don't really see much problem about the price and people complain it being a mobile port when it doesn't as I don't see how it's different from the PsP/Console version besides all the HD Texture models, sounds and FMV. Even the file size is completely different. So I'm guessing its the minority people who really didn't go full research. Sure there is a FPS lock but this was created during the Playstation 1 Era and its not really easy to code the entire game to fit its FPS. You can turn on the highspeed mode with the F1 if you read the manual. There are cheats there though best not to use them unless you wish to speedrun or just to kill time.\nGame supports both Gamepad Control (It uses Japan Standard Layout) and has a perfect Keyboard+Mouse settings. The UI is kinda big and gets in the way at time.\nOnly the Main characters get a Remodel Texture while the rest didn't get the same Treatment. With the background it didn't see to fit also.\nThe sounds is also beautiful. Its not the Digital sounds that we all know as its replaced with actual musical instruments.\nBugs, I've yet to even encounter any of them. I guess it differs to peoples PC/Laptop setup so if you have any problems go check the Discussion Forums since people have reported missing sounds or some sort of broken controls.\nOverall the port is perfect and there is no DRM which is a bonus.","April 15","true","31.1"," 20 of 29 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","20","29","2","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dalgokaito/recommended/377840/","dalgokaito","Demilikos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dalgokaito/","115 products in account","Final Fantasy IX is like a childhood friend of mine I'm meeting again for the first time in over a decade. Among the cheerful memories, witty banter, romance, moments of doubt and lessons-learned... it opened up a world of intrigue and steampunk-sprinkled adventure to my 13-year-old self during a time in which the world had me jaded. The game especially held a dear place within me as I introduced it to my childhood best friend. Raised in a religious household, she never grew up with the television shows and general entertainment that most millennials growing up in the west were able to consume. After we played through the riveting kidnap and crash sequence, I could see in her eyes a new world of possibilities had emerged. Not too long afterward she had somehow obtained a PlayStation and a copy of the game, which she and her little sister would soon complete. I noticed from afar that it had colored her life, and her little sister's as well. That friend of mine left this world two years ago, losing a hard battle to cancer. Her little sister lost her life in a car accident just prior. It was devastating that they had gone and yet I would remain. And now Final Fantasy IX has returned like a ghost of the fond memories we had shared in our distant past.\n\nFinal Fantasy IX was released in 2000 for the PlayStation. Until 2016, there was no legitimate way of playing the game outside of PSN in the west. This re-release will open the game up to many who have never had the chance to play it. This absolutely excites me. Final Fantasy IX was my first Final Fantasy game. I have since played them all, but Final Fantasy IX still remains my favorite. From the setting, to the differed ideologies of its characters, to the clever dialogue and story with its well-executed character development, and Nobuo Uematsu's brilliant, beautiful music which tied the story and its varied settings together. Also, it arguably had the sharpest and most-unique graphics among the PlayStation-era Final Fantasy games. I held to this being my favorite in many conversations, and until recently, had been the only one I knew standing behind it. Most people I talked to would just laughed at the mere mention of IX, usually citing the character designs as the reason they never gave it a chance. It is by far the most underrated of the PlayStation-era FFs, and I'm curious to see if this will remain to be the case going forward.\n\nThis is a great port of the game. The character models and textures are highly improved, although as I write this so close to the Steam release date, many gamers are currently complaining about the pre-rendered background textures. I never expected SquareEnix to go back to the source files and re-render those CGI files for the modern-era. I'm not even sure if they have access to them, or are still able to open them with a program. If they could somehow do that, perhaps they'd even be able to re-render the 4:3 aspect ratio cutscenes into 16:9, but I'm just happy they were even able to improve the in-game 3D models, textures, and text -- although I could imagine a portion of the original players expressing some gripe toward the latter.\n\nSome would attribute these high-praises from original players to nostalgia-glasses. I'm here to say that I actually have a bigger appreciation for this game as an adult having a go at it again. So if you haven't given this game a try, what are you waiting for?","April 18","true","57.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

The characters are all very well done with unique personalities that play and clash wonderfully with each other. The story starts out with a simple abduction of a princess, but eventually turns into a story about life and death itself.\n\nTHE PORT:\n\nThey did a good job of porting this to PC. The default keyboard controls are bizzare but can be rebound in the config menu. I would still reccomend using a gamepad though. The main characters have been given a higher poly makeover without looking bad or tacky. The cinematics have been given some love and been made sharper. I'm not sure how they did that but I wish FF7 and FF8 had been given the same treatment. All in all, you'd never even know this was a mobile port if no one told you.","May 13","true","73.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","1"

That being said, this port is just not worth the money.\n\nThere are audio bugs rampant everywhere from sound effects being way too loud and clipping the audio near deafening you if you're wearing headphones, to audio just cutting out for apparently no reason. The HD models are nice but with the backgrounds just being upscaled from 144p (or whatever it was) there can be a huge disconnect at time and it can just look plain bad. The framerate can dip (Most notably on the world map when you have a chocobo, ship or airship) down into the 10's for a number of seconds or just straight up freeze for no reason, with a game that's already locked at 30 or sometimes 20 depending on if you're on a normal screen or the map/battle this is very disappointing.\n\nGoing back to the models it's clear some were given more love than others, models like Garnet and Steiner look fantastic whilst people like Zidane and Eiko still have these weird awkward faces that look ridiculously out of place. Most NPC's models have just been upscaled too and when standing next to the player models they look terrible. One of the biggest irks I had was the issue of no longer having infinite analogue control movement. instead of being able to run in any direction like you could in the Playstation 1 version of the game, for some reason this game only lets you run in 8, meaning you will get caught on the scenery A LOT and when you're playing something like Chocobo Hot 'n' Cold it can lead to a lot of frustration.\n\nLike I said I hate having to put this, but I cannot recommend this game in it's current state. Just buy the port on PSN if you want to play it OR play the original version on Playstation.","April 30","false","40.6"," 24 of 42 people (57%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","57","24","42","3","1"

The characters move very smoothly and the clarity is unreal. I can actually see the details in weapons that I never knew were there in the old Playstation version. Everything is very much up scaled. I'm kinda bummed Square Enix didn't remaster the music too (it's amazing to begin with though) but this isn't a full on remaster so it's whatever.\n\nThus far, my only gripe(s) is that sometimes the frame rate craps out only slightly because they up scaled the characters so much that the back ground gets a little constipated. Like when you take control of Vivi and the camera zooms in with "Alexandria" fading in and out of the screen. Then when he gets knocked down by Puck... sweet baby jesus TEH blur. I also noticed it suffers from the same nonsense the other Final Fantasies when they're ported (to/from) andriod--the interface. The stupid battle menus look like the same cancer as before which perplexes me.... this was meant for PC but I feel like it being held back because of the port to android?\n\nOne last thing, no matter what screen ratio you choose or even if you full screen or window the game has this border on both sides that's distracting. I blame android. I feel this could have been SO MUCH MORE if they didn't bother with the android stuff and pushed for a PC release only. Just my opinion though.\n\nANYWHO! I'm grateful this was "remastered" because it is my favorite Final Fantasy from the Playstation era. It's nice to see it at least cleaned up and easily accessible for me to play again. I love it for the nostagia factor yes, but I also love the game in no matter what format it's in.

Final Fantasy 9 orijinalinde 2000 yapımı bir oyun. Uzun yıllar sonra sonra steama daha doğrusu PC ye geldi. Diğer FF ler gibi.\n\nGrafikler elden geçirilmiş ama 16 yıl öncesine ait bir oyun olduğundan çok bişey beklemeyin. Yine de hem FF oynamak istiyor hem de grafik arıyorsanız 13 üçlemesine yönelin.\n\nTantalus adlı görünürde çeşitli şehirlerde tiyatro oyunları sergileyen gerçekte ise hırsızlık yapan bir grubun üyesiyiz. Görevimiz tiyatro oyununu maske olarak kullanıp prensesi kaçırmak. Tabi ilginç bişey olur. Prenses de saraydan kaçmak niyetindedir. Ve böylece maceramız başlar. Konu Final Fantasy olduğu için bundan kat be kat fazlasını gönül rahatlığıyla bekleyebilirsiniz. İstediğinizi alacaksınız.\n\nOynanışa gelirsek Final Fantasy 7-8 i oynadıysanız yabancılık çekmeyeceksiniz. Sıra tabanlı random encounter olan sistem. Farklılıklardan bahsetmek gerekirse; 7 de Materia sistemi vardı, 8 de Junction. 9 da ise şöyle bir sistem var. Kullanacağınız yetenekler itemlere bağlı. Misal bir yeteneği istediğiniz zaman kullanmak istiyorsanız size o yeteneği veren itemi giyip o yeteneği öğrenene kadar o itemi takmalısınız. Genelde çok yüksek rakam isteyen yetenek pek yok. Ayrıca boss dövüşleri yerine göre 8-10 20 30 yetenek puanı verdiğinden çokta sıkıntı olmaz bu.\n\nKesin olarak öğrenmeniz gereken yetenekler ise auto-life, auto-haste, auto-regen. En az 4 karaktere bunları öğretin. Dikkat etmeniz gerekn birşey daha var. Diyelim bir itemde 3 yetenek var. Bir karakter bu 3 yetenekten 2 sini öğrenebilirken diğeri sadece birini bir başkası ise hiçbirini öğrenemeyebiliyor. Aynı item ama öğrenilen yetenekler farklı. Yetenekleri hızlı öğrenmek istiyorsanız "ability up"ı öğrenip equip yapın. Sonra gidin farm yapın.\n\nFinal Fantasy 9 neşeli cıvıl cıvıl bir oyun. Öyle ki en hüzünlü anda bile yemek muhabbeti duyabilirsiniz. Bu yüzden bolca kahkaha attığınız anlar olacak oyunda. Oyunda midesine benden daha düşkün bir karakter var. Daha ne diyeyim.\n\nOyunla ilgili ufak bir hayalkırıklığım oldu. Nasıl dediğinizi duyar gibiyim. Olay şu; Final Boss savaşı (3 savaş) çok çabuk bitti. 15 dakika sürmedi bile. Sadece bir karakterim 2 kere öldü bu 3 svaşta. Gerisinin hp si 1000 altına inmedi bile. Üstte bahsettiğim yeteneklerin ve sağlam gitmeminde etkisi var bunda tabi ama benzer şekilde Sephiroth a gittiğimde öttürmüştü resmen. Ki onda hp im 9000 lerdeydi. Bunda 7000 de olan HP im yoktu. Resmen "öldüya la" deyip kalakaldım.\n\nİlginç bişey daha söyleyeyim. Oyundaki en yüksek Hp ye sahip karakter aklınıza bile gelmez. O paylaştığım küreye benzer şekli olan değil. 2 tane var gerçi. Birini rahatlıkla bulabilirsiniz ama belli bir görev yapmadan savaşamazsınız. Görevse çok vakit alıyor. Ben yarısından sonra yapmadım. Ekipteki kişilerden birinin ultimate silahı bu dediğim kişide. Diğeri içinde Friendly Monster görevini yapmanız lazım. Hepsini yapmadan bulsanız bile. Ötekilerle buluşmadın deyip kaçıyor. Bu görevse inanılmaz sinir bozucu. Çünkü bi türlü çıkmıyo dallamalar.\n\nSevimli dostlarımız chocobolar bu oyunda da varlar. Bu sefer chocobolarımızı geliştirmek için yarıştırmak/çiftleştirmek zorunda değiliz. Sıcak-soğuk diye bir oyun vardırya sonuca yaklaştıkça sıcaaak sıcaaaaaaaaaaaaak denilir. Ona benzer bir oyun oynayıp chocograph denilen parçaları buluyoruz. Chocographlarda bize bir noktayı gösteriyor. Hazine orda. Bu bulduğumuz hazinelerden bazıları chocobomuzun gelişmesini yeni yetenekler öğrenmesini sağlıyor. Bazı ultimate silahları gizli yerleri hatta resmini paylaştığım o yuvarlak küreyi bulmanın yolu chocobo side questi olduğu için yapmanızı öneririm.\n\nEee müzikler, müzikler nerde? Onlardan niye bahsetmiyon diyeceklere; "Uematsu var bir kere taam mı. Siz Uematsu nun adının geçtiği bir yapımda müzikleri tartışmaya mı açıyorsunuz?" 10/10 müzikler. Özellikle ending şarkısı çok çok güzel. Dinlemek isteyen olursa diye parçanın adını söylemiyorum. Bilenler de söylemesin. Oyunu oynayın kendiniz görün. Çünkü hem şarkı hem öncesi çok güzel. Ben bulup dinleyecem diyorsanız da klip olarak değil de bi tane resim olur şarkı çalarya o şekil dinleyin. Çünkü spo yiyeceksiniz ve spo benim en nefret ettiğim şeydir oyunlarla/filmlerle ilgili.\n\nBu sefer kısa yazacam deyip gene destan yazdım. Sağlam hikaye, bol esprili bir oyun istiyorsanız ilacınız Final Fantasy 9. Alın oynayın.","April 27","true","80.0"," 17 of 29 people (59%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","59","17","29","3","0"

This game STILL makes me cry, and even after just now completing it again for the 12th time, I STILL wouldn't mind playing it again. It's because this game is built on two major things that so many games lack, and that's VISION and HEART. FFIX is filled with interesting character designs, environments, side-quests, and overall story. It's very light hearted and really stresses the theme of the strength built through working together with friends.

But if you look at the discussion forums, you'll note that half of the entries are from people where the game is simply too buggy to play.  I'm one of those people and I do not want anyone to buy this game and waste their money until SE patches the game.\n\nThe problem is the controller interface.  If you have an Xbox 360 controller there is, for unknown reasons, a 50/50 chance the game will be unplayable for you.  You can update all your drivers, and in the forums people have rituals they're trying to do to make it work (similar to blowing in an NES cartridge back in the day).  But the bottom line is, the PC version of the game was a direct port from the smart phone version, and the programming for the controls was not done well.  If you have an Xbox One controller, the game will be unplayable.  For me it's so bad with the One controller that I can't even make it past the start menu.  The problem is so bad for both of these controllers that if I had them plugged in at all at any time before I start the game, I can't even play with my keyboard!  I literally have to go into my device manager and turn off Human Interface Devices and enable only my KB and Mouse as peripherals.  And I have to do that every time I want to attempt to play with my KB (which kills the experience for me anyway).\n\nSo in sum, you're playing roulette with purchasing this game.  And the sad part is, the opening week deal will be over before they patch it, if they even do.  I personally am considering the 16 dollars spent on this a donation to SE, since I don't feel like going through the hassle of getting a refund.  I own FFVII, FFVIII, FFXI, FFXIV, and Lightning Returns, all on Steam.  And every one of those titles works just fine with both the 360 and the One controller with default device drivers.

Although many times the Final fantasy series have similar plots such as the protagonists being branded as outcasts, run around the world then at some point managed to save the day and concludes with a happy ending but it still never fails to captivate me. In addition, FFIX has very detailed characters where each character holds a very deep story of their own. Not to mention, all the characters are very likable. Like take for example animes, dramas, movies, novel and basically anything that is a story; there will always be that 1 irritating egg head character that stresses you to the point where you would go ‘JUST GET THE FUQ OFF ALREADY KUNT?!?!?’. But for some odd reasons these characters somehow someway get a lot of screen time... WHY? -.-‘ Nevertheless, FFIX has none :3 (maybe Steiner in the beginning I guess LOL).\n\nMoving on, FFIX also has great music that comes along with it ( yea.. Garnet.. and her mellifluous voice [I think she was my first crush >.<]) I must say I absolutely adore her when she was singing the ‘Melodies of Life’. Then there’s also Beatrice. Her theme and her character without a doubt carries their charm too. Although there is also Freya and Eiko but since they are not as visually attractive.. I have decided to skip (Don’t judge me :P)\n\nThe graphics and gameplay matter little to me back then, they still matter little to me now. The fantasy FFIX brought me through remains beautiful.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Misdirected/recommended/377840/","Misdirected","Misdirected","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Misdirected/","186 products in account","[Updated review: included assessment of the port]\nThis game holds a special place in my heart. I’ve played it hundreds of hours, and have now bought it three times.\n\nThis was released on the PlayStation (one) several months after the PlayStation2 had already been released. This was probably why it managed to slip under the radar for many folks, even though the graphics were on par with the PS2’s titles at that time.\n\nThis game harkens back to the NES and SNES world-types, and was the last game composed entirely by Nobuo Uematsu – the brilliant mind behind Final Fantasy’s genre defining music.\n\nThe truth is, the characters are all stereotypically cliché, and the plot is formulaic – but the world is so immersive and the storytelling so charming that this fails to detract from the experience. It’s fluff, not Machiavelli; it’s meant to be enjoyed. It overcomes the sitcom-like positioning of its set-pieces and embarks the player on a delightful experience, full of drama, pathos, and a fair number of laughs. If that’s not something you find desirable in a game, I suggest you look elsewhere – otherwise I can’t recommend it enough.\n\n----------\n\nThat’s all well and good, but how well does the port run?\n\nBetter than the original, honestly. I’ll address the cons in a moment, but they got everything as good as I could have hoped. Comparing both to the original PS game and optimum emulator settings, the game is so much crisper than it’s ever been. Previous aliasing miss-alignment are gone entirely, and the image fidelity is exactly what you’d expect from your computer’s hardware (again, qualifying these statements below). The UI has been updated, others attribute it to the mobile port which I haven’t played, but I’m inclined to say it’s a marked upgrade, even if it takes up additional screen space. I’m going to pick it apart in a moment, but with everything I’m about to say taken into account, I don’t really see how it could have done better.\n\nThat’s a hell of a statement, and you may be disinclined to agree with me in light of some other reviews, or even if you’ve played the game. And you’re right, you see graphical flaws, the textures are fair-to-poor in many places, the framerate is capped to about 30fps, and it’s pillarboxed.\n\nYes, these are issues this port has, and it’s understandable if they detract from your experience playing the game, but as I said: because they’re using the original game assets, it’s as good as it’s going to get.\n\n“What!?” – Let me tell you about how they made this game 16 years ago. The majority of the game (except for cut scenes, world map, and battle arenas) are all sprites, not rendered scenes with hundreds of polygons. FFVII and FFVIII used actively rendered scenes, this is true – but for FFIX they took a completely different visual style. They pre-rendered all the landscapes and “baked’ them into a dozen or so polygons – significantly lessening the processing necessary, instead opting for a much higher level of detail than the previous two titles were able to achieve. The thing is, many gamers today would prefer active rendering because it’s become the norm, and that the resolution of the textures are very lacking by today’s standards.\n\nBecause of this, you get the reasoning behind the biggest complaints folks seem to be having in the reviews: The game is pillarboxed to 4:3 because that was the stock aspect ratio of all CRT screens used 16 years ago – they can’t just extend the camera to 16:9 like they did for the FFVII and FFVIII ports because the game’s assets were finalized into 4:3 images.\n\nSecondly, along with the 4:3 target aspect ratio, standard-definition[en.wikipedia.org] PAL televisions only had a max resolution of 720 x 576 (NTSC TVs in the US were a little smaller). This is why the textures are at the low resolution you’re seeing. If they made the game with higher quality textures, you’d never (ever) see a quality change on your standard-definition television. Personally I can’t blame Square for not having the foresight of knowing they’d be re-releasing the game into 1080p 16 years later. I’m just glad they didn’t emulate interlacing like you need to if you’re emulating the game on the PC.\n\nThe framerate cap is understandable, if undesirable. I’m not sure the reason, but the game runs dependent on a fixed update, not per cycle of your processor. 30fps was likely chosen because the original framerate was either 24, 25, or 30fps per SDTV. While HDTV is frequently 60fps, they likely used the age-old doubling jitter-reducing[en.wikipedia.org] trick to match current monitor refresh-rates. (It’s not particularly necessary to understand what this means). The odd thing about this is that it is a solid framerate cap – I attempted to insert a speed-hack modifier into the game’s memory, only to have it crash every time (I wanted to use this as a frame-skip feature present in emulators). The game doesn’t hang when loading new scenes like the original did, so I suppose I’ll take that as an acceptable improvement.\n\nThe only other thing to talk about are the changes made to the UI. All-in-all I think it’s a large improvement, the only detraction being the increased size to accommodate mobile users. Everything about the menus, including the portraits, are much (much) sharper than they were in the original. If anything it’s too much of an improvement because it’s so much of a contract from the rest of the game. It does leave me to wonder that if they made such improvements to the UI, they could have adapted it to be a little more efficient with screen-space for the PC port. The additional features (infinite money, max level, etc. cheats) are in an out-of-the way place that are kind of hard to find, but they weren’t in the original, so I’m not sure where else they should have been put.\n\nSo, after all that, I can certainly recommend the game – both the core game and the port.","April 14","true","23.7"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

My friend gifted this game to me all of sudden, so I have an opportunity to replay it.\n\nBack then my english was not as good as now. The emo heroes such as Cloud and Squall shaped the general jrpg heroes, the sudden introduction of Zidane deviated the popular tropes, it's probably the reason I didn't like FF IX back then. Perhaps because Final Fantasy VII was my first Final Fantasy entry (I only played three rpgs on SNES: Chrono Trigger, Mystic Quest, and Super Mario RPG. I played FF VI only after the re-release on PSX) therefore I couldn't understand why everyone praised FF IX, when actually this was a very refreshing entry on JRPG.\n\nI have forgotten 80% of the plot, so this is almost like a new gameplay for me. Well, I gotta say this game is truly charming. The opening scene and the kidnapping of princess Garnet is probably one of the best opening I ever seen. It truly established the characters of the cast very well and you can tell the light-hearted atmosphere of the game. I really like it.\n\nNow for the quality of the port itself. So far I think it's the better port of FF entry, the game is capped 30 fps which is just fine. The 3d graphic has been upscaled to HD version.\n\nAs this is a port of an old game, you will notice that the pre-rendered CG don't age very well. One of the main reason is that Square lost all the high-resolution arts (please read and cry)\n\nhttp://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=551612\n\nthe good thing, this game has also a built in cheat. 9999 damage for example. if you don't care about the gameplay and just want to enjoy the story (it also has a fast forward button). just activate the cheat. Be careful about the level 99 cheat though, it will only increase your level, not your status\n\nThis game is truly a classic.

They include boosting your Gil (in game currency) to the maximum amount, always dealing 9999 damage per attack (the maximum you can attack for), skipping random battles that are there for grinding purposes, maxing out your learning of skills, speeding up certain parts of the game (though I don't know what they specifically speed up) and remaining in Trance at all time (trance being a mode your character can enter to do more damage/more attacks) and I swear there was one more but I can't remember for the life of me.\n\nThe game is highly immersive with lovely looking locations, interesting characters whose story and personality is aided through the game's unique system of viewing little events they get up to and defiantly worth playing.\n","April 25","true","22.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

And the same warning as last time.\n\nWARNING:  IF YOU ARE EXPECTING FINAL FANTASY XIII GRAPHICS AND FOR WHATEVER REASON HAVE IGNORED EVERYONE TELLING YOU, REPEATEDLY, THAT THIS IS A PORT OF THE ANDROID/IOS VERSION - WHICH IS A PORT OF A PS1 GAME FROM 16-17 YEARS AGO - DO_NOT_BUY, or at least don't complain.  Why drop $16 on a game you know you'll just complain about?\n\nOkay, so if you're expecting high-def backgrounds - don't.  Look.  This game was released in 2000/1999.  Back then it looked spectacular, they DID put a lot of effort into it, and I'm almost 100% certain they never ever thought that they would be re-making this game.  The models used for the pre-rendered areas no longer exist.  Accept it.  There's far more to the game, such as the story, dialogue, and music.\n\nThe character models, battle scenary, and menus?  They're great.  At times it looks the models are watercolor painted, and personally I like that.  The menus and item icons are well-polished.  The music is still the same music as before, maybe slightly higher audio quality - but that could be due to hardware, so don't take my word on that.\n\nSome people are having controller issues, but my 360 controller seems fine.  Your results may vary, but I'm 100% certain it'll be patched in the next couple days.\n\nBut I digress on the port issues.  Let's delve into the meat of the game...\n\nFinal Fantasy IX is a return to the midieval roots of the series. This doesn't necessarily mean four crystals and yatta yatta.  It's about people coming together, becoming friends, and overcoming evil. Characters hava pre-defined classes, but while there's no job system they're the classic Final Fantasy I-IV classes.  Customization is plentiful through weapons, armor, and accessories.  Music is memorable, and as it's stuck with me for 16 years at this point?  I'm pretty sure it'll have a similar effect on you.  The storyline has a good many twists to keep you interested.  Personally some find the begining a bit long and boring, but I -promise- you that after you get out of the forest you'll be on the edge of your seat for the rest of the game.  As fr the characters, some are hit-or-miss but I honestly feel like if you got attached to the characters in Undertale that you'll do the same for at least of the characters in this story.\n\nIf you're not new to the game, but are thinking of buying it for nostalgia?  There are some nifty additions that'll help you beat the game more quickly without breaking the gameplay experience. So yes, for the nostalgia, $16 ($20 if you're reading this after the sale ends) is worth it.","April 14","true","102.4"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

My all time favorite Final Fantasy game and one of my top 3 favorite games of all time. I am so glad just like Final Fantasy VI remastered edition, you guys have out done yourself on bringing this game to a pc port. Everything I loved about this game back when it released in 2000, is here, and it makes me so happy to be replaying it again. I still own my PS1 copy but the PC version is so beautiful in HD resolution. I totally recommend this for all the classic Final Fantasy players and new players of RPG games all together. I will be going all out to get every achievement on this game, even that blasted Jump Rope one.

I still remember their game discs were made in black, and that added on to the special feeling I have for FF9 since then.\n\nI will not compare to other Final Fantasy games because each has its own attraction and audience. For me, FF9 feels like a throwback to the classic FF system. Although the mechanisms may seem simple, along with its simplistic graphics, it allowed me to "fill in the gaps" in my mind with my imagination, and allowed me to immerse in its story and emotions.\n\nThis is my Final Fantasy, and this is how I tell and re-tell the story. This is the fourth time I'm re-telling the story, and I still have more interpretations each time. Final Fantasy is about telling a story like no other games can. Yes, graphics may be a boon, but if a Final Fantasy game can't tell a story 10x better than its graphics could, then it has failed as a Final Fantasy.\n\nI believe Final Fantasy IX has done that. It shows how great games don't necessarily need to have life-like facial features and individually-moving strands of hair. In fact, I'd rather let the mind fill in those gaps for me, as that is actually more enjoyable and personal than having everything laid out for me.\n\nThis is my Final Fantasy, and this is how I tell and re-tell the story.

It's not a big deal once you get used to it once again, but it's a shame they couldn't find a way to improve on the original.\n- It is made in Unity engine, which means that having your controller work with it can be really painful.\n- Graphics are a mixed bag: 3D models are very beautiful looking, but the blurry 2D backgrounds meld very bad with the models and are often downright confusing.\n- Overall the game isn't CPU/GPU intensive at all; it will probably run well on any potato even on integrated graphics.\n- Music is the original one and not a remix. It sounds as good as ever.\n- They added 7 boosters that can be very helpful to ease the suffering on the hardest parts.\n- It has some very minor bugs like inputs not correctly displayed in some parts or dialogues randomly freezing before they start back again. I didn't find anything game breaking, but I'm still too early in the game to judge on that.\n- It still has Tetra Master. AND 3 achievements for playing it. Yuck.\n\nOverall I give this port a 7/10. It works fine, but the additional value over the original is very slight. Get it for nostalgia or if you really never played this fine game.","April 19","true","20.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A few people complained about the updated UI but I really don't see a problem with it.\n\nI honestly cannot find a reason for someone to not play this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tetsuo3k/recommended/377840/","tetsuo3k","Tetsuo3K","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tetsuo3k/","452 products in account","This is a pretty decent port, albeit with some odd shortcomings compared to the original. Probably the most awkward among them is that this port offers no real analog control, plus name entry is mouse+keyboard only. This is not a port that can be easily enjoyed in big picture mode (that said, this is plainly stated on the store page). I like mouse and keyboard support, but not when it fully supplants gamepad input. Overall, it seems like controller support was at best an afterthought, which makes sense in the context of a mobile release, but not for PC these days - and certainly not for a game that originally saw release on a console 16 years ago. It's more than a little obnoxious that I should have to hold a button to run while using the analog stick, rather than just using the analog stick like nearly every other 3D game has since Super Mario 64. Final Fantasy 9 really deserves better.\n\nOtherwise, things are pretty good. Obviously the backgrounds don't hold up terribly well, but they get the job done. Only a handful of high resolution assets from development of the PS1 version still exist, and nobody reasonable was expecting Square Enix to remake the rest to match. I don't know what the situation is with the FMV, but it looks surprisingly nice. The 3D models of course look great, and while it is a shame the game is still 30 fps locked, I can't honestly say I'm that broken up about it.\n\nAt the end of the day, while it exhibits some unwelcome mobile-to-PC port idiosyncracies, this is still a good PC release of one of the best Final Fantasy games ever. It could use a bit more polish, but it's fun and nostalgic as is. If they improve the controller support, it'll be damn near perfect.","April 16","true","5.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I was captivated by the music, the story, the characters... Everything kept me under spell, till finally I beat it. Best three days of my life. Now that my PS2 console is busted, I no longer can play this but thank gods for this release, I can finally relive the best moments of gaming!\n\nWhat I like:\nCharacters. I love Zidane and his attitude. Even though laid back, he has wisdom in him that he shares with others. Dagger, well, she's your everyday naive princess, but during the course of the game she grows up to be the ruler that her kingdom needs. Steiner... oh... Steiner! The sass he and Zidane exchange... I love it! Vivi is like me - introvert, uncertain, hesitant with low self-esteem, but underneath all that he holds the power to destroy the world if he so chooses. Sadly I can't do magic... but Vivi is still probably my number one character. Quina... the must-have comic relief... but s/he is till better than Jar-Jar :P (please don't kill me). Freya... I love her "To be forgotten is worse than death" phrase. She's my must have member in the main party. (I soloed the last boss with her! THAT was a thrill.) Eiko is that perky little girl that everyone loves... or hates... I personally keep her as a second healer in party. Amarant... no opinion. He's awesome but I hardly ever keep him in my party. Main villain, however, is just... meh. Kefka is better, Sephiroth is better... but I think he was made for the fangirls to drool. Those hips man... those hips don't lie!\n\nMusic: Uematsu-sensei deserves much praise for the music he composed. I love Melodies of Life theme song a lot, and I find  myself singing it to the tune everytime.\n\nStory: 10/10, nothing else to say. Play it! Experience it!\n\nNew graphics give more depth to the design, so yes, I like it.\n\nWhat I don't like:\n\nThe chance for random battles have obviously been decreased. I love grinding. In the PS version I wouldn't need to take more than 5 steps before the next fight, now I need to walk around for a minute before I get into a fight. I hope this issue is fixed or at least checked upon. I need them levels and I don't want to waste time by running around looking for random fights when those fights should basically come to me.\n\nThe battle UI is wayt too big! It's distractingly huge and the spell quickly browsing (RB/LB) the spell list make the cursor go to the bottom and not stay on the spot... I'm used to the PS version where the cursor stays on the spot and when quickly browsing the spell list the spell is easier to choose. I don't use "Wait" mode in battle. So... yeah... But it's fine, this is only a minor thing and I'm sure someone will come up with a solution.\n\n\nOverall:\n\nPlay this game! It's 10/10, and all those old school gamers should feel the nostalgia when FURUSATO plays on the menu screen.","May 21","true","48.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

From Vivi, the self doubting black mage, to Zidane, the mischevious ne'er-do-well, to Garnet, the naive princess that believes she can prevent a war, the entire cast of playable characters is very well fleshed out. I personally didn't like Amarant, Eiko, or Quina as much as the best, but they are all quite interesting in their own rights, and there are characters for everybody. Garnet and Vivi have set a standard for me as far as true strength of character goes, as they both face very powerful demons and are able to find peace in them.\n\n+  Atmosphere  Other than characters, the world of Gaia is quite an interesting place. It uses a more high fantasy style than the iterations surrounding it. The world is filled with all kinds of crazy races of people, from bird people (hellooooooooo Queen Stella), to pig people, bat people, rat people (I never thought I would like rat people, but the Burmecians are pretty cool), clown people, androids with tails, and, of course, everybody's favorite, the moogles! There is also a steampunk theme to the game, as Mist powered airships are becoming popular, and those that have limited access are being left behind, yet magic still abounds and can be quite powerful.\n\nGameplay  The gameplay itself is good not great. You can have a party of up to 4 characters that all have predetermined abilities to be learned, and you don't get to choose who you want until the 3rd disc. Combat is based off the ATB system, which is quite good in its own right, until you factor in Trance. Trance is just like limit breaks and overdrive, except it activates all by itself. That's right, if you get whacked in the face by a Mu with a nearly full Trance gauge, you'll activate Trance, probably kill him by looking at him, and then boom, your Trance was wasted. On top of that, once you queue up certain commands, it is entirely likely that the enemy will execute a turn before you are expecting it. The number of times that I have had one character use a phoenix down and then another character immediately use a hi potion, only to have the revived character immediately killed off, is maddening.\n\nProgression is also extremely limited. Regardless of how much you are able to steal, or how many treasure chests you find, the set of abilities that you are allowed to learn is finite. While restricting the spells that are learnable such that your characters don't just blast the ever living hell out of everything you run into, it gets real old real fast when you have to use far inferior equipment in order to deal with certain status ailments because you didn't power grind Steiner's abilities for that short period of time you played him in the first disc.\n\nSide Quests  This is a truly mixed bag. Chocobo Hot and Cold, where you dig in a chocobo forest (and eventually other areas) for items, and subsequently get to go hunt for buried treasure on the world map, is a fantastic mini game. On the other hand, you have Tetra Master, which has quite a bit of potential, but it's ultimately completely pointless AND has a card limit (you can only have 100 cards on you at any given time). It wouldn't be so bad if the behemoth that is Triple Triad didn't exist in Final Fantasy 8, but it just doesn't compare; Triple Triad opens up all kinds of avenues in FF8, but Tetra Master is just there for a small part of a ranking that doesn't mean anything. There are a few more, like catching frogs, jumping rope, the Nero brothers shuffle game, that are all interesting, and do have some affect on the game, but none as big as the Chocobo and card game side quests.\n\nFor Old Players\nThis port is damn good. The character models for the main cast were rebuilt and look brilliant. They do contrast with the backgrounds, as those are the same as the original version, but they didn't bother me. All of the other changes were basically streamlining; card icons appear over every NPC that you can play in cards, the menus look very nice (especially the main menu before actually getting into the game), several boosters were added (max level, do max damage, no encounters I believe were a few), which means scrubs like me finally have a shot at claiming the Excalibur II!\n\nWord to the wise, don't use the "Continue" option from the main menu. The auto save function is from the beginning of an area, so if you saved at a moogle, there is a possibility that you will have to redo a good chunk of content using the continue instead of loading your moogle save.\n\nOverall\nFinal Fantasy IX is quickly taking a top 2 spot in my list of favorite Final Fantasy games of all time. The cast of playable characters, along with Cid, Brahne, Kuja, Garland, and several others, is just utterly fantastic. I give the game a solid 9/10 for being such a great over experience, only being held back by a frustrating progression system as well as finicky combat system.","May 13","true","26.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I was hoping that SE would of included HD versions of the game backround scenes as they made HD versions when the game was developed then they downscaled them so the PS1 could run the game, it was a bit of downer that they didnt include them. The NPC's are sharpened up to the same standard as the other remastered FF games. The cutscenes have been tidied up and there are the cheats (if ya want to use them) as seen in the other FF games.\n\nAlot of the Negative reviews are due to a 'Xbox controller' bug but i have not come across this so far or because they where expecting the graphics to be better and it being scaled to 16:9 Aspect Ratio, well i dont really know what those people where expecting. It's a PS1 game that is 15ish years old so dont get your hopes up if ya thinking this is a full on redo of the game cus its not xD.\n\nAfter installing the gameplay was jittery but a quick PC reboot sorted that issue.\n\nPro:\n- The best FF game ever made has now come to PC\n- sharpened NPC's (no more blurry characters) happy days \o/\n- 100's of hours of great gameplay and story from a time where RPG's where in their prime.\n\nCons:\n- No HD backround scenes in the game (though not surpised)\n- Cutscene's locked at 15fps/ Gameplay locked at 30fps\n- Maybe a bug or two\n- Looks like its a port from the mobile version of the game\n\nFinal Words:\nNot much to say really, it is what it is. People who have played the remastered versions of FF 7/8 will know what to expect. Its a shame that they didnt include HD versions of the backround scenes as they where made when the game was develped, SE have had 15 years to implement into the PC version of the game, however, that is prob my only gripe.\nDont expect a full-on redo because you will be left with a bitter taste in ya mouth. All you should expect from this game is a vanilla game with sharpened NPC's a few pointless cheats, cloud game saves & steam trophies.\n\nWith all that in mind i am very happy with my purchase, i get to play prob the best FF (yet under-rated) game ever made on pc. Veteran's of the game will be happy with just having the game on PC and for those who have not played the game then give it a go. Its a very relaxed gameplay style with some of the best storytelling that has ever been created for the gaming industry.\n\nHope this review was helpful, thumbs up/down if ya liked/disagreed with my evaluation. Enjoy & Good luck","April 15","true","75.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

If you have never played 9 it is deffenitly worth the price, sale or not. Although I am a bit biased, the HD remake has been done very well. Plus if you have already played through the game play it again with some of the boosters or the cheats!\n\nThe speed booster added onto auto battle makes grinding (if you need extra money or AP) so much easier. No encounter booster for stopping the battles during a part of the game where you just want some quiet. Or even use it to make the game harder and only do boss fights. Some cheats and boosters can be op, but its a single player game. Play it how you want.\n\nI'd recomend controller for the game, not usually a fan of keyboard with turn based RPGs. The feel of the game is still here and can be loved by newer players to this game!\n\nThe only con I have had is while making presses at the top of the menu, pressing up doesn't wrap around to the bottom and vice versa. Also once in a while it feels like I have to press a key/button again when I load screens, although rare for me it does happen.","April 15","true","37.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Fourteen years ago I was a sixteen year old boy with teenage angst dripping out my ears, parents in the middle of a very messy divorce, and a high school life that was like Saved by the Bell combined with the nastier bits of the Dante's Inferno video game. During this time my only solace was video games and, for Christmas in 2001 I recieved two things: a Playstation 1 system and my first game for it, Final Fantasy IX. This was the start of a large library of JRPG games including Xenogears, Lunar: Silver Star Story Complete, Wild ARMs 2nd Ignition, and more.\n\nSeeing this game appear on Steam for me is like running into an old dear friend that you haven't seen in a very long time.

Its neat to actually be able to see non-pixelated details on their faces and bodies compared to the 1999 version.\n- The game controls well and I've only had one issue so far in the Ice Cavern (one of the contextual spots where Vivi uses his magic to melt a path to a treasure chest refused to respond. I already had a Mage Masher so it's not a HUGE deal, but irritating nonetheless).\n- The music is every bit as good as I remember it, I had to pause for a moment the first time I got to the overworld just to sit and listen to that song for a while. I've heard some people complain that the music sounds 'tinny' and 'not as good as the original' and, honestly, I wonder if they're just not remembering it right.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/twoheadedenby/recommended/377840/","twoheadedenby","Leg","http://steamcommunity.com/id/twoheadedenby/","532 products in account","THIS RECOMMENDATION COMES WITH MAJOR CAVEATS\n\nThe short version: This is, in all the essentials, still Final Fantasy IX, which is my personal favourite of the entire series and one of my favourite games of all time. If you have no other way of playing the game, this PC version will do you right. HOWEVER, if you have access to a PS3/PSTV/PSP/Vita, I would recommend going for the PSN version of the game (a direct emulation of the PS1 original)  instead. It has its own problems but it is my significantly preferred way of playing the game.\n\nThe Port: As with nearly all of the Final Fantasy games on steam, this is a port of the smartphone version of the game. The interface and 3D models were redone for that version, and the results are hit and miss. I find the interface pretty unpleasant to operate on a mouse and keyboard, and when playing with an X360 controller I found its processing of analogue control input frustratingly imprecise, prone to overshooting where I wanted to go or veering off in unwanted directions. The new models look quite good, but they clash horribly with the original pre-rendered backgrounds, which are still at their PS1 resolutions. The PSN version of the game has much jaggier lower-res models, but everything looks uniform which is easier on the eyes imo. Additionally, the framerate in battles is abysmal, rendering every battle animation as a jerky sequence of still images and making the already cumbersome interface even moreso with the addition of input lag. The PC version also does not support borderless windowed play but I got it working without grief using a third-party program. The resolution is fixed to a non-widescreen aspect ratio, again because of the limitations of the pre-rendered PS1 backgrounds.\n\n(In case you're wondering: while the PC versions of the other PS1 titles, VII and VIII, contain awful MIDI versions of their respective soundtracks that need to be fixed with mods, this version of IX contains what appears to be the original PS1 soundtrack.)\n\nThe Game: As a result of coming out in the waning years of the first Playstation and only a short while before the release of Final Fantasy X on PS2, as well as sporting a whimsical high fantasy tone and aesthetic after the franchise had shifted into a darker, angstier, fantasy/sci-fi baseline, Final Fantasy IX is often remembered as a series black sheep, where it's remembered at all. It's a shame, because the relative freedom and low-stakes development environment the game enjoyed resulted in one of the most wholly successful expressions of the FF formula Square Enix has ever produced. Think of it as a last hurrah of the (admittedly antiquated) overworld/random encounters/ATB system format that all of the games had enjoyed to that point before Square started retiring or overhauling those things in a drastic way.\n\nWith nothing left to prove on that front, the team was able to focus fully on character, art, writing and soundtrack (not to mention the bevy of minigames, sidequests, hidden content, and a fully-featured card game) and treat those things with a level of creativity and polish that neither of the other PS1 FF titles could match. If you like your JRPGs dark and angsty you might walk away disappointed, but for my money this is the most successful work of worldbuilding and character creation Square has ever accomplished in this franchise, and after ten years and three playthroughs the game is still an utter delight.","April 14","true","11.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

If you haven't played the game before, then mostly everything is left untouched (story, game mechanics, etc) and you should read a review elsewhere for how the game is in regards to that. I'm going to talk about the port itself and what changes it brought to the table.\n\n\nOff the bat, the character models had their textures bumped up to higher quality. No longer are faces blurred out because now you can see them with great clarity. Even NPCs had their textures bumped up too! However, the backgrounds are still in their old Playstation low resolution versions and rumors state that the developers lost the assets for the backgrounds. It's very distracting and clashes heavily with the new high res character models. While it doesn't bother me too much, it may be a deal breaker for others. The FMVs also had a bump up in quality and are not fuzzy or blurry anymore, which is another nice touch.\n\n\nThe port also has several game boosters that you can turn on and off at will, such as making the game go faster in turbo speed, always do max damage, disable random encounters, and always have full ATB and Trance bars. The other boosters such as max level and magic stones, instant learn abilities, and max gil can't be disabled once turned on. The boosters are nice to have if you want to screw around or just want to get to certain parts of the game with little hassle and you can easily enjoy the game without them. However, it is quite easy to accidentally turn a booster on by mistake if you're aren't careful.\n\n\nThere are a few bugs, but they're mostly minor. There's the infamous "character moves to the right" bug when it comes to using controllers, but so far I have managed to get around it by only enabling the controller after the game has loaded. In certain battles or battle screens, the dynamic camera can get screwed up such as zooming in too closely on a character or the camera focusing on the wrong character when an enemy readies an ability. While distracting, they're just minor annoyances.\n\n\nOverall, the port is pretty solid and the extra features are a welcomed addition. Minor bugs are present, but nothing too deal breaking.","April 16","true","31.7"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

The backgrounds are ugly, but I didn't really expect them to re-do all of them for a port of a sixteen year old game.  The characters themselves look fine, and the cut-scenes look great.  I've had no issues with controller support (using the PC version of the 360 controller), and I like that you can edit buttons, as the game originally has B as confirm and A as back, which is stupid.  Was able to easily swap them and then no issues.\n\nThere are built in cheats for anyone who is interested in that sort of thing, along with more useful legit abilities like speeding up combat and turning off the over-long pre-fight cut-scenes (which I believe were there to mask loading on the PSX but are obviously no longer necessary).  Removing those scenes alone probably cuts your overall game time by a couple of hours, especially if you're playing legitimate and thus are likely grinding a lot.\n\nThe card game still sucks and is totally pointless.\n\nAnyway, Final Fantasy IX received a solid port.  It's not amazing, but it's perfectly acceptable.  I'd say the game is a little overpriced at $21.99 (I paid $16.79, but the price will go back up soon).  It should have released at no more than $15.00.  Still, if you're a fan of the original game or want to play the best and last great game in the series, or just one of the better JRPGs ever released (by the way, why can't we get Chrono Trigger on Steam?), this would be a good choice.","April 16","true","52.2"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","4"

The character models and cutscenes are much more polished looking in this version, and the autosave/faster load times make this the best version I've played of this game.\n\nThe only things that bother me with this version that I've seen so far, are that the game caps at 30fps, and there is a bar on each side of the screen (at least at the resolution I have it set at for my monitor). However, I'm hoping that these issues will get fixed with mods. Overall, I'd definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes the old Final Fantasy games and never got around to playing this one, OR if you just want to play the game again and relive your childhood.\n\n9.5/10","April 19","true","45.5"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

It would be a sin if I didn't review this.\n\nFinal Fantasy IX isn't only my favourite game from the series - it's my favourite game of all time. It's the first Final Fantasy I played, and it's the one I could return to every single year until I expire. I played this continuously when it was first released back on the Playstation.\n\nAs a huge time fan/writer of medieval fantasy, this game really does have it all for me. The plot is, for the most part, a gripping tale of intrigue, romance and adventure. The (main) villain is one of the most charismatic of all, despite their very questionable fashion sense. The character development is second-to-none, easily the best from the series (Zidane and Vivi, especially.) It also features my favourite female protagonist from the entire series.\n\nThe setting is wonderful. No two places look the same, and the environments are all unique and memorable (though in the case of one particular dungeon, you're likely to remember it for all the wrong reasons...)\n\nThe music. My God, the music. This soundtrack is a masterpiece and the work of a true legend of composing, Nobuo Uematsu. I want to be Uematsu. Seriously. Character themes, environment themes, battle themes and that beautiful, beautiful world map theme - there's not a single track that I don't like.\n\nThe sidequests are fantastic (a couple are a little irritating, like one involving a skipping rope, but all entirely optional.) The Chocobo one is easily unbeaten and rewards you very, very well for your time. I also think I'm the only person on Earth who actually enjoyed the card game.\n\nI could honestly write more - so, so much more - about why I love this game. But I would be here all day. Let's just say that I enjoyed the original release so much that I actually got the Excalibur II in a repeat playthrough because I wanted to see EVERYTHING that this game had. Buy it. Just...buy the damn game. Please.\n\n","April 17","true","35.7"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","9","17","0","2"

First of all, let me say that Square did a GOOD job porting one of their PSX titles this time. Character Models look great, Menus look sharp and beautiful, and the added some shaders and stuff to make the pre-rendered backgrounds look better than the original. That being said, after waiting all these months for the PC release, I was kind of hoping they would find a way to add the original HD pre-rendered backgrounds that would've made the contrast between the hi-res models and the backgrounds less obvious. Also, I hate the fact that this is a port of the Android/IOS version, and that they didn't take the time to rework some parts for PC. I mean, who needs the battle menus to take half the screen on PC? Why 6 options instead of 4? Can't we use a BUTTON to defend/change?\nAnyway, would of course recommend to everyone, as this is the best game ever released :P and the port is actually good!","April 14","true","91.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Kupooo! Kupo kupo. Kupo kupo, kupo kupo. Kupo? Kupo, kupo kupo. Kupo, kupo? KUPO!!! Kupo. Kupo kupo. Kupoooo. Kupo? Kupo kupo, kupo. Kupo kupo. Kupo. You guys are annoying you know that, kupo? Go suck on a kupo nut, you kupo!\n\n“TLDR: Keep calm, buy the game, smoke a bong full of fruit loops, all good in the hood.”\n\nGood ol’ Kupo. First off I would like to talk about some of my past experience with video games, and mention that this review will be based on the PS1/Vita versions. I won’t get into detail about the new features they have added for steam, and I fully welcome anything where I can choose rather I want to turn it on or off for my gameplay, it simply gives me more options if I want or you want, nothing more. I simply wish to write a review for this game, because Final Fantasy 9 is my favorite game hands down above anything new or old. Witcher 3, Dragon Age 3, Grandia 3, Mass Effect 3, Final Fantasy 3, Persona 3, Disgaea 3, Xenosaga 3, Half Life….anyways. I want this to be known before reading my review so you may take it how you like, but I have my reasons for feeling this way.  I love video games in general FPS, puzzlers, RTS, dating Sims just recently started enjoying 4X games again. Though my top genre played is RPG’s this includes MMO’s.\n\nFinal Fantasy 9 was the first story that made me go wow after completing it, it made me think about the story I was just a part of. The only story that I wish I could completely forgot, just so I can re-experience it for the first time. It showed me what video games could truly offer when it came to completing a game, and falling in love with the story and characters involved (Freya/Beatrix) two characters I did not expect such a strong story from when first playing, absolutely beautiful. I remember the first time I forgot I loved this game so much. It just got released on the Vita, and I immediately had good memories, nothing bad.\n\nIt was then I realized this was my favorite game, it was maybe my second to third time playing it then. I had a hazy memory of the game that I remember very fondly, next to other amazing games like FF7/8, Chrono Trigger, and Legend of Dragoon, but I just couldn’t fully remember FF9 for some reason, too many blanks. It wasn’t until I started playing it again that I remember how much I loved the game. It was a game that got lost to me, and when I finally got the chance to play it again on the Vita, it reminded me how great some games are to play. No super crazy boss fights that were mandatory, nothing in the story that I thought was just bad, was one of the few games where I would want to listen to the entire soundtrack. I like the composers for Final Fantasy and Legend of Zelda and some more recent games, but I was never a big sounds person. I never got entranced by the music or sound effects of a game, I was a playlist type of gamer. This was a game where the music I wanted to listen to was the game. Everything felt just right when entering a new area or during certain conversations.\n\nThe characters personalities never felt too forced nor did I feel anything to cliché, everything just felt natural with the settings these individuals have been put in. Another thing I really loved about the game was traveling, before you could do it freely. It feels like a huge chase scene for a while running off from danger, splitting up, beautiful locations. It felt like a very fun and exciting journey, it wasn’t so much danger as just following want you wanted to do and the consequences of your choices. Everything this game has to offer is great. They have your Chocobo mini games hot-cold you either love it or hate it, I always found it entertaining, but Final Fantasy 7 racing was the best. Black jack, jump rope, racing a fat hippo kid, treasure hunting, a card game called Tetra Master I enjoy the Final Fantasy card mini games, and small one time arena fights on certain disks, quizmaster, friendly monsters, special bosses, items, and events, loved the ATE’s best thing ever when entering a new area, being allowed to see what your friends are doing elsewhere.\n\nThe battle system is what you would expect from Final Fantasy of this era turn-based active/wait, experience and monsters level are pre-set like FF7. One unique thing that I love is the trance system just because it looks so cool when transforming and truly makes you feel like your power level is over 9000!!!!! This game brings me happiness and light even in the darkest of times. This game might not have all the things I have grown to love about new video games, but it showed me first what a video game had to offer me. The feelings I got from playing Final Fantasy 9, is the feeling I hold all games up to. Not the comparison of stories, graphics, features, but how did I feel as I played the game, was the ending well thought and satisfying to the story, did it leave me thinking about what I just played as if I had just lived through the actions I made. I won’t deny many games have gave me strong feelings of both love and hate but none as strong as, Kupo.\n\nEdit: Moved TL:DR to top, and the game looks, feels and plays absolutely beautiful.","April 14","true","15.7"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","4","8","3","0"

Everyone speaks about that one game that defined them, or their childhood. This is THAT game for me. Everyone who has played this game sings the same tune: you can't beat FFIX. It's so charming and the story is so intriguing. The charcters are relatable and engaging, and you'll find yourself engrossed in the whole FFIX world from the off.\n\nAs a port - I can't fault it. It runs smoothly and flawlessly. I was curious as to why the game needed the Android SDK before release. I can now see that it's so you can click the mouse on the screen to make your charcter move in that direction - smart. I imagine this adds touchscreen functionality too, but can't confirm due to my lack of touchscreen.\nThe original soundtrack is in this game which is a big plus for me personally: this soundtrack was easily Uematsu's finest work.\n\nThe upscaled and retextured character models look great, and the new battle/text interface looks really nice as well. The cutscenes have also clearly been remastered but not so much to the extent of the models.\n\nHowever, having played the original PS1 game, and then again (several tens of times) on an emulator - I would not say this is the definitive version. Though the new charcter models look nice - the pre-rendered backgrounds have not been changed, and the two graphics fidelities do clash sometimes. Not only that, but some sounds effects that weren't there in the original game have been added (one in a cutscene, which I won't spoil but it does kind of ruin the mood a bit).\n\nThat said, these are only very minor issues which for me only detract from the game slightly. I am throughly looking forward to playing this one through again, and strongly recommend it for those who have not yet played it.","April 14","true","7.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's nostalgic to play the game again. Okay, to business.\n\nFirst of all, look at my playtime on steam (negligable at the moment) and multiply it by a thousand and you MIGHT have my total played hours. Back in the day when the game originally came out, I must have played, and replayed it at LEAST a dozen times. Each time having several hundred hours. Over the years I played the game again but with more time in between but still, I can play it through blindly and usually without dying too much. I know which levels I should have (roughly) but nevertheless I know everything there is to know about the game.\n\nI'm not going to bother to go over the graphics. The game is from the year two thousand so its well over a decade old. You can't expect the game to look pretty compared to modern games.\n\nmusic / sound\nThe music is awesome. The songs and music of final fantasy nine are perfect and don't get on your nerves too quickly. Of course, if you let the game on loop then it might be a bit much....\n\nPlot\nWhen I played the game for the very first time, it was a gift for my tenth birthday. (I think) The thing is, I picked it because it had four cd's. But I absolutely NEVER regretted buying... well okay having the game bought for me (details) But seriously, I never regret getting the game or playing it. And again. And again.\n\nBack then, I didn't have accesss to the internet, but I did have access to a walkthrough which did help me a lot. It told me how much hp enemies had and I must have died hundreds of times. I remember that I pulled the plug (after making sure I wouldn't lose too much progress) in frustration at least a dozen times.\n\nSo the question remains... Should you buy the game? Well it depends. For me, I bought it as soon as I realized it was available. I didn't hesitate for a second.Why? Because I know what I'm getting. I bought the game because I wanted to play it on pc. That was one reason. But I also wanted it because it's one of my favorite games of all times and well.. I can afford it so why not?\n\nYou, the  prospect buyer should probably watch a few let's plays or a review (when it comes) before deciding if you should purchase or not. The game looks a bit prettier, and the models are updated, but I don't think anything was changed mechanic wise. Of course there are a few cheat options but you should only use that after finishing the game at least once.\n\nShould you buy?\n\nYES! Definetly but only after making sure you know what you're getting.\n\nKingdark","April 14","true","5.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

So far, they're the only real things i've noticed that make it look like an IOS port. Nothing like the VI port with intruding buttons you could press. As for the rest of the game, they've polished it up well. The character models look beautiful, the remastered cutscenes look amazing, and all the slowdowns that were in the original, up to the point of the game i am currently at, have been completely fixed. I have to say, in a year where SE seem to be releasing a game that will kill what was a great franchise, they managed to bring one of the best enteries back from nothing, and give it rousing return at that. If you've never played Final Fantasy IX, go for it, this is an amazing version of one of the greatest Final Fantasy games there is.","April 17","true","58.5"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

If you're from Europe, this is the easiest way to play the game at the correct speed. No performance issues for me. You can turn off the encounter start animation, reducing the time the fights take by quite a bit. You can also skip FMV cutscenes (you still can't do this in FFX on PS4). Other notable changes include being able to continue where you died instead of having to load your previous save.\n\nConsidering all this (even if you dislike being able to continue from where you left off), I'd say this is the definitive version of Final Fantasy IX. Eventually there will be mods to help with the low-resolution backgrounds which is my only gripe with this release. Even a simple post processing method would be enough to remedy this.

The graphics look fantastic, it plays smooth, the horrible 'wobbly' textures and warping of models as seen in the PSX version is gone, gone gone. Attention to detail has actually been undertaken to make this game a rare gem for me to play.\n\nThe Good-\nIt's got cheats, or 'boosters' yes they will come in handy but I've always been a fan of the grinding, so I won't be using these but I can see other players might like to use them.\n\nThe Bad-\nController support is woefully inadiquite. The Xinput plugin for unity used is way, way out of date and lackluster. The Backgrounds, although I know myself they have been replaced with higher resolution versions than the PSX, they stand out really bad on higher resolutions.\n\nThe plain ugly-\nWhere do I start? First of all an older version of unity has been used making the game prone to game-stopping bugs (which I will report below). There's zero graphic customization, there's a horrible aspect ratio fix and ugly grey bars, forcing me to create my own mod just so I can enjoy the game, you know, so it stretches to my screen. Heck a PSX emulator can do better. But don't fear, my mod for this is up on the guides section in the community.\nAlthough it has been claimed that the movies are 'HD' the one at the start (where vivi walks around and the alexandria text comes in) is plain awful. Pixellated, blotchy, low res rubbish. At least use a slight blur and a sharpen Square to get rid of this. And why the heck are the movies been renamed to .btyte when they are clearly theora? Why make it so hard for the modder community to improve a classic game further?\n\nAnd the big one. The game, for some, doesnt work. Period. Getting into the first battle is impossible for some and the music plays, but your world will go black. And here's why.\n\nI was able to reproduce the issue people have been having, it seems it's related to a really dogdy plugin that square enix made for this game, called FF9SpecialEffectPlugin.dll, it's in the Plugins folder. A look in a hex editor at it mentions bones, SFX and framebuffer effects. Deleting this plugin results in what people have described, cant get into the first fight, the music plays but the screen is black. This is definately what is causing the problem. Square if you are reading this fix your buggy plugin or should I do it for you?!!!\n\nAll in all, I do recommend this game as it is *almost* a vast improvement on the PSX version. However, Square, you need to fix all these bugs, upgrade your unity version, allow people to mod your game more easily (this is 2016, not 1996 anymore) and stop treating your PC fans like idiots.\n\nBuy for the price and the possibility of this getting fixed but steer clear if you want to play now.","April 14","true","63.1"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

I fell in love with when it first came out on the original playstation back in 2000. I still have my ps1 copy and play it often actually.\n\nFinal Fantasy IX is what Final Fantasy should be. In my opinion it is the perfect Final Fantasy, it mixed great story with deep characters that keeps you interested and wanting to play more.\n\nThe card game is really fun and like msot card games in real life can get kind of annoying when you keep losing.

Go suck on a kupo nut, you kupo!\n\n“TLDR: Keep calm, buy the game, smoke a bong full of fruit loops, all good in the hood.”\n\nGood ol’ Kupo. First off I would like to talk about some of my past experience with video games, and mention that this review will be based on the PS1/Vita versions. I won’t get into detail about the new features they have added for steam, and I fully welcome anything where I can choose rather I want to turn it on or off for my gameplay, it simply gives me more options if I want or you want, nothing more. I simply wish to write a review for this game, because Final Fantasy 9 is my favorite game hands down above anything new or old. Witcher 3, Dragon Age 3, Grandia 3, Mass Effect 3, Final Fantasy 3, Persona 3, Disgaea 3, Xenosaga 3, Half Life….anyways. I want this to be known before reading my review so you may take it how you like, but I have my reasons for feeling this way.  I love video games in general FPS, puzzlers, RTS, dating Sims just recently started enjoying 4X games again. Though my top genre played is RPG’s this includes MMO’s.\n\nFinal Fantasy 9 was the first story that made me go wow after completing it, it made me think about the story I was just a part of. The only story that I wish I could completely forgot, just so I can re-experience it for the first time. It showed me what video games could truly offer when it came to completing a game, and falling in love with the story and characters involved (Freya/Beatrix) two characters I did not expect such a strong story from when first playing, absolutely beautiful. I remember the first time I forgot I loved this game so much. It just got released on the Vita, and I immediately had good memories, nothing bad.\n\nIt was then I realized this was my favorite game, it was maybe my second to third time playing it then. I had a hazy memory of the game that I remember very fondly, next to other amazing games like FF7/8, Chrono Trigger, and Legend of Dragoon, but I just couldn’t fully remember FF9 for some reason, too many blanks. It wasn’t until I started playing it again that I remember how much I loved the game. It was a game that got lost to me, and when I finally got the chance to play it again on the Vita, it reminded me how great some games are to play. No super crazy boss fights that were mandatory, nothing in the story that I thought was just bad, was one of the few games where I would want to listen to the entire soundtrack. I like the composers for Final Fantasy and Legend of Zelda and some more recent games, but I was never a big sounds person. I never got entranced by the music or sound effects of a game, I was a playlist type of gamer. This was a game where the music I wanted to listen to was the game. Everything felt just right when entering a new area or during certain conversations.\n\nThe characters personalities never felt too forced nor did I feel anything to cliché, everything just felt natural with the settings these individuals have been put in. Another thing I really loved about the game was traveling, before you could do it freely. It feels like a huge chase scene for a while running off from danger, splitting up, beautiful locations. It felt like a very fun and exciting journey, it wasn’t so much danger as just following want you wanted to do and the consequences of your choices. Everything this game has to offer is great. They have your Chocobo mini games hot-cold you either love it or hate it, I always found it entertaining, but Final Fantasy 7 racing was the best. Black jack, jump rope, racing a fat hippo kid, treasure hunting, a card game called Tetra Master I enjoy the Final Fantasy card mini games, and small one time arena fights on certain disks, quizmaster, friendly monsters, special bosses, items, and events, loved the ATE’s best thing ever when entering a new area, being allowed to see what your friends are doing elsewhere.\n\nThe battle system is what you would expect from Final Fantasy of this era turn-based active/wait, experience and monsters level are pre-set like FF7. One unique thing that I love is the trance system just because it looks so cool when transforming and truly makes you feel like your power level is over 9000!!!!! This game brings me happiness and light even in the darkest of times. This game might not have all the things I have grown to love about new video games, but it showed me first what a video game had to offer me. The feelings I got from playing Final Fantasy 9, is the feeling I hold all games up to. Not the comparison of stories, graphics, features, but how did I feel as I played the game, was the ending well thought and satisfying to the story, did it leave me thinking about what I just played as if I had just lived through the actions I made. I won’t deny many games have gave me strong feelings of both love and hate but none as strong as, Kupo.\n\nEdit: Moved TL:DR to top, and the game looks, feels and plays absolutely beautiful.","April 14","true","15.7"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","4","8","3","0"

Everyone speaks about that one game that defined them, or their childhood. This is THAT game for me. Everyone who has played this game sings the same tune: you can't beat FFIX. It's so charming and the story is so intriguing. The charcters are relatable and engaging, and you'll find yourself engrossed in the whole FFIX world from the off.\n\nAs a port - I can't fault it. It runs smoothly and flawlessly. I was curious as to why the game needed the Android SDK before release. I can now see that it's so you can click the mouse on the screen to make your charcter move in that direction - smart. I imagine this adds touchscreen functionality too, but can't confirm due to my lack of touchscreen.\nThe original soundtrack is in this game which is a big plus for me personally: this soundtrack was easily Uematsu's finest work.\n\nThe upscaled and retextured character models look great, and the new battle/text interface looks really nice as well. The cutscenes have also clearly been remastered but not so much to the extent of the models.\n\nHowever, having played the original PS1 game, and then again (several tens of times) on an emulator - I would not say this is the definitive version. Though the new charcter models look nice - the pre-rendered backgrounds have not been changed, and the two graphics fidelities do clash sometimes. Not only that, but some sounds effects that weren't there in the original game have been added (one in a cutscene, which I won't spoil but it does kind of ruin the mood a bit).\n\nThat said, these are only very minor issues which for me only detract from the game slightly. I am throughly looking forward to playing this one through again, and strongly recommend it for those who have not yet played it.","April 14","true","7.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's nostalgic to play the game again. Okay, to business.\n\nFirst of all, look at my playtime on steam (negligable at the moment) and multiply it by a thousand and you MIGHT have my total played hours. Back in the day when the game originally came out, I must have played, and replayed it at LEAST a dozen times. Each time having several hundred hours. Over the years I played the game again but with more time in between but still, I can play it through blindly and usually without dying too much. I know which levels I should have (roughly) but nevertheless I know everything there is to know about the game.\n\nI'm not going to bother to go over the graphics. The game is from the year two thousand so its well over a decade old. You can't expect the game to look pretty compared to modern games.\n\nmusic / sound\nThe music is awesome. The songs and music of final fantasy nine are perfect and don't get on your nerves too quickly. Of course, if you let the game on loop then it might be a bit much....\n\nPlot\nWhen I played the game for the very first time, it was a gift for my tenth birthday. (I think) The thing is, I picked it because it had four cd's. But I absolutely NEVER regretted buying... well okay having the game bought for me (details) But seriously, I never regret getting the game or playing it. And again. And again.\n\nBack then, I didn't have accesss to the internet, but I did have access to a walkthrough which did help me a lot. It told me how much hp enemies had and I must have died hundreds of times. I remember that I pulled the plug (after making sure I wouldn't lose too much progress) in frustration at least a dozen times.\n\nSo the question remains... Should you buy the game? Well it depends. For me, I bought it as soon as I realized it was available. I didn't hesitate for a second.Why? Because I know what I'm getting. I bought the game because I wanted to play it on pc. That was one reason. But I also wanted it because it's one of my favorite games of all times and well.. I can afford it so why not?\n\nYou, the  prospect buyer should probably watch a few let's plays or a review (when it comes) before deciding if you should purchase or not. The game looks a bit prettier, and the models are updated, but I don't think anything was changed mechanic wise. Of course there are a few cheat options but you should only use that after finishing the game at least once.\n\nShould you buy?\n\nYES!

The graphics look fantastic, it plays smooth, the horrible 'wobbly' textures and warping of models as seen in the PSX version is gone, gone gone. Attention to detail has actually been undertaken to make this game a rare gem for me to play.\n\nThe Good-\nIt's got cheats, or 'boosters' yes they will come in handy but I've always been a fan of the grinding, so I won't be using these but I can see other players might like to use them.\n\nThe Bad-\nController support is woefully inadiquite. The Xinput plugin for unity used is way, way out of date and lackluster. The Backgrounds, although I know myself they have been replaced with higher resolution versions than the PSX, they stand out really bad on higher resolutions.\n\nThe plain ugly-\nWhere do I start? First of all an older version of unity has been used making the game prone to game-stopping bugs (which I will report below). There's zero graphic customization, there's a horrible aspect ratio fix and ugly grey bars, forcing me to create my own mod just so I can enjoy the game, you know, so it stretches to my screen. Heck a PSX emulator can do better. But don't fear, my mod for this is up on the guides section in the community.\nAlthough it has been claimed that the movies are 'HD' the one at the start (where vivi walks around and the alexandria text comes in) is plain awful. Pixellated, blotchy, low res rubbish. At least use a slight blur and a sharpen Square to get rid of this. And why the heck are the movies been renamed to .btyte when they are clearly theora? Why make it so hard for the modder community to improve a classic game further?\n\nAnd the big one. The game, for some, doesnt work. Period. Getting into the first battle is impossible for some and the music plays, but your world will go black. And here's why.\n\nI was able to reproduce the issue people have been having, it seems it's related to a really dogdy plugin that square enix made for this game, called FF9SpecialEffectPlugin.dll, it's in the Plugins folder. A look in a hex editor at it mentions bones, SFX and framebuffer effects. Deleting this plugin results in what people have described, cant get into the first fight, the music plays but the screen is black. This is definately what is causing the problem. Square if you are reading this fix your buggy plugin or should I do it for you?!!!\n\nAll in all, I do recommend this game as it is *almost* a vast improvement on the PSX version. However, Square, you need to fix all these bugs, upgrade your unity version, allow people to mod your game more easily (this is 2016, not 1996 anymore) and stop treating your PC fans like idiots.\n\nBuy for the price and the possibility of this getting fixed but steer clear if you want to play now.","April 14","true","63.1"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

At least we have it.\n\nStraight up, this is what is going on.\n\n1. This is a mobile adaption, no widescreen, you get the same borders you get with mobile. OK.\n2. Right off the bat, the controller scheme was messed with. What made FFIX unique was in that it used X as select and O as cancel by default, or A and B if using Xbox controller. I feel the developer totally was clueless about this.\n3. Dialogue changes: So far, the little girl with the cutsey soft vowels who bumps into Vivi now speaks perfect english.\n4. Floating cup inside the tavern.\n5. Battle is now clunky, they seem to think we wanted to keep "Change" and "Escape" and "Defend" in the menu, so now it's extra wide. OK. Will get used to it.\n6. Steal rate seems to be improved, tried several times after the mage masher and always got it within the first few tries.\n7. Everyone who can play cards has the card icon over their heads when you approach them. OK.. I guess I'll survive it.\n\nSo far that's it for now.

I even went as far as to install it on an sd card for my PSP. So understand when I say that i love FF9, that I really do, despite this review. Sadly, despite the improvements to image quality, this is a far from being a perfect port.\n\nPros:\n\n1. Music from the original game is retained and NOT replaced with crappy midi, so enjoy the original score.\n\n2. Background Image clarity is good compared to what it is on PS3. I've had to play it on a PSP (very small screen) to get close to a sharp image.\n\n3. Character sprites look clear and sharp.\n\n4. This is FF9, one of my most favorite FF's.\n\nCons:\n\n1. Despite support for 1920x1080, the actual game screen does not stretch to fit monitor, leaving a 2 inch dark gap on both the left and the right side of the screen. This is not a good thing (at least playing it on PS3/PSP i can stretch that image to fit). Check the images above on the store page and you will see the border I am referring to.\n\n2. Terrible Font used in the game's text. The orignal game used a very unique looking font (check out peeps Youtube playthroughs of original and see for yourself), the style of which, fit the game wonderfully. Despite the clarity and sharpness of the text, this port's Font looks like it got ripped from RPG Maker ACE or something.\n\n3. The redone (and very blocky looking, at least to me) battle menu is too large and looks like it was made for ANDROID, as a result, it fills more of the scrren than it had originally filled on the PS1/PSP/PS3.  The combination of this and the replaced font, just feel wrong. As a result, I find myself wishing that the game at least had UI resizing or transparency options to offset this somewhat...\n\n4. The built in game cheats (which i do not use), cannot be turned off once turned on.\n\n5. The "Quit" button is hidden in the config sub menu, rather than the main part of the menu. Seriously, it is actually hidden at the bottom of the Config sub menu so that you actually have to scroll down and find it. Just sad...\n\n6.  Other than resolution and the choice to play in"windowed"mode, the game "options" are not accessable until you are "in-game", no options menu appears on the start up.\n\n7. Backgrounds still not as clear as they should be for PC.\n\nFor Android this is fine I guess, but for a PC version, It just feels "half-@$$ed" to me.\n\nWill I be playing FF9? You bet I will...on the PSP","April 19","false","0.4"," 32 of 65 people (49%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","49","32","65","5","1"

Some of the content will reflect that.\n\nThe game itself is a great game. I've played it a lot over the years on the PS1. It was my first Final Fantasy and it's also one of my favorites in the series. The music is beyond amazing, and even the tracks that isn't amazing is still great. For it's time, the game looked amazing. That obviously doesn't hold up to today's standards, but if you can keep an open mind and remember that this game is old, then it probably won't be much of an issue. The game ration is 4:3, gameplay is locked at 30 FPS and cutscenes runs in 15FPS. (They look smooth, though!) Gameplay-wise it's pretty much the same as older Final Fantasy games, and it plays nicely. (Do yourself a favor and turn the ATB speed to max.)\n\nThere's only two issues I truely have with this game. The first one is most important, and that is the wonky controller support. I can't use my controllers for this game, because if I do, I'll walk to either the left or the right without pressing any buttons. The other thing I can complain about is the lack of audio settings. The music in the game is fantastic, but it's a bit loud. The only settings you have for audio is music / no music and sound effects / no sound effects. You can't adjust the volume itself at all.\n\nOverall, the game itself, as it's original release way back on the PS1, I'd rate it 10/10.\nThis port, however, I would rate a 7/10. There's a few things missing and the controller issue is a really big deal. Despite this, I will recommend this game.","April 16","true","38.7"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

What's important is the actual port/HD conversion. And to that end, it's a little bit of a mixed bag that ultimately leaves me a little disappointed. The general HD-ification seems pretty good to me, with sharp redone UI that still retains the look and feel of the original PS1 version for the most part. Font is nice (unlike the other mobile-to-PC ports) and everything works well enough with a controller. Character models seem to have gotten a decent bump in polycount and their original textures have either been redone to a degree or at least filter decently. The static backgrounds have also been filtered a little, and look about as good as can be expected. FMVs run at the original 15fps, and the rest of the game is locked at 30fps. All this being said, I have two gripes, and I guess they are both superficial.\n\nFirst, the battle HUD, particularly the basic party member info that is always displayed, is FAR FAR too large. It's apparent this was ported directly from the mobile version (despite taking over 2 more months to come to PC after both version were announced simultaneously), with no thought given to, say, scaling the HUD down to better suit the larger screens the game would be played on. Second, I'm shocked that there's no option to disable the static grey/textured sidebars that border the game on either side (or top/bottom, depending on your resolution) at all times. A simple toggle in the launcher is all they had to add to just allow for clean black pillarboxing, as an alternative to the currently forced images.\n\nAll in all, the total package seems like a pretty decent one, but it just seems very little additional effort was put into this particular version to set it aside from the mobile port released earlier. As with III, IV, V, and VI before it, IX seems like all the effort went into the mobile version and they just swiftly (or not so swiftly in this case) slapped it onto PC as well, without any thought given to the differences between the platforms. That being said, this is by far the best HD conversion/remaster they've done out of all the mobile-to-PC ports, as well as the other two PS1 titles ported to PC (VII and VIII). Everything's sharp and cleaned up nicely, yet shockingly faithful to the original, all around.\n\nAs of right now, if you can get past the two complaints I mentioned, I think you'll like what this lite remaster has to offer. With a few simple tweaks, this could be unquestionably the definitive version of the game. As of right now, I'd say go for it, but don't expect it to be perfect.","April 14","true","6.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

The game runs well and there are options to change the resolution. Of course its a port of a psone game so don't expect the backgrounds to change.

The Ratio gets a little getting use to. I had an issue with my controller double clicking, however the fix was start the game with keyboard only until it talked about the controls and you could change it in the obtions and all worked fine. The game looks way better than before, and the boosters are an added bonus for those that don't want to grind all day. The jump rope still pisses me off, the models are crisp and clean. This is my favorite FF out of 7-14, and I remember why now. it is worth the price at admistion and worth another look at the world and characters I loved so much.

Not only was it my first Final Fantasy (which raised the bar pretty high for all the games I played afterwards) it's my first PSX game, the first I completed and definitely the game I put the most time into back in the day. I feel this is a gem that has been sadly overlooked between the success of FF7 and the first on the PS2, FF10. However, as the last Final Fantasy on PSX it did everything right.\n\nThe story is fantastic, even revisiting this I'm left happy, sad, emotional and I'm seeing small things I missed as a child. The characters are so full of life, the way they interact with each other is really genuine. The banter between Zidane and Steiner is really funny and the sincerity with Vivi and Freya is really strong. Overall, it's one of the best storytelling games I've played and goes from a fairly light hearted premise to some pretty heavy themes.\n\nMusic is AMAZING. Nobuo Uematsu has called this game his masterpiece and he's right, the sound is so memorable and it all really fits the setting. I've had the soundtrack to this game since the first release and I always go back to it for some nostalgia.\n\nGameplay is hard to rate because it's an old FF game and they're reknowned for being a bit slow paced, however the port does improve this with some settings to speed up the battles and to turn off encounters if you want. Otherwise it's the same as before and I quite enjoy the battles. FF9 is the only PSX game with 4 characters, and this makes the battles much better in my opinion. The Trance system is still annoying because you can't control when it pops, so losing at the end of the battle means you can't save it for an important fight, but oh well. The equipment and ability system is really nice though, it actually gives you a good reason to keep your old items becuase you learn your abilities and passives this way. It's very simple and works really well.\n\nThe only thing I can find wrong with the Steam version is that the pre-rendered backgrounds are blurry as ♥♥♥♥. However this is nothing new for FF ports, there's not much that can be done because they're pre-rendered and animated 16 years ago and it's a tall order to re-make them. FMV cutscenes are the same ones and their framerate is a measly 15 fps, which is a bit jarring in this day and age, but again not much can be done. It's an old game, you'll have to take it in your stride.\n\nI'm so happy this game is released and I thoroughly recommend.

Nobou Uematsu is a legend.\n+Characters and their deep involvement in the story is beyond this world.\n+85 Achievements ! Pretty fantastic i'd say (Also steam trading cards).\n+Mods that will make this port good.\n+Loading time is better.\n+Few of the boosters are good like battle speed and the No Encounter for lv1 playthrough.\n+Open world with vehicles, huge amount of exploration !\n+Heavy amount of side-quests and mini games that are incredibly fun.\n\n-Cant press quit unless you go to the config menu ??\n-Too many boosters and cheats, some might consider those pluses but exploiting the game and making an already easy game to be super easy and one hit everything and making the game's only challenge to be Ex2 and Rope Jumping is super weird to me\n-Game still has the same glitches from the PSX verson (Thunder Slash etc)\n-Character models are way too flashy and dont fit into the environment.\n-Audio is pretty bad,especially when playing the card game, it's ringing in my ears !\n-Analog controller doesnt work for alot of people, i simply run sporadically to the left and right, so until a good mod/patch comes that works for everyone, im forced to use the D-Pad.\n-The same pop-up that comes when looking for items and something interesting pops up when meeting people, which is annoying because im trying to find items D:\n-When remastering the game like this, i would expect some changes like were done with FFIV and VI: New bosses,dungeons, just something more to do !!\nThe only challenging enemies in this game are the Yu's..\n-Bars that need mod to delete, eventually just makes the screen stretch, leaving the PS emulator version of IX to be wanted.\n\n\nSo to sum up, FFIX is a fantastic game, especially on the PSX and with PS emulators to enhance the graphics with the best mods available.\nThis port feels very lazy but its FFIX on PC for crying out loud.\nBy far one of the best jrpg's ever made, and rpg's in general.","April 17","true","3.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

So, the sound is pretty much as good as the original thus far.\n- Continue option for busy on the go gamers or for those who must unexpectly stop playing is a huge bonus.\n- Game boosters. I say this is positive because it is optional. I don't use them, but again, who gives a ♥♥♥♥ since they are optional. Its the same as when they added fast travel in Oblivion. ITS OPTIONAL, quit your ♥♥♥♥♥in'. And maybe at some point I will use them just to enjoy the storyline. Again, the continue option and this make those who are busy have a much easier time to enjoy the game.\n- GENERAL BEATRIX <333    mmmmmmmmm..........\n- Indicator that tells you who is willing to play cards. Especially great for new players, so you dont need to waste time and ask everyone.\n\nNeutral\n- The graphics updates are nice in general, but I also am perfectly fine with all the old graphics too.\n- Bars on the side of the screens. Not horrible, but also not right.\n\nCons-\n- That said, the graphical updates do contrast with the backgrounds which can be less appealing. I love the original look, but since they refurbished the characters for a higher quality it would have been nice to have matching backgrounds too.\n- Button mapping should be before the start of the game at the initial title screen.\n- Occasional slight pausing (not sure what that is called. Screen tearing?) during cutscenes that isn't game breaking, but does make the cutscenes look less fluid and smooth. Could be my PC or lack of V-sync option or whatever.\n- Jumproping","April 14","true","28.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

FF9 is easily my favorite game of all time. I have wanted to play it on PC for as long as I can remember. Now it is here and it is quite honestly much better than I expected! With much higher quality cutscenes, character models and portraits as well as in-game text and icons. Overall it just feels very polished and cleaned up compared to PS1 version of the game. I am constantly staring at the screen and noticing small things I did not notice before (like patterns on a iron sword or dagger). And each time I look at a CG cutscene I marvel how beautiful and sharp it has become. Knowing the amount of gorgeous cinematics this game has, I feel like I am in for a huge treat.\n\nI have played the game itself many times so I know pretty much all there is to know about this game. If you have never played it before, know that this game is easily the epitome of JRPG in a medival setting. Everything about this game is absolutely perfect, and this pc port is definitely worth it even without any of the enhanced features.","April 14","true","61.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

It should also be noted that this is my first time playing FFIX; I never got to play it on the Playstation (mine broke shortly before this game was released and I never went back to try it on my PS2 in later years, skipping right from VIII to X), so this is a rather enjoyable experience for me.  I had the misfortune of purchasing FFXIII and have regretted it ever since; this is a refreshing return to when FF games were well-written and had relatable characters. Consequently, for me, this isn't some misty-eyed remembrance of gaming from 15 years ago; this is simply a thoroughly enjoyable throwback to a different age of RPGs.\n\nThe cons are few, namely the grey letterbox format due to the original game's 4:3 ratio (I'm using a 21:9 monitor) and the odd contrast of the new, high-quality character graphics with the filtered original backgrounds.  The mouse and keyboard controls are a bit wonky, but managable (frankly, this is one of the few games where I would actually prefer a game pad).  Oh, and the Tetra Masters minigame is kind of broken (I much prefer the one from FFVIII), in that it contains an element of chance that results in some cards winning or losing when they have no rights to do so.\n\nReally, the above are the only things about this port which I consider not ideal. I have had no stability or performance issues (no, the game won't do 60 fps, so please stop whining about it being capped), though I understand that some folks have. The story is enjoyable, the characters are well-rounded, with charmingly (and believably) flawed personalities (I love to watch Steiner get so angry that he just gesticulates). The music is excellent, the cutscenes are gorgeous, and from what I've seen, the gameplay and combat is on par with the other FF game that came just before and after. On a final note, I had forgotten how nice it was to not have voiced characters.\n\nIn short, this is a welcome reminder of the golden age of Final Fantasy; not perfect, but quite satisfying. I recommend it.","April 15","true","13.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

If you've enjoyed FF3-8 on Steam, you'll likely enjoy this game, too.\n\nIt is a much slower paced game than other FF titles, and that's not the developers being lazy. The original varsion spanned 4 discs on the PS1, and had some of the best graphics the console  had to offer.... Even though this caused some framerate issues at times.\n\nThat carries over to the Steam Version, too.\n\nPros about this game:\n\n- Contoller support right out of the box. My 360 controller worked on this no problem, all inputs responded without issues or cumbersome configuration.\n- Noticably improved graphics. This isn't just a simple remake, more like a remastered version of sorts.\n- Great soundtrack\n- A story that will keep you interested throughout most of it.\n- You can conquer this game at a surprisingly low level (If you know what you're doing)\n\nCons about this game:\n\n- It's not a perfect port, notably with enemy sound effects.\n- Lindblum is the most boring place on Gaia. You will come to dread story plot-related visits to this place.\n- The options to cheat kind of break gameplay, I strongly suggest you play casually first and only turn cheats on as a last resort.","April 15","true","56.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I decided to take a leap of faith after reading some early good reviews.  Holy ♥♥♥♥, am I glad I did.  I lost my ♥♥♥♥ after starting the game for the first time, and was actually given the option of CHANGING THE RESOLUTION.  Holy balls, no more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t 2004-era resolution, now you are only as limited as your hardware.  It's almost as if Square read my negative review of FF6 and agreed with me when I said it was shameful that KOTOR 2 released an update allowing for higher rez, and this brand new game was capped at a lower rez.\n\nThings only improved once I heard the music.  They actually ported the PSX music from the original.  That's right, no lame MIDI music a la FF7 port here.  Cinematics look exactly the same, except somehow even cleaner and crisper than a PC emulator.  Now lets get this out of the way straight off the bat, because some ♥♥♥♥tards on Steam have been giving negative reviews based on this next fact.  Yes, there ARE bars down the side of the screen, so it doesn't take up the full screen.  It is a negative, yes, but unlike those perfectionist ♥♥♥♥tards, I don't believe that is enough to say the entire game is ♥♥♥♥ because of it.\n\nOverall, is this game an HD remake as believed?  Yes, a thousand times.  In my FF6 review, I argued that they should have just taken the SNES version, ported it over to the PC and not change a single thing, and it would have been perfect.  Square did that with this game, and so much more.  They took the PSX diamond of a game, and polished it to a mirror sheen.  The scenery is gorgeous, the combat feels fluid, hell, even the text of the dialogue looks crisp and more legible than ever.  It's not one single detail that elevates it, it's the thousand different details that make it so enjoyable.  Unlike FF6, I have no intention of refunding this game within the first 30 minutes of playing; I intend to play this game for a very, very long time.\n\nBravo, Square.  You CAN learn from your mistakes, you CAN be taught.  Just give the fans exactly what they want, and they will eat it up in droves.  Square did for Final Fantasy IX what Fox did for the recent Deadpool movie.  Listen to your fans, and they will buy your game.  Simple.  Now I'm telling you to buy this game, because this behaviour needs to be rewarded.","April 14","true","1.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

No, this isn't a port of the mobile version, yes it is a port of the original games, but an incredible one.\n\nThe Pros:\n-This is arguably one of the top 3 best of the series, and its finally on steam!\n-The boosters take the fun away, but its an option for speedrunners and tricky areas. With that said for legit players, the super speed option is great for level grinding!\n-Nobou Uematsu soundtrack\n-A fun, and touching story.\n\nThe Cons:\n-There really aren't any significant ones..\n-Like I said its a port of the PS1 original, so while the game is now running at 60fps, the animations aren't silky smooth because they weren't made that way in the original. Not an issue to me, but may be for some.\n-Some of the prerendered backgrounds definitely haven't aged well.\n-Some minor cosmetic changes that you'll notice if you played a ton of the originals. Example being, Vivi doesn't close his eyes anymore when he casts spells, or that sometimes when something gets close to the screen, it'll clip a bit and piece of the object disappears (see Steiners victory animation with his sword).\n-As this game had disc specific things that you needed to do or they'd be gone, it'd be nice to have a cut where a disc would have ended, like an "End of part 1" or something when you finished disc 1.\n\nSo all in all, the cons don't really mean much in terms of the overall experience. With that said, buy the game, play the game, and enjoy!","April 20","true","40.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

All of the upgrades, including a way to make the battle transitions shorter, auto saving (which is hard to understand at first), higher res models/textures, beautiful menus, etc., are welcome. Here's hoping they give 7 and 8 this kind of treatment (unity ports for mobile, back ported to Windows - very nice!).\n\nThe game is just as fantastic as I remember, and even my kids are interested in it due to it's quirky story line and characters, and fantastic (largely upgraded) graphics. Certainly the best FF for PSX, and maybe the best ever.\n\nThere are a couple of nits (one of them a bug that should be fixed) to be aware of:\n\n1. You can remap the flawed XBox controller defaults (actually, I switched it back to default so my buttons match the prompts and that feels fine - still, this is a bug), but if you do use custom mappings, the onscreen prompts will all be incorrect! A frustrating bug that should be fixed!\n\n2. There is some stuttering in various places with my older hardware (Core 2 Duo 2.6GHz, 4GB RAM, GeForce 650 GTX). I'm not sure if it's my older bus speed, or my slow hard drive (using my SSD didn't seem to help), but scrolling and screen transitions on the tiled screens is stuttery, until the textures are loaded - then it's smooth (hopefully they add a way to preload all the textures per screen at once - slightly longer load between screens would be better than stuttering).\n\nFinally, where's the Mac and Linux ports (my newer hardware doesn't run Windows)? This thing is built on Unity, it should be easy. ;-)","April 16","true","5.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

So this review may be biased.\nFirst of all, should a person who likes Final Fantasy or Role Playing Games in general buy this game? The answer is yes! As other reviews have stated this game has charm oozing from it.\nThe story, in my opinion is wonderful and heartfelt. The setting is a living fairy tale world with just enough steampunk to keep it entertaining. The characters are wonderful.\nEnough about the old stuff. What about the new? The new character models are excellent. The ability to speed up battles is also great. Turning off random encounters, while not something I would usually do, is becoming tempting because of the encounter rate in certain areas. There is a lot of good. I have especially enjoyed the sharper graphics and enhanced cutscenes. I am seeing details that I didn't know were in them, and I have played this game countless times through. This is the best version of Final Fantasy IX.\nSo...what do I wish was better? The backgrounds and some of the NPCs could have been touched up a little. I know that replacing backgrounds would have required phenomenal effort, but I know there are some high quality backgrounds floating around the internet. Perhaps a future update could gradually improve the visuals that way. Honestly, it's not a deal breaker. This is the best version of the game.\nIn closing, if you are at all a fan of the JRPG genre, this game is for you. A great story, great side quests, and a lot of depth.

No, this isn't a port of the mobile version, yes it is a port of the original games, but an incredible one.\n\nThe Pros:\n-This is arguably one of the top 3 best of the series, and its finally on steam!\n-The boosters take the fun away, but its an option for speedrunners and tricky areas. With that said for legit players, the super speed option is great for level grinding!\n-Nobou Uematsu soundtrack\n-A fun, and touching story.\n\nThe Cons:\n-There really aren't any significant ones..\n-Like I said its a port of the PS1 original, so while the game is now running at 60fps, the animations aren't silky smooth because they weren't made that way in the original. Not an issue to me, but may be for some.\n-Some of the prerendered backgrounds definitely haven't aged well.\n-Some minor cosmetic changes that you'll notice if you played a ton of the originals. Example being, Vivi doesn't close his eyes anymore when he casts spells, or that sometimes when something gets close to the screen, it'll clip a bit and piece of the object disappears (see Steiners victory animation with his sword).\n-As this game had disc specific things that you needed to do or they'd be gone, it'd be nice to have a cut where a disc would have ended, like an "End of part 1" or something when you finished disc 1.\n\nSo all in all, the cons don't really mean much in terms of the overall experience. With that said, buy the game, play the game, and enjoy!","April 20","true","40.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

Just wanted to weigh in my experiences technically.\n\nWorks fine with Xbox 360 wired controller for me. Doesn't have the annoying pre-boot screen like FF8 and FF7, meaning I can boot this up and not have to go near a keyboard. Haven't tried it on the Steam Link yet, but I'm not anticipating any issues based on the above. Controls feel fine. In-game recognises Xbox buttons (telling you to press Y, etc.).\n\nSound is same as PSX. No midi here.\n\nGraphics are along the same as FF7/8. Hi-res models, but muddy backgrounds. Occasionally jarring, but not too bad.\n\nThere have been some changes to the GUI, but aside from some resizing I'm honestly hard pressed to notice and/or care. The ones in this version work pretty well, that's all that matters to me.\n\nOnly thing I don't like is access to the game boosters from within the menu, rather than outside the game. Not end of the world, but occasionally worried I'll accidentally hit one of them (it says they're irreversible so would probably require a reload).\n\nGame is not widescreen. Original game wasn't, so it makes sense. It has some textured edges to fill the sides. Honestly would've preferred it if they'd made it black, but it's neutral enough to not be too distracting.\n\nProbably the best PSX>PC FF port I've played so far. Nice to see that lessons have been learnt.\n\nEDIT: For clarification, there is a launch screen, but unlike FF7/FF8 you can actually navigate through it with a controller. However, I did have some issues when trying to change resolutions and had to go back to my PC to actually do it. Once set up, I've been able to go through fine each time.\n\nI've spotted a few graphical issues. Nothing major, but still annoying. Steiner's victory pose in battle, if the camera focuses on him, causes him arm to vanish.\n\nOther than that, still seems to be running well. No other issues encountered.","April 15","true","5.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

By far the best Final Fantasy game in the series. I highly recommend to anyone looking to try an FF game for the first time, or relive one of the best in the series.\n\nFor the port, it has some good and bad.\n\nGood:\n- F-Keys add a bunch of functionality like multiplying speed, adding levels, no encounters, etc.\n- Graphical updates. It looks much prettier now, especially combat, characters, and tetramaster.\n- Smooth. The game wasn't very choppy back on the PS, but even less so now. Even with multiplied speed it works great.\n- Great port to Unity that functions similarly on a lot of computers. Easily modable and decompilable, at the time of this writing.\n\nCons:\n- Resolution is weird. You have to play with it quite a bit to get rid of the bars\n- Oddly slow at several points. There is literally more lag at times than on the PS (to be fair, its much faster most times)\n- Controls. The mouse tends to get stuck at the center of the screen, xb1 controller has problems being registered. This might be due to not playing well with multimonitor. To fix I often win-key out and click on the titlebar of the non-windowed app or alt-tab out and in to fix it.\n- The backgrounds are not HD. Since theyre pre-rendered, they look about the same as they did before.\n\nAll of the cons could easily be fixed, with the exception of the backgrounds. I don't expect many of these to last more than an update or two.","April 17","true","8.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You can also navigate with the mouse like in a point-and-click adventure.\n\n- graphical update is mostly good. In a few cases the low-res backgrounds are jarring, the originals have been lost apparently. Runs well on my 5 years old laptop, but no widescreen, there are constant gray bars on both sides.\n\n- F1 ALL THE THINGS - 2,3x speedup via F1 makes long fights with summons bearable, also great when you're stuck in a location and missed a door somewhere, it's easy to visit all screens in a few seconds. It's a godsend when the game makes you watch something boring like that dance in Cleyra. F1 can also be used as a cheat: when you're in one of the missions with a time-limit the clock isn't affected by the speed-up. I've encountered a minor bug: A few times I've managed to F1 the animated cutscenes with no way to turn it off, you have to hit F1 at exactly the right time for the bug to trigger.\n\n- The other F-keys are cheats, the only useful one is F4 which turns off random encounters (that includes the "good" ones!), good for exploring or when you're running low on supplies.\n\n- Autosave! You still have the old-school save locations, but you also get a autosave every time you change the location, good for when you lost a valuable Tetra playing card, or when a boss is far away from the last savepoint. Apparently this save is only accessible over the "Continue" button in the main menu.\n\nIt's one of the best JRPGs!","April 17","true","16.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I had completed it fully, with no stone left unturned. I remember it was perhaps not one of my favourite games, possibly because I was too young to fully grasp the emotional rollercoaster the story turned out to be, but I remember it was up there with my top 5s on the original Playstation. And now, here it is on Steam! I immediately bought it as soon as I could and couldn't wait to jump back in, and I have to say, I am not disappointed in the least! The game is just how I remembered it only with boosted graphics. The gameplay is smooth, no lag whatsoever, the menus are slight larger from what I remember but I think that is because this PC version was adapted from the IOS and Android version? Correct me if I'm wrong. Anyway, moving on, the adaptation seems to have brought on no problems. I read a few complaints in the reviews about controller support issues, thankfully I can say I have had none of those.\n\nAll in all, the game is (still) perfect! No problems, and SE didn't mess it up by trying to implement Microtransactions or DLC!\n\nDefinitely a worthy purchase for the nostalgia and a truly fantastic, wonderful and inspirational game!","April 17","true","17.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

After careful consideration I've decided that there are two types of people looking to buy this game.  I will be writing specifically to one of those types so lets get the other out of the way.\n\nFor those of you who played this game years ago as a kid, buy it for the nostalgia factor.  It's pure bliss.  It's amazing how much you'll realize you forgot about this game, but how quickly it'll come racing back as soon as you see it over a decade later.\n\nFor the second type, those of you new to FF IX or to FF titles in general, this is for you.\n\nFFIX is the benchmark, my control group, the game that sets my standard for all other FF titles and in some ways, all other RPG's I('ve) play/played.  It's just that good.  From the amazing story, the beautiful cut scenes, to the loveable characters and fantastic music, this game did it all so well.  It starts of with a great little setup sequence but puts you in the action almost instantly and it only gets better.\n\nYou will come across characters you will immediately love, some you will despise, others you won't know what to think of them, and some that may just change your mind eventually.  All the while progressing a story that I could not put down as a kid.  I've since found myself years later looking up the music of this title to listen to while playing other, more current, RPG's because its simply that wonderful and entrancing.  And I've happily talked to many other FF IX players over the years about the in game card game (Tetra) and how amazing it was to collect different cards from different parts of the globe in an effort to become a Tetra master on the side.\n\nWhile it's so easy and ever more commonplace to judge a game based on what it is not or what it leaves out, lets take a moment to remember that we should really be basing our opinions and views/(reviews) on what the game is.  It's a loveable tale, with great cut scenes, hard to forget music, fleshed characters, a wonderful collectable mini-card-game within the game, and a huge world of puzzles waiting to be solved and it does all of this seemlessly.\n\nI challenge all gamers who purchase this game to play this game like we, those of us who are coming back for a second helping, played it as kids: there were no walkthroughs, no wikia pages, no builds, and no 'lets plays'.  We just played the game.  We discovered on our own, we solved on our own, we progressed on our own, maybe a we failed a bit on our own, we made our judgements and decisions on our own and we loved every second of it.  Do yourself a favor, buy this game.  Do yourself a bigger favor, play it the way it was meant to be played: with an inquisitive mind and a smile.  It will have a lasting effect on you by the end.","April 14","true","5.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The UI isn't too bad and the menus have mouse control which is always nice on a PC game.\nOptions are lackluster but that doesn't come as much of a surprise, youcan just set Resolution but the game plays in the original 4:3 aspect ratio regardless with no widescreen options. The FMV's look gorgeous and the characters and battle arenas are lovely and bright although the pre-rendered backgrounds can be a blurry and a tad ugly at times. The FMV's run at 15FPS with gameplay and battles running at 30FPS, I will add I had a slight frame drop once I hit the world map after the forest but that could just be my crappy computer.\nJust a heads up though, there's complaints of some people having controller problems and the store page does only say "Partial Controller Support" but I've been using a Xbox 360 controller and had no problems so far.\nSo yeah, with that said it's not a terrible job and it is FFIX, one of my personal favourite Final Fantasy's so when all's said and done I've gotta recommend this, it's worth the cost for the hours of entertainment you'll get out of it.","April 14","true","9.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Zidane was a breath of fresh air after Cloud and Squall depressed us with their emo mannerisms. All of the characters were fun and exciting. The story itself seems to transcend its own seriousness in lieu of light-hearted silliness and many many opportunities to get sidetracked with other activities, like Chocobo Digging and Tetra Master.\n\nThe PC release offers us help in the form of fast forwarding, easy skills, and max gil. I will admit to being tempted to use them, and I would recommend it for any buyers who lack the patience for an old grindy game, but there has been and always will be a feeling of satisfaction that comes with seeing your efforts pay off when you finally learn a new skill or level up after a lengthy grinding session.\n\nI have heard a couple of reports of controllers not working, though my lame Steelseries 3GC works just fine, and I have seen people using the 360 controller reporting no issues as well.\n\nThe polished character models are fantastic! I can, for the first time, appreciate the detail that went into these characters. Faces that simply looks like colored blobs of pixels, now actually look like faces and their bodies have details I had only noticed in cutscenes and closeups. Unfortunately, the backgrounds were not upgraded. I have read that this is due to much of the original material being lost over the years.\n\nAll-in-all, I'll say that this game is worth the price, especially since it is discounted off the bat. I would have gladly paid $25 just due to the sheer amount of content in this game. You will get your moneys worth in this.

Many of the cutscenes have always gotten a small reboot it seems, with new character models being taken into consideration.\n\nI have gotten through the first couple of hours of gameplay and many things really stood out from the start.  For one, they took into consideration the sword fights difficulty with the different input lags it seems, as on the PS3 edition of the game it is much harder to get to 100 impressed nobels with Queen Brahn, but in the PC Edition that has been resolved as   it only took me around 6 or 7 tries I think.\n\nThe game is easier though, or maybe it is just because I have played it so much that in 2 hours I only needed to hit level 4 to defeat Sealion and Black Waltz No. 1.\n\nAnyways, this is definitely an awesome game, and I would recommend it to any RPG fans out there.","April 15","true","183.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I'm a huge fan of rpgs and j-rpgs and I've been waiting for this release for a very long time. And they didn't mess it up, thank you square enix!\n\nNow that you know a little bit about me, would I recomend this game? If you are a FF fan like me, yes definitely. If you are new to the FF saga but you love rpgs, you should wait for a sale (and a good one!).\n\nI'll be honest, this game is a port from Android (more like an adaptation, but it feels like a port), and they've done a good job on some parts of it, but were really lazy on other parts. Let me explain:\n\n++ Character remodelling: the characters you control and most characters you interact with, have been remodeled and it looks really good *.* (I've been playing this game on a 1366x768 resolution). Also, the text balloons have better quality too.\n\n++ Cinematics: The movie cinematics have better quality then it had on psx. It could be better, but I'm happy they improved it a bit.\n\n++ Battles: New options like being able to disable the battle intro or no encounter mode are welcome. I like the battle intro, but when you're grinding (it's not like you need to do a lot grinding on this game, but still) it will get boring to watch the same intro over and over again (that takes about 10 secons on each combat).\n\n++ Music: I absolutely love the music themes on this game. The composer is Nobuo Uematsu, I don't think I need to say anything else.\n\n++ Feel (this is a personal plus for me and FF IX fans): It feels like FF IX. It plays like FF IX. It sounds like FF IX.\n\n++ Story: The plot is simple and easy to follow. It's not the most original plot ever, but it's well presented to the player, you can actually feel the story growing, gaining complexity, you care about what's happening in this world. And a very well built world to say the least.\n\n++ Characters: The characters jobs are cliché. You have the happy, good-hearted thief, the angelic white mage, the strong worrior and so on. But their personalities, oh my, their personalities are just... wow... Even years after playing this game I can still remember every main character name, their motives to fight, their roles on the story, what they're trying to acomplish, what they went through that made them change and the conclusions they find out... You can feel them grow up, their pain, you care about them and what is happening to them... d*mn FF IX is the only game that ever made me cry.\n\n-------------------\n\n\n-- Graphics: They've done a good job remodelling most characters in game, but the backgrounds and minor characters (like the villagers on a farm or citizens on a city)... not so much. It's the same backgrounds and models, no HD or remoddling whatsoever... On Android maybe it doesn't look that bad, but on PC with a 1366x768 resolution, it looks bad for a game released on 2016... A little remoddeling here would be welcomed.\nAlso (and probably because Square Enix didn't touch on the backgrounds), the game is locked on a 4:3 aspect ratio (no widescreen option).\nI also detected a minor animation glitch when one of the characters is celebrating a battle victory.\n\n-- Price: it doesn't feel good at all when you pay 17€ for an Android port on PC, even more when this game was released  16 years ago and it's basically the same game from back then with a little remoddling...\n\n\n----------------------\n\n+/- Controller: I played this game with an Xbox360 controller, and it works really good. Only a small problem when using the joystick to move the characther on the map, the character for some reason keeps moving on it's own sometimes...\n","April 15","true","41.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/danilonishimura/recommended/377840/","danilonishimura","danilonishimura","http://steamcommunity.com/id/danilonishimura/","104 products in account","tl;dr: Overall it's a good port. There are changes to the UI, sound effects have been updated, videos have better resolution, characters are great, controls are ok.\n\n- If you're a fan of Final Fantasy games, don't miss this release.\n\n- If you have neve played this game on PSX, here's your chance, do it.\n\n- If you played it on a emulator, It feels like playing it on a decent emulator, with the best possible quality, and also some dark magic improving models and textures (things a emulator can't do properly). Plus, it has all the charm of various language options, Achievements, Cloud Save and Trading Cards.\n\n--\nComparisons to PSX version\n\nUI: The UI was basically remade. It has touch support, which translates to mouse clicks on the PC side, and navigation using a controller feels mostly the same as it was in the console version. Player portraits inparticular look great. The downside is that it runs at a faster framerate than the gameplay itself, making some UI graphics shutter when it tries to follow a model character, such as damage text when a creature dies.\n\nMusic: It features the same music used in the original game, with a small difference. The PSX game had its music done using a sequenced with specific samples. The game can be speed up using the F1 key, which makes the whole game faster, except the music, making the battle encounters and battle spoils moments completely gone, and would make Mr. Uematsu quite unhappy. This version uses a compressed recorded version of the original PSX music, which leads to the best fidelity, but with a small impact on quality. If have a good ear for subtle things like this, it'll bother you a little; most people won't even notice.\n\nControls: Using a gamepad, it feels like a PSX, except for some parts of the UI, where it behaves slightly different from the original counterpart, such as the battle scene, where selecting the target of a skill is easier to select using up and down in the enemy list instead of selecting the enemy looking at him, using left or right. Inputting the character name is also different and quite counter-intuitive: I had to grab the mouse and click on the text box, and then click Confirm.\n\nModels: The character models are great, and their textures also look great. The battle scene models remain the same as the original PSX game, which makes it look a bit outdated, which is fine, since we're playing a port, not a remake. Also about the battle scene, the level textures uses some filtering. It doesn't help, but doesn't hurt to have it. The prerendered backgrounds are fine just the way they were, also featuring the same texture filtering, also not helping nor damaging.\n\n--\nVeredict\n\nOverall it's a good port. Being someone who played throughfully the PSX version, It feels like the psx version, with slightly better graphics. Being able to keep your save in the cloud and basically never lose it? Big plus. The things I miss in ths game: New Game+ and better storage of Tetra cards.\n\n\nScore: 9/10\n\n\nP.S.: Overall, It's a good thing they didn't redo the textures, the music or the levels. It would look like a whole new game, and at the same time, and perheaps not being par to current quality of games. In fact, if they were to rework the game, they should literally rework the whole game, not just the textures, and would end up like FF7, taking a lot of time and a lot of resources to rework the whole thing.","April 15","true","2.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Mouse controls are a lil unresponsive but otherwise they did a surprisingly good job of creating a PC-centric control scheme. Controllers work fine, the one sticking point being that there's no analog movement so it's a little awkward moving around with an analog stick.\n\nGraphically it looks about as good as you'd expect from a $20 Unity port of FF9; character models and UI are high res, backgrounds are blurry messes because they're the original PSX assets stretched out. Kinda sucks but it's completely understandable given the limited scope of the project.\n\nAlso the game itself is really cute and fun if a bit shallow!!

So this review may be biased.\nFirst of all, should a person who likes Final Fantasy or Role Playing Games in general buy this game? The answer is yes! As other reviews have stated this game has charm oozing from it.\nThe story, in my opinion is wonderful and heartfelt. The setting is a living fairy tale world with just enough steampunk to keep it entertaining. The characters are wonderful.\nEnough about the old stuff. What about the new? The new character models are excellent. The ability to speed up battles is also great. Turning off random encounters, while not something I would usually do, is becoming tempting because of the encounter rate in certain areas. There is a lot of good. I have especially enjoyed the sharper graphics and enhanced cutscenes. I am seeing details that I didn't know were in them, and I have played this game countless times through. This is the best version of Final Fantasy IX.\nSo...what do I wish was better? The backgrounds and some of the NPCs could have been touched up a little. I know that replacing backgrounds would have required phenomenal effort, but I know there are some high quality backgrounds floating around the internet. Perhaps a future update could gradually improve the visuals that way. Honestly, it's not a deal breaker. This is the best version of the game.\nIn closing, if you are at all a fan of the JRPG genre, this game is for you. A great story, great side quests, and a lot of depth.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kindredspirit17/recommended/377840/","kindredspirit17","☆KindredSpirit☆","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kindredspirit17/","4 products in account",""Final Fantasy IX" is definitely my favorite in the series, and one of my favorite games of all-time for that matter. So upon hearing that this game would ported to PC, I got super excited. This is a game that I feel (or rather now felt) didn't get the recognition it deserved. Admittedly, I did get a little worried, considering that the ports of FFV,FFVI, and even FFVIII weren't well-received by fans (not including the graphic and music mods inputted in those games).\n\nSo after playing at least 7 hours of this port, I would have to say, YES!! THEY DIDN'T SCREW IT UP!! NO CRAPPY RESOLUTIONS, NO MIDI MUSIC, NO LAGGING!!\n\n*ahem* Anyways, I was pleasantly surprised that this port was not only great, but also a decent contender of the most definitive version of the game, giving the original PS1 version a run for its money. The graphics are updated and more crisped, the FMVs (cinematic cutscenes) have gotten an extremely HD boost and looks absolutely spectacular, the music is the same as it should be, the mouse support really helps in some parts, and the battle system is more helpful,giving you the option to change and defend in on menu (though that's kind of a small thing).\n\nThe only nitpicks I have with this version is that one: the battle swirl is a little less fluent than in the PS1 version, two:  it's kind of a hassle to exit to game, having to go to the menu to exit it instead of doing so pressing ESC, and three: I kinda don't like that this game is not fully controller compatible. When I use my PS4 controller to play the game, Zidane walks either to the left or right. But again, like I said, they're nitpicks. A keyboard works fine as well.\n\nOverall, SE managed to not screw up this port of the game. I say if you want to go on an nostalgic trip, or if you want to play this game for the first time, buy this port! :)","April 16","true","2.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Loved it then and love it now as well.\n\nPros:\n- the graphic updates to the characters makes it where I can actually see their faces, as well as see what the monster cards actually look like.\n- the 'cheats' they have in the form of boosters was a nice touch, since I can turn some of them on and off like I could when I had a gameshark (although back then I had to restart the game by shutting it off to turn off the cheats).\n- having no encounter will be good if I ever decide to do a speed run, as I never did it before (back with the original I used a cheat that would reset the game timer back to 0:00:00 so that I could enjoy the game and explore everything without having to sacrifice anything and so I could get that excal 2).\n\nCons:\n- Sometimes using those cheats makes me feel dirty lol, even though I've played it many many times and used more cheats than that with the psx before.\n- Steiner with his face looking like it has makeup on (looks like he has eyeliner on to me)\n- This version doesn't have the cheat to reset the timer, only one I would use very often, but in a way that makes since as all the people who do legitimate speed runs would be upset with it.\n\nOverall was impressed with this rerelease of the game, definately makes the nostalgia part of my brain happy.","April 16","true","52.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I don't think I've ever been this excited for a rerelease of a game before!\n\nThis game runs really smoothly on my current PC. The audio seems to be in perfect sync, which some of the other ports (VII and VIII mostly) have had some trouble with. I love the updated models, and while they're not Dissida level, they look 100% better than they did in the old game, and still are able to capture the original image of it.\n\nI really love all of the improvements, plus the booster system made a "for fun run" much easier, especially if you want that rare and elusive "Excalibur II" for Steiner.\n\nAll in all, this game is ported well, the thing just makes me happy.\n\nNote: For controller usage, I ended up switching the Confirm and Cancel buttons (From B being Confirm and A being Cancel) to make it a bit more like the original on the Playstation. But that's just me.","April 16","true","7.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

FF9 is usually hailed as either one of the best, or the best FF games released, and it's easy to see why. It's immersive, the story is pulling and the chracters have depth and, well, character.\n\nIt's a great game. The general graphics are dated (it's realse date originally was 2001, on the PS1) But for the PC version all cutscenes and character textures have been upped into a higher quality. To be honest, I can't really tell with the cutscenes, Squaresoft/enix were very, very good at getting the best they could out of the hardware at the time, and the cutscenes are still good.\nThe auto-save has got to be one of my favourite additions. It's so much nicer than having to slog through the same bit to get to a boss fight again.\n\n\nI have noticed one or two little things in the game that bug me, for instance (To avoid spoilers ((You haven't played this yet? What have you been doing since 2001?)) I'll play the pronoun game) On the Prima Vista, when the Knight jumps into the hole, there's a little sound of his armour clinking when he gets stuck on the PS1 version, not present here.\nAlso, the little robot things that appear when you use Detect or Scan don't open their 'eyes' like they do on the PS1 version. I imagine, or hope, Square will look into updating the PC version to include these little bits and pieces","April 15","true","37.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheKingofFighters/recommended/377840/","TheKingofFighters","Zero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheKingofFighters/","149 products in account","I'll start by saying that this Final Fantasy isn't like the others. It's probably what people imagined the next Final Fantasy to be like after they played Final Fantasy III on Super Nintendo and were waiting for the first 3D game consoles to hit shelves. Instead, what they got was Final Fantasy VII. FFVII is a great game and deserves the accolades it gets, but to me, Final Fantasy IX hits a home run. This is the game I wanted. I loved it on Playstation and I love it now. It's my favorite Final Fantasy.\n\nIf you enjoy JRPGs and have not played this, you owe it to yourself to at least give it a shot. The music is Nobuo Uematsu at his best and of the three Playstation era Final Fantasy games it has the best graphics. Square really knew the ins and the outs of the Playstation by this point. The characters are likable(make sure you get those Active Time Events so you see what they're up to!) and the gameplay(while slow, can be sped up in the menu, with a booster using the F1 key, and with an Auto-Haste ability!) is what you'd expect from a classic Final Fantasy game.\n\nThis version regrettably does not have hi-res backgrounds allegedly because Square lost the master assets to the game. This is incredibly saddening as this game deserves to look its absolute best. Even so, the new models look great and I did not run into the problems other people are talking(controller issues, mine works fine) about other than a sound glitch when you use an Elixer and that is hardly a deal breaker. This is easily the best PC port that Square has done, and though I wish they had kept the master assets I wholeheartedly recommend this game to any fan of the series that has not tried it yet.\n\n10/10 would cry at the ending again","May 3","true","92.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Going against the typical darkish and negative-ish protagonists that the saga has provided until the IX release.\n\n*Each character is unique on their battle roles, so no over powered main character who does it all.\n\n*Return to the basics of the series: the vintage classes, fantasy related world, empires, kings and whatnot.\n\n*The variety of paths you can take to finish the game, each combination of characters provides many challenges.\n\n*It is a damn long game to play if you go for the whole 100% thingy.\n\n*Many minigames and secrets that really add a lot of fun time to mess around.\n\n*The score is the best of the series.\n\n*The old school feel was successfully ported.\n\nCons:\n\n*To any RPG fan this game will result pretty easy to beat, once you get the hang of it.\n\n*Not much replay value.\n\n*Some minigames are just a grindfest to obtain things that won't matter that much.\n\n\n****SOFT SPOILER ALERT****\n\n*Although the villain has an awesome personality, I do feel it is too easy to beat him, same with the last boss, not what is felt against the secret boss, which is by far the hardest thing to beat on the whole FF series if you refuse to do the friendly monsters quest.\n\n\n\nAll in all the overall scoreboard:\n\n*Music: 10/10.\n\n*Playability: 9/10.\n\n*Difficulty: 6/10.\n\n*Characters: 10/10.\n\n*Story: 10/10.\n\nOverall Score: 45/50.","May 17","true","85.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

That's all you need to know.  Buy it.\n\n\nI've been playing Final Fantasy since the first once.  The very first NES FF game.  This is, hands down, my favorite one.  This version is not without its issues, but the core of the game is there.  Plus, it auto-saves to a quick load slot so you don't have to "load" your game, you can just "continue" it, so if you experience any issues you can close out and re-launch almost where you left off.  That's very nice.\n\nWhile the overhaul of character models is decent, it would've been nice for them to do something with some of the area models.  There are times where you can't tell a door is a door or a hallway is a hallways because the maps, foreground/background, whatever... are all the original low resolution.  I don't have any complaints about the audio quality not being what I remember...  it's still the same.  But keep in mind I haven't played the original in years so maybe I just don't remember correctly.\n\nI have experienced a number of bugs...  from game breaking (Zidane stuck walking in one direction, perma tranced, instant ATB, and invulnerable in battles...  all at the same time), to just annoying (if you play long enough the interaction with stuff begins to take numerous button presses).  It would be nice if SquareEnix patched and corrected some of this...  but let's be honest, lately they just hammer stuff out and move on without giving any support to their products.  And yet we continue to buy it all up.\n\nIn the end I recommend this because it is, afterall, Final Fantasy 9.  The characters are great, there's a TON to do beyond the story quests, and it's just an overall fun game.","April 17","true","39.3"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","0"

So far this is a pretty decent port. Some quick notes:\n\nPROS:\n+ Port runs well, no issues at all. You can be under the requirements and the game will still run fine\n+ Music is the same as PSOne\n+ Remastered textures and polygons are a great addition\n+ Controller support, although I've only tested on a wired 360 controller\n\nCONS:\n- While the FMVs and textures for 3D objects have been remastered, the backgrounds have not. This creates a huge contrast between the player and background quality and can be a bit annoying\n- Not a lot of PC options and key rebindings can only be done in game and will only affect that specific file\n- I believe they still kept the original PSOne framerate, so expect 30 frames locked and dip to 15 in battles\n\nEDIT:\nSo I bought an XBox One controller and tried to test it on this game, even after the 2.6GB update that we got and it doesn't work that well. For some reason, the controlls are really wonky because it can't use the analog stick right. That said, the game is still fine and Keyboard controlls work just as well. If you need to use a controller, make sure you have a 360 controller because I know for sure that it works well.","April 14","true","8.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

To people coming back to the installation, you will love the updates, nothing is ruined, in fact things are improved (if that was even possible) slight touches here and there make the game so much more enjoyable - things like autosaving before a boss battle to the updated sprites; simple touches, nothing overdone, they even keep the amazing original soundtrack - keeps the nostalgia alive. Also for those that want to have fun messing around with speed runs, or expirimintation - cheats can be enables in game! Things like auto earn abilities rather than leveling them to keep them, or auto level 99 are all in this game so you can tweak it how you want it, or play it like it was in the glory days, your choice. Also added to the adaptation - STEAM ACHEIVEMENTS!\n\nTo those new to the game - enjoy this beautiful masterpeice, there are too few games out there that warrant the title "work of art" but this game hands down is one of the best in the long running Final Fantasy franchise, and ultimatly one of the best games EVER made. The turn based combat seems slow at first, but if you dive deep into the core mechanics that is this glorious RPG; it will make you think. You will fall in love with the fantasy/steampunk environment and will be enamored by the complex ability system. Saving every peice of old equipment to be synthisized into something completley new with brand new abilities is a refreshing turn from tossing things out just because you have something that hits harder. From the main story to the side quests and mini games, this game will keep you hooked - the character development is something you don't see in video games in this day and age anymore (so good that I did my creative writing thesis on it). So much to do, so many secrets to find, every time I pick up this title it blows me away, this is how games should be made.\n\n100/100 nobles impressed\nQueen Brahne was quite impressed\nSquare Enix was showered with 10000 gil","April 14","true","31.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I will update soon after replaying the game.***\n\nTRUTH: This will be the first review I write on steam.\n\nThe first FF game I ever played was FF8 and I never looked at a video game console the same way again. The story, the characters, It really was magical to me. I loved every second of that experience. There was nothing that could come close to, or even compare to, that game for me...until FF9 came out.\n\nFrom the very start I was encahted. The opening movies were amazing, the dialouge is funny, and I enjoy reading it (WHO NEEDS VOICE ACTORS). Zidane is a typical cool guy rouge, and that is so different from his predecessor (the seriously serious Squall).  I love the ATB system and turn based battle system in general. I know that in todays fast pace action packed video game universe the battle system in this game can sometimes feel a little...dull. However i assume the new "boosts" they implemented will help you get over the hill when it comes to that issue. It's all about the story, the journey, for me, and this is one you don't want to miss. NOT FOR ANYTHING. The backgrounds and scenes are just amazing. They really help draw you into the story. The cut scenes are always great and exciting to watch. The relationships between the characters is amazing to watch and experience. No doubt by the end of this game you will have a new favorite game charecter in one of them. The lore and history of this world is exciting and fun to learn about. Admittedly, being back to castles and airships is nice too. Hey, don't get me wrong I loved FF7 and FF8, but to me this game really gets back to the games true origins, mages and monsters, princesses and knights.  A true "fantasy" experience. (with some crazy tech thrown in at the end) You really love the good guys and you really HATE the bad guys. Another positive thing about this game. As much as you can care about your party is about as much as you can hate the bad guys in this game.  Just another reason to keep playing, to see 'em all burn HAHAHAHAH! ...eh hem.  Look its an old game from a long time ago. It's not all flashy and what not, but It is a great game.\n\nHonestly, I cannot wait to start replaying this game. It is all downloaded and ready to run. And I am just about to dive in. Do yourself a favor and grab a copy of this and do the same.\n\n","April 14","true","38.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The characters seem to act typical as to what you may expect, but its not always bad to play the role your best suited for in my opinions. so i'm coming at you with this short list of reasons to play and own this game.\n\n-Chocobo Hot & Cold game will suck up tons of time in the most enjoyous ways.\n-Vivi is hands down a must in your party cause he OP and just plain bad@$$ (Top 3 All time FF characters for me)\n-A story that makes you question your own existence and the reasons why you do what you do. (Cause you love it)\n-Plenty of CG cut scenes that really bring the characters to life.\n-Easy to learn trading card game built in that if you play enough jump rope, you can call it out from there on.\nFinally\nA sexy princess to save, who's personality and determination is admirable and quite desirable.\n\nOne of the few FF games i've played through multiple times, and its time to do it all over again.

I will update soon after replaying the game.***\n\nTRUTH: This will be the first review I write on steam.\n\nThe first FF game I ever played was FF8 and I never looked at a video game console the same way again. The story, the characters, It really was magical to me. I loved every second of that experience. There was nothing that could come close to, or even compare to, that game for me...until FF9 came out.\n\nFrom the very start I was encahted. The opening movies were amazing, the dialouge is funny, and I enjoy reading it (WHO NEEDS VOICE ACTORS). Zidane is a typical cool guy rouge, and that is so different from his predecessor (the seriously serious Squall).  I love the ATB system and turn based battle system in general. I know that in todays fast pace action packed video game universe the battle system in this game can sometimes feel a little...dull. However i assume the new "boosts" they implemented will help you get over the hill when it comes to that issue. It's all about the story, the journey, for me, and this is one you don't want to miss. NOT FOR ANYTHING. The backgrounds and scenes are just amazing. They really help draw you into the story. The cut scenes are always great and exciting to watch. The relationships between the characters is amazing to watch and experience. No doubt by the end of this game you will have a new favorite game charecter in one of them. The lore and history of this world is exciting and fun to learn about. Admittedly, being back to castles and airships is nice too. Hey, don't get me wrong I loved FF7 and FF8, but to me this game really gets back to the games true origins, mages and monsters, princesses and knights.  A true "fantasy" experience. (with some crazy tech thrown in at the end) You really love the good guys and you really HATE the bad guys. Another positive thing about this game. As much as you can care about your party is about as much as you can hate the bad guys in this game.  Just another reason to keep playing, to see 'em all burn HAHAHAHAH! ...eh hem.  Look its an old game from a long time ago. It's not all flashy and what not, but It is a great game.\n\nHonestly, I cannot wait to start replaying this game. It is all downloaded and ready to run. And I am just about to dive in. Do yourself a favor and grab a copy of this and do the same.\n\n","April 14","true","38.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

So far this is a pretty decent port. Some quick notes:\n\nPROS:\n+ Port runs well, no issues at all. You can be under the requirements and the game will still run fine\n+ Music is the same as PSOne\n+ Remastered textures and polygons are a great addition\n+ Controller support, although I've only tested on a wired 360 controller\n\nCONS:\n- While the FMVs and textures for 3D objects have been remastered, the backgrounds have not. This creates a huge contrast between the player and background quality and can be a bit annoying\n- Not a lot of PC options and key rebindings can only be done in game and will only affect that specific file\n- I believe they still kept the original PSOne framerate, so expect 30 frames locked and dip to 15 in battles\n\nEDIT:\nSo I bought an XBox One controller and tried to test it on this game, even after the 2.6GB update that we got and it doesn't work that well. For some reason, the controlls are really wonky because it can't use the analog stick right. That said, the game is still fine and Keyboard controlls work just as well. If you need to use a controller, make sure you have a 360 controller because I know for sure that it works well.","April 14","true","8.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The nostalgia is strong with this one, and I bought the PC Steam port the day it came out.\n\nBut... really, Square? Update the character models but not the background, having high-quality characters on a PAINFULLY  low resolution background?? It takes away greatly from the work put into updating the models Because they seem like cutouts plastered on a low res jpeg (but in the screenshots on steam, they have been painted over!).\n\nSame UI setup from the mobile game, which isn't great on a 16:9 computer screen? ♥♥♥♥♥♥ menu controls and lack of ability to customize buttons? Far out, guys. I knew you were stingy and look for any way to make more money - and yes I have bought, and will play this game because it is one of my favourites of the series - but you didn't even have the regard to treat this port with the dignity it deserves.

As usual, they've ♥♥♥♥ed up the PC port of an usually fantastic game.  This time they didn't turn it into a subpar mobile game with terrible graphics; it does look better than the original, but at the cost of gameplay.\n\nThe loading times between FMVs and battles are ridiculously long; up to a minute.\nThere's an odd input lag and when it kicks in, the controls just slip all over the place.\nYou need to go through more interfaces than is really necessary (choose a slot, then choose a slot again?  why?) to save the game, and it takes ages; even compared to the original version.\n\nI'd say the only good thing about this port (as with literally all of Square's Steam ports) is the presence of achievements but even that seems to not work for many people and as usual, don't expect a patch from Square anytime soon since they pass on to another project the second they release anything.","May 1","false","3.7"," 7 of 17 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","7","17","0","1"

Even the page listing of "partial support" doesn't explain it well enough. That said, I've heard it works fine with a true 360 controller. x360ce or InputMapper cannot get any of my controllers to work without extreme sensitivity and a left input being forever pressed.\nThe one thing that wasn't touched was the backgrounds. It causes a jarring effect between the high resolution character models and the blurry and low resolution backgrounds.\nNo customization options outside of a launcher with resolution options.\nNo save data on your actual computer (as far as I am aware). All in the cloud, Squall.\n3.6 gigs.\n\nOther than the "controller support" this port is actually quite good already. If Squeenix can manage to just finish the job and make it work with controllers it would be perfect. I would not complain about more customization options though! So at the moment, if you're a PC player who doesn't need a controller this game is completely ready for you. For the rest of us, we'll have to make the best of it.\n\nRecommended since this one huge issue (that will most likely be patched) can't bring down what is otherwise a surprisingly decent port.","April 14","true","1.6"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

It causes a really jarring and distracting effect on the game. I sincerely tried to look past this, but coupling that glaring issue with the fact that combat is PAINFULLY slow I cannot recommend this port.\n\nYes I am aware that there is a speed boosting feature, but you have to pause the game, hit R1, then unpause to resume. Had they just allowed you to hold R1 to get the speed boost when you wanted it (when waiting for combat commands to complete or ATBs to fill for example) then it might have compensated for the slow combat.","April 25","false","2.0"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","0"

The story had me quickly engaged, and I was looking forward to my new adventure. However, the technical issues and bugs with the controls have soured me on this game.\n\nAs a disabled gamer, it is important that a game functions well in windowed mode with an on-screen keyboard. Final Fantasy IX currently has a very severe bug that centers your mouse pointer on your screen whenever you hit a movement key (WASD or the arrow keys). A game should never move your mouse pointer when you are not using the mouse. You press any of the directional for your character and the mouse will move. This is very irritating when using an on-screen keyboard.\n\nThis bug will also affect controllers if you are plagued with the character continually moving in one direction even when not pressing a joystick. Thus you will be required to use keyboard shortcuts to quit the game.\n\nI recommend staying away from this game until Square takes the time to fix these issues.","May 5","false","21.8"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","22","2","9","3","0"

Not recommended.\n\nFirst time I did a refund for a game on Steam. This port is of very low quality and destroyed my attempt to jump on the nostalgia train.\n\nFirst off, game assets vary A LOT in quality. The prerendered backgrounds look blurry and have a laughable low resolution, while some of the main characters got new textures and poly count. The end result is a very uneven experience, where the characters feels artificial in relation to the environment.\n\nSecond, the game pad support is quite buggy and totally ignores joystick sensitivity. The latter could easily been fixed. Don't tell me that this is part of the nostalgia - it is simply just bad.\n\nThird, the ugly grey background filler is just terrible. I really don't mind the game being in a 4:3 format, but why use an awful grey texture as filler?

I say mostly due to one part as seen in part 1 of my playthrough that I'll link below. But as evidenced by Final Fantasy 7 and 8 where i always felt the backgrounds looks very pretty compared to the models, this time we have the opposite. The backgrounds so far look like they have had no improvement what so ever.\n\nAnd some how they can't improve the aspect ratio...\n\nIt feels very lazy for its premium (relative) price.\n\nA few personal points on the game I'm not keen on.\n\n- Mobile Style UI interface\n- Cluttered Title Screen\n- No PS4 Controller Prompts\n- GAME BOOSTERS :/\n- That Crappy Card I was given at the start of the game....\n\nOverall I love this game for it's story and characters. However I'd like you all to hear my gripes before you, yourself go  out and buy it. Hence why I am down voting. If you've never played it before however, then I would implore you to experience the story.\n\nLink to Part 1 : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTjFsTXmE0w&feature=youtu.be","April 14","false","41.9"," 29 of 106 people (27%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","27","29","106","0","6"

So for those saying this isn't a port, your wrong!\nThe game might be good even if it's a port from the mobile version, but unfortionately I'm not able to play it at this time. I never liked playing my FF games with mouse and keyboard, so naturally I choose to connect an Xbox One controller (it's more comfy than a PS3 controller, and easier to setup). This does not work well, as the character starts running off to the left of the screen and gets stuck there, no matter what way I try to push the stick...\nI was really hoping of enjoying this today (or tomorrow on my birthday), but looks like I gotta wait some more.

We meet on PC at last.\n\nSo it's a port, of a port. Not that bad. But not the best either.\n\nHD models are nice. The backgrounds could have used a little work, but they are still pretty decent, considering.\nLocked at 30 FPS, locked at 4:3 aspect ratio, which causes massive screen tearing. No V-Sync, and not even an option to turn it on. Bummer.\n\nBattle menu was a little clunky, but no worse the the PS1 version.\n\nThe big flaw. The BIG one. The cutscene going into Alexandria, before you take control of Vivi. The NPC's are still PS1 graphics. They ripped the scene straight from the PS1, and slapped it in this HD version. That's just lazy. They had plenty of time to fix that, and even the models are there! They're peppered all throughout the town, but they chose to be lazy. The mobile version launched in or around Feburary. They could have easily done more.\n\nAll in all, it's a mediocre port of a port, of a game made in 2000. If you're a die hard fan, you'll love it. You'll look past all the lazy and see it as an amazing piece of your childhood. If you're new to the franchise, and want to play the old stuff? Just pick up a copy at your local used game place.

It's a good port, but the base game wasn't that great to begin with.\n\nFinal Fantasy IX, "goes back to the roots of the Final Fantasy series", which root? The classic Final Fantasy should be about the four Warriors of Light with special power from the mother crystals, going on a journey to save the world. Final Fantasy IX doesn't have the crystal nor the job system. It's more like FFIV and VI where characters have unique job and abilities.\n\nThe setting feels more like a Disney cartoon where you have animals pretending to be human. The plot is about a princess who ran away from the castle with a thief. That princess also starts singing out of nowhere just like every Disney's princesses. Not that Disney is bad but it doesn't feel like a Final Fantasy game.\n\nThe characters are so generic. You have the princess, the monkey thief, the knight, the black mage, and the rest is irrelevant characters who barely have anything to do with the main story.\n\nThe battle system is very slow. Even with the new option in this port that allow you to remove the intro before battles but the battle itself is still slow. It also has a huge lag before battles in this port. Trance is the worst "limit break" system I've ever seen. A finishing move that you cannot choose when to use? really?\n\nThe character developmental system is not good. Maybe worse than FFVIII's Junction system. In FFIX you'll be forced to use inferior equipment in order to learn character abilities. It's annoying.\n\nThe card game is not as good as Triple Triad from FFVIII, and other minigames are boring.\n\nThe soundtracks are fine. I like many of them.\n\nThe port is very well done. I worried a bit because they ported it from Android version but it runs perfectly on my system. The graphics look fine, the new battle menu doesn't cause any issue to me so far. The 4:3 ratio with stupid side bars is lame though.\n\n7/10 for the port.\n\n5.5/10 for the base game. A decent JRPG but not that great.\n\n2/10 for the FFIX fans who kept hating on people who don't think FFIX is the best of all-time.

I can't say that IX is definitively the best, but it's definitely up there as far as quality games in the series goes, and for a good reason.\n\nThe story is one of the best I've ever seen in a JRPG. All of the characters are lovable and hard to forget. My personal favorite is Vivi, the young Black Mage. Without spoiling too much, he goes through a lot of difficult things, mostly existential, and if you're anything like me it will probably make you cry.\n\nThe graphics are wonderful, even to this day, although the character models have been upgraded. There are complaints about how the backgrounds are blurry, and well, they are. But when you're focusing on playing the game you kind of don't notice after a while. The FMVs are beautiful looking for a game that came out on the PS1.\n\nThe battle system is great, still using the ATB system like the older games in the franchise. This means you can choose to be active to fight in real time, or you can wait, which lets you go through menus for items and magic. There's also Trance, which lets your character become stronger for a short period of time. Abilities are given based on what items you equip, each of them having different effects in battle.\n\nTo those wondering, this game isn't stretched to be fullscreen, because it will still show grey borders at the sides. I have it on 1366x768 and it still shows the borders. I personally don't care, but some people might be turned off by it.\n\nOverall, this game is amazing, and if you consider yourself a JRPG fan you would be doing yourself a favor by playing it. I feel like the price is a little too high right now, though, even for such a great game. When it goes on sale, it's a definite purchase.","May 5","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But even when I put aside those rose-tinted nostalgia goggles, I can safely say that this one is a timeless gem and well worth playing if you haven't done so yet.\n\nI've played through the entire game and completed all side objectives multiple times back in the PS1 glory days, when FFIX was in its original 4-disc form. When I found out that this perennial fav of mine was being brought to PC in a remastered state, I was overjoyed-- and also, like many other fans, a bit worried that the port would be of poor quality. I anxiously awaited its release, and when it finally came out I was extremely relieved to see that the game was nearly perfect. They even kept the quality of the lovely and memorable musical score intact.\n\nThe character models look better than ever in high-res, and for those less fond of that JRPG grind there are now optional cheats to breeze through the game (though I'd never touch 'em, personally. I'm an FFIX purist like that!)\n\nControls work fine with either a controller or keyboard/mouse, but I recommend using a controller as that is the way the game was meant to be played.\n\nThe only issue I've got (and it's a relatively minor one that not much could've been done about) is the blurry backgrounds, which in most PC resolutions are quite noticeably fuzzy. This is unfortunate, as these pre-rendered backgrounds feature some very stunning art and help to create the game's amazing atmosphere. But fortunately they can still be appreciated, even in this state. It's far from a deal-breaker, at least for me. It bugged me a lot at first, but I can deal with it now.\n\nThe story and its characters remain as timeless and charming as ever, and it's the same emotional thrillride for me that it's always been. I will never stop adoring this game, and I'm really pleased to have it back in my life.\n\n\nTL;DR --> An above-average port of the best Final Fantasy game of them all.

It is lighthearted in appearance, but don't let that fool you - the issues explored in this game are very, very dark, including war and genocide.\n\nThe game world is a mixture of fantasy and steampunk (there is a LOT of steam, mist, and clouds in this game; probably why it was released on this platform!). The game's backgrounds are gorgeous and colourful (I took many screenshots) and most of them are partly animated, breathing life into every location you visit. The whole game looks and feels like you're walking through a Miyazaki movie.\n\nThe main characters are a whimsical collection of misfits that range from magical children to brooding warriors. The plot is your straightforward "save the world from a warlord" fare, with the usual twists and turns of betrayal and friendship. The ending of the game felt rushed and disjointed, with so many events and so much information dumped on the player that it felt like a completely different story.\n\nThe music is, as expected, fabulous. It captures a medieval tone and sentiment, like the lute music of Shakespeare's time. The soundtrack alone is a work of art.\n\nAs for gameplay, you have options. Hardcore gamers can grind, sidequest, and level up to their heart's content. A big sidequest is evolving your chocobo to hunt for treasure. Casual gamers, or nostalgic gamers who just want the story, can simply activate this PC version's Boosters to transform this JRPG into a graphic novel. I appreciate this freedom of choice.\n\nFinal Fantasy 9 is a pleasant retro departure from the modern Final Fantasy.","May 14","true","25.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'll explain why below.\n\nFinal Fantasy IX is one of the few titles after FF7 that feels like it has real heart. Many articles on this topic have addressed this fact, but the stories theme is "What is my purpose? Why am I here?"\n\nZidane struggles with this existential crisis. Of course Vivi, the Black Mage, struggles with it more than most. Princess Garnet struggles with wanting to be herself and live her life while balancing her duties as royalty. Steiner struggles with his duty and honor and how that conflicts with his direct orders. This theme plays out again and again with the various characters, and it truly is a deep and moving story.\n\nThe creators of this game poured their heart and soul into this game. There was no pandering in this game or fan service. This game personifies what Final Fantasy should be. The art of this game was unparalleled at the time of its release. If you do a Google search you can find the full resolution background images for many scenes, and they're absolutely breath taking for a game originally released on the PS1.\n\nIt is clear that this game, both in aesthetic and in its storytelling, was created with true passion from the developers. The combat system is smooth, fun, and engaging, without being overly convoluted like later titles in the series.\n\nIt lacks the cheesy J-RPG romance and soap operaness that titles like FFXIII, FFX, and even FFVII displayed.\n\nThis game is simply a masterpiece for any lovers of RPGs, and it's an absolute must buy for anyone with a love of JRPGs.\n\nPlease, do yourself a favor and buy this game.","April 18","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Stories for side characters feel a little forced, as if they did not have time to create the content to flesh them out.  Good sequences and scenes but sadly are not too memorable.  If you enjoyed the formula for Final Fantasy games before this then you will probably find XI to be a decent addition to the collection.  For someone who's never played the older Final Fantasy games, by all means, jump in.\n\nPlayed at the highest resoultion without problems - although certain videos would stutter during playback.  Did not crash or run into any glitches that made the game unplayable.  Be careful not to accidentally activate the game boosters (like opening every battle in trance mode).\n\nRecommended for nostalgia and for being a decent game for its time.

They've updated the assets and the FMVs to work on today's higher-resolution monitors, although the sound effects and backgrounds are still the same. Saving seems to work slightly differently to normal- you can save at moogles if you like, but the game autosaves at each new loadzone. And would it have killed them to add a "quit" button somewhere rather than making us Alt+F4 every time? That's pretty tedious when you just want to restart after having lost a card battle.

PLUS, the booster to turn on 9999 damage is amazing for finally beating side bosses i never bothered with when i had to rely on save moogles exclusively.  (the game auto-saves every time you switch to a new scene, making boss battles infinitely easier to restart.)\n\nmy favorite thing tho has to be the clarity i can now see the cinematics with.  expressions are obvious and they make for some great screenshots. i am all about screenshots of this game and pretty much tap the capture button constantly, just so i can go back and admire the nuances that i never noticed before.  i'm probably going to do another playthrough just to finally get steiner's best weapon, since i can actually do that now with the speed-up booster and the no randoms.\n\nhonestly if you are a fan of ffix you owe it to yourself to buy this version.  if you're a final fantasy fan but havent played ffix yet, please do! it's one of the best, and it really shows you the heart of the franchise (imo).  i sincerely recommend this game to like everybody on planet earth, honestly!","April 27","true","32.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ragingrazmataz/recommended/377840/","ragingrazmataz","holy shit is that kurt cobain","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ragingrazmataz/","162 products in account","FF9 has always been one of my favorite games in the series, especially since it's so aesthetically similar to Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles in terms of theme and outright recycling character and monster models, and to its medieval fantasy predecessors like FF6. Behind its cutesy, super-deformed art style is a story focusing heavily on the death, the five stages of grief, and existentialism.\n\nThe PC/Android version has been partially remastered in the sense of updating the character models (not the backgrounds, unfortunately--rumor has it the original files were lost/could not be updated without being redone from scratch), FMV quality, the user interface, and adding some modifiers for different playstyles. The modifiers are especially great for people who aren't thrilled over a turn-based battle system but still want to experience the story. The updated graphics give the game a watercolor-esque sort of look at times reminiscent of Life is Strange and The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword's concept art. It's a nice touch, and there are new details on character models you can pick out that you probably weren't able to notice before on the Playstation. There are also a lot of optional sidequests and collect-a-thon elements for people who like doing completionist playthroughs, as well as some well-hidden scenarios that are fun to find on subsequent playthroughs.\n\nI would recommend this game to Final Fantasy vets and people unfamiliar with the series alike, especially if you're interested in existentialism and related subjects. The characters and soundtrack are a delight, and the NA translation is a shining example of localization even today. I never thought I would see the day that Final Fantasy 9 came to PC, but then it did, so call me a Genome's Uncle.","April 27","true","33.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is rich and so are the characters.

Most of us have had no problem with controllers working perfectly. Next, It does use the same UI as Android for the most part. IMO looks clean works well and the font is smooth and sharp. Next people are ♥♥♥♥♥ing about it not being 60 FPS....well the game came out when that wasnt a thing and the fps is tied to the movement of everything in game sooo it would look borderline ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ if you JUST move it to 60 fps without reworking the animations to fit. People are complaining about the music IMO sounds identical to the PS1 version if not better. The game is SQUARES best port thus far at first launch. Have had no problems at all.\n\nBasically people complain to complain. The game is fun and runs good and has some small extras in there. Easily worth the 16$ I paid. Heck I would have easily paid 40$ for it.\n\nBest idea is to watch a video of it being played and judge from there.\n.","April 14","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

My wireless xbox 360 controller works flawlessly with the game, at least so far. I also think the game looks amazing.

This works for me with my XBOX 1 controller, but I haven't experimented enough yet to make it work for my Dual Shock 4 while using the DS4Windows app. After doing a quick search, it's clear that I'm not the only one who had to fight with Zidane constantly moving left as soon as the game gives the player control.\n\nThis controller issue is another derpy performance from Square Enix, which I think many of us have come to expect, especially in their PC ports of classic Final Fantasy games. I enjoyed my playthrough of it back when it was originally released on the Playstation 1. Anyone looking for a more detailed review of the games content can easily find one with a quick online search.\n\nThe framerate is unfortunately locked at about 15-20 fps during battle and on the overworld map (though the damage / healing numbers strangely seem to be animated at about 30 fps over the slide show), but since this is how the game ran originally, I'm not going to hold it against my recommendation of this port.\n\nA few quick button presses from the start menu allow you to double the speed of the game, enable always full ATB/Trance/HP/MP, constant 9999 damage, or disable random encounters. The double speed is a nice way to counteract the slow pace of battle (there are frequent pauses between character and enemy turns that slow down the pace), and disabling random encounters will be nice for areas with weak enemies. A 1.5x speed option would have been nice since the 2x is so fast. The other 2 are cheats of course for those who can't handle a bit of challenge, just want to play around, or don't want to grind :)\n\nThe graphics are nicely done. The new character and enemy models have some extra detail on their textures, and I think there have a been a few more polygons added to the main characters. The movies have been very tastefully up-scaled to look good at a higher resolution. Environment backgrounds have been given a smoothing effect, which is an improvement, but not quite as nice as the character models. The text font looks sharp.\n\nI've heard some complaints about the menus, which were carried over from the mobile version. The layout of the menus doesn't bother me, but there is about a 1 second delay between each menu, which is only slightly irritating.\n\nOverall, this looks to be an adequate port of a once great game. In its current state, I'd recommend it to anyone who can get past the controller issues. Since that should include everyone who reads this review, I'd say buy it and enjoy :)\n","April 14","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Is it as bad as the other ports Squeenix has offered us in the past? Well I have good news for you all, it's actually fairly decent. FF9 was the game that really got me into gaming all those years ago, and having played the original more times then I can count I'd say this port is pretty decent.\n\nSome common complaints so far are: (1) It's battle interface being huge, (2) the game being a straight android port, (3) controller support being finicky and unpredictable, (4) bugs, (5) achievements not being locked if you use boosters.\nHere's how I've experienced these complaints so far:\n\n(1) The battle UI is a great deal bigger than it was on the Playstation, however it never really bothered me and I quickly got used to it. I thought I would hate this aspect of the new release, but it bothered me less than expected, and I must admit that having all the options available on one screen was sort of nice. Your milage may vary over whether or not this is a huge issue in your enjoyment of the game.\n\n(2) I can't tell you whether or not it's a straight port from mobile to PC, but it seems to have been adapted to fit the PC even if it's just in minor ways. Regardless of whether or not it is just the android version spiffed up, it seems to work really well on PC (and I'm still on windows 7, so it's not even necessary you have windows 10). The reason I think that it being the android version bothers people is because we all had to wait for 4 months while android users got it in January. That leads one to think that Square just wanted to milk the mobile release, even if that's not necessarily the truth. Anyway, it's still fully playable and feels like a PC experience, for anyone wondering.\n\n(3) I have yet to have a single problem with my Xbox controller. However several people have reported that there controllers are either too sensitive, make characters walk one side, or don't work. I have no idea why there seems to be problems for certain people, but keep in mind your controller may or may not work.\n\n(4) I'm at the very beginning of the game and have encountered one bug so far, when Zidane fights Boku for the first time. The screen stays black and won't continue to the fight screen. I fixed this by following a thread that said to put the contents of the x86 folder into the x64 folder. However I still sometimes have to pause and then unpause to get to the battle screen. Several other people are also affected by other bugs. Hopefully these will be fixed with time, but for now it's touch and go.\n\n(5) There are several boosters in the game that allow for infinite money, no encounters, etc. Using these boosters doesn't turn off the ability to gain achievements. So be aware of that if the importance of achievement legitimacy bothers you.\n\nHere's a list of the things the game does well:\n-Sprites and cutscenes look very nice and HD. You can finally see the details of the characters faces (and wonder in amazement at how you never knew x thing about that character model before because of the distortion). Some may find the blurriness of the backgrounds to be distracting when you have such HD sprites, but it didn't really bother me\n-Nice achievements and cards.\n-They haven't really changed the story or characters, the original game's integrity is still intact.\n-Music is a decent quality. Nothing exceptional, but they didn't completely butcher the sound quality.\n\ntldr: has some bugs, changes some of the UI, but is playable and still largely the same old FF9 we all remember.","April 15","true","22.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I do wish the backgrounds had been given the same HD treatment, but I can live with that. It would have required going back and redrawing hundreds of backgrounds, which would mean we wouldnt have had this awesome gem on Steam for several more months/years.\n\nSome users complain about the new UI, but I think its much easier took at, especially in full-screen 1080p. There is controller support and its fully customizable, but if you do customize it, the new keybinds only works past the Title screen. So any changes you make wont apply while on the Title screen.\nThis game also features the ability to just click with a mouse to make selections on the menu. Movement is still controlled on a keyboard otherwise. (or controller)\n\nIf you like turn based, JRPGs than look no further. This is one of the better Final Fantasies and one of the best JRPGs out there.

Personally I don't bother this and I think its now easier to manage around the map since things are more clear now.\n\nOn personal note, the only CON I can find in the game is that there is no Japanese option....

It became an obsession.\n\nAnd I must admit I got excited when it was released on Steam. This was the FF that I played most and enjoyed most so I immediately bought it.\n\nIt holds up incredibly well for what is now quite an old game. Good old fashioned turn-based combat and plenty to keep you occupied. If you're a fan of the final fantasy series you'll already be quite familiar with its appeal, and this classic drew me in all over again.\n\nIf you're not familiar, here is a basic rundown (no spoilers):\n\nYou control the main character, Zidane (or "Tailboy" as some of us may have called him...) along with the usual crowd of Mages and Warrior types. As you progress through the story you come across random battles and bosses, where you control a team of up to four in turn based combat mixing attacking, healing etc. There are skills unique to each character which makes it worth swapping the team around from your eventual pool of 8 characters. By equipping certain items you can learn more skills and both active and passive abilities to make your team ready for any challenge.\n\nThe story itself keeps you interested and makes you want to carry on long past the point you were planning to stop.\n\nAny downsides? I suppose the random battles can seem lengthy in loading and finishing so sometimes you may end up looking at your phone inbetween but generally I've found it to be rewarding replaying one of my favourite games.\n\nAlways worth having a guide handy to see little things you may have missed, the Chocobo side quest can be very rewarding (though grindy) and playing the card game can be good fun too.\n\nFor the money this is well worth it, and I feel far outshines the newer FF games.\n\nEdit: I thought I'd add - you will be humming certain tunes FOREVER","May 1","true","39.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm happy to say that wasn't the case.\n\nThe addition of the game boosters allow for more variety in playstyles, and generally speaking the graphics upgrade looks fantastic in the cinematic scenes. However, some backgrounds were scaled with less grace and frankly look a mess. Scenes where scene and character models collide suffer the worst and can seem pretty jarring (the scene near the start where Vivi is introduced is one of these - if you encounter it and think it's unbearable, turn back).\n\nThe addition of the mouse controls are interesting, but finnicky. The default keyboard controls are also weird imo, so if they bother you, hit "v" asap and switch them up to something more logical. The game does manage to switch fairly seemlessly betwen the mouse controls and the keyboard, though, which is nice.\n\nI'm pretty simple with my desires from ports - I want it to look good, sound great, and generally not interfere with my love of a classic game. Overall, I think this meets those criteria, and even adds in some bits which some may find good use for. I'm still early on, though, and will update if I encounter any inexcusable problems further down the line.","May 1","true","25.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I thought I would mention that though for the people looking to play this with one.\n\n- Graphics. For me, I don't care too much about the graphics. This is an older FF title so in today's standards the original didn't look all that pretty and I didn't buy this newer port expecting it to be either. But I will say the HD retouches on the cinematics made me giddier than a schoolgirl.\n\nWith all that out of the way I did thoroughly enjoy playing this on the PC and am not regretting the purchase.\n\nThis one also has some cheats in it like Fast Forward, Trance mode always-on and a few others that I forgot what they do. I personally think playing with most of them would ruin the game and so I didn't. I did however use the Fast Forward function while trecking the map... One thing I've always hated about RPG's is when they make you go to one end of the map and then walk all the way back, if I wanted to do that I would have bought something with a title like "Walking simulator 2016". The Fast Forward function was a beautiful way to get rid of that","April 17","true","26.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That said, this should prove to be no issue at all if you already love the game.\n\nAdditionally, if you want to use the cheats built into this version of FF9, you have to use the Function keys to toggle them.   As of this writing, the port developers haven't made that overly clear or self explanatory and it can be a bit unobvious if you don't know what to push to toggle them and don't know exactly what you're looking for to tell if they're on or off.\n\nPros: Excellent PC port with some graphical and gameplay updates from the original version.     Squaresoft was at the top of their game in the FF7/FF8/FF9 years, and FF9 is a worthy culmination of that era with a memorable cast of characters, an engaging and often heartwarming storyline as well as a great deal of potential challenge, secrets and an expansion on one of the most addictive collectible card based mini games I've ever encountered in an RPG.","April 26","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

PLUS, the booster to turn on 9999 damage is amazing for finally beating side bosses i never bothered with when i had to rely on save moogles exclusively.  (the game auto-saves every time you switch to a new scene, making boss battles infinitely easier to restart.)\n\nmy favorite thing tho has to be the clarity i can now see the cinematics with.  expressions are obvious and they make for some great screenshots. i am all about screenshots of this game and pretty much tap the capture button constantly, just so i can go back and admire the nuances that i never noticed before.  i'm probably going to do another playthrough just to finally get steiner's best weapon, since i can actually do that now with the speed-up booster and the no randoms.\n\nhonestly if you are a fan of ffix you owe it to yourself to buy this version.  if you're a final fantasy fan but havent played ffix yet, please do! it's one of the best, and it really shows you the heart of the franchise (imo).  i sincerely recommend this game to like everybody on planet earth, honestly!","April 27","true","32.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Behind its cutesy, super-deformed art style is a story focusing heavily on the death, the five stages of grief, and existentialism.\n\nThe PC/Android version has been partially remastered in the sense of updating the character models (not the backgrounds, unfortunately--rumor has it the original files were lost/could not be updated without being redone from scratch), FMV quality, the user interface, and adding some modifiers for different playstyles. The modifiers are especially great for people who aren't thrilled over a turn-based battle system but still want to experience the story. The updated graphics give the game a watercolor-esque sort of look at times reminiscent of Life is Strange and The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword's concept art. It's a nice touch, and there are new details on character models you can pick out that you probably weren't able to notice before on the Playstation. There are also a lot of optional sidequests and collect-a-thon elements for people who like doing completionist playthroughs, as well as some well-hidden scenarios that are fun to find on subsequent playthroughs.\n\nI would recommend this game to Final Fantasy vets and people unfamiliar with the series alike, especially if you're interested in existentialism and related subjects. The characters and soundtrack are a delight, and the NA translation is a shining example of localization even today. I never thought I would see the day that Final Fantasy 9 came to PC, but then it did, so call me a Genome's Uncle.","April 27","true","33.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Saving seems to work slightly differently to normal- you can save at moogles if you like, but the game autosaves at each new loadzone.

Even Hilda Garde was a better actress.\n\nPlaying Final Fantasy IX is like reading one of the best written novels, without the bother of reading.\n\nIf you ever want to escape from where you are and summon the childhood back to your doorstep, turn the page then.","April 29","true","51.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was really glad to see an HD version come to Steam. I liked the updated graphics and the ability to use the XBox 360 controller I bought specifically for PC gaming. There are cheats available in the Config menu, which can be helpful, although the game isn't too terribly challenging without them. I did, however, notice that sometimes I hit a wrong button which enabled some of them. This put a light icon on my screen, which I figured out meant that I had a certain cheat enable. I did manage to figure out how to disable it.\n\nIf you like Final Fantasy games, particularlly, this one, I strongly suggest this version of the game.","May 10","true","64.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

PLUS, the booster to turn on 9999 damage is amazing for finally beating side bosses i never bothered with when i had to rely on save moogles exclusively.  (the game auto-saves every time you switch to a new scene, making boss battles infinitely easier to restart.)\n\nmy favorite thing tho has to be the clarity i can now see the cinematics with.  expressions are obvious and they make for some great screenshots. i am all about screenshots of this game and pretty much tap the capture button constantly, just so i can go back and admire the nuances that i never noticed before.  i'm probably going to do another playthrough just to finally get steiner's best weapon, since i can actually do that now with the speed-up booster and the no randoms.\n\nhonestly if you are a fan of ffix you owe it to yourself to buy this version.  if you're a final fantasy fan but havent played ffix yet, please do! it's one of the best, and it really shows you the heart of the franchise (imo).  i sincerely recommend this game to like everybody on planet earth, honestly!","April 27","true","32.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ragingrazmataz/recommended/377840/","ragingrazmataz","holy shit is that kurt cobain","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ragingrazmataz/","162 products in account","FF9 has always been one of my favorite games in the series, especially since it's so aesthetically similar to Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles in terms of theme and outright recycling character and monster models, and to its medieval fantasy predecessors like FF6. Behind its cutesy, super-deformed art style is a story focusing heavily on the death, the five stages of grief, and existentialism.\n\nThe PC/Android version has been partially remastered in the sense of updating the character models (not the backgrounds, unfortunately--rumor has it the original files were lost/could not be updated without being redone from scratch), FMV quality, the user interface, and adding some modifiers for different playstyles. The modifiers are especially great for people who aren't thrilled over a turn-based battle system but still want to experience the story. The updated graphics give the game a watercolor-esque sort of look at times reminiscent of Life is Strange and The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword's concept art. It's a nice touch, and there are new details on character models you can pick out that you probably weren't able to notice before on the Playstation. There are also a lot of optional sidequests and collect-a-thon elements for people who like doing completionist playthroughs, as well as some well-hidden scenarios that are fun to find on subsequent playthroughs.\n\nI would recommend this game to Final Fantasy vets and people unfamiliar with the series alike, especially if you're interested in existentialism and related subjects. The characters and soundtrack are a delight, and the NA translation is a shining example of localization even today. I never thought I would see the day that Final Fantasy 9 came to PC, but then it did, so call me a Genome's Uncle.","April 27","true","33.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Hopefully, this will get a patch soon to resolve that.\n\nEDIT (5/2/2016 ~ 37h+ playtime): All the issues I had seem to be fixed.

I can't say that IX is definitively the best, but it's definitely up there as far as quality games in the series goes, and for a good reason.\n\nThe story is one of the best I've ever seen in a JRPG. All of the characters are lovable and hard to forget. My personal favorite is Vivi, the young Black Mage. Without spoiling too much, he goes through a lot of difficult things, mostly existential, and if you're anything like me it will probably make you cry.\n\nThe graphics are wonderful, even to this day, although the character models have been upgraded. There are complaints about how the backgrounds are blurry, and well, they are. But when you're focusing on playing the game you kind of don't notice after a while. The FMVs are beautiful looking for a game that came out on the PS1.\n\nThe battle system is great, still using the ATB system like the older games in the franchise. This means you can choose to be active to fight in real time, or you can wait, which lets you go through menus for items and magic. There's also Trance, which lets your character become stronger for a short period of time. Abilities are given based on what items you equip, each of them having different effects in battle.\n\nTo those wondering, this game isn't stretched to be fullscreen, because it will still show grey borders at the sides. I have it on 1366x768 and it still shows the borders. I personally don't care, but some people might be turned off by it.\n\nOverall, this game is amazing, and if you consider yourself a JRPG fan you would be doing yourself a favor by playing it. I feel like the price is a little too high right now, though, even for such a great game. When it goes on sale, it's a definite purchase.","May 5","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The soundtrack is just as good as you remember it being.

The return to rigid jobs (classes) among the characters brings the series back to its roots while also incorporating what made the later games (such as ff7) so great.\n\nI'd recommend this game to anyone that is a fan of JRPGs.","May 6","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Loved the accessibility of the port.\n\nJust a few things that irked me about Kuja's char model updates, FMV sound, graphical, and text issues listed below.\n\n\nI played to see the updated character models for Kuja and his higher res cutscenes. During the fmv scene on the end of  disk 3 the sound crackled and popped and went silent every few seconds. This also happened during Bahamut attacking Kuja at Iifa Tree, and a few other scenes.\n\nThe sound overall in the game comes across flat in this port, as other's mentioned. Lacking depth. Kinda like a lack of depth perception but auditorially. It's all on the same plane. Was not like that in PSX original.\n\nDuring the endgame char epilogues the last few words of their lines of text kept cutting off. And during the I Want To Be Your Canary performance, at the end of the credits, the auto advancing dialogue went way too fast.\n\nThe worst and most distracting element was that it looks like Kuja had female breasts. It's not there in the FMVS but his normal character model shows him as having a really bulky chest or it's boobs. I don't remmember seeing this in the original. It probably was too low res to show clearly back then. But I found it very awkward since in FMVs his chest if flat.  Got nothing wrong with him having breasts it's just so random, and unexpected, and seems more like a glitch in the model.\n\nAnd Kuja looks like yoda sometimes due to a texture on his forhead when he's injured. I couldn't take the scenes seriously because of it.\n\nKuja's outfit also looks less sleek and sinistely angular. His silhouette reads a bit awkwardly round and not threatening at all in this version. His sleeves are yellow while his skirt is white and this is inconsistent throughout. Sometimes being white and other times yellow.\n\nLots of invisible faces on character models and monsters when the camera is too close, faces as in poligonal sides being invisible. And some seams look broken like with Freya's tail- made it look cut in two a the end.\n\nHad the running to the right and down  issue on controller but after rebooting pc, game, and plugging the controller in after the game was up and then fighting the movement's wanted to go down by trying to make zidane run up and left I got it to unstick the movement.\n\nTreasure chests not hidden behind background elements properly.\n\nThat's the stuff I managed to pick out.\n\nI love being able to see Freya's eyes! I NEVER knew her eye color. She always looked like a cyclops. Now I can amke out what the other hybrid people look like. I love LOVE the higher res char models. Eiko used to annoy me to death but now that I can actually SEE her and the rest of the cast- they finally, really grew on me. Cried so many times, goofy smiles. pure delighted smiles, laughter, embarassment, cheering them on.  Spent so much time guessing if the vertex lurching in the original was an emote or not and missed so much of the characters my other play throughs. They really came alive for me this time. Best play through ever.\n\nBEST","May 2","true","33.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I used to overlook ff9 as the character design looks childish as compared to ff7 and 8, and though this is the first time im playing ff9, the story plot and the gameplay actually rock hard! I was really surprised and enjoy the game alot! Must play if you really dig into FF series","May 12","true","38.2"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

They have indeed improved on the character models, but the backgrounds and some FMVs really do lack the same finessee. If I had to say, I would say it's down to SquareEnix's "quantity over quality" style as of late.\n\nIt's still a good game though. Let's hope they give the developers a little more time to work on the backgrounds.\n\nBuy it if you like Final Fantasy, don't if you want a graphical wonder.\n\n","May 12","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However if you're part of the new generation of gamers today and never played FFIX (or any PS1 games), chances are you'll find some eye glaring flaws that we oldtimers didn't noticed back then.\n\nJust so people know, FFIX is arguably one of the best JRPG ever. Not my favourite JRPG but I can see why other people loved it so much. Just remember the generation gap this game has before buying.","April 30","true","43.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm happy to say that wasn't the case.\n\nThe addition of the game boosters allow for more variety in playstyles, and generally speaking the graphics upgrade looks fantastic in the cinematic scenes. However, some backgrounds were scaled with less grace and frankly look a mess. Scenes where scene and character models collide suffer the worst and can seem pretty jarring (the scene near the start where Vivi is introduced is one of these - if you encounter it and think it's unbearable, turn back).\n\nThe addition of the mouse controls are interesting, but finnicky. The default keyboard controls are also weird imo, so if they bother you, hit "v" asap and switch them up to something more logical. The game does manage to switch fairly seemlessly betwen the mouse controls and the keyboard, though, which is nice.\n\nI'm pretty simple with my desires from ports - I want it to look good, sound great, and generally not interfere with my love of a classic game. Overall, I think this meets those criteria, and even adds in some bits which some may find good use for. I'm still early on, though, and will update if I encounter any inexcusable problems further down the line.","May 1","true","25.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The card game is alot of fun and I'm still working on getting better at it.\n\nI will say this game has some very heart felt moments.(There was a few tears for me)\n\nCombat can seems a little slow at times. But there is lots to do.\n\nAdvice:\nWill say that, you will need to grind out levels fairly frequently.\nLeveling all your characters will help in the long run.\nExploring the map will be useful.","May 1","true","44.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It became an obsession.\n\nAnd I must admit I got excited when it was released on Steam. This was the FF that I played most and enjoyed most so I immediately bought it.\n\nIt holds up incredibly well for what is now quite an old game. Good old fashioned turn-based combat and plenty to keep you occupied. If you're a fan of the final fantasy series you'll already be quite familiar with its appeal, and this classic drew me in all over again.\n\nIf you're not familiar, here is a basic rundown (no spoilers):\n\nYou control the main character, Zidane (or "Tailboy" as some of us may have called him...) along with the usual crowd of Mages and Warrior types. As you progress through the story you come across random battles and bosses, where you control a team of up to four in turn based combat mixing attacking, healing etc. There are skills unique to each character which makes it worth swapping the team around from your eventual pool of 8 characters. By equipping certain items you can learn more skills and both active and passive abilities to make your team ready for any challenge.\n\nThe story itself keeps you interested and makes you want to carry on long past the point you were planning to stop.\n\nAny downsides? I suppose the random battles can seem lengthy in loading and finishing so sometimes you may end up looking at your phone inbetween but generally I've found it to be rewarding replaying one of my favourite games.\n\nAlways worth having a guide handy to see little things you may have missed, the Chocobo side quest can be very rewarding (though grindy) and playing the card game can be good fun too.\n\nFor the money this is well worth it, and I feel far outshines the newer FF games.\n\nEdit: I thought I'd add - you will be humming certain tunes FOREVER","May 1","true","39.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
