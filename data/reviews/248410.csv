"http://steamcommunity.com/id/unaccounted4/recommended/248410/","unaccounted4","Unaccounʇed4","http://steamcommunity.com/id/unaccounted4/","650 products in account","Legends of Aethereus first reared its ugly head over the Linux crowd around May 2013. At first it was just an exclusive Beta version for the Kickstarter backers. Eventually though, ThreeGates realised the money they had gotten out of their Kickstarter wasn’t enough; $35,554 out of the $25000 they were originally looking for. Over ten grand above their original goal and they still felt like they needed to sell Beta entries for $30. That was when the first red flag was hoisted in my head.\n\nWith the promise of a large scope Action RPG on Linux, I chose to ignore that first warning. Silly me!\n\nYou see, having used Linux since 2005, I’ve seen plenty of platformers, first-person shooters and even strategy games running natively. Role playing games on the other hand, there were close to none. Off the top of my head, the biggest profile RPG back then was Sacred (published by the now defunct Linux Game Publishing). Don’t get me wrong! That amalgam of bugs, which Ascaron Entertainment stubbornly kept calling a game, was actually pretty damn fun. To this day, I still fire it up once in a blue moon and lose myself in the isometric world of Ancaria for a couple of days. Then the nostalgia wears off and the critic in me just wants to tear some people’s limbs off.\n\nLegends of Aethereus was set to be the Linux incarnation of a great action RPG, until you actually got to play it. If you’re a regular follower of our LGC Weekly podcast, you probably already know where this is going. ThreeGate’s debut game was (up to this point) the sole Unity 3D game that got an average score of 1 Lawn Chair, using LGC’s brutal review system. If the Lawn Chairs don’t mean jack to you, IGN gave it a 2.5/5, Destructoid gave it 3/10 and the Metacritic page reveals that there are no positive critical reviews of the game. None! Not a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ single professional reviewer could bring himself to justify a score above average.\n\nIt’s that bad! When a Unity game runs like ♥♥♥ on an NVidia GTX 770 paired with an Octo-core AMD 8150 processor and these are backed by two SSDs in YOL0 RAID, you’re doing something wrong… on purpose! There is absolutely no excuse, after 6 months, to have the game in such a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ state.\n\nI have actually been in the testing team for the past 2 months. I’ve submitted a total of 6 bug reports and out of those, only 3 got a reply. Personally, I ran into a bug that caused the game’s gamma to be constantly set somewhere in between pitch dark and the bottom of the Mariana Trench. It took their Linux dev around a month and a half to actually bother to reply and you know what he asked? “Is this with the open-source or proprietary drivers? Steam recommends you use fglrx 13.11.” - You don’t ♥♥♥♥ing say?! (This happens with both, fyi.)\n\nThe one bug they actually acknowledged was the Steam Achievements not unlocking when they did in-game. Let me tell you what their fix involves; you need to copy the libsteam_api.so library the game provides into your OS’s /usr/lib folder. They basically want you to introduce a third party proprietary library into a system wide folder, for the sake of doing something 200 other Steam games already do without it. They’re basically asking you to introduce what amounts to an exploitable backdoor to a system wide folder. ♥♥♥♥! Right! Off!\n\nIt doesn’t end there, though. Remember those other three bugs they never even replied to? Those are the random freezes that happen regardless of what’s going on, the mouse lerping bug that caused mouse input to go haywire and the stupid mouse sensitivity bug that would progressively make the mouse more and more sensitive over time. I don’t know about you, but to me those are some game breaking bugs or at least they toss any immersion you may have at that point right out the window.\n\nThere is absolutely no ♥♥♥♥ing excuse for a game riddled with this kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to be allowed on the Steam store. It isn’t in Early Access anymore and it doesn’t have a warning about the Alpha state the game currently is in!\n\nThat, ladies and gentlemen, is False Advertising. Some of you may argue the contrary, to those of you who do I give you the legal definition: “Any advertising or promotion that misrepresents the nature, characteristics, qualities or geographic origin of goods, services or commercial activities". They’re charging $30 for a game which, according to its store page, works under Linux. When technically it does little else than cause players endless frustration and a recurring stream of refund requests.\n\nWe all know Valve is pretty lax when it comes to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games on their Steam store, but come on! This piece of junk is bleeding $30 out of unsuspecting purchasers. It’s an overpriced scam under the guise of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game.\n\nThis is the part where I’d drop the mic but I can’t afford the risk it’ll break after spending money on this game.","November 26, 2013","false","9.2"," 298 of 366 people (81%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","81","298","366","7","10"

Based on what I saw, it looked promising. I played a little bit of the beta, and liked where it was going, but now it appears to have stopped going anywhere. I made a mistake, one that I'll learn from in this new age of crowd funded Indie games, but I'll get to that in a moment.\n\nFirst, I don't think was a scam, even if I do think continuing to sell it might be. I think the developers actually did have every intention of fully developing this product, you can see that by the work that went into the product as it exists. But, the developers made a mistake themselves early on that more or less doomed the project.\n\nMy mistake was not checking the history of the game, seeing how it was funded, and what that looked like. Turns out it was a crowd funded game, and upon further investigation they appear to have not ask for nearly enough cash to keep the project going. That is only my opinion, but the stated goals are fairly ambitious for $35K in funding.\n\nI'm sad it didn't come to fruition and wish the developers the best in their future endeavors. Because, I imagine that this was even more disappointing to them than it was to the supporters.","December 23, 2014","false","0.8"," 39 of 47 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","39","47","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/recommended/248410/","fandango89","Apparently Kid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/","599 products in account","I will start this off by saying I am not one of the dozens of butthurt kickstarter backers that are giving this game negative reviews. I also was not dumb enough to pay 30 dollars for this game, a ridiculous asking price. It is well known that the game makers completely abandoned this game almost right away, so points off for that. While this game has all the working pieces of an RPG, very few things are done right. You start off in this cool looking hub town on the water. Unfortunately it is basically empty, with a blacksmith, a few quest givers, a trainer, and a lot of hollow empty space. The graphics of the game are good for such an indie team. I did have regularly random stuttering later in the game, that got annoying. Also it is nice how different enemies can attack each other, which you don't see in many games. Also, you can build statues in the city, including ones of yourself, but too bad there are only 3 total sculptures to choose from. You have an apartment, of which there is basically nothing to do besides change the wallpaper. The game also has decent playtime. That is where all the positives end.\n\nLets start with combat. Enemies can knock you over and stuck lock you, as well as auto hit you with abilities. The kick button is useless as enemies get right back up and you do no damage. The block and parry both don’t really work, but the computer has no problem using them. They also can use super overpowered elemental attacks, like venom, that are way better than others, as it hits you for damage over time for like 10 seconds, messes with your vision, and drains all stamina and energy (yeah that seems fair). Then every time you use a rifle to attack, you have to reload between each shot. There are 2 2-handed weapons, 2 guns, and 2 1-handed weapons. The models never change, and nothing else is ever introduced. Attacking with melee attacks you constantly go through people and it doesn’t hit them.\n\nThe abilities are bad. It looks like you have a huge skill tree, but its really like 5 abilities, and you can just continue to get more elemental variations of the same attack, which you do for each attack. This also doesn’t work with the toolbar because it only supports about 7, and just 1 ability takes up the whole thing. It isn’t clear the difference in damage or whatever else between different elements. There are only 2 classes. My guy had a bunch of abilities that did the same thing, such as bombs, satchels, lanterns, rockets, grenades, so getting multiple of the same ability called something else doesn’t help. Needed more variety. Also my turrets would constantly shoot over guys and attack guys far away, instead of those standing right in front of them. Using abilities for some reason CONSUMES RESOURCES. Yes it is as dumb as it sounds. So if you don’t pick up enough of 1 resource or run out, you can’t use them anymore.\n\nGuys don’t drop any weapons. They only drop crafting materials. This makes killing guys boring because just crafting 1 thing requires like 600 of materials, something I couldn’t get with over 15 hours in the game. This means you don’t ever care what you get, because you usually get low level crafting stuff you don’t need, and if you do get a good resource you know you need tons of it so it doesn’t matter. Also there are tons of different color variations of the same resource, meaning your gathering will be split and you won’t get enough of anything. Also crafting things requires 2 different types of materials, meaning you can have enough of 1 type but still not be able to craft it because you don't have enough of the other. You cannot buy new weapons and armor, as the starting vendor weapons never upgrade. This causes you to switch weapons and armor 1-2 times during the entire game, yup it sucks that much. Since vendors never upgrade money is worthless besides buying a few materials. I had 300000k and nothing to spend it on.\n\nThen there are the quests. There is no feasible story or anything. You basically get random quests with no cohesion. I had no idea what the main quest was as it was never labeled. Then I would stop getting quests from the main quest giver and then after doing other side quests I would suddenly get more quests from her again. The environments are super repetitive. Each quest you run around 1 of 3 total places: a swamp, a forest, or an underground cave. They use the EXACT same textures and layouts from all the previous levels over and over (you will notice 1 above ground cave used 20 times). All of the environments are super big and super empty and full of nothing. But every quest makes you run for 10 min through these empty big environments just to waste time, instead of getting to anything good. There are difficulty settings for each quest, but choosing a harder or easier one doesn't change the rewards at all, which means it is useless. Boss fights are boring as the guys are the same models as the other enemies just with more health and a name attached to them.\n\nLets not forget about health. First off, when you get hurt you lose total health, and you can only heal a certain point of your health with berries, meaning you keep losing health with each hit even if you heal (yeah stupid). Using healing things make you stand in one place to get hit more, instead of making sense (hate when games do that). The game thinks it’s an MMO, because even in single player you cannot pause the game for some reason, and there is no saving. If you die during a quest you have to restart the entire thing. Funny though because multiplayer no longer works, as you can’t join a game, invite a friend to play privately, or anything. The bland repetitive level design and quests of fetch/kill are MMO like though. The enemies suck too. There are about 10 total different enemy models, but you will only fight 4-5 of them throughout the entire game. This, combined with mission and level design, make every level feel the exact same. Just move along. 5/10.","June 28, 2015","false","18.5"," 33 of 39 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","33","39","0","0"

However I bought it for the full price on their website shortly hereafter - only because of Linux support.\n\nAt that time Legends of Æthereus was in an alpha state and hardly playable on my hardware at that time. I did manage to get the initial feel and concept of where the game was heading, and I promised to return when some of the more game-breaking bugs was fixed and I upgraded my hardware.\n\nFast forward 3 months and I had finally purchased up to date hardware and decided to give Legends of Æthereus another go.\n\nI was overwhelmed with the progress there was made with the game in that short period of time, and most of the worst bugs had been fixed and my newer hardware made the game playable.\n\nWhile Legends of Æthereus is not complete yet, and by all means a diamond in the rough. ThreeGates manages to have something that many developers lack: a constructive dialogue with the community. They truly want to better this game in every aspect, and they listen to the community - you are not just playing a game you purchased at a lower price in some Steam sale, you are a part of the game.\n\nI do understand why some people gives Legends of Æthereus bad reviews, because if you're looking for a complete and finished game, this is not for you.\nIf you're looking for an ARPG where you don't need to immerse yourself too deeply in the game, this is not for you.\nIf you're in dire need of a replacement for another game, this is not for you.\n\nHowever, if you want a game you can actively help make better, Legends of Æthereus is for you.\nIf you want a game where combat requires thought and technique, Legends of Æthereus is for you.\nIf you want a game that will continue to improve, Legends of Æthereus is for you.\n\nOne feature I particularly like, is the Quest system. You can selectively go back and play any previous quest on any difficulty.\nAnother thing I do enjoy is the Arena. It has two modes, one for beginners and one for experienced players - both equally fun when you get a hang of the combat system.\n\nWhich brings me towards something else I enjoy by Legends of Æthereus; the combat system.\nUsually in ARPG's, you select your target and the character will automatically engage the enemy, or you point a direction and click your mouse. In Legends of Æthereus you actively have to block, dodge and attack each time immersing you in the combat, pressing different combinations of keys while attacking to use another attack vector.\n\nAnother thing about Legends of Æthereus, is the crafting system. While it is not complex it does offer some diversity, and customizability using resources gathered throughout the planes of Æthereus.\n\nI do really enjoy playing Legends of Æthereus, and I hope others will come to have the same passion for this game as I have. I've already tracked 100+ hours in the non-Steam version - and plan to do the same in the Steam version.\n\nEach storyline can be completed in about 6-8 hours based on your skills. But there are also randomly generated quests if you just want to walk around and enjoy the scenery. Last but not least, you can always engage in some co-op with your friends, or beat them to smithereens in the Arena.\n\nShould you buy this game?\nYes, at some point you should give Legends of Æthereus a try - if you want a polished game, you should wait.\nIf you're in doubt, grab it while it's on sale and dedicate time to play through one of the storylines, and tell your friends how it was.\nIf not, at least pop it into your wishlist and come back to it later.\n\nIf you enjoy being a part of a games process and progress, and don't mind a couple of bugs here and there, buy it this instant.\n\nI genuinely enjoy playing Legends of Æthereus, and I highly recommend this game.\n\nEnjoy","December 3, 2013","true","26.6"," 77 of 118 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","77","118","2","6"

Unfortunately, the final impression was pretty underwhelming. Legends of Aethereus isn't a bad game, but it's not that good either. For me, this title fell into the mediocre category pretty quickly.\n\nPros:\n\nI loved the environments. While not too highly detailed, they were well fleshed out and large. I especially enjoyed the forest areas with all of the greenery and lush vegetation.\n\nThe character growth features a nice system where there are six main attributes sectioned into three pairs and displayed on progression bars. Each attribute has a complementary one on the bar that prevents you from maxing out every stat. For example: filling up the strength/agility bar with points in strength prevents your character from being agile. It's a nice system that allows for specialization instead of overpowered characters.\n\nThe skill trees are also quite large and feature a lot of skills to obtain and expand upon.\n\nCons:\n\nWhile the environments were well-made, the character and costume models, unfortunately, were not. Character textures are flat and dull with the characters themselves not being pretty lifeless. I suppose it's just a gripe of mine, but I would've expected a bit more detail on the character models considering how much better the environments look.\n\nThe fighting engine is quite simple. The game's website boasts of a physics-based fighting system, but so far in my playthrough, combat just boiled down to dodging to the side and swinging  your weapon (I've only played a melee character, so ranged attacks might be different). Enemies aren't that bright, either. They'll detect you and then just perform one attack the majority of the time.\n\nRegarding enemies, there are some areas where they spawn indefinitely. It can get pretty frustrating when attempting to pick up a quest item or some loot and enemies keep on coming. Most of the time, there isn't a musical change that signals an attack, so you can get surprised from time to time. It's not that big of an issue, but I get the impression that unlimited waves of enemies were used to create tension, but they instead end up being a point of frustration.\n\nQuests are extremely simple. So far, everything I've experienced has basically been: go to a certain place, fight some enemies, get an item or wait out an attack, then return and collect your reward.\n\nCrafting is also simple with few different armor models. Most of the armor looks the same with maybe an extra texture or armor piece added. Though I've only seen the Tier I armor and weapons and tiers II and III may have more different kinds.\n\nAll in all, I wanted to like Legends of Aethereus as it seemed like a good entry in the adventure-RPG genre, but it turned out to be quite underwhelming. It's good if you want something quick to do, but at this point, that's about it. Perhaps the developer is working on more content and updating the gameplay engines somewhat, but until that happens, I would say to hold off on it.","August 14, 2014","false","5.5"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","11","15","0","0"

The graphics are nice. The combat is complex and creative. There's lots of skills and abilities to choose from when leveling up. Customization is all over the place, from your character to your your gear to your city. And I think the setting is a nice deviation from the standard "everything is magic" fantasy genre fare. And most importantly, there's loot everywhere, especially with the newest Arena update.\n\nThe AI needs work. I can plant turrets with my inventor and watch enemies stand frozen, apparently unsure of what to do, or watch them climb on top of my turrets and sit there like vegetables. On that note, the turret AI needs work, too. Most games have turrets that aim in such a way as to HIT enemies.\n\nThe biggest problem, though, is that it's VERY poorly optimized. I have a very high spec computer, and even at the lowest graphical settings with nothing running in the background the game lagged like crazy whenever 5 or more enemies were nearby. Furthermore, the loading times are absurd, and even after the absurd loading times, the levels stutter as you move through them.\n\nI picked it up on sale in a bundle, and I suppose if you had to play it, I'd recommend doing that. And be careful not to get too close to a crowd of enmies when playing hardcore, or you'll be forced to watch a slideshow of your character dying horribly and losing all your progress.","February 24, 2014","true","22.9"," 21 of 37 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","21","37","0","0"

Do quests handed out in the hub city.  Marvel at the gorgeous art design, then feel dissappointed at the lack of opportunities for interaction.  Buy and sell crafting material and weapons and armour at traders.  Or craft weapons and armour at the blacksmith (crafting material can also be collected during quests).  Play one of two classes - one focused on brute strength and the other one deploying devices (e.g. mines, turrets, etc.).  Develop special moves (called a skill tree in-game, but it really isn't).  Use a complicated but accessible combat system in satisfying combat against (admittedly cookie-cutter) foes.  Play with up to three friends.  Enter your character(s) in the arena to earn more gold and materials.  Outfit your apartment (a feature that isn't fully developed at the moment).  Generally have fun (yes!).  Be amazed at the game's potential.  Then visit the forums (or do that before buying) and lament the lack of updates.\n\nYes, Legends of Aethereus has been responsible for its fair share of controversy amongst RPG fans.\n\nMy first impressions were very favourable.  Following about twenty hours of play I drew up a long list of suggestions for improving LoA, but then decided to wait for a (claimed to be coming soon by the developers) mega update before posting it.  Now it's been a year and we've heard nothing from the developers aside from their asking for participants in a secret testing programme.\n\nTo dispell a common myth, this game was never in Early Access.  In other words, Legends of Aethereus was sold as a complete product.  Heck, there's even a deluxe boxed version (containing two keys);  nothing on the box says anything about the game being unfinished or undercooked (unlike for example the boxed version of another RPG, Krater, which makes it clear that the game has missing features, to be patched in at a later date).\n\nThere is an ending - meaning you can play through the story from start to finish.  Many of the technical issues relate to the game running on Unity (notoriously buggy and resource hungry), and that's unfortunate, but it's also too late (obviously) to move the thing to a different engine.\n\nThe many problems include:\n\n- quest objects spawning inside environmental objects (i.e. scenery)\n- it being massively difficult to hit enemies when fighting on a sloped environment (i.e. you and enemies being on different elevations)\n- enemies floating above the ground or being too short (meaning your sword doesn't automatically hit them unless you use a specific move)\n- the hub city looking great but being largely non-interactive\n- the useless player apartment feature\n- the skill tree not being a real skill tree at all, but rather a list of special moves which consume resources that need to be collected in the world\n- technical issues like long loading times, random drops in frame rate and the game generally being a bit choppy\n\nThe quest environments feel a bit empty but they are gorgeous to look at.  You never collect gear, as in other RPGs.  Instead the game has you collecting the resources with which to craft gear.  These resources are dropped by enemies or collected from treasure chests.  These rarely tend to be hidden and thus the game doesn't really give you any reason to explore.  Even if you do explore, beyond admiring the scenery there really isn't much to find or do outside of following the list of simple commands constituting your quest -- almost always a case of following a linear path until you get to a location where you either have to pick up a quest item or kill a certain character (or monster).  This aspect of the game feels "cookie cutter", to use a cliche, and many others have remarked on it also.\n\nPlaying the game you'll be exposed to copious amounts of text, likely enough to constitute a fairly thick fantasy novel.  But for all that lore most of it reads like gibberish, or, in my opinion, isn't contextualised or interesting enough to lift the narrative beyond the uninteresting quest structure, which really mires it down and made me skip through most of it.\n\nThe problem of uninteresting environments extends to the main hub city.  There are many locations within the city which were clearly meant to be built upon, but since the game has for all practical reasons been abandoned never will be.\n\nHaving said that, the hub city is the location of a cute little meta-game where you use the resources you would normally use for crafting weapons and armour to craft statues of yourself (or enemies), which you can place throughout the city.  Just imagine inviting your friends over to your game and showing off your many heroic poses cast in shiny platinum.\n\nI've mentioned that there are currently two classes, namely Officer and Inventor.  The former is more focused on brute strength and the latter on deploying gadgets.  Both classes use exactly the same weapons and armour.  The differences come down to the available skills (or special moves), which consume their own resources and will thus likely not be used very often.\n\nA developer posted that they were going to add a mage questline (you'll notice the mage guild location cannot currently be accessed), which would among other things allow you to play as a magic user.  Unfortunately, as we now know, that update never came (and probably never will).  Even more unfortunately, the developers have since LoA's release been working on a series of simplistic mobile games for phones and tablets.  That's a real shame, considering the obvious talent employed there.\n\nNow ...\n\nPerhaps you have been left thinking:  "With all that I've just read, how can this review be marked as RECOMMENDING the game?"\n\nIt's simple -- Legends of Aethereus is one of the most addictive RPGs I've played in years.  It is absolutely a slimmed down, cut-the-fat sort of role playing game.  You get in, sign up for a quest, travel to the quest location, kill some enemies, get some loot (i.e. this game's version of loot which is resources for crafting), go back, turn in the quest, craft some new gear, rinse and repeat.  The combat is for the most part satisfying.  The environments look great.  Each and every mission can be replayed as many times as you like, and at any of three difficulty levels.  (The game notes which missions you've completed and at which difficulty level.)\n\nThere is little depth to the experience.  There is also little pretention.  The game knows what it is.  There is an effort to pad out proceedings with a grand narrative, but as it's almost all in the form of walls of text, it is easily ignored.\n\nLegends of Aethereus is all just as you see it.  Right there.  Right now.  You can boot it up, play for as long as you like, quit the game, it'll save your progress.  And later you can come back for more.  That is rare, people.\n\nIn a market where almost every PC RPG tries to be like another PC RPG, only outdoing it in the size and grandeur of its cinematics, here you have something that is truly refreshing, hugely playable, and although lacking in content and polish, a game that offers escapism in spades.  Escapism being, I believe, one of the main reasons why we play games in the first place.\n\nSome may disagree, some may agree, please feel free to leave a comment.  And if one of the developers read this, please do the same.  I'd love to hear from you guys.\n\nThe manual can be downloaded at the following link.  Please do so if you havn't already.  This review is for all intents and purposes an opinion piece.  The manual will give you more information on the actual systems and the two classes currently available.\n\nhttp://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/248410/manuals/LoA_PlayerGuide.pdf?t=1390752252\n\nPS. Change the camera to Middle;  I found the game almost unplayable with the Left and Right camera settings.","February 18, 2015","true","29.8"," 25 of 45 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","25","45","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spaghyeti/recommended/248410/","spaghyeti","Yeti","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spaghyeti/","474 products in account","I'm going to start off with this is a fun game. The combat I find well done, but still a little clunky. It constists of a lot of blocking, parrying, and dodging. There's a decent variety of enemies and they are creative and fun to fight, and a bit of a challenge with the flank-loving AI. The graphics are pretty nice, and the mission setup is kinda cool. The weapon/armor creation and customization is really fun to toy with and create new things for first few hours. Character customization isn't all that bad either, and the armor and weapons look nice aethestically. I found it fun for a few hours, a bit more with the easy set up Co-op with a friend. Lastly, this game is not dead. The devs are still working on it, and may end up changing or fixing what I have mentioned. It has recieved a few patches since purchase.\n\nOn to the cons for Legends of Aethereus. The skill tree is mediocore. It looks very vast, but it consists of a few skills with just a bunch of shallow upgrades. The skills themselves aren't very interesting either. The map seems quite small, and many different areas reuse very large chunks of terrains and models, and makes many areas seem very very similar. The weapon and armor creation seems vast at first, but I later realized it's quite simple and a bit shallow. You run out of things to make fast, and Crafting is the only way to find decent weapons and armor. It consists of making the same things over and over, but just changing the material it is made out of, to make it more effective. The game is very buggy and poorly optimized. There are memory leaks that can bring even great systems to its knees over time which can really kill the experience. The game overall has a cheap feel, which is to be expected with a small studio indie game.\n\nTl;DR - Personally, I would not recommend the game. There is fun to be had, and I'm sure there are people out there who would enjoy this game. There are, however, flaws,bugs, and lack of depth in the game that should be pointed out and considered before throwing $30 on this game.","December 13, 2013","false","10.3"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","12","20","0","0"

My thoughts are with a friend, this game is great fun. While I imagine solo would get boring fast for most people, having a friend to kick around like a football, fight a bunch of christmas elves, mock the aethetics (nobody is wearing pants), and enjoy the games many glitches with, this game is brilliant.\n\nIt seems to be a poorly made game but not so poorly made that it can't be played. The games design seems to be ambitious, and co-op play was very quick and painless to set up and enjoy. The thing I really like about this game is it feels like the old school RPG's that just don't seem to be coming out all that much. You do quests for part of some generic story in order to earn loot, its good and simple fun with a friend and if you have one friend or a group to play with, i'd highly recommend it for $1. In fact I may buy a few more copies for friends later.","March 18, 2014","true","7.8"," 20 of 36 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","20","36","0","0"

It'll give you pretty much the same mechanics, just with smoother combat, better crafting, vendors that can actually upgrade your equipment, intuitive character stats, a simpler damage/armor system, and Vindictus just generally does everything better.\n\nLong version: This is probably the worst game I've played that wasn''t outright broken like Hydrophobia. The easiest way to get me to stop playing your game is to have terrible combat for the genre, and this game completely misses the mark, being at least 3 steps worse than the standard Bethesda combat, which is the stiffest I had seen before buying this game. My recommendation for Vindictus is because that's the closest game I can think of to this, although comparing it to this game is an insult to said MMO. The combat is done the same way, just minus any combos, smooth character movement, or any real combat quality whatsoever. The crafting system has potential, but the materials seem to have essentially no drop pattern whatsoever, thus rendering any chance of being able to make something GOOD for your level entirely up to chance. The quest system, and transportation to the areas for the quests is what made me first think of Vindictus, and this seems to be the only part of the game done with any actual quality, since it does something Vindictus DOESN'T do, by only showing the areas you need to go for your active quests. This is literally the only game I've seriously thought about trying to get a refund for, since I knew Hydrophobia was going to be broken going in, I enjoyed Colonial Marines because I went in thinking it was going to be the FPS version of the previous title named, and I haven't tried Magicka on a desktop yet which is where it apparently works best. The graphics are alright, but so the graphics in Vindictus, so save yourself the money and just download that...even if the game is closer to P2W than F2P.","November 29, 2013","false","4.5"," 15 of 29 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","15","29","0","0"

The game is expansive, there is plenty to do, and lots of character customization.  Sadly level design, enemy design and gameplay design took a backseat to quantity and we are left with a product that feels unfinished or undeveloped almost everywhere you look.\n\nI honestly feel bad for LoA and I don't like giving it a bad review.  I was a Kickstarter and I really wanted this game to be good, I believed in it.  But the question of whether or not I enjoy the game is the same as asking, do I like all the technical limitations, bad animations, missing sound effects and just general lack of enjoyment for completing quests.\n\nThe core of these flaws lies in two places; items and combat.  I like what Three Gates tried to do here: instead of buying and finding weapons and armor, you make and customize your own.  The system is a bit ugly but the outcome is fun.  Where it falls apart is there are too many materials and its all a bit cryptic.  Instead of 'cloth' and choosing a color, you have to find cloth of that color.  This means the materials list is padded down with seven kinds of every material making it a chore to find what it is you wanted.  Items are worse since you find them, but you never really need them because they never really do what you think they will.  These two factors mean looting just isn't fun, which is a problem in an aRPG.\n\nCombat is the other end of the badness.  The game was built on pride in its combat system, how your sword actually had to intersect your foes to do damage.  Sadly you don't have much control over how you attack, and the idea is forgettable anyways because enemies are annoying and nothing responds to you in a meaningful way.  It's a tough thing to describe, but let's just say enemies have more reaction to your attacks in Skyrim but at least that game had large hitboxes to make up for the lack of feedback you get.  I'd tell you 'try it and you'll understand' but my review is telling you not to try it.\n\nLoA is just a game of flaws.  It tried to do something new, but the result just isn't that good.  I only touched on two major problems, but it has plenty of bugs and questionable design elements I haven't listed.  If you want to support the developer then buy their game, but that's about the only reason to consider it.","April 20, 2014","false","0.7"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

Combat looked clean and kinda like Dark Souls, its not. You can run right through monsters so in the heat of battle it gets pretty obnoxious. Animations are pretty horrible, the voices in game are ridiculous and it the game world is all instanced. Maybe the game is not complete, hopefully they will fix things like how stiff your character looks and jumping is strange. I would avoid this game until they fix the bugs (my friend and I were playing and the orc-like creatures head was doing the exorcist thing trying to look at him while fighting me, hilarious but not thirty dollar hilarious), get new voice overs and maybe make the game feel more alive.

It is very detailed, has extremely high-resolution textures (especially the interiors) and an incredibly sophisticated leveling/perk system. Geniusly balanced imo. Also has more armor/loot/items than you could count.\n\nThere really is nothing here that is indicitive of a poor game. Everything works as it should. There is nothing game breaking or poorly implemented. There is NOTHING in this game that even hints developer laziness. Everything is complete and finished..\n\nThe only con is that this game is not anything close to being open world like most rpgs. You start off in a small central hub city and you pick a quest in which you must run to the docks and ask the sailor to start your mission whereas a new level loads.\n\nSo it's pretty much like a game with multiple linear levels, not an open world. If you like games where you travel off the beaten path to go look for treasure chests, this game is not the game for you. Because there is none of that.. While i was running down the linear levels there were multiple times i saw cave entrances or staircases leading up brick structures just to find out they were blocked by an invisible wall when you approach them.. I also stopped a few times to check in secretive looking areas and i would never find any secret loot chests or anything like that. So the exploration value is ZERO.\n\nIs it worth 30 dollars? No. I could see why the dev's would THINK it was worth 30 dollars because of all the work they put in. But the amount of work the devs put into a game does not always equate to realworld value.  I personally don't know why the dev's have it priced so high on the steam page because multiple times i have seen it go for sale in bundles for mere pennies.\n\nI think a good steam page price would be $9.99, the current $30 pricetag makes me just think that devs don't dont care/check up on their sales anymore.\n\nThe only reason i could see why others would not like this is because it lacks the smoothness/polish/AAA voice acting that most rpg's have. There are many times where you can simply picture the developers speaking in to a cheap household mic as use for the NPC voices.\n\nBut other than that i really soo","August 7, 2014","true","5.7"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","0"

firstly it has nothing simular to skyrim as skyrim is the best game of this sort to buy but as regarding this game soly on it's own merits i have to say after playing it for over 80 hours and reaching level 45 i am somewhat disapointed in it.\n\nThis game has some major bugs and flaws in it that makes this game a major failer firstly you can only open 1 out of 4 storage chests which is very annoying and you can't scroll your entire contents you have in your inventory which means you don't always know what you are carrying when all your inventory boxes is filled up so how can you sell anything if you can't see what you are carrying.\n\nsecond the mouse control behaves very eractic meaning it is not smooth action and i am using a brand new mouse which was bought only 3 days ago just in case anyone says i have a faulty mouse then forget it as i don't.\n\nthirdly you can't buy items from all the traders in your city (only buy from 2 traders which includes a blacksmith) they just stand there and do nothing to me that is a waist of game information that can be better used elswhere and the maps are too small and not much detail in fact some maps are just the same they have been duplicated because the developers are too lazy to create new maps, also you can't interact with all the people in your city and the trees and leaves and water does not even have a real looking effect unlike in skyrim and i can go on and tell you lots more that is bad about this game as the list is endless and i should know as i have played many top title games (some good and some bad)\n\nThe good points about this game is i bought it for less then $5.00 which is about £2.00 british pounds but for it to have a retail price of £22.99 which is about $35.00 which is daylight robbery to me the developers went all out on this game with the sole intention of robbing you which is no less then thievery or stealing from you in my book, they rushed this game without any thought at what they was trying to create as all they think about is money.\n\nThis is not a game anyone could possibly be proud of and is too over priced even skyrim is only about £12.00 to buy now and is a thousand times better if i had to give this game a score out of 10 i could only give it a sad 2 as the turkey game of the year as i look at this game and laugh at it on how pathetic it is.\n\nI understand the developers which i will name from shame is (Three Gates) who has pulled back there money from this sad poor game only to be nasty and legally ask a charity site to remove it from there bundle which the charity was selling in a game bundle to raise money for starving people and people dying in other countries this shows how nasty and unhumane three gates are and care of nothing but themselves and putting money first before human life.\n\nMy best advice to you is stay well clear of this game and in fact never buy anything from the company three gates as most likely it will be rubbish like this trash besides they have been nasty to a charity site so i will never buy anything created by three gates ever again in my life time.\n\nI know many of you will say that you can't expect a AAA+ game from a small indie developer but let's be honest here if we was going back 25 years ago i would say yes it is a good game because our computer tech and game developement was not very high then but let's get real here we are now 2014 and we have advanced so far in 25 years as we have super duper computers that is 64bit and liquid cooled with super processers and graphics cards so the tech is very high and many small developers is still knocking out really top end games at a low price, the difference here is this is a crap end title from a small developer who is demanding a high price for a bad product.\n\nThis game has so many bad reviews and will continue to do so because it has not met up with todays standerds in the game industry and i can't see three gates investing any money in this game with DLC packs or even any patches in fact i think they just want to dig a hole and bury it and forget it as it is making no more money for them so why should they care about it's customers because they don't as they already had your money so why should they care after all this game was released september last year and if there was going to be a patch to correct the bugs in the game it would of been released long before now, so don't live in hope of seeing a patch for this game as i got more chance of going to the moon then you seeing a patch for this game.\n\nI know my remarks has been hard on this developer but i speak as i find and judge people on there own merits and there own failers and in this case there is no merits to praise here.","March 4, 2014","false","99.2"," 25 of
