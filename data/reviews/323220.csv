Here's a list of the random permadeath things I've played that I can remember, ordered by how much I've enjoyed them, perhaps you can see if your tastes match mine or not. Do check out 1-8 if you haven't already.\n\n1. Vagante\n2. Risk of Rain\n3. Ziggurat\n4. FTL\n6. Binding of Isaac\n7. Tower of Guns\n8. Eldritch\n9. Dungeons of Dredmor\n10. Runers\n11. Teleglitch\n12. Legend of Dungeon\n13. Dungeon of the Endless\n\n\nRight, now that you've checked if you hate me for giving your favorite a low ranking, let's begin the review.\nI'll go over the essentials of rogue-lites, and tell you why I like the way Vagante has done each.\n\nCombat and MovementDoes it keep you constantly busy and challenged? Is it fun? Frustratingly unfair?\nMovement is nice and quick. You can run, jump, and grab ledges, with more options available if you find the right items.\nIn Vagante, positioning is key. Your attacks can only be aimed to the sides, or up and down if you've got certain upgrades. You'll be running around, jumping over and on top of enemies trying to get them to a good spot to spill their guts, and trying not to get cornered. I personally enjoy it. It's fair. Also, the characters play pretty differently, in case you get bored with one.\n\nLoot/Skills/Cool Stuff You Can GetIs every item or ability exciting to find or unlock?\nOh yes. Getting items is amazing. Every item has not only + or - to certain stats, but they also all have some kind of passive ability attached to them. Stuff like Wall Grabbing, High Jump, Freezing Aura, all great stuff with effort put into it. To add the spice of danger, items can be cursed, and you don't know that or any of its stats till you equip it or use an identify scroll. Also, there are even a few unique items in the game, with even more interesting, unique effects.\nAs for skills and abilities, you gain points for killing enough monsters, which you can spend on new skills. Or, you can just put them into stats like strength or intelligence. The skills though, can totally change the way you play with that character, so it's usually worth having those. You can even become a stealthy pacifist type.\n\nRandom Generation/Level DesignDoes it seem different every time in a way that encourages replayability?\nAbsolutely. Although you'll recognize bits of terrain after some hours, it puts them together in a satisfyingly different way every time. Hazards include instadeath spikes and boulders, and swimmable air meter type water that sometimes has fish in it that nibble you. It's fair though, you can walk horizontally past spikes, and the boulders are dropped by pressure plates, so it's your own fault if you die to them.\n\nOther Random ThoughtsOverall, Vagante shows a lot of effort and consideration in its design. Even in co op, I was pleased to find that if you die but another player is still alive, rather than become a useless spectator, you become a weak skeleton and can throw bones at monsters till you find an item to revive you. Lots of nice little things like this make me really respect the game. Also, the art and music are both quite good, and work well together to create this wonderful, mysterious world. Really excited to see how it develops.","December 24, 2014","true","116.3"," 90 of 98 people (92%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","92","90","98","5","9"

The game is still in an early state, and this review will be heavily modified and added upon as development continues.\n\nVagante is an action platformer with procedurally generated stages and perma-deaths , making this absolutely imperative for any enthusiast of games with roguelike elements. The game is very akin to Spelunky in terms of its random maze-like passages sprinkled with difficult enemies, and its maiden rescuing side objectives. The controls and platforming are smooth, combat is simple and fun, and your skills and equipment actually have a noticeable impact on your current run.\n\nYour consecutive runs will be incredibly difficult with narrow and claustrophobic corridors trapping you between numbers of varied monsters. As challenging as it is on the surface there is a slew of options available for your survival from leveling up important life-saving skills and abilities to finding or buying very useful equipment from the merchant which keep the game increasingly addictive in its progression, exploration and discovery.\n\nThe level and character designs in Vagante are stunning while retaining a simple indie game charm and the very well-done character portraits of the distinctly different classes you can choose in particular are reminiscent to me of the most memorable mid-to-late 90s era JRPG designs, with lovely organic background art in the eye-catching title screen almost akin to series like Secret of Mana/Seiken Densetsu.\n\nThe music also follows the same attractively unique yet familiar territory into RPG classics, the natural wood and string instruments sounding to me almost like tracks you would expect out of the likes of Yasunori Mitsuda's Chrono Cross soundtrack. Long story short, even in its earliest form Vagante already has the makings of a classic.\n\nVagante is in an alpha state currently, and is already very hard to find any faults with other than the fact that it's early and still has lots more incredible content to come. With the nostalgic visuals and music combined with fun, precise and easy to pick up but challenging to master randomized gameplay this is a title I'm certain could become the next 'big' roguelite. I already know it is for me, at least.","December 17, 2014","true","5.7"," 48 of 54 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","48","54","0","0"

The developers are engaging their community and progressing the game - a seemingly rare occurance among Steam early access titles.\n\nThe content this game does have at the moment is enough to make the game feel mostly complete (not complete, but mostly complete). There's just enough diversity in monsters and items to keep each run-through unique and entertaining.\n\nThis game has excellent replay value. If the frustration and desire to beat this game after numerous deaths doesn't keep bringing you back, the secret content will. There are "secret" achievements that players can unlock within the game. These features allow you to: unlock a new class, give your character a stat-altering background story (eg., bookworm increases intelligence), or give your game certain environment effects (such as freezing time when no button is pressed).\n\nThis game has a somewhat steep learning curve, but is relatively simple once you get the hang of it. It took me about 2-3 hours to get the hang of shifting through my inventory, setting spells, and quick-swapping weapons, etc. It's definitely worth the invested time, though.\n\nDefinitely glad to support the development of this game.","February 24","true","11.5"," 31 of 32 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","31","32","0","1"

Here are my thoughts.\n\ntl;dr - Yes. Vagante is worth the purchase.\n\nPros:\n\n~ Fairly unique. You can compare Vagante to both Spelunky and Rogue Legacy, but for me Vagante leans more toward Rogue Legacy.\n~ Large replay value.\n~ Unlockable traits. Playing the game you will unlock several traits that allow your new characters certain benefits.\n~ Four classes. (Knight, Rogue, Mage, and "???" - of which we'll call her universal.) Each has their own unique playing style and starting equipment.\n~ Addictive. The game may cause you to mini-ragequit when you first start, but you'll start it right back up a few minutes later.\n~ Updates. This is an Early Access, but it is one of the few in which the developers actually come out w/ regular updates. I encourage you to download the version 8 edition for free from the developers main site and then purchase version 11 later. You will see a vast improvement between the two editions.\n\nCons:\n\n~ Lack of instructions. It's a very simple game to play and you will learn quickly how to do things. However, you will not learn certain things right off the bat. (I was 15 hours in before I realized what some of the altars do and how to use them.)\n~ No use for funds after a certain point. If you choose a certain trait, gold serves no purpose other than for a certain altar; which could be a game changer if you are lucky enough.\n~ Vast superiority in certain weapons over others. (You will find that you will end up using certain weapons more than others due to how they work.\n~ Organization. A little one, but still valid. You have a rather small inventory. When you equip something it "stays" in your inventory, rather than being linked to a character grid. Over time, you've got a full set of gear and almost no room to carry anything else. (Melee weapon, Ranged weapon, arrows/quiver/both, head, chest, feet, two rings, hands, neck/face, 5 total potions, 5 total scrolls.)\n\nAt this point I do not see why this game has so little success. Of all the garbage in Early Access of right now, Vagante is a diamond in the rough.","January 26, 2015","true","49.9"," 33 of 37 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","33","37","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cryotek/recommended/323220/","cryotek","Jinx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cryotek/","825 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nA great little roguelike! If you like Spelunky, but want a bit more combat like Rogue Legacy, you should definitely check this game out. The initial difficulty is high, but as you begin to figure things out it's very satisfying. And for the most part it feels fair, which imo a lot of roguelikes get wrong. When I die I usually feel it's because *I* screwed up - not because the Random Number Generator wasn't in my favor. It's still very difficult, though, and I've come nowhere near beating it.\n\nWhile the game is a roguelike, with no carry-over between runs, it also has RPG elements. There are three different classes, and you earn points to improve your stats and abilities. You also find a variety of new gear, potions, and scrolls, and can even pray at different shrines for different bonuses. Taken together, all of this helps makes every run feel unique because you never know what you'll find. It also gives both a sense of progression and a sense of investment in every single run.\n\nVisually, I have to say screenshots don't do this game justice. The muted colors really fit the feel, and the reason there is a lot of darkness is because you reveal the map as you explore. You can also only see what's directly in your character's line of sight (like fog of war in strategy games). It's an interesting gameplay mechanic and means you have to be extremely cautious as you proceed. The sound in the game is excellent as well, the music setting a great spooky tone and the sound effects doing their job nicely.\n\nOverall, if you are a fan of roguelikes and 2D platformers this is one for you. It's only in alpha, but it's stable, has plenty of content and features, and is well worth the asking price.","October 12, 2015","true","5.6"," 22 of 23 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","22","23","2","0"

You progress through 2d levels while looking for items making you stronger. Each level has a boss that you can choose to kill, if you kill the boss you will instantly level up and can assign a skillpoint between levels, else you slowly gain exp by just killing normal mobs.\n\nThere is also a shopkeeper you can either rob or buy items from, and many different shrines you need to discover what they do.\n\nThe game has a few class-unique skills for each character that you can choose to unlock with skillpoints, it also has general skills for all characters, like strength, vitality, etc.\n\nThe game has quite a few different paths you can take your character down and it feels really nice to go from mostly dying on the first 3 levels (one world is 3 levels) to mostly dying on the 2nd world to suddenly almost always make it to the fourth world, every death in this game is caused by you and you yourself, so while you may die a lot when you start out, every death is because of a mistake you made.\n\nIf you have any interest in roguelikes at all you HAVE to get this game.","May 6","true","55.7"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","20","21","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SlyEnemy/recommended/323220/","SlyEnemy","Magic Murder Bag","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SlyEnemy/","862 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis feels like a grand mixture of all of my favourite games wrapped up into a neat little pixel art soup.\n\nFirstly, you have the obvious reference point: Spelunky. Where Spelunky has a defined set of rules in its physics, so too does Vagante. Where Spelunky has a defined set of rules in its items, Vagante does not, and this is the defining element when it comes to both the platforming and the combat.\n\nItems that you pick up in the procedurally generated levels are "unidentified". That is to say, you have no idea what they do - yet. To discover this, you have to use them, either by equipping them (Weapons/Armour), drinking them (potions) or reading them (scrolls). What they'll do is anyone's guess, but it's your only way to learn your way through items on that particular run through. This is typical of most Rogue games, but it's nice to see it makes a return here. It makes use of items a gamble. You need health, but which of these 4 potions could possibly be a health potion? Let's try this Blue one... Oh balls, I'm on fire.\n\nSo far, I've put my time into the standard Warrior class, the Ranger class and the recently unlocked "Wildling" who appears to be a Barbarian sort. While they all handle the same, they each have their own basic talent tree and unlockable skills. Certain weapons will also be of more benefit to certain types; an Archer, for instance, will make more use of a Bow but it doesn't stop a Warrior from using it. There's also a mage class that I'm yet to try - but again, magic is something that all classes can use, it's just that each class specialises in these areas.\n\nCombat and difficulty can, at times, hold the same feeling as Dark Souls, especially in the Warrior class. Once you unlock the block ability, you can quickly switch from attacking to blocking and back to attacking. The enemies AI is satisfactory in that it can be read predictably and therefore can be exploited when needs must. This is exceptionally helpful when the difficulty and the stakes are high, but it'll take a few runs against the same enemy to get a feel for their movement/attacks.\n\nI'm absolutely glowing about this game right now, I love the art style, love the procedurally generated levels and the unscripted nonsense that happens as enemies set off traps and kill themselves while you stand idly by. There are a couple of points which I hope to see fixed or come to the full version though:\n\nOnline Multiplayer is sorely missing as of writing this review, but I'm reading that it's on its way which will open up a whole new aspect of the game.\n\nLevelling is only done once per level - I'd much rather see this tied to a standard experience system. You won't see any great differences in your builds until you get through multiple stages with the current levelling system, but traditional XP would alleviate this and I don't feel like it would make the game any less punishing.\n\nLedge hanging - sometimes it just doesn't seem to work and I can't figure out why. I'll clear a gap and often times will only cling to a ledge if my character is about 3/4 of a sprite over the lip. This doesn't "feel" quite right, and I'll often fall to my death thinking that I've easily made it.\n\nAll in all though, if you're a fan of Spelunky or rogue-lite/likes in general, this is an excellent purchase - even in Early Access it's immediately playable.","February 5","true","5.8"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","18","18","0","0"

It's like a marriage between Risk of Rain and Rogue Legacy. The gameplay sort of "slow and tight" like Risk of Rain, but also manages to feel a lot more frantic and fast paced. The different classes have drastically different play styles (in a good way) but there's also the original Diablo principle of 'anyone ~CAN~ learn magic.'\n\nThe game's very challenging but also very fair. You'll get punished by visible pannel traps and realize after the fact it was in plain sight, you'll get knocked back into spikes and die and realize it's your fault for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. You'll accidentally summon/anger bosses and learn not to do those things again (or do them again on purpose if that's your thing). For me, it's the perfect level of dificulty to keep me trying and dying and trying and dying.\n\nThe 2-4 player co-op in this game is seamless and perfectly done. When a player dies, they can revive as a cannon-fodder skeleton that is essentially useless in combat but can function as a warm body to scout/distract enemies. Dead players are tactically useful, but have no 'actively powerful' impact on the game. It's a clear punishment for dying, but keeps players engaged and useful. If you're lucky, on future floors you may find items that can revive one dead player. If the entire party wipes, of course, it's game over.\n\nI highly recommend this game and really appreciate the developers for creating it.","November 15, 2015","true","17.0"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","18","18","3","0"

It's very similar to Spelunky but it also adds some RPG elements on top of the normal mechanics for those types of games and IMO this makes playing each run a lot more rewarding. I haven't played through all the content on the Early Access version but the demo that was released a few months back lasted me about 15 hours before I got bored, so this version should go for more than that at least since it has more content.\n\nAnyway, if you liked Spelunky then you'll probably like this.","December 16, 2014","true","27.2"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","16","16","0","2"

And also, let me tell you it is marked as one of my favorite games of all time. It takes the platforming of Spelunky and adds a nice RPG element to it, from random weapon drops to the risky testing of potions.So let me tell you why to buy this. It is cheap for the god send that it is IN BETA. Hear that? Beta. And this ♥♥♥♥ is already the Jesus baby of Spelunky and whatever sweet suckulant damsel of RPG it fornicated. It is fun, challenging and you get better the more you play. And that Jesus is still in Beta. Which means it can only get better, and thats god damned impressive.\n\nEveryone who gripes about this game seem to have the same complaints:\n\n1) The controls are not smooth.\n-I debunk that by saying that these are basic platformer layouts, apart from the special skills that require you to do a few odd combonations but are nontheless very rarely used even if you spec for them.\n\n2) The classes are not balanced.\n-They are. Save for the mage who takes some getting used to because-\n\n3) The magic system sucks.\n-This is COMPLETELY false. It has a very unique mana system, yes. Having a direct amount available for use which is regenerated by a resavoir that grows as you find secrets, explore the map, identify items, etc. Which is, by far, the most astonishingly well thought out and greatly executed mana mechanic I have ever encountered.\n\n4) Magic sucks.\n-Magic is overpowered. Spells are rare, yes. But that comes with random loot. Some spells do rediculous amounts of damage at the cost of a lot of mana to deter the user from fire blasting every slime. And for the use of everyone, wands, so as not to leave the knight out of the magic game.\n\n5) Bosses are too hard.\n-Bosses are challenging and are easily scanned for their move sets which are unique and threatening in their own ways. Kind of like Dark Souls. And like DS, you can dodge every move with ease as long as you take your time.\n\n6) Healing is too drought out.\n-Healing is as random as every other element of the game, coming from potions, fairies, equipment, and sacrificing money. Just don't get hit and you are fine.\n\n7) Instant death traps.\n-Easily identified and easily avoidable...♥♥♥♥ing scrubs.","February 5, 2015","true","50.6"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","17","19","4","0"

I will not give a number score anywhere in this review.\n\nGameplay Vagante is a 2d rogue-lite platformer that is also a RPG. Each level is randomly generated and as of now levels are not seeded, so you cannot replay a run. This game can be played solo or up to 4 players locally (I have only played it by myself so far so I have nothing to say about the local co-op). It consists of some elements from Spelunky: arrow traps, spike pits, and the shop somewhat works like the shop in Spelunky. Currently you start off with three available characters/classes and one is unlockable. Weapons and armor are not class locked and you can find spell books, swords, tunics, and other loot in random chests through each level. Gear is also not locked off by stat requirements but you should be cautious when equipping anything since it may take away stats when it is equipped or it may be a cursed item which leads to the item being stuck on your person until the curse is removed from it via a scroll. Scrolls and potions are randomized every run like how pills are randomized in The Binding of Isaac. Everytime you start a run you start with one affinity point which you can put into an affinity (unless you are the unlockable class) or stats. There are no repeating affinities on any of the classes.\n\nArtstyle I personally found the artstyle and aesthetic of Vagante to be very colorful yet still dark with the color palette. Everything looks really nice and does not blend in unless it seems to be necessary.\n\nEnding (not conclusion) Thank you for reading my review, if you have any criticisms about this review please comment so I can improve it.","January 2, 2015","true","17.1"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","18","21","0","0"

It has a somewhat deep character progression system that lets the player mold their character into whatever they want (restricted somewhat by the class system).  There are 3 starting classes, rogue, warrior, and mage, that are exactly how you think they would be.  Don't let that stop you from playing a magic warrior though! (Really not a good idea though haha)  The item system is random enough where each playthrough will feel different, but it can be pretty punishing if the RNG gods are against you.  The controls are fluid and combat is simplistic yet feels really good.  Face tanking damage will quickly end your run (and death is permanent!) so don't do it.

This game is still in early access but there is enough content to warrant the early purchase. There are elements that still need to be improved but overall the core is very much there and extremely playable.\n\nThe controls are responsive, simple, and great on an Xbox gamepad. You can jump, melee, range, and cast magic at the press of a button; switching out weapons and magic is easy and fast with the swap button. Navigating through the inventory, magic book, and character sheet is also a breeze.\n\nAlright now for the gameplay. You can expect to die a lot. Boulder traps, spikes, even gravity can bring you to a quick end. The walk button will become your best friend when exploring and keen observation will keep you alive. Another great element in this game is using the evironment to your advantage. Scouting the entire level for the perfect spot to vanquish a difficult boss can be very rewarding. Enemies are pretty generic but provide a fair and fun challenge, also the different approaches to triggering floor bosses is interesting whether it be a sleeping dragon or angry mother worm. Loot, glorious loot! You'll find all sorts of enchanted weapons, armor, scrolls, potions, and trinkets. Some items will drastically change up your strategy and even the way you travel.\n\nThis game is still in the development process and I'm very excited to see what the creators are going to add to Vagante. Changes I would like to see are variations on enemy and boss types ala the Binding of Isaac, being able to sell your loot to the shopkeeper, and more death screen statistics. It would also be cool to see what needs to be done to unlock the unlockables but as this game is still early stage it is understandable. I can't wait for the next update!

(i still want a support-role ♥)\n• Dungeons are nicely random generated, but sometimes you're more lucky to find those items that help more your class (not droping a bunch of wands as a knight ;-;);\n• Weapons and armors in general are randomly generated too, so sometimes you drop different types of daggers, swords, clubs, axes, bows/crossbows, wands (etc.) with their unique status and attack speed, that make every round more and more unique;\n• Potions and scrolls come unindetified, so you have to indentify it in some way, or just drink it and see what it happens, one nice thing that the "white unindentified potion" is not always your sweet regeneration potion that you droped last round, and when you drink it..... "hm, that tasted strange" *-5, -5, -5...\n• The navigation through the dungeon is one of the best things that this game offers; you must be really careful with those plates on the ground, and if you miss it and press: "BAMS, 999 damage you're dead.";\n• Enemies and bosses are really challenging, since you have just one life, sometimes you really have to pay attention on those offensive patterns and dodge or block it to save your HP; every free damage you take counts, and if you're unlucky to not find any good healing items, you're pretty screwed!\n• I LOOOOVE the art in this game, 16 bits polished style simply amazing ♥♥♥; one of my inspirations on future development of my games since i studying game design and i want to make one game too!\n• Online multiplayer finally is out (and i was waiting for it before writing this review), and playing this game with other friends is sooooooo good; managing your life, items, healing items, droping items to each other, fighting bosses togheter and exploring carefully those stages... ah, awesome!\n\nDeeply recomend this to anyone that like RPG and those rouguelike mechanics of randomness and dying with inventory full of good supplies because of that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ boulder! haha\n\n11/10 would die again as a mage.","March 21","true","30.0"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","13","13","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cognitiveagent/recommended/323220/","cognitiveagent","PariahDog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cognitiveagent/","776 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nGameplayThis game is exactly what you'd get if you wanted to make a roguelike 2D platformer. While it lacks the turn-based and top-down gameplay that define the genre, pretty much every other aspect of the genre is retained. The procedural generation of levels is executed perfectly, as the levels are challenging and look good. Loot is randomly generated in true roguelike fashion, where nothing is identified until you use it, or if you cast from an identification scroll. This goes for potions as well, of which the color never indicates what type of potion you find between runs.\n\nItemization so far has been pretty great. The items not only offer random stat upgrades, some of them also offer platforming assistance (to some extent) and other abilities. For instance, it is possible to find gloves that allow you to grab hold of walls, boots that allow you to bounce around or leave a trail of fire, a grappling hook, and even items that allow you to phase through walls and floors. If you're a dumbass like myself, you'll find yourself phasing through the edge of the level by accident, killing yourself in the process. There are many more items like this, and I haven't even gotten that far into the game.\n\nThe fact that there's more to items than just numbers makes itemization in this game a LOT more interesting.\n\nControlsThe game controls feel a lot like spelunky, which makes it a bit clunky in combat. The clunkiness, however, is rather charming. While I personally opted not to play a knight as the rogue's dagger is much faster (and thus hits the opponent when I press the button, not half a second later), once you get used to the controls the game should feel natural to play.\n\nThe controls can be rebound from the menu, and it's possible to use a controller (which I would recommend for this game, although it is certainly not necessary).\n\nCo-opThe fact that this game has local co-op makes it all that much better. I have only seen co-op in videos, as I haven't yet had the chance to play this game with friends. The videos show that if one of the players dies, he is 'resurrected' as a skeleton, with some chances to return back to life as a player. This means that dead players can still help, but would much rather be alive since living characters have more to offer.\n\nDifficultyThe game is quite difficult. At the very beginning you lack the gear to withstand a lot of punishment. Each level contains a boss, and if you can't find a way to cheese the boss, they can be quite a challenge. Difficulty also hinges a lot on the item drops you get. Getting health potions early on helps a lot, as well as items giving you higher defense, or more attack power.\n\nFinal Judgement\nThe Good\nFantastic gameplay; it resembles a rogue-like more than most games calling themselves roguelikes\nConsistent quality of graphics; the game looks great for those loving the NES/SNES era type graphics\nIt has co-op!\nIt's quite difficult\nThe Bad\nThe controls are a bit clunky, making combat harder than it should be. Especially with a sword, you really have to get used to the timing, otherwise enemies will chip away your health before you can even finish the first level. It's not a deal-breaker, though, as the controls are not unfair or unresponsive.\nIt's quite difficult\nThis game is an absolute recommendation for those enjoying 2D platformers with a mean streak. It also has co-op! What else could you wish for? The co-op is still limited only to local, but on the discussion board the developer mentioned making online co-op. The fact that this game is still early access is fantastic, because it means from here on out it will only get better.","December 18, 2014","true","15.1"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

I don't find that it is worth $15 in its current state. It simply lacks content.

Few have been game-breaking, and the game is in early-access as of writing this review, hence why this item is #4 on my little list here.\n\nSo let's talk about what the game is like. Some here have compared it to a 2D Dark Souls. I can understand where the comparison comes from, but its not really accurate. Yes, the game is something of a dark fantasy (and I do admire the art style). Yes, the game is quite hard at first. That's where the comparison ends, though. Dark Souls is an entirely different game. This is a rogue-lite dungeon crawler, through and through.\n\nThe first thing I noticed is the control scheme. It's entirely keyboard driven with no mouse at all. It takes a little getting used to, but it becomes very intuitive fairly quickly. I believe the game also supports gamepad and controller (I could be wrong).\n\nNext, this game will kill you A LOT. There are a lot of insta-death scenarios and your character can't take very many hits. However, all deaths are within your control, which is something I've found very refreshing. This is one of the few games where when one of my characters dies, I laugh it off more than get upset about it. The devs really reached a sweet spot in animation, audio, and visuals that make instadeath a unique blend of comical and ... something I can't quite describe. The point is, I'm the guy who would cuss at the screen after getting killed in Enter the Gungeon, and in this I find myself far more often giggling about it.\n\nBefore I get into my main problems with the game aside from what I listed above, I'll talk about what I liked:\n\n++ The procedural generation is quite good. I've been surprised by how certain segments can link together in interesting ways. The mechanic of being able to push blocks has been key to this.\n\n++ The platforming is very fluid and responsive.\n\n++ Art is beautiful.\n\n++ The music is very good. This game provides a surprisingly ambient, calming experience, provided by the blending of the dark visuals and the music.\n\n++ The game's core mechanics (e.g., stats, resistances, items, abilities) are easy to understand.\n\n++ Sound effects are satisfying and have a nice retro feel.\n\n++ I enjoyed the way the game decided to set up its control scheme. Abilities are cast as combinations of keys rather than standard QWER setups, and since the game is fully keyboard driven, combat feels pleasantly skillful and visceral (especially with a mechanical keyboard).\n\nNegatives:\n\n-- The big one: lack of content. I know, its early access. I should be expecting a lack of content. But its still a glaring issue. A rogue-lite game NEEDS variety of enemies, loot, classes, and bosses. As this game stands, there is very little variety (however I see that there is HUGE potential for more).\n\n-- Combat. I've been a little divided on this one. I've found the combat satisfying, but also found it somewhat annoying. Because of how weapons and sprites fundamentally function in this game, combat is dictated by how well you can exploit the features of the procedurally generated terrain. This is especially obvious against bosses. But like I said, the combat still remains satisfying, I just find that it becomes less of a challenge of reflex/skill and more about knowing what kind of terrain the boss's pathing is worst at.\n\n-- Combat, part 2. Continuing on the previous note about how the terrain dictates the fight: I've found that while exploring the dungeon, it is far less dangerous WHICH enemy you find, but rather WHERE you find the enemy. Even the weakest creature in the game can kick your ♥♥♥ if you find it in the wrong spot (which feels really cheap, usually).\n\n-- Skills. Each class has 3 "skill trees". In my experience, some of the skill trees are objectively better options than the others. This makes gameplay dull. I wish the weaker skill trees were a bit more developed to become more viable.\n\n-- The game's quality seems to diminish the further you go along. I don't know if this is just something I've observed, but I've found the first stage is far more developed than the next two. Perhaps this is just once again indicative of early access. I hope the later stages are developed as well as the first.\n\nThat's about everything I can think of about this game. Do I recommend it? Yeah, absolutely. If its on sale and you like rogue-lites/dungeon crawlers? GET THIS GAME! I really hope the developers stick with it and continue to add content. So far this is one of my favorite dungeon crawlers yet. Great job","May 16","true","17.4"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","15","18","3","3"

However, here are the reasons why you should play this one instead:\n\n*It doesn't look like ♥♥♥♥. Spelunky's art style is crisp but I feel like I am playing with Lego Duplos or some ♥♥♥♥. It's weak and childish. Vagante's art is dark but also beautiful. Simply put just more well done all around.\n*It's more RPG-like. Knights, Mages, rogues and the mysterious Princess Mononoke-esque character (whatever is it, it's awesome).

They started up a Kickstarter that sadly failed so I'm really glad to see it finally up on Steam. I originally backed it and was super hyped about it so I'm more than happy to support the development of this game. I absolutely recommend this game for any fans of Spelunky, roguelikes, or just enjoy a nice difficult game. Would I recommend it for it's current price? Probably not. I don't think it has enough features to necessitate a $15 price tag. Why did I buy it? Purely because I want to support it's development. They also have a free demo on their site if you want to give that a look. I recommend trying that out before buying it to see if you'll truly enjoy it.\n\nGameplay is great. If you've played Spelunky then you'll get a hang of the controls just fine. Has really good controller support too which I highly recommend using. Each class you choose from pretty much handles the same at the start. There's three to begin with (knight, rogue, mage) and you can unlock more as you play. I'm not sure how much there is currently in the unlockables department but I really hope they just load the hell out of this game with them because this is the perfect type of game for it. You can even unlock different backgrounds. I unlocked Deprived which starts you off with no items at all (a nod to Dark Souls I'd imagine).\nBasically you go through randomly generated areas slaying monsters with a pretty diverse arsenal of weaponry and spells to gain levels and loot. To gain levels it's almost mandatory that you kill the boss in each area but you only level up once you transition to the next floor which will allow you to distribute a point in either a new ability or into one of your stats. Along with loads of xp the boss also drops a key that'll allow you to unlock a super chest tucked away somewhere on each level. There's a decent amount of crates to smash and chests to loot but there's also a shop very similar to Spelunky's.\nThe difficulty is fair and makes the game challenging enough that it'll keep you hooked. Easy mechanics that are difficult to master. There's quite a few things that can kill you in one hit. Mostly spike traps. It may take you a while before you're used to how to handle areas with spike traps but don't give up.\nThey also plan on adding in online multiplayer to go along with the local multiplayer they already have. They've already changed up the gameplay to facilitate multiplayer so I assume now they're just adding in netcode which is a huge thing.\n\nI tried really hard to think of something I don't like about this game. I think my only real gripe is that all the monsters are just generic fantasy creatures. You got slimes, goblins, bats etc. I can understand why they would make it this way though. They do fit into the theme really well. I'd also like to have sounds play when a creature is defeated. In Dark Souls when you kill something they play a really satisfying slashy noise but in this they don't really make a sound. This is early access so maybe they'll add it in at some point.","December 17, 2014","true","19.9"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

The goblin king has no business being a Zone 1 boss with his unpredictable movement and very high damage. The plant boss in the forest might very well be the most frustrating boss I have faced in any game EVER. He sits there like a smug ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ while his little drone-line plant buddies attack you from below. If you're a melee class good luck fighting him, there is literally no counterplay. Oh, also he poisons you and kills you in about 4 seconds flat if he grabs you. The basic enemies in the third zone can easily kill you by themselves if you aren't paying attention because they do absolutely ridiculous amount of damage.\n\nMan... when I put it like that, I wonder why I recommended this game.

What a delightful experience.\n\nI would like to start this by saying it has been a long time since I last played a game so cativating like this one... Unfortunately I am not a child anymore and I have to stop some time for I need to work by the morning, if I was still young, I would probably keep playing this until the sun rises.\n\n* While it still under development, the game already offers a much too polished gameplay mechanics with a wide variety of skills and abilities to be used, and of course, each class has their own or uses them more effectively.\n\n* Punishing difficulty, something that very little game developers nowadays tend to do wrong, by just increasing the enemy's parameters, however Vagante does it properly by making the player undergo a punishing and often little rewarding exploration through the cave, making the character exhausted, and that's when the Boss shows up, most of the time. Even though you might get killed often, that will only make you want to do better next time.\n\n* A Good level design, the caves do not seem to be only randomly generated, as I did not find any way to be permanently stuck, nor did i find breakable walls that leads to nowhere, not even collision bugs. 2D games tends to have at least one or two of these spots, due to the complex space-detection-scripting.\n\n* A Responsive input and also very little is required to run the game.\n\n* A Fair price.\n\nYes, the game could be a little more versatile by allowing the player to willingly travel to other locations, shops, etc... And also, character leveling is something that should be constant and not during rest-like periods, for a game like this: You achieve the required points > You Level Up > you gain your hability point > You spend and that's it.\nAlthough those are not to be frowned upon yet, it would be pleasant to see the game walk towards this way, as success would be inevitable. More classes and of course, a "Character Creation" which i believe it would not be hard to implement at all and would be better than generate skin over skin. a humble tip from an "Amateur Developer" like me: Generate the character parts separetely (Head/Torso/Lower Gear and Gloves) creating a sprite sheet to each, next, set them all as strings and call them in their respective flag to whatever Window_Character_Creation HUD you come up with, it will give the player that feel that he is unique, making the game progression far more pleasant to achieve.\n\nThe only thing I am really worried right now, is that someday the developer quits updating this Project, that would be most unpleasant, as this absolutely has the potential to surpass every other game in his category, heck, I would even go as far as sponsoring this project if it walks towards the right way.\n\nAn honest 10/10, Good Work!\n\n- Glorian","October 14, 2015","true","8.6"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","9","10","2","0"

There really isn't one, but you kinda feel like there is.\n-----------------------------\n\nImagine if you took diablo on hardcore mode and made it play like an oldschool castlevania game; complete with beautifully fitting sound track.  Gameplay mechanics are very simple, especially in the beginning, yet as you level up and get new abilities, it actually becomes rather deep and complex for being a 2d platformer. It's hard, so don't get this if you're not looking for a challenge. You will die. Many times.  It's less forgiving than Dark Souls. Some of the enemies and obstacles may seem a bit unfair at first but after a while you start to be more aware of what you should be looking for; whether it be pressure-plate trap triggers or analyzing enemies' patterns to dodge and counter. You'll find your average play progression steadily rising once it starts to click.\n\n\nThe real gem is online play with a full party of 4.  Once you've crawled through 6 dungeons together with your team and rest around the campfire together, you start to feel this real sense of bond with these people you're struggling to survive with.  Everyone I've played with has been a chill and/or friendly team player.\n\n\nI've only owned this game for 3 weeks and already they have patched one of my two issues with the game- their crashes on the online mode have seemingly stopped since they last patched, which even still to the time of me writing this you have to click a button saying you understand that the online mode is still very much in beta; to basically expect error , which now the only error i'm really seeing is that it's telling us we have more skill points to spend than we really do a lot of the time\n\nThe only other issue I have is that the map is too small... you are literally 1 pixel on your high definition laptop screen on the little map you see in the corner, and I can't make out the map at all if I'm playing it on 1080i 40" tv.\n\nGet this game.

I'm enjoying it, it's different every time since the levels are randomly generated.. there are already a range of different weapons, scrolls, potions and so on, I hope they keep on adding stuff.\nhere's what I dislike: when you enter the Forest or the Ruins it gets ridicolously hard one of a sudden, when you get there the first time you die quickly, because you don't expect it, you get spammed by attacks and huge strong enemies. they charge at you, and since it's very open you die very quick. of course this is work in process and needs balancing, I just wanted to point that out.\nthere's a hidden character, I like the look but I don't get what his abilities supposed to be.. no starting weapon, no skill upgrade. so I guess he or she is a work in process character aswell.\nalso there seems to be difficulties after you played a while, I'm not so sure what each difficulty means... but it's good that you're trying a not-so-obvious route here. deprived is starting without weapons right? but what about 'strong'?\n\nI like this game so far, it's quite hard right now and needs balancing. but if you want to shape this game and you're into challenging roguelikes, I recommend this game to you. just don't expect a finished game, because that would be silly.","December 21, 2014","true","26.7"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","1"

I didn't enjoy the mage so much, but in multiplayer I can see it being a valued class. For solo play if you want to get far learn the warrior first then master the rogue.

I feel so immersed playing this, it does a great job at putting sound, music, visuals and gameplay together to build something more, in a very non-pretentious way.\n\nDifficulty can feel tricky at times, as it requires a different philosophy to play it. It's a game about being cautious to EVERY aspect it presents. Every mechanic can and will be used against you in case you didn't play carefully. Precise platforming is required to manipulate every combat situation to your advantage; opening menus doesn't pause the game, leaving you vulnerable; newfound items might include negative stat reductions and your field of view should really scare you as much as it does for the very first moments of the game.\n\nI'd definitely recommend this, it's all about caution, paying attention to details and being very well rewarded for exploration and manipulating the game in your favor.","August 4, 2015","true","28.7"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

It definitely needs more publicity as it's a godsend to people who love retro graphics and adventure games.

Not alot of PC games do this. (Online is coming soon as well)\nRetro graphics look amazing.\n\nThe Bad:\nFramedrops cause slowdown.

Atleast in my opinnion I believe the game would be much better if there was an actually sense of progression via addition of more rpg elements that persist through all your dungeon runs and not just unlocking new characters and perks. The perks as they are right now to say the least are pretty underwhelming and don't really change the gameplay that much sadly. Also I feel like there is a bit of a balancing issues with the classes themselves, some classes excel at combat far greater then others and some skills almost feel completely useless compared to others. I have high hopes for this game since the art style is fantastic and the gameplay feels tight. I wish updates were more impactful but I mostly only see balancing changes to the core gameplay itself which are about every two weeks. I would reccomend this game as is currently but you shouldn't expect too much from it at this point.","February 25","true","32.2"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","8","9","2","1"

I'm not even sure why this game is labeled as Early Access even after reading the FAQ.  There is a ton of variety and a LOT of depth to even master the game at this point.  Gripping on to ledges has to be intentional.  There is a gravity to the game's pace that presses real and urgent danger everywhere you turn.  Secret areas, Boss fights on each level, crazy thieves, traps, multiple classes to choose from (and each class managing to reflect the archetype very well within the mechanics).

Only L4D2 and DMC3 managed to get over the 100 hours, the first because most of my friends play it and revel in it's chaos, and the later because I'm a freaking SSS maniac obsessed with perfect ranks. Dark souls is different, it's a game for real mans, it knows it's not a casual AAA game.\nBut every other single big titles can consider themselves lucky to be even played through. And I mean, I try, sometimes I even hope it gets good, but it often fails to deliver. Even DmC was baaaaad, hell, EVEN XCOM: Enemy Unknown failed to get a second playthrough. And it's X-COM material.\n\nBut games like The Binding of Isaac? Xenonauts? Dungeons of Dredmor and Don't Starve? Terraria, Starbound, you name it. These games captivates me so much. Maybe it's because they don't treat me like a child or an idiot. Maybe they don't feel bad about beating me to the ground. Maybe they think I like it, want more, thirst for vengeance and have a chance to show the game who's behind the controller. Maybe their mojo captured my mind, their music trapping my brain...\n\nPlus these games are well made. The hundreds of items in Isaac, the 70+ classes of Dredmor, the random levels, the effect of surprise always being present, everything from the colors to the little details...How could you not love this?\n\nWell, Vagante is among these. Right in the tutorials it shows you what's up by killing you twice. There. Now you know what's gonna get you. And the first couple of runs are tough, maybe even unfair and infuriating. But then you kill your first boss. Open your first great chest. Equip that fat loot. And break your first statue.\n\n...I shouldn't have done that, I should not have done that!\n\nBut if it was only about the rad difficulty then I'd play Real-Life: The Game. Vagante has a beautiful aesthetic to it, it has an enchanting charm when you first select your characters (via tarot cards, that's pretty neatto). From there, all you see is a gaping hole in the wall daring you to go inside. The warmth of the torches begging you to stay, the vines over the remains of decaying structures saying you shouldn't be there and that little bug just minding it's own business. The game feels alive. It is a beast baiting you with items, pieces of gold, dangers and rewards. The music and the sound effects are all suiting, the characters are easily recognizable. How could you resist? So you hop in. The gap behind you shutting down, only one way to go. You brace yourself, as the environments around you changed from last time's attempt. And you know you have high chances of kicking the bucket. Yet you go stab that slime, it deserves it. Stupid slimes.\n\nVagante is not a complete game, yet it already does so much. If you think you want to try it out based on that I wrote, then you should give it a proper try. I know, from the feels of it, that I will play it for hours and hours.","May 21, 2015","true","19.4"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Nothing is more frustrating as dying in Vagante. You lose everything all your gear and skills. No other option as starting again. The thing that keeps you on track is random items in random dungeon stages. Every game is a different challenge. You get better and better with each run.\n\nNevertheless, if you are careless for a second it is still possible to die in seconds. However, it is never unfair! All traps are visible. All enemies can be beat. Maybe not during your first run that is for sure. ;)  Learn weaknesses of the boss enemies in each dungeon stage. Learn to use your skills effective. In addition, chose your battleground well. That is the motivating core of Vagante.\n\nGame Graphics are awesome.

Gaining levels allows you to choose a new mechanic to one of the weapons that you spawn with, and they're all useful and worth taking depending on what you're planning, One of the most impressive elements of the game is it's ability to surprise you at every corner, enemy AI is smart, doesn't really let you take them out easily, and getting hit is very easy. Another thing that will likely end your run sooner than enemies is spiked floors and boulders that fall from the ceiling, There's even items that specifically protect you from these, This forces you to pace yourself, Either that or risk death each time you drop from a platform. I can't wait to see what could come after this 3 first set of levels.

It is very much a project of love.\n\nThe idea is fairly simple, a side scrolling action adventure and a roguelike got down and had a baby. You will find many tropes familiar to you if you are a fan of either genres. That being said, execution is far more important than an orignal design. While this game doesn't break new ground necessarily, it does what it does very well. The controls are tight, and so far, for a early alpha, I've experienced very few bugs.\n\nIt's very difficult, but for the most part, that difficulty feels fair. You rushed when you should have scoped it out, or jumped into a fight that maybe you should have avoided.\n\nThe game feels pretty complete to me at this stage, however I am still honing my skills and have not been able to reach the lower levels.

The artwork combined with the amazing musical score depicts a state of whimsical malaise and curiosioty. This goes well with the randomly generated levels. The RPG elements are simple, yet have a complex and meaningful outcome as to not overcomplicate the decisions made in the leveling the process. In other words, you spend less time in "cause", and feel a lot more "effect" when spending your experience points. Your hero will develop and become powerful, while suddenly you say "Wow, I did that?" Many would wory that the RPG elements would make the permadeth even more frusterating... to the contrarty, the permadeth allows the player to reset and start over, learning from mistakes in a easy to use and non frustrating way. Again, simply put, the point spending in the leveling system is very simple to use, yet very effective and versatile.\n\nI take much pleasure in a game with many collectable items, gear, loot, etc... Vagante has that too. To no suprise whatsoever, it is incorperated well. The randomness of the dungeon keeps me playing. I am always all too excited to see how the levels will play out. This is why I personally love Rogue Lites, because no matter what, there is always unlimited replayability. As long as it is fun, addictive, and goal oriented. All of which, you can find in this game.\n\nExperience this journey for yourself.

For those who fear early access titles being left behind, the updates come really often (The two week period is real), now and again with significant content that alters gameplay in some way of form.\n\nThere is already content to be unlocked on the game (Perks, basically) and some are *specially* creative, to the point of making some playthroughts simply unique in shape and form.

There have been, for over a year now, consistent updates every 3 or so weeks, without fail. Developers like Nuke Nine are what gives me hope for the constantly abused Early Access system. Now that my gushery is over, let's look at the actual game.\n\nFor the presentation, we get a lovely score and sound design by Sam English that really eminates a feeling of solitude, but still encourages you to press on until you find that one magical sword or that one rare wizard hat. The sprites are to die for, the character sprites in particular. (These have since changed since the trailer released, so if you didn't like those, they aren't what I'm talking about.) Additionally, each of the four playable classes has four different sprites to choose from, with a grand total of 16 (20, if you count skeletons) different character sprites! Every animation is smooth and crisp, so everything looks exactly like it's intended to.\n\nRegarding the gameplay, the platforming is smooth, the combat is fun, and each class really feels different. Each trap or enemy placement makes total sense, so every piece of precious health lost really feels like it's the player's fault. The game is great fun on your own, sure, but playing with 3 friends is a complete blast, and truly feels like it works hand-in-hand with the singleplayer game. It doesn't feel tacked-on afterthought, but it doesn't feel like the entire focus of the game either, which is something a lot of these co-operative indie games in the market nowadays need more of, a proper singleplayer experience. I won't go into the intimate details of the gameplay mechanics too much, but I will grace over them. In terms of the game's meta, Vagante could described as a game of choices. Oh look, I found a spellbook! Do I offer it to a shrine, give it to the party Mage, or burn it at the campfire (between-levels resting place, where your inventory can be managed and you can get a bit of healing) and get extra health? Golly gee whiz, I killed a boss monster, now I have a key! Should I just open the big chest right away, save it for a later level, or use it on this mysterious door? I leveled up! Should I spend a point in a specific statistic, if so, strength or vitality? Should I use it on one of my classes 3 to 4 traits, such as the Wildling's Berserk or the Mage's Alchemy? The act of simply discussing the pros and cons of a decision with your party is a lot of fun, but don't think of Vagante as some intellectual debate room. If you have friends like mine, expect a lot of fun combat encounters, inside jokes to be shared, and arguments over who to revive from skeleton form. Lastly, heed this advice. Don't use a wiki. Heck, don't google anything. One of the coolest parts of Vagante is going out and finding out if x spell is a good counter against y boss, what happens if you kill the shopkeeper, etc.\n\nTL;DR: This game is the best to happen to Early Access. It's consistently updated, the gameplay is tremendous fun, and the presentation is spot on.\n\nFinal Rating: 10/10","May 17","true","71.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

This is a game that should not be missed by anyone looking to adventure and delve with friends, into a dark, rewardingly deep, and nuanced gameplay system. Everything about Vagante bleeds thought and deliberate design. You'll find the music, sounds, solid gameplay, level progression, and variety of a title that was made for the sole purpose of being played with friends.\n\nI have few if any faults to find in Vagante, the only negative I can think of is the modest length of the game. However, this is proved vindicated by the varied character types, builds, and random level design.\n\nPlay this game, enjoy this game.

I rarely put in as much time with a game as do I with this one and despite it being early access the game will provide you with alot of bang for your buck. As i sort of wish i didn't hear of this game until it's 1.0 release, these early iterations hold up quite well due to the awesome map generation and variety of different combinations of enemy placement that can occur. I've never hit that "oh this feels samey" when i replay it.\n\nYou'll wish there was more, simply out of your sinful urge to indulge...and then you'll realize your still getting your butt kicked in the 2nd stage out of 4 (50 hours in lol!), secrets are still being uncovered and your testing out the beta version of online with your steam pals...\n\nIf you have the iron will, You could always purchase it to support the devs and wait it out...but it will suck you in as soon as you start it up!\n\nIt might be a little more niche of a game then spelunky due to the extra systems it adds on but for anyone who's gotten bored of spelunky.....get this one....this is the one your looking for....","April 4","true","63.9"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","1"

This is a challenging game so if you are looking for a game that doesn't require a lot of thought and strategy you should probably try this out before commiting to a purchase.

There are a mix of familiar elements that fit well together and can easily be recognized by those who have played games with these elements in them. Because of that there are a lot of people who can just jump right in and start playing and just skip the tutorial.

When you die (And you will.) you can't blame anyone but yourself, The trial & error of detecting traps & pitfalls makes one have to be very cautious with the movement. The bosses are a real challenge when you face them, whether you dodge & take potshots or get up in their face, two screw ups & you will be in a very dangerous position. [Boss Goblin/Hobgoblin especially]\n\nHowever, I have a few qualms.\nBoth the Mage & the hidden character have little to no purpose to play as. The mage is physically weak & since most enemies rush you down, the only thing to do is use up a precious wand charge or run away & use Magic Missile. Running haphazardly in Vagante either leads you being cornered or dead via spikes & boulders. A skill that can cause him to levitate would aid with reversing rushing enemies.\n\nThe hidden character is an unarmed fighter, which isn't an issue, it's that she is bland. The aspect that makes Vagante fun from my standpoint is the unique abilities of each character, she has none. I believe this can be resolved is to have her gain more affinities the higher their level. Such as, every 2-3 levels is a new skill set for her. Unarmed skills would make her more exciting, such as a combo or directional attacks.\n\nVerdict: As it stands Vagante is an addicting game with satisfying gameplay, even though it is not finished, I am awaiting the later updates with much anticipation.\n\n7.5/10\nWould Recommend.","January 23, 2015","true","53.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

View feels a bit large, making bosses less intimidating.\n\nSound: 5.0 / 5.0: Sound quality is excellent, with reminiscent 8-bit sounds, and a very impressive soundtrack.  If the developer decides to sell the OST as a bundle with the game, or even seprately, I would gladly give pay for it.\n\nControl: 4.0 / 5.0 : Controls remains lightly clunky in favor of old school charm, having you plan for every melee attack.  While this can work for enemies, it makes some boss fights challenging, where bosses are more mobile, and (because of how you move) sometimes harder to avoid.\n\nFun Factor: 4.5 / 5.0 : A wonderful game that'll have you play over and over again.  Every level up point is very rewarding. I wish there was a way to form check points in later acts so as to not start again all the way from the beginning upon failure.  Choice of weapons could help add to customability in the beginning with the game, as the sword can be a frustrating first weapon.\n\nOVERALL:  A remarkable title, with hours of fun in store.

Inspiration drawn from some of my favorite games; Symphony of the Night, NetHack, Spelunky, Dark Souls.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with Roguelikes, this game has that beautiful duality of being incredibly relentless and at the same time incredibly rewarding. You die, and rage at yourself for whatever mistake it was that you made, and at the same time feel "okay, well now I know never to do THAT again." You'll be violently and permanently punished for your mistakes, but you'll learn, and you'll be back with a vengeance. It will challenge your gaming abilities on every level.\n\nOn the plus, the levels can compensate you for your intelligent use of strategy as well as your twitch reflexes. There are many ways to approach the game and the classes have a lot of contrast between them. It is extremely replayable.\n\nThe game already feels rich and nearly feature-complete in its current state, so why not jump in for the reasonable price? the value is already there, and the game will only get better over time.

The idea of permanent death leaves the players being more careful, since taking the wrong step could REALLY bring you down. The spikes and the falling boulders insta-kill, so be wary of the booby-traps. It's good to play when you're waiting for something like a League of Legends queue, or whatever the case may be.

The gameplay is smooth and the combat mechanics are well designed as far as I can tell so far. The game also holds to being a real time roguelike. It doesn't baby you at all... it's simply terrific. :D\n\n\n\nLittle personal design rant:\n\nOnly thing I could personally ask for is to remove randomness in damage (crits and "evasion" stat). Other than that this game is freaken amazing.\n\nSo far it seems that as you progress your skill in a weapon you unlock new techniques with that weapon. That is my FAVORITE type of progression in a game.

I would argue this game is far superior.

You've got your strategic elements, the option to flee from most threats until you get cornered, distinctly starting classes and intrinsic mutations, the unidentified items, wands, curses, gods and plenty of death.\n\nPeople with platforming skills should feel at an advantage playing this game over others, however, since the random map generation can often produce awkward jumps for the less-inclined to the genre, yet twitch reflexes commonly found on players of RTS or even FPS games can also help in many situations.\n\nIt is Early Access, however, so I can't really judge the game as a whole at this point. Is it fun? Yes: if you like true rogue-likes, this is definitely a good experience for you, even as a real-time action format. Is it hard? Somewhat: just like in any true rogue-like, you'll need a lot of luck on the items you find and the right strategy to deal with the monsters of the area depending on which class you picked. I personally like the music quite a bit, and the visual style is also quite polished already.\n\nI'm looking forward to seeing how the game will evolve over the course of EA. If you developers are reading this, here's what I personally think I'll want (even if post-EA):\n- More classes with different skills; the current four are good, but even more variety would be awesome.\n- Like the tutorial room, a room or room-type that lets you interact invulnerably against invulnerable creatures you've defeated at least once, as both a "trophy" system and a way to practice dealing with them as other classes perhaps.\n- An explanation on shrines in-game. It's not very obvious how you should interact with them for a complete newbie, and the hints on death don't really count.\n\nThis review might change if/when the game changes significantly or leaves Early Access, but it will always be a positive recommendation.\n\nIf you're not a developer of Vagante and you're still reading, buy the game!\nIf you're a developer of Vagante, keep up the good work! Looking forward to online multiplayer.","January 24","true","52.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Regardless, it felt good to finally complete it. I have been trying to play it every once in a while after a new update is released to test the improvements, and I can say these recent improvements have been some of my favorites.\n\nNow however I fear however the game might be too easy. I think it's going to take some time readjusting it and finding the sweet spots. (I managed to find 6 death protection necklaces in one playthrough.)\n\nI do appreciate the developer's watching people's feedback, and working to find that special spot that keeps everyone happy. From the time that I first saw this on indiedb compared to now it's almost a completely different game. (The new hud looks great, and thanks for the new tooltips)\n\nI no longer seem to find random crashes. Attacks are precise, and movement is fluent. I no longer feel like the game is limiting my ability to play. Instead I feel quite the opposite. Vagante is slowly becoming quite the polished game. I think I might have been a bit drastic on my last review, as I didn't give it the level of concentration that I first started the game out with. So for that I'm sorry. The game has indeed improved a lot. (Also please don't confuse me saying the game is being polished just because the difficulty was lowered. I did make it to the very end while everything was overtuned)\n\nEvery enemy I fought now had a reasonable weakness or way that it could be killed, and I was able to find that in combat. Loot seemed way more plentiful in single player, and I also think that made a huge difference. (maybe too plentiful or we need a new way to sell gear or do something with it)\n\nOnce again though, I think lowering the enemy damage might be a bit too much. (I stormed through the final level like it was nothing, not even fearing enemies, without selecting anything in vitality. (at the end I had 130 hp)) I found the beginning levels to be much more punishing when I was without gear, rather than the other way around.\n\nAnd finally, now that I've beaten it, I can be less salty about the game's flaws and focus on the things that I like.\n\nThe classes feel unique. I'm still not certain if I'm sold on all of the talents yet, but they get the job done. The Wildling is still my favorite class, and I'm glad to see new weapons for it. Getting a 3-4 very fast speed weapon for it made all the difference in my playthrough.\n\nEach enemy has it's own unique way of being dealt with, and I like that. In previous builds, some enemies seemed either impossible to beat, or just way too confusing / full of rng / impossible to kill without losing life / not worth your time. I feel like this has been fixed in the newer builds. Each enemy also has unique ways of dealing with you, which I also like. Some are still a bit unfair, such as the giant rock tree monster being able to 999 you if he lands on you, but I understand the developers want one shot mechanics. I would say a solution to this and the problem I mentioned above would be to make death protection something you can work towards as you play, rather than rng. This would make it so if people spent extra time crafting something, collecting something, giving up something, or a mixture of all of them, then they could craft or receive a death protection item rather than ending up with a lot of them by the end of the game.\n\nI also want to say that there was a point in time where this game's ai wasn't superb, and it made it so enemies felt clunky and out of place, almost just plopped into the game. I no longer feel this way. Enemies seem to have a purpose and seem to thrive in the environments that they are put in. Skeletons still need some work though.\n\nThe item list in the game is a decent size, and I'm hoping they continue to add more. I do feel like despite getting a lot of items, I very rarely swapped to new ones though, and this kind of worries me. It made me less inclined to pick up new things. Perhaps increasing the numbers on everything so you have more room to work with numbers in general. Maybe making it so every level adds a bit to the multiplier on new items found, so as you venture deeper, you can expect to find better loot, even if it is just slightly better.\n\nI really enjoy that you can keep playing once you have beaten the game. I love that it's seamless and it just transitions into the next tier of levels, as well as having the increased difficulty. It would be nice to see additional new things on the second playthrough, third playthough, etc.\n\nAnother thing I like is that vagante doesn't try to hold the reins too much. You go in, and you view everything in real time. No cutscenes, and quests even happen without the use of interface. I hope they continue to use this, as well as find a way to non intrusively tell a story.\n\nAll in all, Vagante has undeniably given me plenty of hours of gameplay. The 15 dollars I have spent I would say is worth it, and if anything I apologize about the last review I gave. It was childish for me to not give you guys the thumbs up at this point. The game is worth the full price, and I look forward to all future updates. I really hope that you guys build a light story around the game, add more quests in the style that you have done, and continue to grow the game out, offering additional levels, new items, new classes, new npcs, and new backgrounds.\n\nAs for my wants:\n\nI still want legendary weapons, lol. This also leads to my next want...\n\nI want more / different quests. I know we get the fox quest, and this is a step in the right direction. Seeing more variety will go a long way! Finding precursors for legendaries, or special keys that unlock new areas that you can only find on your second playthrough of the game (after beating it etc) would be wonderful. I want more oh my god moments from the items / quests that I find.\n\nI still think the tarot card reader / fortune teller is a good idea. Being able to find this old hag somewhere randomly in the levels, chance to spawn that gives you a chance to pick a card, with the option of changing your background, even to ones that you can't unlock through normal play.\n\nIt would be cool to see the shrines be shrines to gods that you're praying to, and to have them as bosses.\n\nA support class would be very welcome. I would love to see a cleric / bard / shaman.\n\nI still think we should be able to turn while we are attacking.\n\nMore npcs would be appreciated, especially ones that effected your gameplay, IE a portal master that maybe asks for something and in return teleports you to a random place, maybe not even on that level. Or maybe make this a bad thing and have it so if you see a portal master, he automatically teleports you somewhere random.\n\nMaybe you find a person / object that if something happens, it curses an item. These types of things would be more than welcome. This would add to diverse gameplay, as well as making sure that no playthrough played the same. Adding enough of these into the game, and keeping their chances of happening low is going to be the key to success there.\n\nMore things like the shop keep being angry at you for the rest of the game. We need more decision making in the game, and this is something, that while annoying is exactly what we need. We need more action reaction in the game. "if I pull this lever, level 2 will flood but a new gate will be open"\nor "if I scare off this npc I'll see it later on with friends" things of this nature would be very very welcome.","July 8, 2015","true","177.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","15"

At this state, there is not a whole variety of gear, everything is about the same, what we need are crazier effects. The devs are working constantly on the game though, which makes me really happy (in my pants). So I dearly and sincerely recommend Vagante to everybody who likes dungeon crawlers and rogue-lites. It is a well polished and pretty little game, that still has a way ahead of it.

There are some cool builds you can compose with different classes and skills, and discovering items is quite charming.\n\nHowever I personally could never reccommend this game.  It is incredibly unrewarding and not very sophisticated.  Monster AI is frustratingly simple (there, in fact, appears to be nothing akin to what I'd call AI). On one hand, you may delight in your developing perception and ability to anticipate monster behavior. On the other, if you're like me, you'll just lose interest every time you fall into a hole and get covered in monsters or fall onto a monster and subsequenly bounce into a spike trap. As I got better at the game, I found I could play for twenty to thirty minutes at a time but increasingly became aware of what a waste of time that made every single round.\n\nIn sum, this isn't the kind of game for people with other things to be doing.  If there was more in the way of persistent reward, I might change my mind a bit. However with frequent deaths caused by chance, often interrupting me at a point where I'd finally start enjoying the game, it's hard to want to be invested.\n\nI sincerely regret buying the game.","December 21, 2015","false","11.4"," 22 of 57 people (39%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","39","22","57","2","0"

The controls bear entirely too much "float" to them and fail to reliably interact with the game environment. Want to climb that ladder you're floating past? Sorry, but... yeah, no. Also, clinging to ledges is dodgy as hell, Oh yeah, and enemy projectiles will sometimes just not collide with the terrain. I get that it's early access, but damn that's some flighty control issues. Can't even get past the second floor because I just end up collision-erroring into pits of spikes. Maybe that's just me. All I know is that there's one thing I demand from games, especially difficult ones, and that is simply that their controls work. Since from my experience I have found the controls do not do that, well, I can't recommend this game. If you can look past the issues in control, the game does look rather nice, and has a pretty interesting idea behind it. I like the random loot system, it's just a pity that it doesn't help. All in all, I'd give this game a 4 or 5. I'd probably be down for giving it something closer to a 7 if the controls worked, but as-is I just can't get them to function reliably.","October 22, 2015","false","4.5"," 10 of 37 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","10","37","0","3"

Regardless of what sort of damage you take it'll occur as a knockback. When you get knocked back there's always a pit of spikes.

At its core concept is a good idea for a game, whose elements are proven in other successful fun games, but unsatisfyingly combined in this one. It sits like some kind of fusion between Spelunky, Rogue's Legacy, and... well, the original Rogue. If Rogue were a 2D platformer, it be about this.\n\nUnfortunately, I feel as if the game can't decide exactly what it wants to do. Spelunky chose to be, by and large, a puzzle game, where as Rogue's Legacy is far more of an action platformer. This is most evident in two factors: the kinds of traps and environments the games employ, and the damage systems they use.\n\nVagante takes a damage system more classically RPG. You have HP, and you deal damage to enemies based upon your attack power. Different kinds of enemies take different numbers of hit to defeat, This is a perfectly functional system on its own, suitable for a more action oriented Rogue-like platformer (such as Rogue's Legacy) but the environments in Vagante suffer a number of complications.\n\n1) Poor visibility. Everything seems just a little too small in my opinion, and the color palette is sort of bland and samey. These factors combine to make a game where it's sometimes easy to miss little things. You learn to cope, but it makes the difficulty curve that much steeper. There's just little reason for a game's graphics to making it harder. Further more, the fog of war effect that limits your vision of enemies to only areas visible from your current position can cause enemies to flicker in and out of sight in a way that humans have evolved to find particularly distracting.\n\n2) Bosses. A great idea to add to games like this, the bosses are very interesting to fight, save for the fact that somewhat clunky controls make it extremely difficult to come out with much HP. The real problem with bosses in my mind comes in with the addition of...\n\n3) Instant death traps. A fine game mechanic as well, but as you vie for positions fighting bosses, it's all to easy to get tossed or knocked back or be forced to flee and find yourself instantly killed by some form of instant death trap. Have you ever noticed that platformers tend to put bosses into boxed off, isolated rooms? There's a game design reason for that besides memory. The action aspect of a boss battle combines very poorly with any form of instant death for landing on the wrong tile.\n\nUltimately, for a game that wants to feature fighting enemies, it sure chose to have slightly awkward controls. You can't run left or right while attacking, and you can't jump while in the attack animation. The most effective way to fight is to explore and  use the random environment to your advantage whenever you can, but as you knock enemies back and wait for them to jump back up toward you, you find yourself in an action game that constantly forces you to break its flow if you want to survive.\n\nFlowbreaking aside, if the instant death traps vying for mental acuity with boss fights wasn't a problem and the controls were more polished, there's an issue of damage. Healing in the game is a bit TOO scarce. Ocassionally on some levels you can go almost unscathed, but on others you'll be lucky to leave barely alive, and when you're in the case of the latter, good luck having any chance of beating the following level.\n\nAll in all, this is yet again another 'rogue-like' game that's made itself more than 'difficult,' it's unreasonable.\n\nP.S.\nMore of a nitpick than anything, but the item system in this game is more busywork than anything. Unless you get particularly good items, they're not so much better or different than anything else to make the system matter. It's kind of inherently frustrating though that classes favor different types of items, resulting in a bunch of stuff you find not interacting with your abilities.","January 30, 2015","false","5.5"," 43 of 120 people (36%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","36","43","120","5","5"

I WANT THAT\ni am not paying for a product that doesnt even resemble the gameplay or functionality it had when i bought it.\nI DONT WANT THIS,   thus i uninstall and regret funding such a project.\n\n\nmind you they improve certain area's here and there, like navigating over edges or new character colors...(if developers would just focus on THAT sort of improvements there would be absolutely no problem)\n\n\nanyway i know you will purchase a game no matter what i say\nbut i just wanted to express the point that there was once a game named Vagante that i enjoyed very much\nbut instead of making a vagante 2 with the contrasting/contradictory/experimental mechanics or fundamentals... instead they half arsed ineptly change the enjoyables of the base game with no regard to people who enjoy the game the way it is.\n\nwhy dont they do what other developers have done and make a test/beta client that players download and play on so they can experience the new changes first BEFORE going ahead and changing the game?\n\nor or or... how about making a save state of the current game (the version i enjoy playing) and then sending me that version so i can play the version that i like.\nthat way you can carry on down that black hole and i can stay here relaxing in my chair playing a game i like???\n\nwow what a concept... providing a product the way people expect it to arrive.\ni go to mcdonalds and order a big mac,  i expect two all beef patties, special sauce, onions, tomato, lettuce, pickles, on a SESEME seed bun.\n\ni buy vagante, i expect the fundamental mechanics to be teh same at launch.\ni understand new graphical rendering for better framerates,  but changes from mana/energy to charges/tokens or whatever the ♥♥♥♥ next is what i would expect from a sequel.\ni bought vagante not vagante 2.\ni wanted vagante not... this.\n\ni literaly have to find a old torrent of an old distrobution and play that.\nand it's not piracy because ive already paid for the game.\nthe real pirates will be the dev when they refuse to change teh game back to the way it was.\ncuz obviously they're full speed ahead and can NEVER EVER consider reverting a change.\ni've never seen any game developer ratify the game after breaking it.","January 22","false","23.5"," 1 of 26 people (4%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","4","1","26","0","0"

Seriously, if it had more classes and races, and you had to fight your ghost, it'd be Stone Soup.\n\nProcedurally generated dungeons, random loot, and a leveling system.\n\nThe problem is that the leveling system is top heavy so you don't get much of anything from it from run to run, and you can only level up once per floor.\n\nThis game suffers heavily from almost relying entirely on its procedural elements.\n\nThe handling isn't terrible, but it often wont do exactly what it is that you want, magic requires mana but almost every spell is nearly useless outside of special situations (except for things like Heal) and any of the advanced elements of the game are going to require a lot of personal testing or research outside of the game.\n\nIf it interests you, keep an eye on it, but unless you're totally fine with things that aren't final products, save your money.","March 29, 2015","false","21.4"," 13 of 59 people (22%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","22","13","59","0","0"

Spelunky HD meets a roleplaying game (level up, stats, spells and skills,...)\n\nIt's challenging, has local co-op (yay!), the controls are very responsives: it takes some time to get used to them (even if you can rebind the keys/buttons) but once it's done you'll never fail because of them.\n\nSpeaking of failures, you'll die a lot in this game, but from what I saw it's always your fault.\n\nThe 3 classes (at the moment, which means on R11 -> with a bonus class that start the game without stuff or skills) play very differently which is good, and the different ways you can level up your class play quite differently too, so this is really nice.\n\nNow, about the co-op, which is the reason I bought the game in the first place (I like the singleplayer experience too but it's very different) :\n\nI really like the way the camera in handled. There is one camera (no splitscreen) which de-zoom/zoom to always show all the players. Some people might dislike this but for me it's the best way to handle this.\n\nThe singleplayer game has permadeath, but in co-op, if you die you can revive (if a living player is near you, so if all players are dead at the same time it's game over) as a skeleton. A skeleton can't wear/use/carry items, doesn't have skills and is very weak. This is an okay way to handle death in this type of games. Playing as a skeleton isn't very fun but at least you're still playing and you can get your full character back if you find a certain item (I'm not sure but I think there's one in each level if someone's dead).\n\nThe co-op experience is very fun. Like in Spelunky you'll have good laugh when your buddy fails miserably and makes you killed by accident (there isn't friendly-fire but clumsy people always find a way to get themself/others killed :D)\nIn conclusion I really like this game. I would recommend it even if it was a full release, the fact it's still in active development is just the cherry on top of the cake.","January 25, 2015","true","19.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Spelunky HD meets a roleplaying game (level up, stats, spells and skills,...)\n\nIt's challenging, has local co-op (yay!), the controls are very responsives: it takes some time to get used to them (even if you can rebind the keys/buttons) but once it's done you'll never fail because of them.\n\nSpeaking of failures, you'll die a lot in this game, but from what I saw it's always your fault.\n\nThe 3 classes (at the moment, which means on R11 -> with a bonus class that start the game without stuff or skills) play very differently which is good, and the different ways you can level up your class play quite differently too, so this is really nice.\n\nNow, about the co-op, which is the reason I bought the game in the first place (I like the singleplayer experience too but it's very different) :\n\nI really like the way the camera in handled. There is one camera (no splitscreen) which de-zoom/zoom to always show all the players. Some people might dislike this but for me it's the best way to handle this.\n\nThe singleplayer game has permadeath, but in co-op, if you die you can revive (if a living player is near you, so if all players are dead at the same time it's game over) as a skeleton. A skeleton can't wear/use/carry items, doesn't have skills and is very weak. This is an okay way to handle death in this type of games. Playing as a skeleton isn't very fun but at least you're still playing and you can get your full character back if you find a certain item (I'm not sure but I think there's one in each level if someone's dead).\n\nThe co-op experience is very fun. Like in Spelunky you'll have good laugh when your buddy fails miserably and makes you killed by accident (there isn't friendly-fire but clumsy people always find a way to get themself/others killed :D)\nIn conclusion I really like this game. I would recommend it even if it was a full release, the fact it's still in active development is just the cherry on top of the cake.","January 25, 2015","true","19.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Random dungeons layouts, lots of traps, and plenty of character customization options. Health is a precious resource as  you only heal 10 points per level at the campfire and potions of regeneration are rare. Sometimes you've taken too much damage to face the boss and have to move on to the next level without fighting and hope to find healing in the next level. Choose the types and circumstances of your battles wisely.\n\nYOU WILL DIE. This is not an easy game, but it is a fair game. If you take pleasure from getting better at a game, learning from defeat and progressing farther and farther each time, you will love it. If you hate losing and think insta-kill spikes and boulder traps are "unfair" and frustrate you, this is not the game for you. I used to die on spikes and boulders all the time. But now I know to hang on ledges, keep my eyes on the floor for triggers, and weigh the cost/benefit of jumping over spikes. It has taken me 350+ deaths to become what I would consider an experienced adventurer.  But is has been a lot of fun in the process.\n\nThe 4-player couch co-op is great.

Random dungeons layouts, lots of traps, and plenty of character customization options. Health is a precious resource as  you only heal 10 points per level at the campfire and potions of regeneration are rare. Sometimes you've taken too much damage to face the boss and have to move on to the next level without fighting and hope to find healing in the next level. Choose the types and circumstances of your battles wisely.\n\nYOU WILL DIE. This is not an easy game, but it is a fair game. If you take pleasure from getting better at a game, learning from defeat and progressing farther and farther each time, you will love it. If you hate losing and think insta-kill spikes and boulder traps are "unfair" and frustrate you, this is not the game for you. I used to die on spikes and boulders all the time. But now I know to hang on ledges, keep my eyes on the floor for triggers, and weigh the cost/benefit of jumping over spikes. It has taken me 350+ deaths to become what I would consider an experienced adventurer.  But is has been a lot of fun in the process.\n\nThe 4-player couch co-op is great. Personally I think 4 is a crowd and prefer to play with 2-3.","July 15, 2015","true","46.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love it and would reccomend it to others. So far I haven't seen any bad problems except I feel the mage is way to weak in the begining. I do great with the Knight and I love the rouge class and also ??? but the Mage is by far the hardest. I've played the mage the most dying over 200 times with him barely making it to the forest in the last few tries. Maybe work on the Mage Class a bit more to make it a bit easier unless they are trying to make it hard difficulty. The specialties for each class are fantastic and smart. For example Knight has a shield, Rouge has shadow stealth and Mage can read what the potions really are. For an alpha I give it a 7/10, a 9/10 if they make the Mage class a bit better.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vineheart01/recommended/323220/","vineheart01","Vineheart01","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vineheart01/","93 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nVagante is an oddly fun and addictive game for how simple it is. It suffers from the usual rogue-like problems where RNG dictates a LOT of the game (gear, map layouts, shrines, etc) but usually you can work with whatever the game gives you anyway.\n\nThe Good:\n-Diverse Ways to Play. Vagante not only has 4 classes to play, but they can be played in multiple ways. You can play this game for hours and rarely have the same playstyle happen twice in the same sitting.\n-Abundance of Danger w/o Being Unfair. This game has spikes and crushing traps that will kill you intantly, not to mention tons of arrow traps and mobs to wittle your health down. However as long as you pay attention and take your time, they are nothing more than keeping you on your toes. Relax too much, and you die.\n-Bosses. The bosses are optional big bad guys in each floor. They give you a full level and a key to open a big chest for phat lewts. I have not experienced the new Catacomb bosses yet, since the Catacombs have been owning my butt since they revamped them, but the 7 before the catacombs are very fun and challenging fights. Except the Golem Boss...screw him lol.\n-Tight Controls. Much like Spelunky, i never feel like the games' controlling mechanics screwed me over. Every time i died, i knew it was my own fault and not the game.\n\nThe Bad:\n-Bad or Useless Skills. Some of the skills you can learn when you level up are just total trash. This isnt a huge problem, since its only a glaring issue for a couple of the dozens of builds you can do, but its a problem nontheless.\n-RNG for the Wrong Class. Sometimes this happens to me where i'll play a Warrior and get Wand/Book drops left and right. Now, you should have access to everything, but i really wish it would lean more towards gear meant for that class (i.e. swords have a higher drop rate and wands have a lower drop rate as a warrior)\n-Useless Gear. Due to the way the Skills work, some gear are useless by default. Things like hammers or maces will literally never be useful to a Warrior, which makes no sense.\n-Instant Kill Blade Traps. Catacombs in the old days were more of a placeholder than an actual level. Since theyve been revamped, they are now brutal - and i mainly blame the overabundance of instantdeath traps. Spikes are one thing, but the 10 blade traps one after another while im trying to dodge a jumping Hand is just too much. Really wish they'd be toned down a bit.\n-Golem Boss. This is the only boss i have a problem with. He swings VERY rapidly and hits REALLY hard (20-28 per hit) not to mention he chucks boulders that hit just as hard with uncanny accuracy. You'd think something thats suppose to be a living rock wouldnt be so fast or accurate. The crushing thing makes total sense, and that usually never happens unless youre just ballsy stupid anyway. But he can shave your health off REEAAALLLY fast and its hard to land even a single hit without getting whacked at some point.\n\nOverall: 8/10. The game is still early access, but even as it is the game is very fun and addictive. With the exception of the Blade Trap thing i mentioned, all of my quirks can usually be ignored due to the RNG system being in your favor.","December 7, 2015","true","35.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's near impossible for me to get out of water because if you're at the top of the water level your character only jumps a hair above, not enough to get out. You have be under the water and then move up and time your jump to get out... something I find HIGHLY annoying. Infact it's really the only thing about this game that annoys me as much as it does. Enemy's are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s in the catacombs too with the spikes and what not...\nButt, (teehee i said butt) Aside from those things, listed above, and a wierd glitch with the The Bloody where my stats get LOWERED, this game is really good and I believe you should play it.\nI'm also very bad at giving reviews.\n:)","December 26, 2015","true","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I like being able to walk into the next room and say "Hey wanna play a couple hours of Vagante?" and jump right in. Don't get me wrong since i bought it I have been playing it a minimum of 3 hours a day  so I can't say I have explored it enough to say it one of the better early access games I have gotten my hands on. Sad to say the only thing that is bugging me right now is the random crashes but other than that I have had no problems ( the crashes have only happened twice).

The game can be approached from any mindset and style.\n\nCons:\n-There could certainly be more things to unlock. I haven't gotten everything, but I know that there should be more reward and variation for actually completing a run.\n-Some updates have changed things for the worse.

But before I go into them, I need to commend the devs on what they did well, but there are rightly an endless amount of comments dedicated to that, so I won't go into detail there.\nHere are my problems with the game:\nThe arrow traps on walls are in some situations virtually impossible to dodge without taking damage.\n\nSome of the bosses are quite unfair, the only one I really have a problem with so far is the boss goblin, who moves way too fast, frequently and erratically in relation to the average reach of most weapons.\n\nI feel like there isn't enough variety or control over your character's stats near the start of the game for you to tailor him to your play-style, also I think there should be more means of progression on the long term.\n\nAs well as you not having much control over your stats, you don't really have much control over your inventory in that, pretty much all of the single-use potions and scrolls are 'unidentified' and you can't really use them that tactically because you don't know what they are, which adds to my next point because you can accidentally use a health potion when it's not needed, adding to frustration.\n\nA lot of this is made more annoying by how difficult it is to recover health, so each loss of health is felt much more and pointless, unfair losses of health can make the game very frustrating.\n\nthere isn't a whole lot of content for how much this game costs.\n\nAnd just in case there's some content in-game that addresses any of my problems, I am brought to my final point; that the tutorial could be a bit more fleshed-out, or even just tips every time you die, like in 'Rogue Legacy'.\nWell done to devs by the way, I have total faith that this game will keep improving and you'll have a modern classic by the time you're done with it.\n\nExtra note: I think for a perma-death game like this, I think that the spike traps should justdo a lot of damage rather than instantly kill you.","July 31, 2015","true","82.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","6"

Too bad, try again.\nAnd while this game features many instant kills (watch the spikes and falling heavy objects), it doesn't neccesarily feel cheap.\nMaybe the first few times where you discover those insta-kill you, but after a while, you learn how to avoid them.\nIt helps that the same rules apply to enemies (with the exception of bosses, though they do take damage).\nYou can knock or lure enemies in traps to kill them without losing anything from it, mostly.\n\nThe classes are your typical RPG classes: Warrior, Mage and Rogue (Archer/Assassin blend).\nThere seems to be more in development, with one other class available right now, but the first 3 are clearly the base classes.\nTHe game also features a levelling system, you get experience from killed enemies.\nAfter every level, there is a hub area, where you can save for another time, heal up a bit (this is always available, after every level) and you get your level up there.\nThis will grant you one point which you can spend on either a skill or a stat.\nThe skills really change the gameplay and while they have a max level, every point spent in them is noticable and changes the way you play a bit.\nThis way you can specialise, while not limiting yourself.\nAside of that you also have your items to gather (sadly, they are not visible on your character) that range from weapons, armor, spellbooks (spells), potions and more.\nWhile every character has a skill bound to a specific weapon-type, every class can equip everything.\nSo even the battlemages can work perfectly, they are just not as damaging with melee as a knight would be for example.\n\nThere is also a lot of things to discover in every level.\nEspecially at the start, you will wonder what some things do.\nWhile there is a (mandatory, i think) tutorial at the start of the game, not everything gets explained.\nThough some things get hinted at in the tips you see when you have died.\nWhich will happen a lot.\nTrust me.\n\nTl;Dr:\nFun, entertaining and punishing game.\nFun for up to 4 players in couch co-op (soon to feature online though!) but also fun for solo players.\nCertainly recommend it to pretty much everyone.","January 10","true","57.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But before I go into them, I need to commend the devs on what they did well, but there are rightly an endless amount of comments dedicated to that, so I won't go into detail there.\nHere are my problems with the game:\nThe arrow traps on walls are in some situations virtually impossible to dodge without taking damage.\n\nSome of the bosses are quite unfair, the only one I really have a problem with so far is the boss goblin, who moves way too fast, frequently and erratically in relation to the average reach of most weapons.\n\nI feel like there isn't enough variety or control over your character's stats near the start of the game for you to tailor him to your play-style, also I think there should be more means of progression on the long term.\n\nAs well as you not having much control over your stats, you don't really have much control over your inventory in that, pretty much all of the single-use potions and scrolls are 'unidentified' and you can't really use them that tactically because you don't know what they are, which adds to my next point because you can accidentally use a health potion when it's not needed, adding to frustration.\n\nA lot of this is made more annoying by how difficult it is to recover health, so each loss of health is felt much more and pointless, unfair losses of health can make the game very frustrating.\n\nthere isn't a whole lot of content for how much this game costs.\n\nAnd just in case there's some content in-game that addresses any of my problems, I am brought to my final point; that the tutorial could be a bit more fleshed-out, or even just tips every time you die, like in 'Rogue Legacy'.\nWell done to devs by the way, I have total faith that this game will keep improving and you'll have a modern classic by the time you're done with it.\n\nExtra note: I think for a perma-death game like this, I think that the spike traps should justdo a lot of damage rather than instantly kill you.","July 31, 2015","true","82.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","6"

It’s like the pixelated version of the Dark Souls’ franchise you wish you could play on a potato powered by combustible lemons but couldn’t because A) you had no potatoes that had a 1920x1080 LCD screen, and B) you had no combustible lemons because those were outlawed after Aperture Science used them to burn your house down.  …With the lemons.  Now that I’ve got your attention, my review will follow.\n\n[GRAPHICS/ART STYLE]\n\nThe graphics portion of Vagante is more like a lifestyle choice when someone says they’re Demisexual.  They’re not bad by any means but the game has its own flair and spark to it through the quirky pixelated art.  Every dungeon, though dark, bleak, grey, sad, and full of everything that wants to have you murdered so their children can live another day to avoid being grave robbed or psycho mass-murdered, it has a dilapidated feel to it, like other dungeon crawlers before you were killed there and you want to just loot their dead bodies for the stuff they were carrying.  The sprites are interesting and remind me something of Terraria in their forms.  It has a gothic, playfully serious tone to it and looks like an adventure waiting to happen.\n\n[GAMEPLAY]\n\nGameplay is addicting, fun, and the “just one more time” kind of vibe to it.  I will say though, that the remapping the controls to your liking helps EXTREMELY unless you’re used to using the D-pad to move around instead of using the left thumbstick.  The in-game text involving button use is literally “button 1, 2, 3, 4” etc. and isn’t labeled as “Press X, A, B, Y,” etc. instead.  It’s not that big of a deal but it is a little frustrating when you don’t remember which button you assigned as “button 4”.\n\nThere are shops located around each dungeon area in which you can buy things from using the coins you just pawned off some dead creature just trying to feed its family in a run-down community home you just sacked.  You can choose to buy things or not to buy them.  Additionally, you can do neither of those things and instead kill the shopkeeper and steal all his gear.  Depending on how skilled you are at not getting crushed by surprise boulders, getting shanked by a bunch of spikes or even killed by dragons, flying eyeballs, arrows, and drowning, you can kill him.  Did I mention you will likely get killed by a boulder?\n\nThe leveling up system in Vagante is more akin to your traditional level-up system in any normal RPG.  You have Strength, Intelligence, etc. but also perks you can pick.  So it’s akin somewhat to Fallout 4’s level-up system and it’s pretty damn cool.  There’s not too much to say about it other than\n\n[SOUND DESIGN/MUSIC]\n\nI normally do not review particular sounds or music in games.  But as plain as Vagante is, it has a very fantasy like vibe.  It’s not epic (lookin at you, Skyrim), it’s not really a fruity fantasy thing (here’s looking at you, Oblivion!), but it is—as I said—very gothic but not brooding.  It’s an adventure.  But all the sounds and the plain music (if I recall, there is some music) all make for a wonderful atmosphere.  You spend more time concentrating on not getting crushed to death by boulders and killed by the 3rd son of the slime you murdered eight dungeons ago, but the sounds are nice to listen to.\n\nSo here’s the rundown.\n\nPros:\n+ Art style is brilliant, dark, and different\n+ Gameplay is addicting\n+ Combat is plain but it helps keep you on your toes and doesn’t require a lot of thinking or planning\n+ gear is not hard to come by\n\nCons:\n- buttons not labeled as on controller (not that big of a deal though)\n- Game likes to hang up a little here and there but since its early access it’s forgivable\n- boulders have a higher K/D ratio than you will after two dungeon runs\n\n10/10 would get constantly killed by boulders again\n","March 14","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is enough randomness to keep me coming back to what i can only describe as an artistic rendition of a smash-your-face-into-a-brick-wall sim. Several classic styled equips and items from similarly styled older games exist within an extremely challenging package. As with most of these types of games, there are the standard strategies involved in progression and there are rewards for grinding through countless deaths.\nWhat sets this apart other than what i consider perfectly executed atmospheric stylizations, is the fact that at no point is that great item going to make you beat the game, only make it slightly less ridiculous. And there is almost no guarantee that you will find anything useable to your current build causing you to change tactics and approach on the fly. There is enough regularity to create a foundation of approach, but enough randomness to encourage a variety of newly invented curse words to project at your screen.\n\nTLDR: buy it","March 13","true","59.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Too bad, try again.\nAnd while this game features many instant kills (watch the spikes and falling heavy objects), it doesn't neccesarily feel cheap.\nMaybe the first few times where you discover those insta-kill you, but after a while, you learn how to avoid them.\nIt helps that the same rules apply to enemies (with the exception of bosses, though they do take damage).\nYou can knock or lure enemies in traps to kill them without losing anything from it, mostly.\n\nThe classes are your typical RPG classes: Warrior, Mage and Rogue (Archer/Assassin blend).\nThere seems to be more in development, with one other class available right now, but the first 3 are clearly the base classes.\nTHe game also features a levelling system, you get experience from killed enemies.\nAfter every level, there is a hub area, where you can save for another time, heal up a bit (this is always available, after every level) and you get your level up there.\nThis will grant you one point which you can spend on either a skill or a stat.\nThe skills really change the gameplay and while they have a max level, every point spent in them is noticable and changes the way you play a bit.\nThis way you can specialise, while not limiting yourself.\nAside of that you also have your items to gather (sadly, they are not visible on your character) that range from weapons, armor, spellbooks (spells), potions and more.\nWhile every character has a skill bound to a specific weapon-type, every class can equip everything.\nSo even the battlemages can work perfectly, they are just not as damaging with melee as a knight would be for example.\n\nThere is also a lot of things to discover in every level.\nEspecially at the start, you will wonder what some things do.\nWhile there is a (mandatory, i think) tutorial at the start of the game, not everything gets explained.\nThough some things get hinted at in the tips you see when you have died.\nWhich will happen a lot.\nTrust me.\n\nTl;Dr:\nFun, entertaining and punishing game.\nFun for up to 4 players in couch co-op (soon to feature online though!) but also fun for solo players.\nCertainly recommend it to pretty much everyone.","January 10","true","57.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Maybe hate it more, but still love it. Me and my brother play this, get rekt, and do it all again just for the hell of it. Surprising to see this still in development in 2014, and look where we are. Updates sastisfy me, but will this game sastisfy YOU? Well, let me explain my thoughts, to give you an impression.\n\n+ Okay Indie "Spelunky" RPG game.\n+ Unique playstyle.\n+ Clean graphics and art.\n+ Difficult but rewarding... sometimes.\n+ A variety of playstyles.\n+ The atmosphere of the game makes you feel pretty confident in yourself (THAT IS YOU LOSE IT ALL WHEN YOU DIE).\n+ Has average controller support (My crappy controller works on this... somehow).\n\n- Can be brutal (Seriously, you can die in seconds if you don't know what you're doing).\n- WAAAY too many spikes/traps. I bring this up because in other games, my brother and I don't come along traps very often. When we do, we are eager to avoid it. In this case, you'll be walking through the Dark Caves, super cautionously to make sure your ♥♥♥ doesn't get plucked with spikes.\n- You can be overpowered really quick, unless you get the proper gear when heading into the next area. If you just speedrun through all the areas, you'll get destroyed, with the exception of people who DO speedrun this... somehow.\n+/- Can be confusing with the "worship statues" (I call them that). The Light is to donate money to heal, and the Blacksmith is super useful when it comes to throwing away extra items. Although you won't even know what they do unless you try.\n\nIn conclusion, I stress over this game to try and do a good run. So far, I play the Knight class a lot since the sword spam lmao.

Its impressive to see how well the game evolves.\n\n<3\n","July 11, 2015","true","55.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Probably more than you do on any dark souls games. Trust me, accept your fate in this game and just enjoy it. The game is amazing. It is pretty much what i have been waiting for when it comes to this genre. It does what Spelunky does but way better. The other game close to this game would be Catacomb Kids. Catacomb Kids and Vagante have pretty much beaten any game this year in terms of replayability and overall in the fun category.","April 4","true","94.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Everything is fast and you can do ♥♥♥♥ from start or great and then die. But I don't think this game is worth the 15 dollars. I think it's more of a 5 to 4 dollar game. Like it has beautiful graphics I'm a sucker for these graphics and stuff. The combat is good cause you can kite the ♥♥♥♥ out of stuff. You can even just down air the hell out of a dragon but still get hit. The shop keeper has a nice touch where he will follow you until he dies which is cool. But for all it is, i might as well play Magicite or something how about Spelunky? All I can say is lower the price to 7, 6, or 5 dollars for what it is. All i can say it's a good game overall but should cost less.","April 16","true","12.6"," No ratings yet 2 people found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

This inculdes difffuclt but fair gameplay, random potions, difficult bosses, prcodeduraly generated goodness and tactical/strategic gameplay. Amazing (dark souls feeling) pixel art graphics added to that, with a beutiful soundtrack, tight controls and regular updates ensures vagante in the small (but growing) club of early-access done right.","April 8","true","9.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dishes/recommended/323220/","dishes","Dishes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dishes/","87 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSo far I'm having a blast with this game. It's a simple dungeon crawler, theres no story and it doesn't hold your hand what so ever, you're left to explore and figure out the various mechanics on your own which might deture some away, but I only see as a challenge. The biggest confusion was the chicken and the.. fairy? Sure, fairy. The totorial filled me in somewhat on what to do, but just enough to get me going.\n\nI wouldn't hate having some story, but honestly its not really needed. the game is fun on its own. the Perma death is frustrating and demoralizing but it just makes me want to get back into the fray and try again.\n\nJust one final thought to the developers: maybe while holding right trigger you can grab onto the boulders and pull them? I dropped a boulder onto a door and cant move it out of the way.. after the epic boss fight and no phasing gloves im forced to restart. Other than that, fantastic game!","June 5","true","11.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
