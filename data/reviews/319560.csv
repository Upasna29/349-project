For new players, this is a God game. You can manipulate the land to allow your autonomous citizens to build bigger houses, generating more mana and allowing bigger God powers, such as fire, lightning and marshes. The general idea is to collect totems containing new powers and to wipe out your opponent! There are plenty of islands to keep you occupied and you are even able to partially amend the way later levels start once you complete them (this affects the islands for everyone as the changes are saved online)\n\nYou don't directly control your people. In fact there are only 3 actions they can perform: Settle (where newly 'born' people create buildings to increase population growth & mana rate), Gather (they head to the marker that you place as one of your powers), Fight (pick a fight nearby). Combining gather with the other two actions gives you enough control as you need. You can also force people out of houses, but this leaves the house open for invasion.\n\nThe game is much harder than I expected. The AI seems to very rapidly build up it's strength (I'm not sure how, but expect I'll learn with time) and begins attacking early. Thay naturally also have access to God powers and can lay waste to your houses if you're not careful. I've just started a world with all 4 tribes on it (apparently all against me!) and it's pretty much chaos! Fun, but chaos! The new update has introduced the option to turn off the 'kindle' option (which allows you to produce people from houses early), this makes the game much more playable and less of a click frenzy.\n\nThe latest update has also improved the UI in terms of allowing edge scrolling (phew). In addition there are some keyboard shortcuts but only for high level selection of the group of spells, not individual ones. Click sensitivity also seems to be a bit off, if you don't click the upper part of the spell icon it doesn't register. One gripe is that the ESC key turns off fullscreen mode, rather than the expected standard of opening a menu and skipping the intro (which you apparently cannot).\n\nThe terrorforming tool (which you use constantly) is normally available and automatically selected (e.g. launch some fire and you switch back to terrorforming immediately), except sometimes it's not (e.g. lay some marsh and you apparently have nothing selected). So there's a bit of inconcistency which may just be a bug that gets fixed later (hopefully).\n\nThe graphics are simple pixel art, but nice to look at, check out the pics & video! It can be unclear at times exactly which square your cursor is on, due to its shape, and as a result launching powers at exact points can be tricky (although exact aim doesn't really matter *that* much. The map edge is tricky to visualise because there is a blurred effect, particularly at the bottom of the screen, and anything built there is slightly obscured (again not *that* bad but could be clearer). The power effects are fairly reasonable although things like fire and lightning storm can obscure things behind them.\n\nThe sound effects are basic but well suited to the feel of the game. There is no music, surprisingly, but I never have the music on anyway. Find yourself some good tunes to listen to and forget about in game music!\n\nSo in summary, it's a good remake of the classic Populous game, fun and challenging, looks and sounds ok. The latest update has made the game more playable, with the edge scrolling and no kindle option. For the price it's definitely worth it. I expect it's going to bring many hours of fun and frustration and what more can you want!!","September 15, 2014","true","12.3"," 54 of 57 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","54","57","0","0"

This game is BETTER than Populous.\n\nIt does drop you in it at points, but not like a roguelike, where yo are supposed to figure stuff out, more like it has a basic campaign that teaches you the mechanics of the game, then the next time you log in, with no warning, you are faced with the "universe" screen.\n\nWhen you start in the universe, you have a new ability set, 'Rage' that you only discover a bit later on, it's based on aggro against you, and is different to Mana. I think that Amulets (items found in the world) may unlock it's abilities.\n\nXP is added, too - levelling up the destructiveness of your abilities. I 'think' it mostly gives them a bigger AOE, and gives your Heros more health, not that they need it.\n\nBigger buildings spawn new tribesmen faster, and they are stronger.\nbuilding size is purely dependant on the amount of clelear space around them, if they have room to grow, they do, instantly.\n\nSo, The Review;\n\nI can't be botherd reviewing this.

Forests, for example, generate mana for you when built next to your settlements (though the game doesn't tell you this).  After beating the 5th campaign level, you'll unlock a skirmish mode and "the universe".  Again, the universe isn't all that well explained, but my best guess is that it allows you to travel to different systems to play different campaigns.  There's also passive multiplayer in the sense that you can see other players' legacies...my best guess is that it's all some sort of leaderboard system.

First, and most importantly, the programmer is actively monitoring for feedback and tweaking the game to improve the overall experience. Secondly, it provides interesting innovations that warrant grabbing this instead of just going back and playing the original Populas game. Third, and most important, it's not by Peter Molyneux. (That may seem like the least important element, but go give Godus a look over and really dig into the commitment and how many of those commitments have been broken-- then come back and compare against this game where the developer is actively engaged with his community. The difference is night and day.)\n\nThe game ramps up steadily in difficulty. (plus)\nThe game is at its core a God game. (plus)\nThe AI is not overwhemling in any map, yet offers a decent challenge in the latter maps. (plus)\nThis was not always the case (in the initial release, the AI over utilized one of its free powers resulting in an unplayable game-- but the dev fixed this in the first week of player feedback.)\nIt's inexpensive (plus)\nIt has a lot of campaign content (30 maps, plus.)\nIt has an even larger number of "Universe" maps (not sure about the total, plus)\n\nSome of the negatives:\nThis is a retro pixel game (negative for some, not for me)\nYou have very limtied control over your populants/peeps (negative for some, not for me)\nNo music (but new sounds that go with the game play, and you can always use the Steam Beta Music Player to play the original Reprisal Soundtrack, if you like. Negative for some, not for me.)\nScrolling is rough (keyboard tapping required, or a newly introduce mouse scroll which still needs some work. This is a negative but the dev is working to improve the overall experience so a plus for me.)\nMap visibility is limited (this is a negative, but it is an homage to the retro Populas UI. There are some differences. Some find this frustrating. I can let it go.)\n\nThe only item that is a real negative for me, the author has committed to working on a fix. (The most likely is center-mouse-button-click-and-drag to move the camera around.)\n\nSo I don't really have any problems with the game. I'd give it a 8.5/10 personally. And, I expect further development will be done to address remaining issues.\n\nIf you're looking for the spiritual successor to Populas, or just looking for a God game to scratch that itch... Buy this, it'll be a number of hours of retro fun.

(Usually the beta is the unusably broken version and the non-beta that installs for all new players by default is the stable playable version.) But doing that, while it fixes the second map, ultimately just gives the interface more opportunity to drive you insane. The terraform tool can't be turned off to use the tool to expand settlements. The terraform tool works maybe 60% of the time? Otherwise you have to click twice in the same spot.

Upon entering, you get a rather basic series of text pop ups from some character you have no idea who they are, telling you vaguely what to do, and then they bugger off, leaving you pretty clueless on really what you need to do at all. Not only this, but the AI you'll be going against in the tutorial isn't limited in their abilities like you are, because you haven’t got to that part in the tutorial that you can unlock them yet, so more often than not, you're going to be obliterated by this AI in the tutorial. Since there's no cap on what they can do, or anything slowing them down, it’s a pretty unfair setup against a brand new player to the game when you’re meant to be teaching them what to do.\n\nAfter a very unfair tutorial, which spans over quite a long time if you include all the hours you likely spent attempting to figure out what to do, you'll finally get to unlock the universe. The universe acts as a global scoreboard, but by then you might walk off and do something else because you're already bored with it.\nOnce you figure out what you need to do, it's a relatively simple game to play, and there's little progress or real grit in it to hold your interest for long. In short bursts, yeah, it can be a neat little thing to pass the time, but so is Sudoku or a cross-word puzzle, both of which I'd put it on par with.\n\nOne issue that really stood out to me though is the lag. When flattening or rising the land in large quantities the game would lag terribly for me, and this is certainly not down to my computer as I can play AAA games with ease. It's pretty aggravating when speed is usually the thing to need most of to beat the AI,  and certainly broke the immersion for me while trying to flatten a mountain and the in-game pointer is trailing behind where I just moused over.\n\nIt's not necessarily a 'bad' game, but there's really not that much there. It'd probably do better as a tablet or phone app rather than a full PC game. Maybe consider getting it when it's on sale, but it's not really worth going for it otherwise.","November 25, 2015","false","2.1"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

A "god" game, like Black and White (*Sigh).  You do not directly control your population, but rather build terrain, summon spells, and influence population and movement.\n\nPros:\n- Art style is awesome.\n- Interface is sleek and clean\n- Map/world is almost exactly like populus.\n\nCons:\n- Scrolling the map is unecessarily slow. There also doesnt appear to be an option to just drag (like a right click/drag). You use WASD, which is tedious.\n- The actual playable space on the screen is a fraction of the screen. I can see why they did this, as an ode to populous, but it doesnt really make a lot of sense and the space you COULD have used to see more of the map is not used for no real reason.\n- Kinda shallow. You spend time either evicting people from their homes to force them to create new ones, which expands terriotory and overall army strengthm or you use powers. The powers look cool, but there isnt really any situation, at least IMO, that any power is particularly useful in a specific situation.\n\nNeutral:\nI have never failed a mission and i use basically the same techniques each time.  The levels dont seem to force you to adjust like most well designed games do. This is a bit of a bummer.","March 24","true","5.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's definitely not worth ~7€ on normal price.\nIt offers not enough content for that price at all.\n\nIt copies the simple concept of Populous rather good. But there are too many issues, so I rather not recommend this, not even for nostalgia or on sale:\nThere are no tooltips whatsoever, you have no idea what the buttons do.\nThey get mentioned at some point but if you miss it (or forget it, because the UI feels cluttered), you're screwed.\nMenus are confusing, to end the game you need to click "options" in the bottom left.\nThe game starts with a kind of a tutorial style, it gives you the very basics of the game, with as less information as possible.\nYou get more powers overtime. Still, terraforming and let your people fight is pretty much the only thing you do in the beginning. It's very repetitive and gets boring very quickly.\nYou ofen times missclick, make land higher/lower than you want because the game lags but if it works as intended it works smooth.\nSkirmish mode is locked for some reason and there's no reason as to why, because no tooltips. I assume you have to play the campaign (where it starts with a tutorial) first to be able to play skirmish or up to a certain point. But really, no idea.\nMaps are tiny.\nOthers mentioned it in their reviews: The fire casting of your opponent is annoying. It's casted almost constantly when you get "near" your opponent or rather in his reach.\n\nBut most of all, the game seems to be locked at 30FPS.\nThe fun thing here is, it only gets the 30FPS at the loading screens. As soon as the game starts, framedrops to 25 and usually below that. If you get to populate not even half the tiny map you won't get more than like 16/18FPS.\nIt's laggy all the time and the gameplay suffers heavily from it.\nI wonder how awful it gets in case the maps get bigger and you get more powers with more abilities graphically "straining" your hardware. Of course this issue may be different for every person with their hardware being different to mine.\nBut 16GB RAM, an ASUS Strix GTX 970 and an Intel i7-4770 should easily be able to give this far beyond 60FPS at all times out of the box.\n\nThe design is actually very pretty and there's absolutely potential for this game, so one should maybe keep an eye on it but I won't recommend this game as of yet.","July 19, 2015","false","0.8"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Reprisal had some very well-crafted NES-style chiptunes that played on a loop during each mission and it gave the game such a feeling of tension and character that it was a major selling point for the original browser game. For some reason the designers decided for the premium release that the game would be better served with some ambient sounds of waves crashing and grass blowing in the wind. I think that was a major error in their judgement because the music from the browser game is simply brilliant. I don't understand why they decided to remove a feature from their premium game rather than adding a feature (they could have given you an option to turn the music off if you preferred just the ambient sound, which would have made much more sense). It's not just nitpicking: that music was awesome and was an important part to why Reprisal felt like a fully-polished product even when it was a free browser game. I can't say I'm not disappointed.\n\nStill love the game, and I have to give it a thumbs up because I do recommend it, but go out of your way to find that chiptuned music (by Eric Skiff) because it makes the game so much better to have that on loop.","June 28, 2015","true","1.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Its not a bad potato, it is like a baked potato with sour cream but sans bacon bits, so there is room for improvement, and it is definitely a far cry from french fries which is the standard world builder/empire manager, or the poutine which is Age of Empires for example. Overall it offers some unique mechanics of terraforming and other environmental manipulation through use of totems, and rudimentary population control. It has point and click mechanics and basic empire building and command control. I would recommend it as a budget title to play casually however there is much better out there.","July 13, 2015","true","0.4"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","38","3","8","2","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/solocitizen/recommended/319560/","solocitizen","Solocitizen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/solocitizen/","70 products in account","A lot of people call this game a Populace clone, but I don't know what populace is and so I'll have to give you an assesment based on its own merits. Reprisal Universe is a fun, fast paced, god simulator title that pits you and your tribe against other tribes. As the god figure for your own little band, it's your job to lead them to victory through manipulation of the terrain and use of your godly powers (conjuring lightning storms, creating volcanos, summoning heroes, ect.). As I said it's fast paced with a typical match lasting from anywhere between seven to fifteen minutes, making it a nice little game to play while taking a break from something else or whenever you're looking to kill a few minutes. That said, I find that it gets a bit repetative and can get old fast. As I said, it's a game you play for short stints not hours on end. It's got a nice pixelated asthetic going on for it as well.\nI also have to point out that Reprisal Universe doesn't do anywhere nearly enough to explain some of its mechanics, such as what exactly legacy points are (they're points you get for "Reprising" worlds but beyond that the game gives no  hint of what they actually do or mean and good luck trying to find an answer online, I don't think anyone else has a clue either) and what exactly happens when you level up one of your abilities. You can clearly see a progress bar advance, but I haven't noticed leveling up actually effect gameplay at all and I have no idea what stats, if any, have been improved because the game doesn't tell you.\nThe AI, both of your units and your opponents, is painfully slow on the uptake at times, but can still a moderate degree of challange. If you're looking for a real hardcore experience, however, you'll be disappointed. There is no difficulty adjuster and you can usual beat any mission the game throws at you by you second try if not your first. None have been so difficult that I have had to attempt anything a third time.\nI personally recommend this game but please keep in mind everything that I have said above. This game is not without flaws, and although I can look past them because I find this a fun game to play while I wait for something else, I image that not everyone else might be able to.","April 2, 2015","true","2.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Its simple, but man do I keep coming back to it. I've already put 11hrs into it in a 3 or 4 day period. It's a casual game that keeps you coming back because there is some strategy to it. It's easy at first, but then after you hit the 9hr mark it really starts to get harder. On the higher levels you have to act fast and keep moving or else you'll be run over by enemy troops and set on fire by the Gods! The only way to make it easy, is to turn off the quick spawning of all populatants, then you can start winning again.\n\nThere are four basic things you can do as far as gameplay: fight, build, lead, and use your God like powers, which there are plenty of. You can even turn your leader into a hero and he'll do some real damage. And there are dozens of worlds and hundreds of maps in each, so I don't know if I'll ever finish it. For this reason the replay-ability is high.\n\nBut like I said, don’t expect an in depth game, its simple - a casual game with some strategy and quick decision making. It's fantastic for what it is.","February 19","true","13.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's basically a modern version of that with even older school retro graphics blended with a modern layout and feel. Hard to decribe but it actually works well.\n\nIt does have some extra gameplay mechanics that I don't remember in Populous as well, such as planetary expansion and conquest.\n\nThe gameplay is quick and easy enough to hop into casually while giving you some level of strategy. Early on it turns into a altering the terrain to expand, and attack. You will find the first levels mainly managing you peoples time between those two modes.\n\nThe modes are however not set on a selection of people, but your entire team as a whole. So not much micromanaging here aside from setting the occasional waypoint and using fire pillar and lightning strikes to burn your AI opponent to the ground.\n\nThe developer(s) shows a lot of restraint in the overall gameplay and I appreciate what was built upon an already successful formula. I need to keep playing more to see how the mechnics evole as the game progresses, but already I am quite happy with my purchase and it brings back awesome feelings of nostalgia from when I was a young lad, sneaking onto my parents computer to play Populous at 1am on a school night.\n\nConclusion: Great fan service to a classic series. Effective and entertaining "god" simulator. Grab it if you enjoy high level strategy and casual rounds you can jump in and out of when you have some time.","March 28","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Graphic reminds me on Populous on my Amiga - not really better. But the goon news: the game is back and it’s better than before. (I’ve read, the Indie-Developer gave up – what a pity). It works on my Notebook: Win 7 (64 Bit).\n\n\nIt may sound trivial: terraforming the landscape in order to provide better housing and using ‘elemental’ forces (thunder, fire, swamps, ...) to weaken your enemies, but IT IS A VERXY INTERESTING GAME. And the best: you can play right from the start. This means ‘playing’ instead of ‘learning’ the game. Though it get’s more and more complicated with each new map, demanding different strategies to win.\n\nThe Game includes a short tutorial of 5 maps. It gives you a first idea - not everything is mentioned and tooltips are missing :-(\nThe Game itself has more than 75 maps in the campaign and there is a skirmish mode too. I’m still at the beginning but I like it already more than many other games in my account.\n\nSometimes the game has short lags - specially when changing your actions (e.g. from raise/lower land towards send your enemy a lightning).\n\n\nThe story: umpffffffff. Better forget about “Thallos - once a mighty warrior ...”. You don’t need it but you won’t miss anything either. There is no multiplayer mode (something I don’t mind).\n\n\nConclusio: 10 Euros is fair.","July 15, 2015","true","63.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sure, there's a few game mechanics that aren't explained, but I'm tired of games holding my hand. It was as simple as trying out new mechanics in future levels that gave me a sense of accomplishment. Especially when I felt satisfied knowing I'd come up with a God-like (no pun intended) strategy that decimated enemies all on my own, sans tutorial. If you want an easy game that holds you're hand, don't play a strategy game with RTS elements, you're barking up the wrong tree.\n\nUnderstand that, and you'll see this game has very good strategy elements, an incredible GUI, and lovely pixel graphics.\n\nOnce you get the hang of the tricks to building fast, expanding, and conquering, everything becomes a timing game IMO: When should you expend resources to attack? Or build more houses? Or use a God power and send a hail of fire upon an enemy city!?\n\nBest of all, if the game starts feeling easy, turn off kindle populants (the ability to basically summon units at will), or increase flag speed (when a unit naturally spawns for either you or the enemy; speeding up real time gameplay).\n\nAnd hell, there's 30 levels, and that's just the first universe!

Its simple, but man do I keep coming back to it. I've already put 11hrs into it in a 3 or 4 day period. It's a casual game that keeps you coming back because there is some strategy to it. It's easy at first, but then after you hit the 9hr mark it really starts to get harder. On the higher levels you have to act fast and keep moving or else you'll be run over by enemy troops and set on fire by the Gods! The only way to make it easy, is to turn off the quick spawning of all populatants, then you can start winning again.\n\nThere are four basic things you can do as far as gameplay: fight, build, lead, and use your God like powers, which there are plenty of. You can even turn your leader into a hero and he'll do some real damage. And there are dozens of worlds and hundreds of maps in each, so I don't know if I'll ever finish it. For this reason the replay-ability is high.\n\nBut like I said, don’t expect an in depth game, its simple - a casual game with some strategy and quick decision making.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/partyiguana/recommended/319560/","partyiguana","unironic communist meme","http://steamcommunity.com/id/partyiguana/","41 products in account","I first picked this game up back in 2012 or 2013, when it was still just called "Reprisal", and just recently got it on Steam; it was a lot different than it is now in 2012, in some ways for the better and in some ways for the worse. The current UI of the game seems very generic Web 2.0, more suited to a tech startup website than to a game, and it's a little incongruous with the game's graphics. I felt like it had a lot more character in its older incarnation, and the grammar seems worse in this one (not a single apostrophe! The horror!).\nAs for game mechanics, the terraform tool is kinda janky and only works half the time. It's also a pain to terraform a large area at once, and I tend to accidentally destroy houses/buildings with it by holding down too long. The frame of view is obnoxiously small and panning around is very slow — you can move it with the minimap in the upper corner, but it pauses everything while you're moving it.\nHowever! It's not all bad. The graphics (with the exception of the aforementioned UI) are very nice, and the pseudo-Grecian architecture and lore are a great touch. It's not an exceptionally challenging game, but it makes you think, which we can all use once in a while. The new universe system is interesting and definitely wasn't there before, but I think it's really cool, at least in an aesthetic sense (I haven't gotten the chance to try it out as I'm still working on the first planet).\nSo yeah, I'd recommend it, but it's not without its issues. The mechanics need some work and it's not enough to keep me playing for more than half an hour or so at a time. But it's fun, and it's relaxing, and it's $7.","March 20","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's basically a modern version of that with even older school retro graphics blended with a modern layout and feel. Hard to decribe but it actually works well.\n\nIt does have some extra gameplay mechanics that I don't remember in Populous as well, such as planetary expansion and conquest.\n\nThe gameplay is quick and easy enough to hop into casually while giving you some level of strategy. Early on it turns into a altering the terrain to expand, and attack. You will find the first levels mainly managing you peoples time between those two modes.\n\nThe modes are however not set on a selection of people, but your entire team as a whole. So not much micromanaging here aside from setting the occasional waypoint and using fire pillar and lightning strikes to burn your AI opponent to the ground.\n\nThe developer(s) shows a lot of restraint in the overall gameplay and I appreciate what was built upon an already successful formula. I need to keep playing more to see how the mechnics evole as the game progresses, but already I am quite happy with my purchase and it brings back awesome feelings of nostalgia from when I was a young lad, sneaking onto my parents computer to play Populous at 1am on a school night.\n\nConclusion: Great fan service to a classic series. Effective and entertaining "god" simulator.
