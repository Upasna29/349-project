This is incorrect.  There are no KB controlls.  There are no mouse controlls.  There is no option for compatability with other controller types.  Be warned."\n\nTemporary Review Update:\n\nGame has been updated since this review.  KB & Mouse controllers are now an option, though some have reported issues with them.  Specifically if other devices that windows labels "controller" are attached.  The game seems to auto detect and put you into controller mode without question if these are present.  Note: I have not personally encountered this.\n\nSo, now that I am actually able to PLAY the game, I will re-review it shortly.  Alas, since Steam does not have aneutral setting I can not YET reccomend this game.  Though the 30 seconds I have played so far seem promising.","August 26, 2015","false","0.8"," 55 of 70 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","55","70","2","9"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/segfault314/recommended/236490/","segfault314",".biz marquee","http://steamcommunity.com/id/segfault314/","409 products in account","Hexodius combines a twin-stick shooter with customization and exploration elements in the form of ship equipment and a world map. Buy ship weapons or upgrades, or find them throughout the world, and equip them on your ship before a level. Weapons are unlocked through collecting energy crystals, a mechanic similar to Gradius (where Hexodius sort of gets its name).\n\nGraphics are well done but nothing amazing, and a lack of diversity between level stages means the game starts to feel the same after time. The sound's well done but there aren't enough music tracks, which makes the stages in the same world feel even more same-y. Haven't tried playing with a mouse and keyboard but I imagine the fine precision of a mouse would make aiming easier. My biggest issue with the game is that it refuses to run at my native res, which means I need to run it in a window. The actual gameplay, however, is quite fun.\n\nAt $10 I'd only just recommend this, since it's a quite fun arcade game but the lack of polish really brings it down. At $5 however, it's a steal.","November 29, 2013","true","1.7"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","16","19","0","0"

Usually games that reccomend the controller before you even start playing, really grind  my gears. However, With this one after trying both settings. I'm glad I got that message for a change, because with keyboard and mouse it was next to impossible to play.\n\nThe game is great fun and highly addictive, but from what I can see, not very popular on steam. I don't know why this is as its a fantastic game. You have a story mode, and a traditional arcade mode (with leaderboards everyone. Yes. You can own your friends). The story mode follows a very basic story and has several objectified missions to get to a dimensional portal at the end of the zone. There is plenty to do. And you get rewarded for exploring all the map with bonus unlocks and bonus health items.\n\nYour ship is also fully customisable with whatever powers you desire from the menu, different combinations will give you different pro's and cons of course, but work out whats good for you.\n\nThe soundtrack to this game in my opinion is rather good, but gets slightly repetitive when you've been in the same zone for a while.\n\nAll in all, Hexodius is a great and addictive twin stick shooter, and there is a lot on offer if you try to give it the time of day. I give hexodius a 8/10.","July 3, 2014","true","3.2"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/2d_invasion/recommended/236490/","2d_invasion","RoX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/2d_invasion/","1244 products in account","Such a very underrated game and the Metacritic reviews are a joke. The 'God is a Geek' review for instance describes the game as "enjoyable" but then scores it a 40 out of 100, only for reasons by comparison to other games of it's genre. There are a lot of game reproductions on the market (the twin stix genre has to be one of the most reproduced) so its not really a fair reviewing Hexodius by comparison and not seeing it as it's own game. 'Hexodius', with it's own challanges, and characteristics that separate it from all the other twin sticks on the market. I need not remind the real gamers how many of them that are on the market but it's a lot and I'm a fan of everyone of them (well almost... *cough*Arcadia*cough* ,ehem.) and Hexodius is not an exception.\n\nThe game play is your basic twin stick arena shooter, you do get power ups which gives it a hint of action stratagy. The other part I didn't like about Hex was how stale the "Action" started out. Yes, it started off a little slow but the action eventually starts picking up becoming more challenging to the players skill level, and the arena's start getting a little more tricky to navigate, and enemies a little more stronger and powerful. In turn, you power up as well and there is no shortage to choose from, with 4 large sets that can be upgraded and customized.\nControls are highly programmable, in fact, makes this twin stick even easier to pick up and learn.\n\nYes, there are minor annoyances in this game... like the text popping up in the middle of the battle and pausing it, then throwing you back in... it kind of isn't kewl and you'll see that complaint on a lot of reviews. A minor design flaw. Really Dev's?! ...this is a robot based game... if you can't/won't hire voice actors, get a text to voice simulator!!!\nGeez...\n\nGraphics are okay (screenshots tell that story) but I'm not exactly sure why this will not run on my i5-HD3000 GPU laptop, as I have no problems running Assult Andriod Cactus... ?! (Currently running this on Phenom IIx4 810 w/ R9 280X - no probs)\n\nSounds are okay but also bring us back to the text issue. So I must note to devs: If you are going to progress a story, or write a book of instructions for the player, don't do it in the middle of the action, very few players will have the patience to read it regardless of the fact that it removes players from the game.\n\nWith more worlds beaten, more arcade modes are unlocked, so there is a decent amount replayability here but because this game cleverly infuses hazards in both the enemies and in the environment, it becomes tricky, with it comes frustration. It is sometimes best to experience Hex in smaller doses.\n\nOverall I enjoy this game, I think the Metacritic score killed what should have been a more popular game, because 47 is a ugly number and in my opinion, it should have been in the high 60's or low 70's. Even so, over a year later, I still play and enjoy Hexodius.","August 17, 2014","true","9.6"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"
