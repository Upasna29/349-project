Controls are very simple, just throttle, break, tilt back and forward, but the game becomes very technical as you pass the levels and every little movement will count on your performance.\nIt´s not like all those tilt games out there, this has really nice physics and gameplay, and a lot of havoc!\nAlso is a great game to play when you only have 5 or 10 minutes available.\n\nYou can race with ghosts or watch replays from others players, and when you see the best players runs you cannot believe how good you can get to be.  It´s a very fun game with a lot of crazy stunts, i recommend it to any person.","June 3, 2015","true","54.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's pretty good!  The meat is tender, the onions and beans are flavorful, the broth is robust.\n\nThen, the cook comes out and adds some Cayenne pepper, to give it just a little spice.  Superb!  Well done!\n\nAnd then the cook comes out again and adds some more Cayenne pepper.  Well, I mean... why?  It's quite good the way it is.  You can still taste the other ingredients, and it's not bad, but things are kind of getting overwhelmed by the spice.\n\nAnd then the cook comes out once more and dumps a gallon if Cayenne pepper into your dish.  Now you're irritated, but you know there's good chili in there, right?  You take a bite, and try to ignore the spiciness, but even when you find a great big chunk of meat or something, all you can taste is spice.  Spice, spice, spice.\n\nDifficulty is good in a game.  A little spice is more than nice.  But when your game's gimmick is that it gets so difficult that you can no longer taste the enjoyable stuff, well... what's the point?  Who wants to eat THAT dish?\n\nA bad chef is one who sucks at chili.  An unforgivable chef is one who ruins good chili.  The same goes for game devs - good game, ruined because some idiot was all like "XTREEEEEEEM MEANS HARD, RIGHT?"

The task is usually to get to the end of the level without falling off your bike. It sounds simple enough, but sometimes, especially in the later levels, you'll really have to stop and think before revving off a ramp without knowing what steep banks lie ahead. It's a blast playing a level over and over until you finally pass it without falling one time. If it sounds like you'd enjoy this kind of thing, you would. I recommend that you try it out.\n\nOh, one more thing. The game has a decent crash system where your guy can flip off his bike and break bones and stuff. It's weird seeing him flail around after he's already on the ground, smacking his arms around and breaking them even more. It's absurd, but oddly hilarious.

Never have I hated one so so much.  Trials can be very addicting trying to get that "perfect run" but at the same time oh so frustrating when you fall just short of the end.  The best part is that it is never the games fault when you fail.  And you always know it.  It is incredibly rewarding to finally get through a track without falling, or shaving off just a few tenths of a second off of your time.  It's a game that you can play when you only have 10 minutes to play, but can spend hours absorbed too.  The controls are tight.  There are only 4 buttons to push, but control is deceptively deep and nuanced.  The crashes can be hilarious.  The tracks are well designed and the difficulty ramps up appropriatly from carefree first levels to the insidiously difficult hard tracks.  There is a fairly punishing learning curve about 60% of the way through the tracks, but so satisfying when you get some of the more advanced techniques down.  Most games I get excited about have a whole lot to do with the story or the atmosphere of the game.  This is one of the very few in recent memory that stand pretty much 100% on the merit of the gameplay itself.","January 16, 2013","true","86.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its difficulty curve is somewhat fair, but towards the end of the tracks they seem almost impossible.\nIt's a truly satisfying feeling when you manage to pass a small part of the track you had been stuck on for a long time, and the feeling you get when you finish a difficult track makes the whole process worthwhile.\nThe game has some of the best achievements I've ever tried to get. Ranging from simply finishing all tracks in a difficulty set with no faults, to completing an entire level while holding the accelerator down... without faulting.\n\nThe game never feels unfair and often times failure feels like the fault of the driver and not the game.\n\n10/10.

You control a trial bike rider across a wide variety of indoor courses, some of them truly awe-inspiring in their complexity.\nYou're supposed to get the rider from one end of the obstacle course to the other, but the endless faceplants, rashies, crashes and bashes are almost as much fun as safely navigating the course. Never have broken bones been so much fun.\nFor added enjoyment, try playing this with a friend - you can take it in turns to see who breaks the most bones.","May 12, 2013","true","11.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
