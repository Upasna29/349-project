I love it, even tho it is in beta.\n\nI also found awesome glitch, that makes my car acceletate from 0 mph to 100 mph in around 3 seconds.\n\n- Doesn't have a lot of cars.\n- Doesn't have GTA V customization. ( You can't add bumpers, spoilers, rims, neons, upgrade power, etc. ) Atleast you can recolor the car and have a paintjob.\n- No use for in-game money ( Atleast for me yet )\n- No easter egg cars. ( Maybe xD )\n- The cursor will be always on the screen, but you get used to it.\n- You can't buy houses.\n- Too high mouse sensitivity.\n- My second car disappeared after saving.\n- Got too hyped of Casino and Gun Store xP\n\nPut boring pros here.\n\n4/5\n\nFor some reason, my computer "overheats" when I play this game. My computer shuts down if it feels like its overheating, even when its not ovetheating.

At this current beta stands I really like it's unique idea/gameplay style, but hate the bugs and flaws at same time. It's a lot better once you get past the confusing start at the beginning though. Well at least i can guarantee this is way better than a certain explosive FlatOut 3 ...... and the car physics has potential (as long as it won't go for drifitng crap like the latest NFSs)\n\nI've concluded myself that this is the type of game which worths throwing in money for supporting if you ain't too poor. The arcade racing genre is dying and proper unique stuff such as this needs to be developed to keep the genre alive.","April 21","true","0.1"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","7","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ForgedFlesh/recommended/428190/","ForgedFlesh","Kappa","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ForgedFlesh/","142 products in account","While a very lacking beta, it is a very fun beta. It has some pretty sweet destruction physics and a fun concept, this game has a lot of potential, with the inclusion of an arsenal of weaponry, more cars, more customisation, and soft body physics or harsher destruction (the ability to bend, crush, and destroy parts of the car as well as the whole car.) this game could be a whole lot better, and while not finished, as stated before, it is a very fun game for an early access title.\n\nMy suggestions:\n\n- Soft body physics / harsher destruction\n- Vehicular upgrades, visual and performance\n- Cleaner menus and UI\n- Ability to change the resolution of the game\n- Other stores as well as interactions (People, etc.)\n- More vehicles overall\n- Weapons for your character\n- Possible character customisation\n\nOverall, I recommend this game, but for a later date, add it to your wishlist and keep an eye on it. If you're feeling generous or experimental, send the devs some support by purchasing this game like myself! The past MadOut games are a few hours of fun and well made whereas this has a LOT more potential, especially with more features to come.\n\nKeep it up MadOut team!","March 30","true","4.0"," 16 of 35 people (46%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","46","16","35","2","1"

This Open City game is exactly as it sounds, it's wide open!  It's like MadOut GTA!  Except it's more technically flawed than the original MadOut games.  It needs a lot of work, but there is an Early Access banner which means we will get a lot of patches down the pipeline soon!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGkCC7VjbwU\n\nOne thing I love about it is when you finish a race, the game doesn't need to load the open world again.  You go from a state of "in-race" to "roaming the world" seamlessly.  In fact, you can just ignore the race and just go do your own thing at any time.  Also, after the race is complete, the car parts that were smashed off of cars are still in the game world afterwards.  These are things every game should have!\n\nEverything right now is super impressive to me.  The flaws, though?  Well, you can't currently respawn properly.  If you get stuck, you need to close the program and relaunch.  Also the 2nd race seemed to be bugged, I couldn't complete it.  You can get stuck in the ocean, I probably shouldn't go down there but there are giant ramps pointed into the ocean everywhere.\n\nLiterally all he needs is a button that will spawn the player back into the starting house.  And fix that second race, so I can continue to explore this game!","December 22, 2015","true","0.4"," 26 of 79 people (33%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","33","26","79","12","0"
