At best its the buggy, poorly crafted starting area for the first level of a game.\n\n--\n\nYou can walk for under half a minute in either direction from the start point and hit the edge of the entire game map. That's how small it is.\n\nThe mouse cursor is constantly visible on the screen.\n\nCharacter jumping is a glitchy mess. Tap the jump button half a dozen times and your character might jump once.\n\nYou can interact with a few things in the world but there's no real reason to do so.\n\nThe escape key doesn't do anything. There's no main menu and you've got to quit the game using ALT-F4.\n\nYou can switch between the characters, but you only learn this by hit and miss. There are no instructions.\n\nThe 'Features' listed for the game are a complete lie. There is no "A huge vibrant world, with colourful wildlife and environments.". At best that world exists in the mind of the developer. It certainly doesn't exist in this game.\n\nDevelopment seems to have been abandoned.

The idea of using a flute to wake up flowers remind me of Chibi Robo. But that's where the positive points end.\n\nI had a go at this game, and wasn't impressed to be honest. You can see for yourself why in this little preview I did of the game on stream.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtXyqRPinuE\n----------------------\nThere is little to no gameplay here. The objectives are confusing and not clear. The camera is glitchy and can be a bother. The music gets very repetitive and is not adjustable. There are also a number of bugs and issues with framerate.\nBut here is the damning part.\nThis game has all the features of a demo. Once you play the flute to all five flowers and get the gems, the player loses control of the character, and you get a thanks for playing screen, stopping the player from actively playing the game. That is NOT the way to sell a game on Steam Early Access.\n\nAlso after some research, this game is available as a demo for FREE on Kongregate and Newgrounds as a Unity Web Player game. (UPDATE: The dev has stated that the demo is an older version of the game.)\n\nThere is no mention of these points in the store page, therefore you are decieving your customers through doing this. The customer paid money for this game, therefore the customer should not be stopped from playing the game after a certain point. It's unfair to the consumer, and the developer should probably mention that it is a demo/preview and a work in progress in the description of the game.\nAlso, an exit button.\nPlease.","June 4, 2015","false","0.5"," 65 of 75 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","65","75","3","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zootch/recommended/375510/","Zootch","Karl Pilkington","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zootch/","904 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nReleased on June 4th, 2015 in early access. Approximately how long will this game be in Early Access?\n“We plan to have NKOA in Early Access for around 6 months.”\n\nI'm writing this review on March 1st, 2016.\n\nAs far as I can tell, this game hasn't had a single update.\nHere is Back to Basics Gaming and their developer associate speaking of a major update, written on June 10th, 2015.\nhttp://imgur.com/CPLSPSU\nAchievements, I think. Cool ! I'll actually have some goals when i play this.\n\nA few months roll by, and nothing. Naturally, people are wondering what the heck is going on? This is before Back to Basics Gaming had a really solid reputation for publishing early access titles that never get finished.\nhttp://imgur.com/qscx8g8\n\nThe Developer, "Mint Age Studio" actually has another game in early access, that was released about two months earlier.\nSo they actually have another game on their plate, that they were busy with.\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/363490/\nNot a good idea to have two unfinished games up for sale at the same time, in my opinion. Finish one, then start another, I say.\n\nJanuary 2016 rolls around, and apparently the developer can't finish the game as promised.  They are having financial issues.\nhttp://imgur.com/u9tJT9t\nhttps://imgur.com/uJvxHxQ\n\nhmm, now i thought the reason selling a game in early access, was to raise funds to finish the game? So if they've got two games in early access, and neither can be finished because of a lack of funds, what the hell are they doing on the store? It also wasn't a brilliant idea to have two games being developed at the same time, without funds to finish either of them. (Unless.. the plan is to never finish. Just take the money and run)\n\nMore and more people are beginning to smell something is off. Back to Basics Gaming doesn't have any answers for customers, and eventually the Developer, Mint Age Studios, admits he isn't working on EITHER of his early access games (This, and Escape Machines, that game that launched a month and a half before this one)\nbecause he doesn't have any money for it, despite having two games published by Back to Basics Gaming being sold on steam. Is Back to Basics Gaming keeping all the money? Where has it gone? Both games have trading cards and are getting money from market transations.\n\nThe Mint Age developer starts getting pretty hostile, in the mean time, at customers.\nhttps://imgur.com/a/ialCp\n\nSo, Back to Basics Gaming publishes this guy's two games relatively close to each other. They launch in early access, for a price. And 9+ months later, he has no money to finish the games, so he's starting a NEW game, which he plans to sell and use that profit to pay for his previous two games which he couldn't otherwise finish.\n\nWhat the heck kind of business strategy is this? It smells, and it smells bad.\n\nDan @ Back to Basics Gaming, has literally said nothing in regards to any of this as far as i know. I can't find an offical comment or response to Mint Age's declaration of stopping development on both games.\n\nIt was only a few months later, that Back to Basics Gaming would publish a different developer's game which shortly went from an update promised within a few weeks, to 4-5 months\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/403560/\n\nYou can read the story of that, in my review for that game.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Zootch/recommended/403560\n\nDuring all this, Back to Basics Gaming published another game called "Flesh Eaters" (unrelated to Eaten Alive)\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/383580/\n\nThis also missed its release date by at least 6 months and counting.  Meanwhile, the developer has gotten two new games greenlit in the mean time. Both published by Back to Basics Gaming. Why is someone working on 3 games at once, especially when they can't even finish the first project? Keep in mind, this is a DIFFERENT developer than Mint Age and unrelated to the Eaten Alive devs (Space Cat Studios)\n\nBack to Basics Gaming has also published "Lup", more recently. In tradition with most everything early access, it has missed its release date by 2 months and counting.\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/412600/\n\n\n\nhttp://imgur.com/yTKmUpA\nyeah i own a majority of their entire catalogue, and this game is in many ways, not an isolated incident with them. I would recommend avoiding Back to Basics Gaming. They can't be trusted to deliver on their promises, and you have a decent chance of the developer missing multiple deadlines or just completely walking away.","March 1","false","4.1"," 39 of 47 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","39","47","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gadolf/recommended/375510/","Gadolf","Gadolf Shmitler","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gadolf/","215 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAn abandoned proof-of-concept engine test with misleading screenshots and a list of features that is an outright lie. The images shown seem to come from a version of the game that either never made it to steam or was altered afterwards. I'm suspecting the former considering that the screenshots show the beginings of actual inventory management and a circumstance of NPC interaction that does not exist in the game's current Steam build. As well,not a single feature from the list is actually present in the game. The Druids to trade with do exist,but the resources necessary to trade with them do not,rendering their presence moot. I can appreciate the vibrant color pallette used to create an almost "Alice in Wonderland-ish" feel,but without any form of actual gameplay aide from the glitched infinite boulder jumps it can't be qualified as an actual "game" yet.\n\nWhile I understand that the purpose of Early Access is specifically to help developers fund and shape their products,this item has no business being on the Steam store in it's current state as there is absolutely zero meaningful gameplay or exploration possible and the devs appear to either no longer be producing it,or simply not updating the Steam version or it's news page with any new information given that the engine migration to Unity appears to have been completed with no further development of the game itself in a month at the time of typing.\n\nTL;DR:Only worth purchasing at a very heavy discount for card profit unless the developers decide to come back to it. While the developer honestly admitted to having very little content,this has so far translated to no content,even 4 months into it's proposed 6 month early access cycle.","September 25, 2015","false","2.8"," 27 of 34 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","27","34","2","0"

There are thousands upon thousands of people who have made flash games that actually games, and are waaaaay more fun than this. Go play them for free instead of paying even the 49 cents (sales price) for this pile. If I could go back in time, I would have saved those precious few cents and put them into a piggy bank. Because even merely listening to the sound of coins clinking into a piggy bank would be way more fun and satisfying than this "game" could ever be.

Beyond that it isn't even a promise of a game. The small map you're placed upon offers little interaction and what it does have is broken and clumsy. The two swappable characters can perform one action each. The little girl can pick up strawberries and rocks. Her friend, Aquarius, makes flowers bloom by playing his flute.  Nothing is achieved by performing these actions. 3 druids, strewn about the level, all with the same exact dialogue, offer trade you upgrades. You cannot purchase any of them or even collect the items the druids wish to trade them for. A new kind of adventure offers nothing more than a half baked premise with no indication of what the final product will even resemble.\n\nPROS\n-Interesting style...kinda\n\nCONS\n-no meaningful gameplay\n-little girl creeps me out\n\n\nDISCLAIMER: Review is based upon approx 1 hour of gameplay.","June 17, 2015","false","0.8"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

Also have you seen the video? Well you've seen everything move along. Seriously the entire "game" at the time of review is that just 1 place where you are restricted to the field and a small cave even then a part of the cave is blocked off as it is still in early access even the first stage is still not finished. This is not a game, this is a babies first UNITY engine game. With poor FPS. If you are a person who likes good graphics this wont be a pleseant suprise. The graphics as can be told by the screenshots is just a bit better than what a PS2 could generate but not as good as something a PS3 could show.

The game in its current state is one largely empty room that has no completed gameplay mechanics. The few items that you can interact with do absolutely nothing and the game world is so small that you can walk around its outermost edge in just under three minutes. The environment has nothing except three paths that say "area not available in alpha" when you approach them.\n\nThe game has been in Early Access for over three months with absolutely no updates in content beyond an allleged engine migration that had no noticeable impact on gameplay. Either the dev has given up or this game was never meant to be finished in the first place.\n\nThere are two possibilities: either the dev started out with good intentions and gave up, or this game was a scam and never intended to be finished. Considering one of the paths in the game can only be traversed by abusing a glitch, I'm inclined to say the latter.","September 7, 2015","false","1.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Never has a game actually infuriated me due to how blatantly broken and lazy it is. This game is so bad that it actually terrifies me. This game claims to be in "early access" (of which it has been for A WHOLE YEAR), when in reality this is a very, very, very first draft, if that. This game has nothing. It is void of literally anything to do. All this game has a story, and a bad one at that. There are a bunch of NPCs around the map with the same dialogue and quest introduction, yet the quest is literally unachievable due to the limited map. Every time you walk for 20 seconds, it says "This area is unavailable during the alpha". Well, when the ♥♥♥♥ is it going to come out of alpha?! It's been a whole ♥♥♥♥ing year! This game is the most putridly, terrifyingly horrendous game in existence, and I mean that with no exaggeration. Worse than ♥♥♥♥ing Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing.

You can switch between two different characters. One is a little girl named Mary, who can lift gigantic strawberries and jump really high. The animations are quite bad, as Mary jumps her knees don't even bend, she just kinda gets pulled towards the sky, in a jarring motion. The other playable character is a magical druid named Aquarius. He is a blue-skinned alien wearing a grass skirt. He has a magical flute, and you can play along with the backround music, which is a funky sounding bassline. The playable area is not that big, and there are areas that you can't enter as they are blocked off. It says that they will be available someday, but I have my doubts. Game has been out for 5 months now, and it is the same "game" that I played at the launch of the early access. Even if this game was free, I would find it hard to recommend.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-3glPcUi5k&list=PLNCk-m24qgLkgLn0G_PjSKus4gRPcU69J&index=30","December 11, 2015","false","0.5"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

It it so far from being a finished product that it really should not have been released as of yet. The graphics are not bad and the environment is nice. I think from what I have seen , this game should be marketed towards young kids like maybe 5 to 10 years old. Alot of guys got this game and left really bad reviews and its hilarious because Im like WTF did you even buy it in the first place. I mean a lil girl in giant strawberry land hanging out with a flute playing alien......really ? Go play GO or Chivalry and STFU. The game has potential but it is not anywhere near , not even close to being finished or even having a point. There is no goals, no tasks you can complete. You can walk around, pick up a rock or strawberry, teleport to a few diff parts of the map, or choose the alien and play a flute. You can glitch the game and fly into space  -_- yay.","November 5, 2015","true","2.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nateofthelivingdead/recommended/375510/","nateofthelivingdead","nateofthelivingdead","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nateofthelivingdead/","210 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFirst impressionThe devs clearly state that there is "very little to do" in the game, and that is very true. I would love to see how this plays with the story, dialogue, and puzzles fully integrated, because to me it looks like they intend this to be an N64-style platformer, which I totally love. Sadly, it's not really there yet on any level but the visuals.\n\n\nCritique and recommendationsIt would be nice to see some actual cinematics in the final release explaining the story, maybe an interactive tutorial demonstrating character switching, special abilities, etc. As it stands though, it would still be nice to have some sort of introduction to the game. It's not fun having to press every button on the keyboard to see what it might do.\n\nThe tank controls have got to go. There is no reason for a 3rd person adventure game to to have a control scheme like this unless it was made in the early to mid 90's.\n\nCharacter animations need some tweaking. Mary's jump, for example, is really stiff and awkward-looking.\n\nInvisible walls suck. If I can't go somewhere, place some tall rocks or something that I can't get over. There should be a reason for why you can't go someplace aside from "because that's how the level was made." It ruins the immersion.\n\nAchievements please :)\nFinal verdict"Needs a lot of work."\nIn its current state, New kind of adventure is more of a promise than anything else. As with many Early Access titles, purchasing this game now is a gamble. There have been no updates since launch, but a developer has recently (1/2/16) been posting in the forums regarding an update in the next few months. I am eager to change my review once I have reason to, because I really do like the premise and aesthetics of this game. At the moment though, that's really all it has going for it.","January 5","false","0.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through." I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette.

(Only while on sale)\n• Bought game for $0.14, sold cards for $0.17. (3 cents profit)\n• Vibrant colors.\n• There are giant strawberries on the map.\n\nCons:\n• UNITY LAUNCHER ALERT\n• This game is in its Alpha stage. EARLY ACCESS\n• It will be awhile until we see some improvement.\n• The cursor is present on screen at all times.\n• No menus at all.\n• No intros or anything whatsoever.\n• Must press ALT+F4 to quit.\n• Poor gameplay.\n• There are no NPC's.\n• Jumping mechanic is bugged, especially with Mary.\n• Music does not fit game at all.\n• There is no information as to what your goal is.\n• The game is very generic. SNES games are more versatile than this.\n• Three merchants exist on the map, but...\n• You can't buy anything from the merchants because $ hasn't been implemented yet.\n• Devs spelled "artefacts" wrong when you speak to merchants.\n• Your companion doesn't interact whatsoever and vice versa when you switch characters.\n• You need to find how to switch characters via a help screen.\n\nSummary:\nIn its current state, think of this particular game in this manner: it's just like playing Garry's Mod with absolutely no add-ons. Except, in Garry's Mod you can probably run around a bigger map.","August 12, 2015","false","2.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It is a fantastic game, and perhaps the greatest videogame there ever will be.\n\nYou play as a young girl named Mary. The story takes place after the parents of the girl get into a fight, Mary then hides away in a closet.\n\nGameplay:\n\nNew Kind of Adventure is open world, and has a wide variety of things to do. As Mary, you can lift objects twice your size, and teleport though what appears to be gates of light, and jump extremely high. As Aqarius, you can play a flute, and make flowers open at will.\n\nPresentation:\n\nMade in unity, this game looks beautiful. It runs well regardless of what setting you chose at the start. It's nice to admire for long periods of time.\n\nStory:\n\nThis might be the biggest part of New Kind of Adventure, the story is amazing. Mary, after her parents' ordeal, hides in a closet and passes out. She awakes in this land full of adventure and secrets. Though the game is not complete, I believe they will improve on the already fantastic story.\n\nOverall:\n\nNew Kind of Adventure is a phenomenal game. The gameplay itself is extremely fun with all the different possibilities you can approach it. controls feel great and are intuitive with keyboard/mouse. It's impossible to go through every cool thing in the game in this review, there's just so much neat stuff to experience.\n\n[Score: 93/100]","November 8, 2015","true","32.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","57","4","7","7","1"

First you start out infront of a cave with flowers, if you use the black one with the flute you can make the flowers bloom. This represents not only a deep relationship with nature, but more importantly life, the black one is lively and godlike one who gives life, but cant destroy it. He represents New beginings something we all have had in dire times, he can represent society today. The girl, not only does she represent lust with her short skirt, but she has the ability to grab and lift items throw them, and she can jump to extrordinary heights. This represents that women can be strong in society and that they can achieve great things as well. When you take these extrordinary characters and put them togather in a small world, they begin to connect, when you start they are right next to each other hinting at romance between the two. These lovers though have to go to extremes during the game and then have to be split(because you cant control them both at the same time) this is where the journey begins and infact there lives do flip all around. During the story you almost be playing basketball with the strawberrys until you notice a couple of rocks that were up to no good so you(the girl) gets in a little fight with them, then the black one got scared so they had to split up and the girl was sent off to live with her auntie and uncle to live in bel air.","August 13, 2015","true","4.0"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","54","7","13","6","0"

I simply couldn't stop playing. I loved it so much that I sent a copy to everyone I knew! The statements this game boldly makes simply CANNOT be understated. The ground-breaking views that this game presented on the Iran Missile Crisis and the Treaty of Versailles simply stunned me. I STILL cannot fully comprehend how this game flawlessly explained both sides of the conflicts while linking these historical events in ways I had never even thought of. Thats not even the most impressive part! The bold inclusion of Third-Wave feminism to counteract the overarching theme of the brutal Neo-Nazi regime was a stroke of sheer genius.

This game is the crowning achievement of our generation. But enough with the prasies lets get down to gameplay and story. The story is a deep, rich saga about the journey of two trying to make thier way in the world. Words simply cannot express the touching moments you will experience as you journey forth to gather gems, and strawberry juice. And all this effort to see in the end, an "Ubuntu Shield" waiting just out of your grasp. The music is amazing, perfectly fitting the mood and atmosphere of the game. The music that Aquarius (the sidekick to Mary, the protangonist), gives the bards of Skyrim a run for their septims. But why appreciate this work of art, this magnum opus, when you can experience it for yourself. Go forth, Mary is waiting with her sidekick Aquarius.

Where do I start?! There's just so much depth to this game, not only is it a great way of getting my wife to leave me after I stayed up for 10 hours playing the flute to a patch of grass, but it's also an awesome way to learn about how not to make a game. It's like stepping into 1994 back when the pinnacle of gaming technology was CD-ROM children's crime mystery games, only that this game still would have felt outdated then. I would rate this game 0/10 but it's something you have to experience, and for the low cost of $0.14 (On sale) or $0.99 full retail, it's well worth it considering how many minutes of your life you will spend in this game as well as the countless sleepless nights after filled with regret and sorrow.\n\n11/10","August 10, 2015","true","3.7"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","40","4","10","4","0"

Lets just start by saying I got this game out of a random 5 steam keys from ♥♥♥ wasn't expecting such a master piece.\n\nThe first thing I noticed: GRASS it's literally everywhere like WHAT the new crysis doesn't even have this good of looking grass\n\nThen it really hit me. I can play THE FLUTE THE #@%ING FLUTE TO PLANTS. Now I don't know about you but this is just amazing I really was not expecting to be able to play a flute to flowers ever in all my years of gaming.\n\nYou can play as a weird little dark guy named Aquarius. Now that name implies that I should be able to go swimming at later levels. I'm really hoping for this dev if you're reading water levels are important.\n\nYou can also play as a little girl named mary. She is extremely odd jumps about what I would guess is about 30 feet and can pick up giant ?boulders? and giant strawberries that are larger than her in width and height.\n\nThere are also "Druids" 3 of them so far that I have found and they'll sell you some stuff for certain amount of other items. Now I can not figure out how to get the other items perhaps they're not in the game yet? I'm not sure but most of them do seem like they wouldn't help much at the current level you can play. The fact you can buy a shield is to me hinting at the fact that there might be combat but I'm not sure.\n\nAnother thing is there are what I think are portals all over outside I've only gotten one to work once other than that they're hard to use and don't seem to work and I don't see a need for them you move quite fast.\n\nThe graphics are also a very intersting take a very vibrant and blown out look to them something I don't think I have ever seen before. The game for me does not run very well but I am just assuming because it is currently alpha and no its not my pc I can run crysis 2 ultra so I would assume this should be just fine. The animations for jumping are still pretty static little to no body movement just an up and down motion and while falling it seems to jitter quite weirdly a lot.\n\nI could definitely see this game going places in the future and has a lot of potential I cannot wait to see more and will continue to update my review throughout the updates.\n\ntl;dr I like it but it is still too early to be "good"\n\nPros:\nA different style of graphics than usual\nGood sound\nInteresting gameplay\nFlawless character switching\nQuarky and new\nNice models\nStory has potential\n\nCons\nMovement feels a bit clunky with mouse and keyboard I do not have a controller to test how that goes\nalso mouse cursor is not hidden and remains visable across the screen\nNo pause button\nSeems to suffer in fps I don't know if this is just me but It shouldnt be I have a nice rig\nNot much to do yet\n\n\nI would recommend this game to others but only in a later version because right now it does not yet grab attention and keep it with the lack of things to do.\n","June 22, 2015","true","420.2"," 30 of 63 people (48%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","48","30","63","23","6"

It shows a lot of potential for future development. The game sets you with the backstory of a little girl who walked in on her parents fighting and she falls asleep in a wardrobe. It is very peaceful with a great soundtrack. The vibrant colors give it a great ambient feel. The game has everything you need: story, music, and graphics. What more do you want? It does confuse me why you are walking around with a guy who looks like the bunny from, "Donnie Darko." He does give a more kid-friendly vibe since he plays a flute sounded tune on an ordinary stick. I love to see a new group of dedicate and creative indie developers who make a great game.

The looping music is dreadful and the controls are stuttery and horrendous.

So that means you have to hit the X on the window or Alt+Ctrl+Delete and end it.\n\nOverall:\nIt's not really a game yet. There's nothing "Fun" about it. There's no Goal, Nothing to do, it's a small room. It shouldn't even be called an "Alpha", this is more like Pre-Pre-Alpha. All and all. NOT worth 0.99c, I suppose it's worth 0.14c but what for? he doesn't even explain hardly anything about the game.\n\nAlso it says as of this post(Below the video) for the "Engine Migration Sale"\n"So, the developer of New kind of adventure has informed me that the game is migrating over to Unity 5.\nThis will allow the newly created content to look and play better" Just because it's "Migrading"(Updating) to Unity 5 from Unity 2/3/4 etc. Doesn't mean it will Play BETTER. That makes no sense.. It will not fix the camera, movement, add a visible goal/guide line, make the NPC do something. Etc.. The version of unity has nothing to do with that.","August 15, 2015","false","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game really repersents how it is like to be on drugs the developers should really stay going in this direction.
