You wouldn't need more than a few hours to make this game.\n\nThe game has enemies raining from the top of the screen, they don't shot or do anything else than "fall". You shot them and after a minute or so a "boss" appears, it's a face standing in the middle of the screen. You kill this boss to finish the level. There are 2 more levels which are simply reskins of the first level, absolutely nothing changes. Once you finish the third level there's a fake BSOD and the game shuts down.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/recommended/449680/","Humanure","Belphegore","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/","1597 products in account","UPDATED for new Cthulhu addition.\n\nSamoliotik is a shoot 'em up title with graphics and gameplay that are a homage to old Atari games. The entire game takes 10-15 minutes to beat, and it consists of three levels; all with their own color schemes and boss. Sadly, there isn't a lot to write about since the game is so short, and what there is to say is nothing endearing in the least. Though as promised, the game does play in "4K resolution" and it does run at "60 FPS", although it stutters at times.\n\nThe first level is red, with black planes for enemies, and the boss is a huge Adolf Hitler head. The second stage is green, has dollar sign enemies, and has an Illuminati symbol as the boss. The third stage is yellow, and it has scarabs to kill, and the last boss is a giant Siamese cat head. There are four power-ups that you can grab, and their icon changes for each level; an item that makes you shoot in 3 directions, an invincibility token, one item that makes you go hyper speed, and another attack power-up that sends a hail of bullets from behind you.\n\nThere is exactly one track for the entire game, and it loops, and loops, and loops, and loops; you will be thanking the gods that Samoliotik only lasts 15 minutes at best, when you have heard the song loop about two dozen times by the end. Speaking of the end, the game has the balls enough to call you a loser for winning, which in turn the developer is actually calling you a loser for buying their game and beating it. Well, it takes one to know one I suppose.\n\nEdit: With the new Cthulhu addition, you get a fourth level that is blue, with fish bones and some malformed "Pac-Man" type enemy. Of course, Cthulhu is the boss of the level. They've also updated the music for the entire game, which is a much welcomed change. The third level boss takes an aeon to kill now as well.\n\nThe bottom line on Samoliotik? More Greenlit trash, more YouTube bait, another massive load of crap to add to the monolith of turds that are steadily being dropped onto Steam. I honestly can't believe that this title has a "mostly positive" rating right now. Even though the game is a buck, I had small hopes for it as I do enjoy casual shoot 'em up types, and the plain graphic style and content appealed to me. What I did not expect was a game so incredibly short. The Steam store shows all of the levels and content, there are no more. Too bad the trailer's soundtrack didn't get implemented instead.\n\nRating: 1.0/5.0 - It's bad.Belphegore's Hell House Reviews (Group)","March 26","false","0.3"," 52 of 63 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","52","63","0","3"

There is no plot, save point, option or a pause button to be found; you get hit once and the game restarts. The enemies don’t shoot at all and they are railroaded to move in straight lines only, this applies to the bosses as well though they bounce around the screen a bit.\n\nThe graphics are almost non-existent, comparing this to flash games might be an affront to the flash format. The music was interesting for the first impression, until you find out there are only two tracks that loops every dozen seconds or so. The ending was mildly surprising, but I can only attribute that as sloppy excuses to cut development time.\n\nIt doesn’t matter how cheap this is, you wouldn’t want to spend money on this, period.","March 26","false","4.7"," 23 of 29 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","23","29","0","0"

The game has 3 different bosses that come with 3 different biomes. After dodging and killing enemies you encounter them. These bosses don't attack, you have to attack them, so, basically, the boss battle is attacking a 2D sprite for 2 minutes, while the "boss" floats around like a headless chicken blocking the view, yes, that's right, in the boss battles you have to pay attention to the endless horde of enemies coming your way...\n\nPROS\n\n+Dank Memes\n+Relatively "good" sprites\n+Simple\n+Trading cards\n+Not bad music\n\nCONS\n\n-So lazy it hurts\n-Not Cheap enough (it should be free)(but then again... it has steam trading cards)\n-Lazy gameplay\n-No story\n-No characters\n-Not much fun\n-Very short\n-Very little powerups\n-No configuration\n-No options\n-hi score is nothing but a "kill counter" that doesn't save or anything....\n-Allways same sprite after map 1\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nDefinitely NOT worth your money.

In the first moment it feels like playing onside an old soviet propaganda wallpaper. Including the russian national anthem in the main menu and during the gameplay the retrolike tetris kalinka soundtrack in an endless loop. The controls are as easy as you move your mouse and keep mouse1 down for autofire. But then you realize you die several times for no reasons. Maybe because some of the hitboxes are sloppy programmed or the level is changing to another random symbols pattern.\nA truely design mistake are the same looking but lighter objects in the background which are apparently harmless. The graphics don't seem to be real rendered pictures, rather some unicode symbols from a wingdings font or something. For example the kalashinkov powerup looks weird and more like a pumpaction shotgun. It gives you a spreaded triple shot for a short time. Only the vodka powerup makes it worse. It speeds up double time and you lose control under bad vision. The 3 bosses and enemies are just a joke and cliche. And the bluescreen at the end of the game is totally unneccesary and considers every player as a "loser".

SIMILOTIKOK... SALITOLILOL... SUKALO... whatever the hell this thing is called, is a plane fly-y, shoot-y, weave-y, meme-y game that's out for you to play on your computer machine contraption right now. Use the mouse to control a silhouetted plane as it flies upwards, while trying your best to either shoot or avoid various other silhouetted shapes moving downwards. Hit a certain amount to reach a boss, shoot it, move on to a different "stage"/background colour with different shapes coming at you, and don't crash into anything or you'll reset to the start. Do this over a small handful of stages, unlock all the achievements, have the game automatically shut down on you, move on with your life.\n\nIt's a short game, clocking in at anything from 10 minutes to possibly half an hour, depending on your skill level or patience, the only other complications being some pick-ups that will have brief, temporary effects of either giving you a multi-shot, speeding you up, or sending out a row of projectiles to clear the screen. There have been a couple of updates to add two new stages and bosses to the game, bringing the total to 5 at the moment, but there may be more in future. It has a certain appeal to its super basic visual style, and the music is actually pretty good. But for better or worse, that's all there is to the game. I think the more interesting discussion here may be about products and their value or worth.\n\nI may have only gotten 20 minute's worth of play out of this with its current content (the rest of my play time being for card drops) but for only 99 cents, I'm not actually going to complain about that. Some people feel hard done by the game because of this and feel it should be free, but I don't think that's entirely fair. Trying to view this from a creative perspective, had I spent any decent amount of time and effort putting something together with sincere intentions of entertaining people, then I wouldn't feel the price was too unreasonable. Sure, what it's worth to you, only you can say - maybe you'll love the game, maybe you won't - but I think it's fair. I mean, if you can afford a device to play this on, the electricity to power it, the bill for your internet access to download it, and however many other things that might come into play, are you really going to complain about something as trivial as 99 cents and say you were ripped off because you only got half an hour's worth of content that someone else put some work into? I'm sure we've all wasted more money on worse things than this and barely thought twice about it. Like I said, value is pretty subjective and the worth of anything will vary from person to person, but I still think this is justified in this case.\n\nSo, while I'm not exactly in love with the game or anything, I was still entertained and enjoyed my time with it and hope there will be more updates to come. Get it on sale, at full price, or not at all, it's your choice, and either way you're not wrong in which you prefer, but if you do get it at least don't make the same mistake I did and do yourself a favour - don't play this in the dark sitting really close to the screen. I don't think my eyes will ever be the same again.","May 6","true","3.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","5","7","3","0"

They have the Sky supermacy, and they have the power to enslave all the human race.\nIn the middle of this madness stands the grandious Union of Soviet Socialist Republics still resisting against the evil forces, but not for so long. Something needs to be done, and is when the great leader Stalin assign the flying ace Marina Kuznetsov to a deadly mission: DEFEAT THE EVIL FORCES AND SAVE THE USSR and of course the rest of the world.\n\nComrade Kuznetsov and her Polikarpov I-16 are the worlds only hope.\nWill she defeat the evil Fasci-Capitalist pigs of the Ancient Egypt and save the entire Human race?\n\nI can't answer that, because the frikkin' Egyptians are nuts too defeat, but Marina will arrange a way to defeat them. With the power of Techno music and staying away from Vodka.\n\nPROS:\n\n- It's a fun game.\n- Works well with drugs...\n- ... or booze.\n- Music is kinda adicted and helps to avoid incoming problems during the fight.\n- Controls aren't bad at all.\n- Bosses are fun to watch.\n- Sometimes isn't linear.\n- Has some hidden achivements.\n- After some time playing, I imagine comrade Marina in lingerie posing on her Polikarpov.\n\nCONS:\n\n- Needs a "Safety advice for people with epilepsy" warning at the beginning, my friend Tobias is dead now, because of that. Na zdorovje comrade Tobias.\n- "PAUSE" actually pauses the game but don't pause the frikkin' Polikarpov, so, stopping the good fight for a cig or a sip of vodka is unthinkable for the Soviet Union conduct.\n- The game make us avoid Vodka.\n- Some enemies don't touch us, but they can kill us. I call them "Glitchy Cheerleaders".\n- There's no way to play the game in a Windowed mode, so its kinda hard to play it on my work place, you know I want to make my capitalist boss loose some money.\n- Needs more and diferent firing boosts, after a while there's no sense of advance in terms of firepower.\n\nI'll give a 6/10,\nmostly because I know this game is still in development, also I got it on an indiegala trade, and because Marina Kuznetsov is a total babe.

And it really was, until the creator added 2 more levels - still full of memes - but slightly more interesting because of their slighlty increased difficulty. I enjoyed it more today than a month ago.\n\nThis game is a little shoot'em up inspired by a flash game I believe, so it is really simple to understand and easy to handle. It has pretty straight forward achievements (for the hunters) and Steam cards. Don't read or watch them though not to spoil yourselves, because I was caught by surprise and laughed for a while when playing the game - but of course you need to like memes.\n\nIt costs 1 bill, which is quite high since you wont play for that long in order to complete the game (probably 15 mins), unless you're a piece of crap in shoot'em ups, just like me. I got it for free though, in some giveaway. If you have the occasion to grab it, give it a shot. I believe this will be worth since the developper seems to add some content once and a while, whenever he's caught by a meme.\n\nPS : I did not mention the soundtrack, which is weird at times or very interesting, but definitely adds some style to game.

The Extra-Terrrestrial would be fondly remembered for having a good story and solid gameplay by comparison.\n\nCONS:\nThere are dozens of other reviews for SAMOLIOTIK that repeat the same shortcomings over and over again.  Look elsewhere if you want to know more about mechanics, sound, level design, graphics, and the absolute lack of any of them in this game.\n\nPROS:\nSAMOLIOTIK has only two things going for it.  First, it has Steam trading cards (and a common $ emoticon). Second it has a short 100% achievement time (17 min for me and that is high).  I would be cautious about the later however.  Considering how much of a troll this game is, I expect after a few months the developers will add several insane grind achievements just to mess with everyone who thought it was an easy hunny.\n\nSUMMARY:\nThe only possible thing that might validate the existence of SAMOLIOTIK would be if it were part of a yet undiscovered Alternate Reality Game tied to the announcement of you-know-what 3.  I doubt this is the case.  Do not waste your money (or 65M of drive space) on this game.  If you are curious, wait a few weeks.

SAMOLIOTIK is a pixel designed shooter with a lot of variety between the levels which can't be selected, but can be reached by advancing in the game, you get to a new one by defeating the boss of the previous one. Predominant colors vary, enemies vary, bosses vary. The soundtrack is awesome, if you like it, you might also want to purchase the soundtrack DLC. At first glance, the game might seem linear and boring, but as I said there's a lot of variation between levels which are amusing at certain points and there are power ups as well. Also, new content seems to be constantly added to the game but as of now, it seems fairly priced for the content and the experience it offers.\n\nTL;DR : Prons and Cons + my final verdict	 Pros 	 Cons 	+ Really nice pixelated graphics\n\n+ Simple controls, click to shoot, move your mouse left to right to dodge enemies.\n\n+ Good level design, a lot variation between levels\n\n+ Really awesome soundtrack.\n\n+ Amusing at times.\n\n+ Fairly priced and it also seem to be updated with new content frequently	- Doesn't ensure much replayability and also some might find a little bit too short.\nFinal verdict:   9/10  Really worth giving it try, would definitely recommend it to people who are into pixel designed games","May 6","true","0.3"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Adolf Gutler. To make it you have to destroy/dodge all of the evil German empire! When you finally get to Gutler, the fight is not going to be easy. After you make it, Vladimir can see your talent and says: "Igor, you need destroy evil evil very evil capitalism of the usa." So you start destroying the economy of the us without knowing what's coming...\nThen you face the base of evil capitalism. Illuminati himself comes to fight you. If you find vodka you might get enough force to actually survive his capitalism. After that, you realize Mr Putin had a power trip and he is now trying to invade the whole world since the us of a isn't an ennemy anymore. So he sends you on a mission to kill the evil egyptian beetles until you get to the master of egypt. The cat thing. (sphinx?) The cat thing is the most intense boss in the game because in 2029 the capitalists egyptians have control of most of the world. So the cat thing shall die. If you manage to do it, you will quickly realize that the world has gone to chaos. Putin, by sending you, Igor the elite soldier, actually destroyed the world, even the good ones.\n\nThis game is a good way to actually reflect on life itself. This situation could very happen in real life so it really makes you think. Why are the capitalists here in the first place? Will they destroy the world? This game is very hard to think of without being scared. 5/7  Enough Water\n\nTL:DR   This game is a joke. Wtf did you expect it's 1.07 CAD$","March 28","true","1.0"," 1 of 15 people (7%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","7","1","15","2","0"

They can get hit in the wings no problem but you can't.\nEnemies are hard to see. Good luck telling appart the dollar symbols that can hurt you from the bg. This caused many "mysterious deaths" for me.\nNo sfx at all. It's fitting but at the same time it feels lazy. Something to let you know the boss is dead would be nice.\nThe game is also really short but given that you always start from scratch I'm not really complaining.\nI'd like to give it a neutral grade because SAMOLIOTIK's enjoyable but not worth going after.

Red colour everywhere. Red stars, vodka and AK47 as power-up's, Kalinka song's is playing. There is World War 2- planes is flying, you must shoot them, after some seconds you must kill Hitler- when he is dead, the comunism is down- capitalism begins.\nGreen background, glasses with something instead vodka, shotgun instead AK. Everybody is happy now, right? No! Instead of planes there is dollar symbols- $. When you are shoot them, you are actually fight with the system, rat race, pursuit of money. Then you musy kill next boss- Illuminati (secret lord of every human)\nAfter this, the symbolism is really strong- you are in ancient Egypt. Scarabs as opponent, amphorae of wine, bows and Ra symnols. Last boss- an sacred Egyptian cat (allusion to nowadays, where cats is our real lords, there are controls humanity through funny videos of cats in the internet). After killing him there is ending- no spoilers, better to discover it themselves.\n\nI got this game for free, for this price- I recommend.     10/10","March 26","true","1.0"," 12 of 45 people (27%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","27","12","45","4","0"

Was it fun? Yeah, for the 10, 15 minutes I spent playing it before the game called me a loser after beating the final boss. Yes, it was that quick.\n\nI do recomend it, only because I had fun. The firing mechanics seem really slow and, honestly, I resorted to a hotkey script to autofire the whole time, but Samoliotik does have replay value despite the end killing my enthusiasm to play again. The developers are looking for ideas for updates so hopefully there will be more in the near future.

For what it is and for the price, it's enjoyable and relaxing, but quite different from other games I've played. You may notice that I only have about eight minutes clocked into the game. That's because within that eight minutes, I completed both levels and feel that I've experienced enough of the game to write a review. This game isn't about completing levels, it's about achieving a high score. The two different levels offered repeat themselves until you get killed and you continue to try to get a new higher score with each attempt. The game could not be more simple. There is no keyboard or controller used, only the mouse. You fly around in a plane like 1942 and shoot at other planes, then dollar signs. The objective is to defeat the flying illuminati, (LOL You will see what I mean). The music adds to the odd nature of the game but somehow fits quite well.I got the game at a steal of 1% off, (from 99 cents to 98 cents). For a dollar, you can't go wrong with an odd but relaxing game like this, but I wouldn't pay more than a dollar for it.","March 25","true","0.3"," 3 of 30 people (10%) found this review helpful","10","3","30","0","0"

I've stared too long at a screen with stuff moving down.\n\nSummary: extremely simple shmup game including some memes and nothing really new.\n\n- The gun fires relatively slow, which adds to the challenge, but sometimes it feels like it is not powerful enough to counter the amount of incoming enemies. But, in fact, it is enough.\n- There are enemies, and "shadows". The shadows are there just for the look, but they are more confusing than helpful.\n- There are no animations whatsoever. Just static monochrome images moving on the screen.\n\nThis feels like it is a game from someone who is learning how to build games.\n\nIt may be worth one playthrough if you are really, but really interested. But if you are looking for a good shmup, or a good game, look elsewhere. Also, I got this game for free.","May 3","false","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
