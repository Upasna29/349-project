I clicked do not recommend because I myself would not want this game recommended to me.  Not because it is bad or broken but because I don't enjoy it enough to warrant the price.\n\nIt is very well-polished, stable and the graphics are top-notch.  The UI is all click-based (think touch screen design) and easy to use.\n\nThis game however is very simplistic and is not a deep game with lots of variety or replay value which is a hallmark of Rogue-like games.  Personally I would not call this game “Rogue-Like” at all as it has only passing similarities. Primarily it has procedurally generated levels and the notion of progressing through multiple levels but that’s about where the similarities end.  I guess you could be generous and call it Rogue-Lite – very lite.\n\nThe game was designed as a mobile/tablet app and as so is intended for quick game play in between flights or while waiting at the doctor’s office.  It is not a “sit down at the PC for a few hours and build up your character game”.\n\nThere are only 3 stats for your character (Strength, Wits and Luck) and two gear slots (weapon and head).   From these stats and items are derived your attack, dodge, defense and critical ratings.  Plus you have hit points.  That’s it – that all of it.\n\nAll of the equipment is pretty similar stat-wise and basically offer some combination of modifying the 3 stats and may offer specific damage type or defense.  There are 60 melee weapons and about 20 ranged ones.  There are 60 head gear items, many of which have the same stats and just different graphics.\n\nThere are a total of 5 “classes” to choose from that you unlock while playing.  Their starting stats are all the same but each one has a unique ability they gain for a period of some moves when starting a level.  You level up each class separately. So in effect you are slowly upgrading each class over the course of the game – which is really the point of the game I guess.\n\nThe levels are very small – you usually can clear each one in a few minutes. They are basically a few “rooms” (maybe 5-7) with some hallways connecting them.  Monster variety is limited with 28 different creatures.  Gear occasionally drops from creatures but “potions” can be found here and there on the ground.  The potions are unknown at start and you basically burn one to find out what they do.\n\nOn each level you will also find two resources scattered about. Metal which is used to level up the strength, Wits or max HP of a class between level runs and crystals which are use to randomly generate head gear and weapons between levels. It appears that all the available gear can be randomly generated and there are no unique items only found as drops.\n\nMonsters wander around levels and when they get close enough, or are attacked by a ranged weapon, move towards you and attack.  Then your only option is to click the monster and go back and forth taking damage until one of you dies.  Killing monsters has no benefit other than they may drop some gear (rarely) or metal (often).  Some of the monsters are not hostile and can be completely ignored. On many levels you can make it through the entire level without having to fight a single monster.\n\nThere is no perma-death.  In fact there is no real death since you are a clone. You keep your character the entire length of time you play the game.  The only consistent aspect from session to session is the stat upgrades you purchase for each of the 5 classes between runs.\n\nThe entirety of the gameplay is to explore a level to try and grab as much metal and crystals as you can before proceeding to the next level.   Do this until you run out of life and die. Then respawn grab two new pieces of gear and do it over.  Just keep grinding metal and crystals to increase the stats of your classes.\n\nYour gear is lost when you die (but it’s not a big deal since you can generate all new gear between levels) but any stat increases made on each class is kept.\n\nIn summary if you are looking for a quick, low-depth game that centers on quickly grinding through as many small levels as possible before dying just to slowly build up a few stats without much power creep then you will probably like this game.  If, like me, you are looking for a deep game with lots of stats and equipment and skill options where you build up your very customizable character to progress as far as possible in a single dungeon then give this one a pass.","July 9, 2014","false","10.7"," 313 of 356 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","313","356","0","9"

While it's technically competent and visually attractive, with a nicely articulated sci fi theme, it unfortunately has little depth and a progression system solely based on grinding. I wasn't aware of the game's tablet roots when I picked it up, but they show through clearly in the design.\n\nThe game is a roguelite in the truest sense of the word "lite." The mechanics, stats, and equipment system are all very rudimentary, with character progression limited to three attributes and a couple of additional skills. Equipment is limited to a helmet, active weapon, and a few consumables. Progress is made by playing the game, dying, then spending earned points (scrap metal and crystals) to upgrade these basic stats and purchase new starting equipment. In practice, this means playing slightly remixed versions of the same few levels over and over again while slowly building up the necessary strength and resources to progress. Skill and tactics don't really come into it, it's all down to a repetitive turn based grind to slowly push through to new material while constantly replaying the old.\n\nAll in all, there's little to recommend Shattered Planet over roguelikes of greater depth and variety. It was fun for an hour or two, but by then I'd seen all of it that I cared to.","April 19, 2015","false","1.8"," 134 of 144 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","134","144","0","8"

They generally require a level of dedication and persistence I'm just not able to give, but that's what had me so addicted to Shattered Planet.\n\nThe game has a very simple and seamless one-click control system for movement and attacks as well as an incredibly clean and easy to use UI. Armed with only your headgear, trusty weapon, and a plethora of helpful and sometimes unidentified and dangerous items gathered along the way you'll be tasked with exploring deeper in to the broken pieces of this strange and ancient planet collecting as much resource as you can for your next trip. You will die and lose your items. A lot. The only question is how far can you make it before you fail, passing this heinous task onto the next unsuspecting clone?\n\nThis is easily the most accessible, easy to get into and just plain fun roguelike of recent memory and yet still offers the same complexity and depth of other top games in the genre in terms of the huge scope of items, classes, events, and enviroments. At the center of the game is the Science Lab your cloned characters seem to be born from acting as the hub for your journey. You have tons of options here to prepare for the oncoming descent including the Clone Vat you're spawned from giving you multiple class and character appearance options, a shop to gamble crystals away for new equipment to save for later trips, a training console for using your hard-earned scrap to increase stats, and a pet cloner for storing DNA of found companions all unlocked through your progress on the unknown floors below.\n\nThere are a multitude of modes to tackle all featuring engrossing procedurally generated alien landscapes, starting with the Explorer mode which is a progressive journey that slowly edges you deeper into the fragmented shards of these broken planets as you earn more scraps to better prepare yourself for each consecutive run.  Players also have three challenge modes of varying difficulty to test your wits after prolonged practice and equipment hoarding and last but certainly not least the Daily Challenge which gives everyone a new planet generated every day and predetermined gear to try their luck with.\n\nShattered Planet is gorgeous and absolutely pleasing to the eyes to play, thanks to the stunning hand-drawn artwork and organic backgrounds that make you feel as though you've stepped into some otherworldly painting. The game has a very engaging sci-fi setting with a dystopic tale of impending human extinction, and while the overtone and story of your hundreds of re-cloned human explorers is mostly serious there are some very humorous moments in your adventures. For example, going into battle near the beginning of my career as an explorer with nothing but my Cabbage Helmet and a rolled-up newspaper as my weapon felt great everytime.\n\nShattered Planet breathes a fresh breath of air into the roguelike genre and is easily recommendable for players of all skill levels, whether it be casual explorers looking for a relaxing bit of discovery and progression or more hardcore roguelike veterans who want to go for that perfect run on the daily challenge.","July 3, 2014","true","16.7"," 105 of 130 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","105","130","0","6"

Progress is tied to finding new enemies,events, items, etc which then unlocks new characters. Most of the actual character progression happens via upgrades after a run which is similar to rogue legacy.\n\nProblems are a lack of information and deeper mechanics to get into. If you're a hardcore fan of Rogue-likes, you may find this too simple to really get into. But it's good for people looking for a rogue-lite that's relaxing or something to introduce the genre to a new player to.","January 15, 2015","true","2.4"," 59 of 64 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","59","64","0","0"

Even so it is still a lot of fun to play on the PC but the lack of any keyboard integration is annoying to say the least since the game could easily be played through it. Also the inherent focus on the mobile market for this game makes it a tad less deep than the game could have been but for the price, it's still a pretty good game that offers good value for what it charges.\n\nThe game is very easy to get into and is fun to play, at least for a while, most games don't even get this far so if you are a genre fan, check it out.","March 4, 2015","true","40.2"," 34 of 39 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","34","39","2","0"

You are a clone generated on some sort of space station. You teleport to planets on a quest to scour and repair these shattered planets. You also have an alien scientist that helps you learn and explain the situation along the way -- I don't want to ruin any of it. xD\n\nGameplay: 8/10\nAll you need is a mouse to control this game, and it's incredibly functional. There are multiple types of classes to choose from, at first just the Renegade and the Assassin. Each planet you travel to has increasing "distances" or levels, that each get harder, to collect items, scrap, and crystals. You mostly use scrap to level up stats and crystals to craft or buy items. You can also recycle items for scrap. You move around and attack by clicking, with only two equipment slots -- a helmet and a weapon. Your inventory can consist of health items, projectiles and potions.\n\nGraphics: 8/10\nAn appetizing take on graphics choice for this type of isometric view. It's very reminiscent of something like Shadowrun, but a little more cartoonish. The different sprites for customizing your clone is very dynamic as well. Definitely a unique style.\n\nSound: 6.5/10\nThe atmospheric music fits the game well, but for a game with a pace like this I'd expect a little more action in the soundtrack. Still the mood of the music is so very appropriate for the melancholy of the worlds you're immersed in. The sound effects are a little repetitive and could be expanded upon as well.\n\nOverall: 7.5/10\nA solid game with lots of replayability and character customization. For any fan of roguelikes this is definitely a title you need to pick up and take a look at for a slightly different take on the genre. I think with maybe a few DLC releases, possibly some new music and weapons/armor/worlds, this could become a definite standout game. You won't be disappointed in this title.","February 23, 2015","true","8.7"," 49 of 64 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","49","64","2","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/evilhippie/recommended/305640/","evilhippie","Evilhippie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/evilhippie/","5012 products in account","If there’s one thing that remains constant in Shattered Planet, it’s that you’re going to die, and die a lot.  Indeed, in this particular subset of the RPG genre, it’s not a matter of if you’re going to die, but just a matter of when.  Shattered Planet, as a space themed dungeon crawler, embraces the inevitability of death, taunting the player to conquer just one more floor before sealing their impending doom.\n\nAs an isometric rogue-like adventure, Shattered Planet looks and plays very well.  The character sprites and environments are beautifully detailed, though the game lacks variety somewhat in the number of tile-sets and enemy types.  Similar to other games in the genre, combat is turn based, with the usual array of weapons, armor, and potions one would expect.  The main game mode, Explorer, throws the player into an infinite dungeon, and though each floor itself is short, the descent into the dungeon is effectively endless.  When the player succumbs to their inevitable death, all items found in the dungeon are lost, though currency is found on each run to spend in the waiting area on upgrades and character development, or the player can spin a random item wheel with 3 potential tiers.  Unfortunately, there is no real crafting system present, nor the ability to sell accumulated junk to for currency.\n\nBeing an adaptation of a mobile port, the micro-transaction currency shop has been removed, though the mobile version is marketed as free to play.  At times, collecting currency to upgrade can seem to be frustratingly slow, as once you are teleported back to the main area, you will more than likely spend that currency obtaining new weapons, armor, and items for the next run.  The class variety is also somewhat narrow, with the only differentiation being a different starting bonus that wears off rather quickly.  While players receive experience and items for “identifying” new things found along each new run, it’s apparent that the variety of dungeon types and item-sets is limited.  After a few runs, everything begins to blend in and seem a bit familiar, leading to that undesirable tedium so often loathed as the “grind”.\n\nThat’s not to say Shattered Planet is not a fun game in its own right.  Despite the lack of variety in the content, what’s there is well done and quite polished.  You might see the bulk of what Shattered Planet has to offer fairly quickly, but it’s enjoyable along the way.  Though there are five different player characters, they’re all similar enough that they essentially only differ in character sprites.  Of course, you could play through multiple times with different characters, but there doesn’t feel to be any reason to do so without more clearly a defined delineation between the classes.  The lack of a crafting system in Shattered Planet really feels like a missed opportunity.\n\nThough it has its roots as a mobile game, Shattered Planet is a surprisingly fun for what’s there.  While it may be one of the more stylistic rogue-likes to come out recently, the game would benefit greatly from additional content at its current $14.99 asking price.\n\nFor more game reviews and in-depth information make sure to visit Feed Me Pixels[www.feedmepixels.com].\n\n-Evilhippie","July 30, 2014","true","2.9"," 37 of 47 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","37","47","0","1"

But I can't recommend it because of one glaring problem: there isn't much game.\n\nThere are some different classes and a range of abilities. The problem is that everything is gotten through grind and that there's only about two tactics: walk up and bash things that you have to while avoiding others or manage to get a gun and kite things. The first way is the way you go because you don't have a gun. You try to survive as long as possible and die due to attrition. Skill is not going to save you here. If you have a gun and a shovel on the other hand you can survive anything. You'll eventually die simply because you get too bored to keep paying attention.\n\nA level basicly goes like this: enter a level, get as many goodies while taking the least possible damage and find a teleporter to get to the next level. If you're successfull, the game will quickly run out of things to throw at you. Expect to see the same levels and enemies time and time again, just in a randomized layout (which doesn't really change much)\n\nThe only thing that stands out in this game are the random event tiles. Stones or stumps that look slightly different. If you click on them, you get an event, followed by a choise and a skill check. This is the best part of the game.\n\nIn the end, the game relies a lot on grinding and doesn't offer enough variety or gameplay depth to back it up. You can have fun for an hour or two. You can pick it up at a very low price, but I recommend you quit playing once it's starting to feel a bit boring because it's not going to get any better.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nourl1/recommended/305640/","nourl1","Two Clicks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nourl1/","547 products in account","VERDICT: Shattered Planet is a fun, enjoyable and for the most part non-taxing casual rogue-like-lite. Though its an iOS port With a simple formula, its solid design and addictive gameplay offer a range of unique experiences ensuring the somewhat repetitive nature of gameplay doesnt detract with each playthrough.  With multiple game modes and a host of research items to discover it will keep your interest high for weeks if not months.\n\nIf you enjoy taking a character to explore small randomly generated maps, exprience many unique events, collect a vast amount of unique items, while fighting off enemy monsters then this could be something for you.  With minimal RPG elements, basic character skills and inventory management the game is a great little time killer between those larger budget games you no doubt play.\n\n\n... More info below ...\n\n\n01. GENRE: 2.5D Isometric, adventure, lite rogue-like, mobile port.\n\n02. SETTING: From your starship orbiting a strange unsurveyed planet, you take on the role of an expendable clone  created to conduct exploration missions and discover what is on the planet below.\n\n03. STORY/BACKGROUND: Once you step into the teleporter on your ship you are beamed onto the ground below.  Your mission is to explore the different areas of the planet which are split into levels. Arrayed across the map you will meet the indiginous people, an assortment of random and varied enemies to defeat, items to collect, events to experience and obstacles to overcome.  Your aim is to discover and catalogue serveral hundred elements unique to this world and in some modes reach the end level of the mission.  Standing in the way of progress is the deadly invincible blight, that follows you from the beginning of each level ready to infect and overcome every living being in its path.  To avoid succumming to its effect you must locate and reach teleporter that will transport you to the next level.\n\n04. GAME MODES: There are four types of game mode: the basic quest - Daily Challenge (10 levels), the Exploration Challenge (150+ levels) and the two harder Signal and Old Blood Challenges (10 levels).  All with their own objectives.\n\n05. GAMEPLAY/MECHANICS: Though the games biggest draw is the element of exploration resource collection and harvesting plays a big part.  Perhaps the game's greatest strength is the numerous gameplay mechanics included with its uncomplicated design.  Numerous playable archetypes(character types), several recruitable allies; melee and ranged combat with dozens of varieties of weapons, armors for protection, resistance and immunity to certain elements, collectibles for healing or boosting character stats and abilities.\n\nThe starting area of the starship contains several consoles and dispensers from which you can setup options such as character archetype, starting inventory for the next game.  They also allow you to upgrade character stats, choose your ally and, buy weapons, armors and item from dispensers using two resource types.  Resources include metals to upgrade stats and minerals which can be used to make other purchases.\n\n06. ENEMIES/OPPONENTS: There are too many to name here but the variety of enemies means it will take you a while to discover all of them and what their weaknesses are.  Sometimes you will not have the perfect weapon or item to quickly take care of them, so you will either have to improvise or flee.  The most common enemy types are: Crabs, Robots, Humanoid Natives and Plant-life.\n\n07. LEVEL DESIGN: Levels consist of four or more areas defined by terrain.  Areas can number from four upwards depending on the game mode or the depth of level entered.  Terrain can be destroyed with weapons.  Levels are covered with events and collectibles provide the player with tough choices.  What to do or what to keep in order to remain intact and progress as far as possible.\n\n08. A.I: The A.I controlling the various npcs and enemy monsters does a good job of randomingly sending them towards or away from you so until you get too close they seem to be oblivious to you.  Unless you attack them of course.  As there is little interaction by the computer controlled critters the A.I is basic but good enough for the job.\n\n09. CONTROLS: Good basic keyboard and mouse controls.  For an iOS port, mouse control is up to the standard you would expect for PC games.\n\n10. GRAPHICS: The graphics are well-drawn and cute, if rather basic.  Overall the aesthetics are functional and nice.\n\n11. SOUNDTRACK & AUDIO: A simple repeating melodic tune which changes when combat starts is the mainstay of the games sound.  Its apt but nothing to write home about.\n\n12. VOICE ACTING: Minimal but used to good effect during the tutorial and at key levels during certain game modes.\n\n13. CHALLENGE/DIFFICULTY: The game has a useful tutorial at the start.  Progression is measured almost perfectly with a learning curve that will match most players commitement to the game.  In addition achievements mark significant events so if you go after them you will learn more about how the game mechanics work and what you should be doing.\n\n14. PROBLEMS: Only a very few which required a restart at most.  More annoying than game-breaking.  Sometimes the tooltip for held inventory items can become stuck and take up part of the screen.  Only moving the mouse pointer over the item fixes this.\n\nA few minor bugs with interacting inventory when buying items from the randomly located robot trader.   Sometimes this will lock up you game and you will be unable to move.  Can be fixed by restarting the game but any progress for that level will be lost.  Annoying but not game-breaking.\n\n15. ACHIEVEMENTS: Actually a great mix of achievements.  A few teach you the games basics. Most though can be categorized as: Kill x y z; Complete each game mode; Complete n amount of research or upgrade character stats.  Just be warned that two to three achievements will need many hours to grind - at least and most likely more (2x kill 10000 critters).  Be aware that one achievement is unobtainable.  Complete ALL research is bugged with and events items not in the game. Unfortunately the game looks abandoned so dont expect any fixes.\nEDIT: 16 Mar 2016 - broken achievement removed.  Now 100% completeable.\n\n16. DLC: There are no dlc and none planned.\n\n17. PLAYTIME: You could play most of what the game has to offer in around 25-30 hours.  That includes the 4 major game modes.  Though you would probably need to play around 50 hours to get your character up to the sort of level you will need to get to level 50 and beyond on the Exploration mode.  I have 100 hours with 70/71 achievements, the only remaining one is the bugged research probably requiring many more hours to get all the available research items. Something Im not bothered with.\n\n18. LONGEVITY/REPLAYABILITY:  There is a massive amount of longevity and replayability in this game.  Yes the nature of gameplay is repetitive but which game isnt...  the game seems to be designed around this (as you'd expect) to a certain degree as its a mobile port.\n\n19. ENJOYMENT/APPEAL: Anyone who likes rogue-likes or doesnt mind good mobile ports will enjoy playing this.  Though if you dont like casual games of a somewhat repetitive nature then it wont be for you.  Even though it has lite RPG elements I dont think there is enough for players who may want something deeper.  It really is something you can play for 5-15 minutes each day but no more than an hour or so.  Short spurts of fun.\n\n20. VALUE FOR MONEY: Excellent a full price even if you only play twenty or so hours.  In a sale its a bargain.  If you intend to play this well-made game for longer then you'll get many weeks / months of entertainment for peanuts - no sweat.","September 20, 2015","true","107.7"," 33 of 41 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","33","41","0","0"

One research vessel, outfitted with a mostly-naked Gekkian scientist, a random equipment generator, and an endless supply of clone explorers, has set out to understand and stop the Blight before it completely takes over. A nearby planet, shattered after a long-dead explosion, is putting off a Blight-resistant signal. Your assignment, as clones one-through-infinity, is to survey the planet, seek out the signal, and deal with any other bizarre challenges sent your way. There will be plenty.As a randomized survival RPG, Shattered Planet thrives on the unexpected. From the armor your clone wears down to the planet to the results of enemy encounters, nothing is directly under your control. A typical trip begins on your spaceship hub, where you can use R.O.S.A., the equipment generator, to create weapons and armor.  But you can only tell it what value of equipment to produce—bronze, silver, or gold—not specifically what item. You can also buy consumable items from the “Crystalobot,” a friendly vending machine that sells a variety of randomized goods ranging from healing items to pet companions.Once satisfied with your clone’s loadout, you send her to the planet’s surface to tackle either a limited-scope mission or an endless survival run.  Both play out in similar fashions, pitting your clone against a series of procedurally generated and progressively difficult levels connected via teleporters.  Missions end after a certain number of levels and goals have been met, while survival lasts as long as your clone does.  Depending on your gear and experience withplanet-exploration, that could be no time at all.There are a staggering number of ways to die in Shattered Planet, some more obvious than others.  Most of the local wildlife is fierce and unfriendly, hunting your clone as soon as they lay eyes on them beyond the fog of war.  The Blight itself, ever-oozing across the land, damages both health and fauna by turning creatures into deadlier versions of their former selves. Random encounters that might provide rewards just as often result in a surprise attack, curse, or other malady that degrades your clone for a short period. Luckily, since all actions are turn-based and time stops when your clone does, you have plenty of opportunity to plan ahead and either prepare for or avoid the dangers at hand.Encountering those dangers, taking the risk, and possibly earning a reward is half the fun, though. Slain enemies regularly drop golden scrap, which is used to perma-upgrade your clone as well as purchase consumables. Valuable items and crystals are often waiting just beyond those sharp-clawed crablets.Growing physically—by improving your Strength, Wits/Evasion, and Health—and mentally—by learning from your mistakes—allows you to travel further on the next run, earn more goodies, and keep the cycle going.The constant progression, rewards, and dangers keep Shattered Planet‘s gameplay engaging. But it’s the kooky inhabitants, unexpected encounters, and sheer charm of its world that will encourage teleporting down again and again.Shattered Planet has landed in the sweet spot between learnability and surprise that keeps each trip new, fresh, and entertaining.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/305640/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","Roguelikes have consistently been a niche sub-genre despite their fervent fanbase, but their popularity has exploded with recent titles such as FTL: Faster Than Light, Rogue Legacy, and Dungeons of Dredmor. Joining the ranks is Shattered Planet, Kitfox Games' debut title. With smooth, vibrant graphics and an isometric layout, the game certainly holds an appeal its less graphically-inclined predecessors lack, but how does the gameplay hold up?\n\nIn Shattered Planet, you play clones that have been created to explore alien habitats for science. Each area is randomly generated and has a teleporter that leads to the next "distance." You can choose to map out the entire location or move on as you see fit. In dire times, it's possible to jump down to the next distance from certain spots on the map, but at a high health cost. A blight grows from each spawn point per turn, and it threatens to consume the entire area. Blighted tiles deal damage when you walk across or stand on them. This creates a time factor to consider, as they can cut off paths. Enemies touched by the blight morph into more difficult versions, and they likely take the closest path towards the clone.\n\nYou can go on general explorations to discover new locations, enemies, items, and events. Unlike the other missions, where dying results in the loss of all items, daily missions let you retain the provided starting gear if the clone makes it to distance 10. The galactic federation provides item boons as knowledge of the various worlds is unlocked.\n\nWhile traversing the land, the clone collects scrap and crystals, both a form of currency for different benefits. Scrap, often lying around or gained from killed enemies, enables upgrades to the Attack, Fate, and Health stats of clones across missions. Additionally, each of the five clone types has unique powers and a special activatable ability that can be upgraded for power or frequency of use. For example, the robot's abilities are: cross bridges for free, items are cheaper, and send an item back to base during a mission. Crystals, which are rarer, are used to roll for bronze-, silver-, or gold-rated headgear or weapons for future missions, to buy discovered items from the shop, or to bring an enemy clone as an ally on the next mission.\n\nLimited to one headgear, weapon, and three additional items per mission, it would be wise to choose carefully. Healing items are rather rare, but locations spawn potions of different colors, and their effects are a random roll each mission. They run the gamut of healing, damaging, buffs, and utility, and the effects are unknown until at least one use. So, the clone or an enemy could be a test subject, but my favorite choice is the ground. Events, which are often clickable objects that look out of place, provide two decisions to choose from, and often result in an ally, buff, or item. A shop is also available on each distance, which offers one fixed and one random item for scrap. Ultimately, the game is a gamble between how far the clone can survive exploring while coming out on top in items — losing too much health is an inevitable death sentence, but maybe, just maybe, there's a healing potion right around the corner from that big, nasty plant... only one way to find out!\n\nAs Shattered Planet operates on an isometric grid, players click on the tile they wish to move to, and each tile advancement counts as a "turn" in the tactical meanderings of the Blight and enemies. The game automatically paths and displays the clone's potential movement from point A to B, but it is so poorly calculated that even if the same number of steps in a different manner will result in avoiding a blighted tile, the pathing will curiously land the clone right there. The alternative is to carefully plot points when such hostile environments exist; certainly not game breaking, but this could result in unintended damage when accidentally or hastily selecting a tile. Precisely because the game is reliant on clicking, rather than arrow keys, there lies a tendency to click on the furthest visible tile in a straight, clear line rather than inching forward, during which an enemy may spot the clone from the revealed shadows and attack before the pathing is even complete. Certainly, these gripes can be avoided by simply playing cautiously at all times and bludgeoning the devil in your head that goes "LEEEROYYY JENKINSSSSS!!!"\n\nMy biggest issue with the game is its lack of data for practically everything. An accessible compendium provides generic descriptions and occasionally amusing blurbs regarding all maps, items, events, and enemies, but it has little to do with gameplay. Does an enemy do electric damage? What kind of enemies spawn here? How long does this effect last? It's thematic that no "information" will be collected until an enemy is killed (for dissection, I suppose), but when the game provides items that give elemental damage and resistances, it would be nice to know exactly what they are useful for. Considering that the clone doesn't start with or come across many weapons or armors in a mission, there is absolutely no way to try to engineer a better solution. Granted, the advisor on the ship occasionally quips helpful advice like, "crablets are sensitive to blunt-type damage" but he doesn't cover them all (I tried), and weapons are not categorized as blunt or sharp (surprise!). Item descriptions are fairly straightforward aside from those finer details, but everything else is a hit or miss.\n\nIn spite of these shortcomings, the game is an addicting, enjoyable experience. The graphics are pleasing and the enemies so thematically crafted for each background type, such as grasslands, deserts, and tundra, that it barely matters that both background and enemies are frequently reused for different "locations." Each attack lands with a satisfying chunk, and I love the sweet, futuristic whir of the teleporter whisking the clone away from danger. Generally pleasant but forgettable, the background music fits the location's theme, and is often overshadowed by the sound effects.\n\nShattered Planet aligns itself more as a roguelite rather than roguelike, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. With polished graphics and engaging gameplay, it warrants an exploration for science. After all, who needs to live forever when you can just clone yourself!\n\nRecommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!\n\nNote - This game was provided by the publisher/developer with the request to write an unbiased, informative review.

Several similar turn-based tile-based with single-character games handle this sort of combat miles better than Shattered Planet. Items can be used for various effects such as displacing them, damaging at a distance and so on, but the core is basically clicking and and clicking, with little tactical maneuvers to be done other than try to use narrow passages so only one creature can hit you at a time. It's just not engaging enough and I felt tired for just about 15 minutes of doing this.\n-Pets can't be controlled at all\n-Item gamble should've been only divided into weapon and armor rather than by tiers which are useless since you can keep gambling for the highest tier literally after five minutes and the other two are there just for show. Even then, after about 10 tries I got 9 headgear and a single weapon, which made runs fairly more annoying.\n-The game bases itself in exploration of planets, but in the end there's just very little to find from exploring other than a slightly different enemy that behaves exactly the same and a new tileset to a map that feels the same as the last one\n\nOverall 4/10","March 23","false","0.7"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","20","23","0","0"

Adorable art style and object references,  Smooth and interactive gameplay and UI, solid mechanics and RPG element, it is a very enjoyable game.\n\nShattered Planet's biggest strength and weakness is its progression system.  Between each run player can and should purchase permenant upgrades which increases the raw strength of the player.  This provides consistent progression after each run which can be very exciting.  However this also incentivise grinding to obtain more power in order to face tougher challenge instead of relying on luck and skill to overcome obstacles like a true rogue-like game.  Since the upgrades do not change the way you play, the game can become stale quickly.  Also the system imposes a cap on the game; you'll only play to purchase all upgrades and explore all of the contents.

Nice graphics, sound, ambiance music. If it only possessed some content and a battle system that is more than "go next to enemy by clicking, now... click on him" Turn based is great, if you had options? You can if you were lucky to find any, heal of course, and then there's running away. Although running away means you will have an enemy one step behind you until you leave the level.\nThe first hour or so, you think this is kinda cool, yeah you die alot and loose you weapons and items, but you find enough loot to make more so it doesn't matter, and leveling is quick even though it doesn't excactly make you feel that much stronger. But after awhile, it feels that when you're level 15, the first level you've been playing over and over should be pretty much be a walk in the park without getting injured. But a little bad luck with the item you generated before this run, and you get injured enough to know that you won't make it any farther this run either. So all you can do is try to find as much loot as you can, hoping it will be enough for 1 more level and weapons that won't suck so hard that the next run is a waste of time too.\n\nThis started off great, but quickly got old, with no real story progression, the levels may change in design, but enemies are the same. The weapons you get really feels like playing a one armed bandit hoping for an item that makes the next 10minutes interesting and not, "oh, well, die and try again". And on your runs you can find bottles of unidentified liquid which does something different every time. The red liquid from last run that healed you, may now boost an enemy. Which isn't worth it, so me, I stayed away from using them fairly quickly, because they simply don't do enough that you should gamble a run you might have a decent weapon on.\n\nThis game needs more content, a better battle system and something that makes a run feel a little more unique. The run can't be doomed to end earlier than the last from the start, you should feel that you can make it, with a little luck.

I wouldn't recommend playing this game LOTS as the set pieces and quests begin to lose their value, but play a little bit each day and you'll find yourself looking forward to the next daily challenge, the next quest!

The RPG upgrades are permanent & include the usual parameters for boosting health, damage, resistances, etc.  Grow more powerful, obtain stronger gear, explore more dangerous alien habitats, defeat deadlier enemies to earn more loot...the clone consuming cycle continues!\n\nThe roguelike element is what you'd expect.  There are some mechanics in play to create urgency in your missions to explore & tame the alien wilds.  You'll find a nice variety of weapons, hats, consumables, enemies, events; a real sense of humor shines through the item & event descriptions.\n\nThe overall effect of game design, the progression system & the lighthearted humor is a refreshingly carefree experience, moreso than I recall in any other roguelike.  You fight like hell to survive & explore as far as possible with each venture then spend your resources to start anew stronger (& hopefully better equipped) than before.  Sure, you lose all your gear, but buying new stuff is super simple.\n\nThe game has a clean, sharp art style that I enjoy & enough variety of environments, creatures & weapons that it has some replayability.  I have only scratched the surface in regards to unlocking all items, planets, encounters, etc.\n\nWith only a handful of hours logged I feel I've already got the game figured out, simple as it is; yet I foresee myself continuing to enjoy this long into the future, whenever I'm looking for a quick bit of fun.  Recommended for all.","March 23","true","4.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

(Again!)\n\nI think the art style of this game is fantastic, and if you haven't guessed from the list above, I love sci-fi settings/game worlds. It allows for the artists and devs to create something cool and I always feel more immersed and exploritory when i run around in a futuristic universe. I enjoy the generation of the levels and progression.\n\nThe main exploration mode involves fighting down randomly generated levels to find loot and kill creatures. The farther down the greater the risk and reward. Upon death, weapons and armor equiped are lost, but scrap (money) and crystals (shiney money) and kept to be spent leveling your stats, buying items at the vending machine and spending crystals to randomly generate loot. You can also unlock various classes which have different skins and abilites/buffs. You then gather your upgrades, equip your weapon, trusty headgear and pet and voyage back into the unknown.\n\nKill more stuff, discover new events (which give crystals upon discovery) and enjoy the randomly generated worlds until death. Rinse, Repeat. (Did I mention you're a clone?)\n\nThe daily challenges give me more incentive to test my skill, wether for a short time or for longer sessions. Daily challenges give the player a certain set of equipment to start with and the goal is to see how far one can get before death.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/celebrusd/recommended/305640/","celebrusd","Festive","http://steamcommunity.com/id/celebrusd/","247 products in account","Shattered Planet leaves a lot to be wanted, as the mechanics of the game are very enjoyable, but the execution is incredibly poor. Although you may have fun with this game for a few hours after you purchase it, you'll find that during your later gameplay, you'll be feeling a lack of depth that doesn't really deserve to be there. Like another user said, binary reviews like this are bad for games like this, but I'll have to give it a thumbs down until other things are implemented.\n\nFor those who don't know, Shattered Planet is a rogue-life, turn-based strategy game in which your character travels to distant planets. These planets are the equivalent to dungeons in any other rogue-like; you find items, gain currency, and inevitably die only to return and do a little better each time. To Shattered Planets strong points, this game has several things to collect and playthrough, but that's the extent of depth you'll end up getting.\n\nPros:\n\n- Very visually pleasing.\n- Comical lines of dialogue.\n- Level design is great.\n- Extensive amount of gamemodes.\n\nCons:\n\n- Not enough items.\n- Small pool of abilities.\n- AI on companions lack-luster.\n- No crafting stations.\n- Expensive upgrades.\n- Sometimes dull grind.\n\nThe things that Shattered Planet does right is in its visuals. The game deserves to pride itself on how aesthetically engaging it is, considering the variety of biomes you can explore and the massive level design that continues to produce original and fun maps over the several hours I've played. I've not once felt annoyed to go into a certain point in the level because no specific artwork bores me, unlike other games like Tales of Maj'eyal and Dungeons of Dredmor.\n\nHowever, there is a massive shadow looming over this game that makes it not enjoyable after a certain amount of hours. You can experience this with the substantial lack of items, small pool of abilities, horrible companion AI, and almost zero ability to craft your own items or at least upgrade them to a better weapon. This can sometimes make it a very difficult grind because, without much customization, the game falls flat quickly.\n\nWhen you first play the game, finding all the weapons are pretty fun. All seem to have their own traits, like increased punctured damage or critical hit, but that's about all the depth you'll get with the weapons. It would be nice if the developers would add a crafting bench, another currency sink other than simply spending tons of money on static weapons from the store.\n\nI imagine that adding this bench would allow you to spend currency in order to put different upgrades on your weapons or smelt them in order to get different resources in order to make your own weapon. Since enemies in the game have specific weaknesses and they appear on predictable levels of the game, having this type of crafting bench would be very important for people wanting to breeze past the first levels. Right now, you'll struggle through every run-through, which can be dull.\n\nThere's also a very small pool of abilities. What I mean by that is, you don't have any active abilities, the characters that you choose have passive abilities. Some are much more strong than the other characters, which almost defaults you to a couple of playstyles, which sucks for a rogue-like. It would be great to add some more abilities, even active ones, that players could use to enhance their gameplay. Right now, all you do is chop with subpar weapons and try to take as less damage as possible before going to the next floor.\n\nAI's suck. They're supposed to be companions that attack for you, defend you, and stop you from taking damage. 9 times out of 10, they don't listen and they rarely attack unless you force them into a position to attack by moving several spaces. It can be tedious, especially when you're surrounded with tough enemies and your companion is doing nothing but snoozing in the corner. You'll die because of this - several times, and that just adds to your misery.\n\n...and this all adds up to a boring game, giving you very little for what you're putting in. With how expensive some of the upgrades are (health, dodge, and attack) and how insignificant they seem to be in-game, you're going to find that you'll get bored of grinding the first few floors until you just switch the game off and uninstall. The only reason I haven't done this is because I'm an achievement hunter and look to collect them all, haha.\n\nAll-in-all, I don't recommend this game just because of the systems I wish were added. The weapons are simple, the characters are simple too - it just leaves so much to be wanted and it's unfortunate for a game like this, a game that is very pleasing and has so much potential, but falls flat on its face because of developers that aren't attentive to quality designs. Find another rogue-like to play, mates, this isn't a good one to sink your time into.","September 25, 2015","false","8.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I definitely enjoyed most of my ~20 hours of playtime, which was enough to finish story mode and make a 39-floor run through explorer mode. However, there are some caveats. This game has some depth, but not as much as it seems to, and balancing the usefulness of items is a problem.\n\nIn terms of depth and mechanics - both elemental attack and defense are extraneous; I've found only two monsters in the game that attack with pure elemental damage, and all the rest are primarily physical based. If you want to fight, you'll more often than not ignore elemental rock-paper-scissors entirely (I'm not even sure it exists, as monster entries in the compendium only list resistances, not weaknesses) and settle for bashing your way through.\n\nHowever, fighting becomes unnecessary if you find two other somewhat gamebreaking items in a playthrough. One removes the enforced time limit from each stage if used correctly, and the other means instant death for any monster (but no drops) as long as you're positioned right. Both have timeouts and may take some time to find (and the second one seems bugged and will not affect certain monsters adjacent to the player), which limits their power slightly, but once you have them there's practically no other strategy that's as effective as using them. Unfortunately, this lack of viable alternate strategies makes the game less playable in the long run, and I hope the devs address this.","July 5, 2014","true","19.6"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Orrus/recommended/305640/","Orrus","Orrus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Orrus/","317 products in account","Shattered Planet is a charming rogue-lite in which you play as a disposable clone sent to discover and explore fragmented Alien worlds. The core gameplay loop is simple - Click to move, click to attack, and wander around the map discovering new items, enemies, and events. You will inevitably die, losing all of your equipped gear and items and hope you earned enough resource to upgrade your stats, or unlock a new pet or character class. Then buy a new set of random gear from the vending machine, and head out for another run. Shattered Planet captures the spirit of a classic rogue-like, but it’s extremely simplified mechanics, soft-core difficulty and lack of strategic depth will leave fans of the genre wanting more. I give it a thumbs up, as it held my attention for a good few hours.\n\nThe Good:\nThe sprites and art style are clean, consistent and fresh looking.\nItem descriptions and flavor texts are clever and well written.\nMenu interaction and combat feels responsive, polished, and smooth.\nLarge variety of world tile sets, and item icon art.\nProgression feels rewarding, with stat increases and unlocks coming at a slow, but steady pace.\nPets are a nice addition and a very important ally.\nRandom event tiles are rare, but exciting. They present a choice between two options, where a skill check determines if you found a new item, a new pet, or spawned a monster, etc.\nDNA menu shows all the monsters, events, items, and tile-sets you’ve discovered through an easy to navigate, slick looking UI.\nDaily quest with random gear set provided for free.\nThere is a free Android version available, and while it has less features than the Steam version it could serve as a free demo.\nThe Bad:\nShattered Planet has a REALLY slow start. For the first few hours expect to fail constantly, get one shot, and not feel like you’re progressing. Farming scrap to get your stats up, and unlocking a pet will get you over the hump.\nMoving around the map feels slow and clunky due to a slight hitch or animation pause at each tile.\nPet AI is insanely, atrociously, bad. The pet is so extremely important to your survival since it acts as a damage sponge, but 90% of the time it stands there, refuses to attack, or moves away from enemies.\nOnly 2 equipment types: Weapons, and Helmets. And only 3 player stats: Strength, Wits, and Fate. Gearing your character just isn’t interesting when there are only 2 slots. Before a run you just slap on a helmet with the highest star rating, and a weapon with a proc and go. There aren’t enough interesting or strategic choices when it comes to gearing your character.\nEquipment doesn’t feel special since you lose it after every run, and even the best item is only marginally better than an average item.\nStats feel inconsequential. You don’t feel any more powerful after increasing your stats, or wearing an item with a stat bonus. The power curve is too subtle.\n90% of the items you use will come from a vending machine in home base which spawns items for a resource. It’s just not very exciting to push a button in a safe zone and have items pop out. I’d much rather loot these items when out in the field, or have the top tier items ONLY spawn out in the maps.\nSome mechanics are poorly explained. Like how recycling items is one of the best ways to gain scrap. Or what exactly defense does.\nLocked rooms require you to find a key to open, but rarely contain anything special.\nEnemy variety is lacking. Sadly many of the enemy sprites are just minor variations of each other, so a lot of them end up looking and feeling the same.\nPotion identify mechanic inspired by classic rogue-likes doesn’t fit well in such a “lite” game. There should be some way to permanently identify potions, after say using it 100 times, or paying lots of scrap (resource).\nConfusing goals and win conditions. NPC buddy says I’m supposed to map out each world which gives the impression that I should fully explore each map. But mission UI says rewards are given based on how deep you reach not how many tile’s you explore.\nShattered Planet would be 10x better with a healing skill available to all classes. There are some consumable items you can use to restore health, but they are both extremely weak and rare. The last character class to unlock does have a heal skill, and he feels extremely overpowered compared to the other classes.\nStat training costs increase sharply which means it’s far more efficient to level the cheapest stat rather than specialize in one. This discourages specializing in one stat, makes all the classes feel the same, and feels like poor design.\nShattered Planet is fun in short bursts, and slightly addicting. The engine and art style are fantastic, so they really could do great things with this game if they continue to support it. But as it stands, the lack of depth and dumbed down mechanics don’t hold my interest for very long. I would say Shattered Planet is worth a buy at around $10, or if they patch in a new content update. If you do give it a go, be sure to stick with it for at least 2-3 hours to get past the slow start.\n","July 7, 2015","true","9.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

After the first 200 turns, it’s the same clone. Eventually, your clone is going to become so powerful that the initial advantage that a particular clone grants you (regeneration, sneak, etc.) would be meaningless.\n- Not enough variety. The daily challenge is nice, but after you beat it, you are left with the three “return with all items you found” quests, which are fairly repetitive, especially if your clone is of a high level.\n- No procedurally-generated weapons or items (a la Diablo, if you will). Not sure if it’s a fair criticism, but it was problematic for me.\n- On my final exploration, I reached close to 60 levels of depth with a possibly game-breaking combination of items (another reviewer pointed that out, too) and the fun was gone. I was just grinding for gold and each monster was so powerful that it could one-shot kill me... which happened eventually. Past a certain clone level, you will find yourself grinding for gold as well (or items, if you do the side quests).\n\nFor now, I will lay off playing the game, but I sincerely hope the developers improve it and you guys support them by buying it or providing helpful feedback.","July 6, 2014","true","42.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

I got it bundled with a few other games, so it was a steal, really.\n\nBasically, you're exploring the surface of a planet that shifts every time you visit it. There are loads of different items, and events on every level. Somewhere on each level is a portal to take you to the next 'distance', and on explore mode every three distances gets you more points for buying better equipment/upgrades.\n\nYou can also find the means to upgrade/buy equipment on each distance. There are potions that you pick up as well, but each one has to be tested by throwing it or quaffing it, each go around, because the effects shift. This adds a strategic layer, because some of the potions can be very useful. For instance, there's a darkness that grows and gradually consumes the whole level as it follows you, but one of the potions will blow up a few square blocks - you can use this to stop the darkness' progress for that distance, and give yourself the freedom to explore the whole level at your leisure.\n\nI also found the events pretty interesting. You usually have two ways to react to the different events you run into, each with stat checks - so you can end up with some nice bonuses, or a title that follows you until you die.\n\nAnyway, I think that it's a pretty interesting game. If you're looking for an absolute blockbuster, this isn't it, but it IS a really well put together, beautiful indie game that is fun to play.","October 6, 2015","true","14.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

It's quite a good game all in all, but it tends to fall flat in places where it has so much potential.\n\nThe story is basically nonexistent, and those hungering for some sort of story to latch onto will find themselves clinging to the pathetic shreds of the missions.\n\nThe simplicity ends up working against it. At a certain point, one might feel that they are simply blazing past the first few levels then suddenly hitting a wall where the difficulty is ramped up so much they are one shotted. But til that point, strategy is minimal anyways.\n\nI recommend this game, however, because it still offers quite a fun time. It is amusing to learn, fun to watch, and easy to pick up, do a quick run, and drop when something else comes up. The dev team, too, is great, lightheated and very responsive. They are truthful as well, and basically everything a gamer could want from the developers.\n\nThe game is definitely worth getting, if not just for the gameplay, then to support the devs. I am also hoping they will add more content in the future, as this game and mechanics seem to have a lot of potential, and I heartily recommend it to anyone who enjoys a simple, Rogue-lite type game to bring out every once in a while.","November 1, 2014","true","24.1"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"

The different character classes are unlocked by finding enough new stuff. Each enemy, item, area, and event are recorded in a journal of sorts, and after discovering enough, your Research Level will increase, which unlocks the characters and gives you a randomized bonus item. You play as a clone, and when you die, you get 'resurrected/cloned' back at the base.\n\nThe classes, of which there are 5, are mostly a different skin with a different passive ability and a limited use skill. For example, the Assassin has better range with Guns(which is this games version of Wands), and increased damage with them, along with better unarmed damage.\n\nThe Items themselves are not randomly generated, they're all premade, though what you'll find and where is still random. All of them have a unique appearance, along with a description that often proves amusing. Also, a lot of them reference something: Like Master Chiefs Helmet, a Lightsaber, and a Stormtrooper Helmet. As for types of items, there's consumables, which come in either food, or Canisters. The Canisters work exactly like Potions in other roguelikes, where there's only so many different types, but in the beginning of each run their appearance and name is random, and only by using or tossing them will you discover their uses, and btw, the food is for healing, though there are healing canisters too. Guns work like Wands, in that they do certain damage and/or effects.\n\nEquipment is kinda limited in my opinion. Well there's certainly a lot of different ones, but their restricted to the Weapon and Helmet category. They DO appear on your character visually, but I wish there were body armor and boots/gloves to deck your character in. Also, once you die in a run(which the default mode has no end, so you WILL die eventually), you lose your equipment, including the ones you brought on the run with you(you can equip your self back at the base/ship). This isn't too much of a problem, since there's enough items of good quality to acquire fairly easily.\n\nYou have a home base. as Ship in orbit, that you return to between runs. This is where you get most of your equipment, upgrade you character, etc. before a run. There are 2 currencies in the game: Scrap and Gems. Scrap is used to permanently upgrade your clones stats permanently, and btw, upgrades are tied to each of the classes, so if you buy 3 Strength Upgrades for the Assassin, your Renegade wont get those unless you buy them for him too. The price of the upgrade scales at a set amount, so first upgrade is 25 Scrap, second is 35, etc.. Gems are used for the R.O.S.E. machine thing in the base. I forgot what the acronym stands for, but it randomly generates Weapons and Helmets using Gems. Each equipment in the game is rated from 1 to 5 stars. At the ROSE, the Tier 1 generates 1-2 Star Items, Tier 2 generates 3-4 Star Items, and Tier 3 generates 4-5 Star items. They're fairly priced at 5/20/50 Gems respectively.\n\nYou can also have companion pets that help in battle, which are created/cloned at the base for Gems.\n\nThe 'get through level quickly' mechanic I mentioned earlier is sort of Creep/Corruption, called Blight. It's a black goo that slowly spreads through out the level, which hurts to step on, eventually spawns Blight Creatures which are fairly strong,\n\nI'll stop rambling now, but this is definitely a fun casual roguelike with nice graphics and and SFX/Music. The $15 price tag is a bit steep for the quality of the game, personally I feel it would be better in the $5-$10 range, but it's a must get on sale.","July 7, 2015","true","3.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Much in the way that rogue legacy has, each life you are collecting resources that you can use to improve your characters (I feel this game improves on this by allowing you to keep resources between lives). I really enjoy how the game is exploration driven, you get points and progress through the game by discovering new items, enemies, and environments. Another fun element you explore are "events" where you are given a choice and that affects your game play. For example, in one event you encounter a strong enemy who is injured and you're given the choice to kill it or heal it. If you heal it, then it becomes a companion animal and attacks your enemies.\n\nThe game has a great sci fi flavor, the art is great (and not pixel art which is nice), and most of all it's really fun to play.

The negative to me is that there are about 10 items in the data log that can never trigger and threads with developer show they're unlikely to ever fix it.

Levels are very quick to complete and have a nice 'one more level' flair.  Itemization is fairly diverse in flavor, but limited in impact.  There's a ton of random events, but unfortunately (again) they have little real impact (temporary stat boost).  Progression is tied to boosting stats based on resources collected during runs, and the needed amounts increase exponentially.  After about five to ten runs, you'll have more or less effectively maxed out your character.  This is a fine mechanic while you're still progressing, but the wall comes too quickly and too hard.\n\nUnfortunately, the game is its own worst enemy, as the mechanics break in really stupid ways.  Blight adds tension, but a common item makes it completely trivial and avoidable.  I enjoyed the game 100 times more when I didn't realize you could stop blight progression.  Also, enemies are easily teleported off into space, instakilled no matter the strength...what's the point in fighting and developing stats if you can just safely kill everything without a fight?  More importantly, anything past a certain level WILL one-shot you if you try to attack, no matter your stats.  Again, why bother with combat at all?  And finally, resource collects increase by level, so the best strategy is to simply teleport everything, get to the next level and collect random dropped items.  It's far more rewarding than doing it the 'right' way.\n\nFor the list price, I wouldn't say it's worth it.  I got it in a bundle (as the only thing I wanted in said bundle, but it was substantially cheaper) and am quite happy with that purchase.  I would've been much happier with it had there been an expansion pack (it's a little repetitious, even for a roguelite) and if the game was better balanced.  I did really enjoy it for a few hours.  Good setting, fun graphics, some interesting things to unlock earn it a reluctant thumbs up.  But ultimately, it's a bit too shallow and self-defeating for any lasting appeal.","July 6, 2015","true","19.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The story is interesting, and the concept of playing as a series of clones, sent to your sure death in the name of Science and Exploration, is pretty great.  As a warning - this does mean perma-death, for those who don't like the mechanic.  There are a few different ways to play the game (including a daily challenge-type mode) and none of it feels unpolished.   There are loads of unlockables, as well as several environmental and enemy types that have varying interactions.  I had a lot of fun discovering all the crazy, deadly and bizzarely adorable content in this game.\n\n\nThis game really is lacking in very few areas.  It does rely more heavily on RNG than any Rogue-Like I've ever played.  The difficulty (for me) eventually ramped up so hard that I couldn't begin to finish the game.  I have a suspicion that playing with one of the unlockable characters might have helped, but the idea of re-raising all of your stats (which carry over from clone to clone) turned me off.  I had spent way too much time just upgrading the one character I had started with.  As much as I enjoyed the game, I couldn't see playing through everything I'd already done all over again, just to get a chance to finish the content I had remaining.\n\n\n\n\nStill worth the price, and a fun way to spend some hours.  Give 'er a go.  I also found out that Shattered Planet is available on mobile.  As a turn-based game, with such depth, I actually would have prefered having it for my tablet.  For no particular reason, other than because there are so few games like this on mobile that are worth a damn.","October 21, 2015","true","31.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

But in no way do I love this game. There are many reasons why, and I would love to keep this review to being short and sweet.\n\nPROS:\n- I love the weapon and armour system in this game. The random piece of armour or random weapon that you get really adds to the "Rogue-Lite" feeling of this game.\n- The vast amount of levels. Playing this game has never ceased for me to find something new that I have either; stumbled upon by complete accident or spent minutes grinding.\n- The range of enemies. The amount of enemies in this game is actually friggin' jaw-dropping. I always fall upon a whole new, sometimes hardcore, enemy. This makes the game seem like it could be played forever due to the fact that there's always something new.\n- The Daily Challenges. The fact that this game gets new dailies... Daily, is amazing. The way that you can play the game every day and get a whole new run that everyone else would be doing. This also adds to the whole "Rogue-Lite" feeling.\n- The pets!! I, myself, am an avid animal lover. The fact that you can get animals in this game to fight alongside you and to kill your wildest foes is beyond happiness for me. I love picking out my cute, sometimes horrifying, pet.\n\nCons:\n- The biggest problem I see with this game is how GRINDY it feels. Okay, sure, that's to be expected of a "Rogue-Lite" but in no way should it be as grindy as it is. I find myself constantly trying to get that whole new weapon that I need or the final piece of armour that I need to complete my collection. Apart from the grinding, there's really nothing else I can flaw about this game. Sure, the actual gameplay gets some getting used to, and the fact that some of the missions seem very repetative, this game is really good.\n\nI would really recommend this game if you're on the hunt for that new Rogue-Lite to keep you on your toes for a few hours or maybe days. Solid game with solid elements and solid gameplay. I must-buy for you avid Rogue-Lite fans.\n\n","October 24, 2015","true","5.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Choose a clone, each with their own skillset and buffs, and traverse the ever-changing shattered pieces of an ancient planet crawling with monsters and tribals, littered with loot and new weapons to help you on your way as you progress onto harder and harder levels that are different every time. See how far you can get before the flora, fauna, or your own mistakes spell your end. You will die. A lot. But don't worry; your clone can pick up where you left off to start the adventure all over again with all the information and levels that your last one was able to earn before his untimely, and probably sudden, demise. But you're not always alone in this, you might sometimes also find it in your favor to either purchase or tame a companion or pet to help fight with you on your next trip to the surface. If you'd rather have a goal to reach instead of pushing the limits of your clone endlessly, there are 3 other difficult missions for you to complete with cool rewards for each, but you'll fare better practicing in endless first! Grab some scrap and crystals (money) in there to buy yourself some fancy murder-tools before pushing your luck in the missions. Travel a lot and you'll find it lying all over the place!\n\nGraphics: Clean isometric environments come together with soft, painterly-esque textures and crisp characters to make for an interesting but pleasing-to-the-eye adventure. Animations are smooth, but your clone's walk cycle usually seems a bit short or abrupt, but it's nothing too jarring. Waddle on, fresh meat.\n\nSound: Adjust sound and music to your preferences or turn them off completely. Tranquil and sometimes ominous music follows you on your travels, each pretty decently set to match your current environment which changes every few levels you progress through to mix it up and give you different enemies and events to find. Every time you stumble into a fight, though, you'll get a more rambunctious action clip to keep you on your toes, though this one only has a few variations based on the enemies you're fighting. I like the music in this game a lot and it's not too invasive or annoying. The fight music does sometimes make a jarring jump in volume compared to the other tracks, however.\n\nControls: The controls were obviously made for mobile platforms but everything is, thankfully, operated with the mouse. There are no key binding options, which is a shame as right now you need to click every tile you want to travel to and you can only see so many ahead of you. This game would greatly benefit even from simple arrow-keys or WASD walking controls, but the clicking-to-walk isn't really a deal-breaker; it's just a little annoying until you get used to it. The camera keeps your clone the center of focus, though, and sometimes I find my eyes feeling a little dizzy the way the environment moves but I stay riveted in the center of the screen, which probably isn't a problem for most people. Think Pokemon Mystery Dungeon.\n\nNotable/Other: It pains me to say that right now, several in-game items and events are bugged in such a way that you cannot find them through legal means. Since one achievement in particular banks on you being able to come across everything at least once to add it to and level up your data-log, that little bug makes this one achievement impossible to earn, along with one or two bugged events. They just seem to not be coded into the game to unlock the achievement once found. There is more information on this in the steam forums, but it seems that until the developers (a small team of 4) finish with their other, newest game-making endeavor, these achievements will remain broken. Achievement-hunters be advised.\n\nOverall: The game is fun, addicting, and easy to play; other than a few tiny annoyances, I feel Shattered Planet is well worth your time and attention, and even a few broken achievements don't make it unplayable. Believe it or not, some players enjoy a game with or without achievements. Personally, I love achievements, so it's a disappointment that a handful of them are broken, but truly, that's not going to keep me from playing this and having fun. I recommend nabbing it on sale.","August 4, 2015","true","151.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

As far as I can tell, it's a huge grind with minimal tactical or strategic complexity.\n\nEnemies are all equally fast as you and all do the same thing: charge and attack. I have yet to meet one with any special ability besides the monster spawners. Most of them are just critters with claws. The first boss can be beaten with a gimmick that would be almost impossible to figure out, but makes him a complete pushover once you know it.\n\nYour weapons mostly just do raw damage, with various elemental effects and resistances, but ultimately they boil down to "click until dead." There is very little tactical variety in the weapons, with the one exception being the fire weapon (you have to run away from the burning ground afterward). There are also poisoned weapons, but they do so little damage that it's hard to say why the effect was included at all. Armor is even simpler -- almost all of them are just some numbers + a resistance type.\n\nWhat use items there are break down into healing items (boring), guns (boring), and potions. Potions randomize, like in Nethack, but there are so few of them and the missions are so short that you are unlikely to find out what they do in time to make good use of them.\n\nThe levels are randomly generated, but identical with the exception of monster distribution and textures. Very samey.\n\nThe toons are the same except appearance and a temporary buff that lasts for the first 200 moves. The Emmisary is the sole exception, in that he has a permanent boost to his stats, and is therefore mathematically better than the rest except in the very early game.\n\nI can see where they were going with this, but there simply isn't enough depth or variety to hold my attention.

These are all logged in a Datalog, which is curated and worked on by a scientist (who is the only other character you get to interact with.) The premise of the game places you on a spacestation/research lab as a disposable clone that can be upgraded with boosts as you play, hopefully increasing your survivability. Your goal is to get as far as you can, and collect/experience as much as you can. The standard mode has endless replayability, but it may seem to get repetitive if you're new to the genre. However, as long as character progression continues, you will oftentimes break farther and farther into the shattered planets, and hopefully uncover new things!\n\nThere are alternative game and challenge modes, and endless litte things to discover. The game has an enjoyable art style, with a laid-back and humorous attitude. The music goes mostly unnoticed to me, and I find this a relaxing sort of experience to play! It may not stand up to hardcore/serious roguelikes, but its an enjoyable way to pass some time!","July 29, 2015","true","10.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Honestly, this is the first modern game I've played that I would even BEGIN to compare to Rogue. If you haven't played Rogue, stop reading because the rest of this review won't mean anything to you.\n\nStart with Rogue. Between games, add a sort of home base where you respawn after every death and buy equimpent for your next run. Here you have a storage locker to keep things you buy at the store (you can't keep things you find during a game, except for money and money (there are two kinds of money)), a place to cohose your class and pet for the next game and a place to buy permanent stat upgrades for your current class.\n\nNow put in a few different quests. Of course there's the main "quest:" run until you die. There are also a few other game modes that I haven't really gotten into yet because the novelty hasn't worn off the basic game yet. In addition, there's a daily quest that you can only run once that picks your starting equipment for you and challenges you to make it through ten levels before dying for a nice reward.\n\nAdd some fun graphics and average sound effects and you've basically got Shattered Planet.\n\nSeriously. If you ever loved Rogue, you NEED Shattered Planet. And there's a mobile app as well. It's free, but significantly watered-down.\n\nShattered Planet gets an A+ from me. If for no other reason than the simple fact that someone has FINALLY made a modern "roguelike" that actually feels LIKE ROGUE.","April 25, 2015","true","12.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It's basically impossible to get through a run in this game with the starting equipment, he had to collect some, die, and upgrade based on what you picked up on the end of that run. And you have to do this quite a few times, before you start to see any "new" content.\n\nI'm not a fan of grinding games. I picked up rogue Legacy on a whim, liking the sound of the idea of it, but ultimately I didn't enjoy it.

And definitely one of the most enjoyable.\n\nSo, you have 5 classes to choose from (2 are available from the start, 3 are unlockable), three stats to raise (strength, hitpoints, evasion), and two slots (headgear and weapon). Now, it certainly does not look like a lot to play with, but trust me on this -- it quite is.\n\nI don't know if there is a certain goal to the game -- I didn't get that far, to be honest. Your main gameplay is exploring some planet, moving from square to square, and jumping from region to region (closest thing to floors in any given rogue-like here).\n\nLevels are generated procedurally, of course (this means you get to play a randomly created level each time you start over). There are also random events, like encountering some crab's nest, or finding some stash, etc. There's even something like a roll, when it happens -- if you fail to roll a certain number, you'll fail the encounter, and some negative thing would happen (like, instead of coming with you, crab will attack you) -- just like in some tabletop RPGs.\n\nCharacter customization seems a bit weak at first -- I mean, what the hell, why only two slots?! I want boots, gauntlets, a necklace, and a pantyhose or something! Or greaves. Yes, greaves. Of course, I meant greaves... But after some time playing, you'll notice that these two slots is basically all you'll ever need -- items are dropping a-plenty, plus you can forge a random item at base, choosing from 3 qualities (low-tier, mid-tier, or hi-tier) with prices varying as well.\n\nAnother significant part of the gameplay is unlocking new content for your journal. Every item, every location, every encounter and every defeated enemy give you a new entry in your journal on your first encounter, and you get addicted to unlocking new entries quite fast (especially if you have OCD, like myself). Also, you raise a special metric by unlocking a certain number of entries -- consider it your explorer's level, with each new level unlocking something new.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nDo I need to buy this game?\nIf you're a fan of rogue-likes, don't hesitate to buy it for full price. If you're not, wait for a sale and buy it with a discount.","April 20","true","2.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JATDragon/recommended/305640/","JATDragon","JATDragon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JATDragon/","224 products in account","Original post here [jatdragon.blogspot.com]\nI obtained Shattered Planet through a free game giveaway, and those types of games - as we all know - are usually just plain BAD. However, I like to give every game I own a try, so I went ahead and installed it. I must admit, I had no idea what this rogue-like turn-based RPG game was, so I was quite surprised with the graphics and music quality right away. Once I started, I discovered that the game had a lot of dynamic gameplay (due to the variety of enemies/items/weapons/etc.) with loads of replay ability. In conclusion, I think this would be a great game for lovers of dungeon exploring games and rogue-like games, and a definite steal if found on a sale.\n\nOverall Rating	7.5	Graphics	8	Sound	6.5	Story	6	Gameplay	8	UI / Controls	9\nThe graphics of the game are quite nice. It is a 2D game, and the art-style seems hand drawn and creates a very warm atmosphere. I have read that some users complain about "clunky animation", however I didn't notice any such problems, since the game is indeed a turn-based RPG.\n\nThe music is obviously well-made, you can tell right away. The sound effects are also appropriate and high-quality. However it seems like the soundtrack you hear while exploring (most of the gameplay) is quite repetitive. The same song gets played in every biome and intensifies when in combat. Also, all melee weapons make the same sound (regardless of the enemy too), making listening to the game quite tiresome.\n\nInitially, you have no idea how the game works. The helper/scientist hints that you are definitely going to die, which to me sounded like intimidation tactics to make you play more cautiously. You later learn that you are simply a clone and will keep re-spawning, losing only the items you had equipped. The objective is obviously to explore, since it is heavily encouraged to experiment more, but not much background is given. The dialogue with the scientist doesn't reveal much about why you are doing this, what your goal is, or what sent you on your mission. However, even though the story is weak, I don't think it is important to this type of game anyway.\n\nThe gameplay of this game is definitely its main advantage. Personally, I love game that involve randomization of game aspects (which results in more unique, less scripted experiences), so I found this game very enjoyable. There are many types of enemies, items, gun, armor, and biomes, which are all logged as unique entries in your discovery catalogue. You even get to encounter unknown substances that have unexpected results and you can chose to use on yourself or throw it (cross your fingers so that you don't poison yourself, heal your enemies, or corrupt important tiles). After death, you get to explore again and replay in a random new world with new mysteries (and even get special levels and daily challenges).\n\nThe UI is quite well-designed and simple, with a reasonable amount of options. The controls are quite basic and easy to learn. Not really anything revolutionary, but it is important to make sure that users don't get frustrated by a good game with bad controls.\n\nPros:\n+Nice graphics, soft and aesthetic\n+Very enjoyable to play and  immense replay potential\n+Can change play styles with different characters, weapons, upgrades, pets, etc.\n+Daily challenges allowing for more higher level runs\n+Big variety of weapons, armor, enemies, biomes, etc.\n+Cheap (listed for $15 on Steam, but found for about $1 on markets due to the giveaway)\n\nCons:\n-Repetitive clicking to attack enemy. Boring combat, even though there is elemental damage, tactics are usually not important early on.\n-Enemies tend to repeat in the first stages of any game.\n\nNotes: It would be interesting to have some story elements being discovered with every exploration to slowly reveal a grand narrative. Also a BIG improvement would be Steam Workshop integration, allowing for variety and arsenals to increase massively.","April 7","true","1.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Hear me out cause its tough as ♥♥♥♥ to describe.\n\nYou start. Gear up and move in a tactical point and click way. So the map is square divided, like xcom, fireemblem etc right? but.. its not turn based, so basicly its real time point and click with the fluidity of a tactical/board type of game lol.\nConfusing? well, to make things worst, when an enemy spots you, he moves square by square as if in a strategy game lol, but to attack him you have to spam the mouse, because the more you click the faster you atk?!? Plus the tile real time point and click movement, is frustrating as times, since you end up walking around what you want to interact...\n\na confusion of genres that makes no sense...\n\nNot only that, but the art is just perfect for an rpg, a tactical rpg, which in a way i was led to believe. But no, this game can be described as half strategy, half rpg, half roguelike and bigger half confusion and lack of direction....\n\nas a "upgrade on death" type of game, this game fails for me. Because simply put, you gear up for a playthrough but when you die, you lose your gear. Ok. But you playthrough to make new gear... Wut? where is the upgrade? i see 1 cycle of never ending difficulty, confusion and ♥♥♥♥. There is a stat upgrader, which just adds to the mess and pile of "dont understand doesnt feel right"...\n\nSry but it feels that they were heading at a great classical rpg/strat game (fireemblem style) with modern art touch and made a turn into action "bastion" style game.... The product is a waste with great graphics.","April 29, 2015","false","0.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

I'm a Let's Player who was given the game for promotional reasons and as a result my sense of value may be skewed.\n\nThat being said, I think that Shattered Planet is an attractive Rogue-lite that does a lot of things well. It doesn't break the mould as far as I am aware and it seems to require an awful lot of grinding to achieve anything, a possible holdover from the fact that it was once an iOS title that has been ported. There is not any depth to the story, but the writing is consistently amusing and some of the random events are absolutely great. I would love to have seen more of that, so take note Kitfox.\n\nThe game presents its challenges interestingly and if you're a fan of the genre I think you'll get something out of it. Anyone else might want to consider their options carefully.\n\nIf you want to see the game in action, you could always check out my series on it *nudge* at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imm7cT1N3sY&list=PL_gUQhEY-R2BOudJCk0_-rKO0xuuDMyDQ&index=2","July 4, 2014","true","2.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Every once in a while you come across an object that gives you a little event, but overall it's pretty basic.\n-Customization: Each character has five different heads to choose from.\n-Dialogue/Well Written: Not a lot of dialogue. Mostly just the alien making little quips or giving you tips on the ship.\n-Tutorial: Not much of a tutorial, but the game is also not very complex.\n-Other: It would be nice if you could command your pet to attack an enemy instead of moving around in the hopes that it will get the message and fight for you.\n-Worth the price tag: I waited until it went on sale before I got it and I recommend you do too.\n\nHave Fun Gamers!","April 20","true","2.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I know that many Roguelikes have similar systems to ensure the player doesn't waste too much time exploring, but the Blight's speed can make it extremely hard to backtrack if you wind up at a dead end well into the zone.\n\n-Crystals become harder and harder to find as you continue to discover new log entries, and since Crystals are your main method of acquiring gear, it can be a hassle.\n\nOveral score: 9/10","August 31, 2014","true","5.8"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Yes the typo was intentional. It's light roguelike, aka roguelite game with some persistent upgrades that you buy in between the missions. Basically you just grind stuff and levels until you can manage worse enemies and there's absolutely no way to finish the game without it. In that sense the game plays out like Rogue Legacy: you grind until you win. Rogue Legacy was funny and more interactive though since in Shattered Planet you just move around, grid based, turn by turn, clicking enemies few times more to kill them, die, upgrade and repeat. It's quite nice game to look at and simple enough to entertain for couple of hours but after that it's pretty useless.","April 20, 2015","false","5.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

This one sucks ♥♥♥ in an almost exclusive way. While the foundation of Rogue-Like games is here, the actual game play is awkward and clumsy. Meaning you cant plan your actual walking route if you need to. If your happy clicking one tile at a time and taking all day in even the earliest levels of this game, so be it, but the game offers nothing spectacular except a serious lack of reward and a tasking, time consuming progress that is all too often wiped away. The worst part being is that you never actually start with a weapon unless you buy one, which is done RANDOMLY. Not only that, but you arent guarenteed to even have a weapon even then. You might have a piece of very useless armor, a hat, or some food. So you suffer through punching everything for the first few maps until you get lucky enough to find some crystals THEN afford a weapon. Which rogue game do you not start with a weapon based on your class? None, thats right. There is a good reason too.\n\nWhile I like this game in concept, again, the execution is terrible. It basically suffers from that "We dont really give you much of a chance to even see the game much less enjoy it" syndrome most bad games have. I didnt have to play long to understand it was far far less about skill and more about gear and stats in this game. Gear that is far far away form being in your hands and all too easily discarded and lost due to this games stat progression.\n\nLet me give you an example: Rogue game Maj'eyal, A similar move to start time type "turn based" game. You get to talor your starting stats, can avoid mobs that are too strong, and have the ability to survive through skill and skills as much as gear. Hell, it even includes a magic wand you can use to teleport out of a dungeon if you run into trouble. You also identify items on pick up (or by hovering over them via mouse pointer)\n\nThis game: Start with random whatever, have no class based skills so if you dont have any gear you basically try to avoid everything just to explore and pick crap up. Stas and putting points into stats only applies LATER in the game, not at the beginning of it. Meaning that if you put stats into your 'clone' they wont actually be usefull until the parts where you pick up armor and defense enough to survive three encounters. Until then you run a lot, hope you find healing ♥♥♥♥, and wish you could identify anything that you had in your inventory.\n\nThey tried to make a rogue-like but ended up just making a hack.","March 6","false","1.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

You get to choose only a weapon and a hat and they are pretty bland across the board. Nothing feels special from item to item.  Attacking is simply left+clicking with no special skills. You might get lucky and get a companion early on but it also falls short of making the game more interesting.  I wasted $14 on this as an impulse buy.  I enjoy rogue-likes very much but this is just bland and not very complex. You will die, a lot.. and its not enjoyable and you start wondering why spend another minute clicking aimlessly.  I feel the art is good except for the sprites. The character/mob sprites feel cheap to me.  Its a shame to see such clashing things across the beautiful looking map/terrain.

During the course of a level you collect resources which are used to increase stats. Increasing stats have minimal effect on your character and gathering enough resources for the next stat upgrade becomes increasingly time consuming.\n\nWith well-made roguelikes you can say to yourself, "I learned a lot from that run, I'll do better next time.". Or maybe, "The RNG gods were against me that time". Not so with Shattered Planet. Shattered Planet forces you into the grind by always throwing impossible odds at you, requiring you to die, and requiring better stats/equipment to advance.\n\n","November 27, 2014","false","1.0"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

The interface is simple. Could easily have been ported to a touch screen version. Good selection of items, and the stats are not very complex.\n\nThe goal to collect data about the planet and species adds to the "got to collect them all" urge. That is maybe a way of keeping us interested, as you lose your gear at death. And you die all the time, so you don't get as focused on the spesific gear as in other dungeon crawlers.","January 2, 2015","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a simple rougelike with an interesting theme, but sadly there's no substance to it or any meaningful gameplay choices. Mechanics are about as complex as "let the enemy move to you and therefore waste their turn", beyond that it's just a drawn-out game of numbers as you try to sustain through endless levels that don't really get any harder.\n\nProblems:\n-The pet AI is horrible and doesn't even seem inconsistent. I've died several times because my pet baited me to death, until I learned to just carry around 5 of them so I could let them occasionally die of their stupidity without also losing because of it. The pets will aggro and suicide on enemies you wanted to just walk past, or sit around doing nothing in the middle of a fight. The option to give them directions would cure half the frustrations of this game.\n-There is basically no item progression. You'll go into your run with top tier equippment every time after the first couple runs, and then when you get to a certain area you'll pick up some slightly better equippment that always spawns on the ground in plain sight, every single run. I didn't even bother checking the shops because of how absurdely unlikely it is to find anything better than what you started the run with. Therefore when an enemy drops an equip item, you're pretty much always just going to toss it.\n-The secondary items are hilariously unbalanced. There's a whole character built around using guns, but the only useful one is the teleport gun (which is an instant kill because of how easy it is to teleport things off the paths, has the lowest cooldown of guns, and I find it most every run). That's fun for a while, but gets dull once you have two of them and never actually have to fight anything again. The Shovel, the most basic item, seems completely useless until you realize that you can use it to quarantine the spreading time constraint mechanic on every single level. So we have those two, and everything else seems more or less pointless.\n-Eventually the levelling system just stops being rewarding. Once you've unlocked the characters, it just gives you pieces of gear that you'e already seen and might even have handy, and which you can only use once.\n-No endgame. Once you've pulled off 3 or 4 solid runs you can level up your character and just rampage through everything. The main game mode is endless, but it's more a challenge of attrition and there aren't any ultimate legendary mythril items to keep it fresh.\n\nThe good:\n-The flavor text is hilarious.\n-The turn-based format is the best-executed I've ever seen.\n-The atmosphere is well done\n\nReally, this game could have been amazing, it just needed to be balanced better and have more sustanence.\n","March 6, 2015","true","9.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game itself is a turn based, map exploration game with an RPG level system, but the main point which will draw your time and interest is the number of captivating item names, descriptions and art. This game isn't afraid to run headlong into satire, making use of pop culture such as Friday the 13th, Star Wars, Valentine's Day/Cupid, among other points.\n\nOne point of note, is that the developers are still willing to make changes to the game and fix bugs as they appear, even years after the game is released. Most notably, an achievement that was unobtainable was fixed; most triple A titles wont give that kind of support this long into a game's release, and yet, this company took the time to do so.\n\nGood game if your into rogue-likes/rogue-lites, of if you simply wish to support a small development team which seems to be doing what it can to resolve the stigma of bad support, bugs and DLC that other, bigger companies have created in gaming.","February 24","true","29.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I normally don't care much for rogue-like games, but this one was always a lot of fun. I played this game for a while on mobile, so when I saw it on sale for less than $3 on Steam, I had to grab it. I must say that it seems a good bit more difficult on the Steam version, but I enjoy the greater challenge. I love the variety of items, of creatures, the clone system; there are a number of things that are great about this game. Now there are some areas where I do feel the game could be improved, but some of the complaints I see (the combat system, ect.) shouldn't really be complaints because they are what makes the game unique. Now I do think, however, that the game lacks a driving plot that gives the player the initiative to move forward. Discovering new loot and enemies can only go so far, so if there was a series of levels that had you saving the Gekkians or covered some other tangent where "You," "Clone ..." was the only hope for some linear, purposeful objective, it would improve the game.\n\nNow the fact that the objective of the game is open-ended, and the only goals are exploration and discovery, is not necessarily a bad thing. The only thing is that when I play, it feels like something is missing. The concept and gameplay are things that I love, but it feels like there is something central that was left out of the game. Nevertheless, I love the game, and I'm very happy that it's on Steam. I am indeed a satisfied customer, and I very much support Kitfox games along with their ability to make unique, interesting games.","May 30","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
