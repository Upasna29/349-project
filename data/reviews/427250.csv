I love the art for this. Everything looks very stylized and moves so smoothly\nUnit and structure placement is important -- Terrain matters!\nEasy to command and order units around.\nCo-op campaign. Yes. Co-op campaign.\nCons:  Didn't realize this, but it's still in Early Access. Even if Steam says it's not (I honestly don't know/don't remember), it really is.\nOnly one faction right now -- however, there's a preview image of a medieval looking faction with mages and skeletons...so who knows what they've got planned.\nNot a whole lot of unit variety, makes it feel very "Rock, Paper, Scissory"\nCannot garrison buildings. :-(\nInterface missing some features (like range checking).\nImportant note: If you don't like old-school C&C, you're not going to like this. It's seriously like a modernized version of the original C&C, right down to the sidebar and EVA-like "assistant" telling you your base is under attack.\n\nIf you do like the original C&C, then this game is perfect for you.\n\nOverall, considering it's still in development, I'd give the current build a solid 7.5/10.\nOnce they get more units and at least another faction in there, this could be an easy 9/10 for me.\n\nAs a LAN game, it's perfect. If you've got a good group of friends looking for a classic RTS game, it's worth a buy for that reason alone.","April 28","true","1.0"," 43 of 48 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","43","48","2","3"

It's small, short, sweet, and fun to play.\nAs an RTS-Lover, this has to be one of the best new RTSs I've played recently.\nHere's the rundown:\nPROS:\n- Fast paced action. Build and attack, nothing more. Micromanagement is for boring people.\n- No multiple build queues. Wanna build faster? Get 10 barracks.\n- 25 Mission Campaign + 10 Mission Co-Op campaign. Each mission has one main objective, and two secondaries. Completing the primary unlocks units. Completing the secondaries allows you to start the missions with extra units/buildings already built.\n- Soft Counters, just like in the old C&C's. Sure, a Rocket Soldier is good against a tank, but its probably gonna die unless it has quite a few friends to back it up.\n- No population cap. How I've missed this in a RTS game. Just being able to build your army with only the map size to limit your dream.\nHALFWAY:\n- 1 Faction, 12 Units, 2 Turrets. 3 Infantry (2 Offensive, 1 Support), 4 Vehicles (3 Offense, 1 Harvester), 3 Aircraft (2 Offense, 1 Transport). It's not much, but its pretty balanced.\nCONS:\n- The game art depicts a Sniper unit (even the menu art) that does not appear in game. WHY?! UPDATE: Apparently the Sniper unit does appear, it's the Commando, armed with a Sniper Rifle and C4, and is only obtainable through drop crates. Not a con anymore.\n- It lacks the variety and flavor seen in older games (like C&C) or even newer games (like Grey Goo).\n- Tanks can bring down massive buildings by just touching them, which just causes the buildings to explode. (Wait, why is this a Con? THIS IS ♥♥♥♥ING BRUTAL!)\n- No Garrison. With so many buildings in the city maps, you would expect garrison to be available.\n\nAll in all, I truly recomend this game for eveyone who enjoyed the old C&Cs and Dunes, or anyone who has never played a RTS before, but wants to get in on this genre that is surely not dead, as Petroglyph has shown us.\nOne last thing. Petroglyph's 8-Bit team, you guys are the absolute best! Keep up the good work.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ashelia/recommended/427250/","ashelia","Ashelia","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ashelia/","253 products in account","This game is going to scratch one hell of an itch of you're into strategy games. While currently light on content, it has a great multiplayer scene brewing as well as singleplayer and  co-op missions that are a huge challenge. Better yet, the developers seem devoted to a quick turnaround on their timeline full of updates. In fact, since I got it, they've already patched several times for balance updates (including a bug I had with co-op missions), and June promises a lot of new content coming our way including a new faction.\n\nOf course, it has some issues (slight input lag for certain micro hotkeys, only one faction, a lack of solid multiplayer matchmaking) but it has a huge heart and a decent skill curve. Additionally, the voxel art style works perfectly against all odds to make this visually superior RTS with a lot of clarity. Sometimes smaller RTS games can be obtuse or deceiving, but not 8-Bit. It rewards players for learning build orders and improving their micro.\n\nKeep in mind that it's very much a spiritual successor to CnC. That said, I feel like it does enough on its own to stand out as more than that and make a name for itself on its on two feet.\n\nAgain, if you like strategy games or enjoy doing co-op missions, it's one of the best titles on Steam for you at the moment.","May 6","true","33.2"," 27 of 30 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","27","30","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeeJaxOff/recommended/427250/","TeeJaxOff","TeeJax <3","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeeJaxOff/","3933 products in account","8-Bit Armies is a great little pixel based RTS with simple yet engaging gameplay and hours of content in both single and multi-player.\n\nI’ll start by saying 8-Bit Armies is a simple RTS compared to most out there but I feel this is deliberate. If you’re not a seasoned RTS player and have never played anything like this before then it will be a great introduction to the genre, and for those who are already comfortable there’s still plenty of fun to be had. 8-Bit Armes stays true to the traditional C&C type RTS games; build a base, gather resources, train up units and CRUSH THE ENEMY.\n\nThere are multiple modes to choose from including a campaign, a co-op campaign, skirmishes against the AI and multiplayer. The campaign mode is the main mode where you’ll be faced with 25 missions that you must complete and this is the mode i’ve spent most time on. Each mission has an objective that must be completed and these vary from destroying two enemy HQ’s to taking out a certain number or type of enemy building to surviving a set time limit. Each mission can be played on any of the three available difficulties so you have the option to take things easy or give yourself a challenge, but fear not, there is incentive to play the levels on a harder setting. Each mission grants you stars after completing and the amount of stars you get depends on the amount of objectives you successfully complete. Each mission will have it’s main objective but if you play the mission on normal or higher you can unlock two secondary objectives to complete. Completing one or both of the second objectives will award you with the corresponding stars but this isn’t just for bragging rights, each objective completed on a mission will unlock new starting units for use in all future missions.  When you start a mission you’ll have whatever units and buildings you’ve unlocked previously allowing you to complete easier missions for higher stars and extra starting missions making the harder levels a little easier.\n8-Bit Armies is nicely challenging yet never feels impossible and having multiple modes with multiple difficulties add with the huge replayability (not that it needs it, i’m around five hours in and haven’t completed the campaign yet!).\n\nThe other modes include the co-op campaign which is the same as above yet you play along-side another person online which is a great feature as few good RTS games have this. You can also skirmish against the AI on any of the available maps against 4 difficulties, or battle against others in online multiplayer. I will mention though that right now it seems to be pretty hard to find a co-op or multiplayer game. There just doesn’t seem to be that many people playing at any one time which is a shame and it’d be great the see a few more people in the lobbies. That being said if you have a friend with the game you’ll be able to play with them easily online.\n\nThe graphics of the game are really nice, cute without being childish and the soundtrack is pretty great.\nAnother cool feature is things that seem like they are just your surroundings can be destroyed so if you’re like me you’ll probably spend a little bit of time just flattening towns for fun. It also means you can destroy any of the scenery in your base to give yourself a little more room if you end up needing it.\n\nThough I love 8-Bit Armies there are a few things I would change. There is no option at all to rotate your buildings so they will always be put down at the same angle. The developers have said that they’ve done this on purpose because they wanted the game to be simple but I can’t help but feeling it was really just a case of laziness. Secondly the enemy nukes can be a pain in the ♥♥♥ on the larger maps. When i’m defending three spots and an enemy nukes me I have around three seconds to move the units out of the way but this is nowhere near enough time to find where the nuke is aimed AND move my units. On the missions where I can’t lose any structures this makes things unenjoyabley difficult and is the main reason I usually stop playing for a bit. Even something as simple as a mark on the minimap would help masses. The last issue i’ve mentioned already and it’s the fact that it’s hard to find a multiplayer or co-op game, but honestly it doesn’t bother ME personally as I came for the single-player but if you’re buying it for the sole reason of playing online with people not on your friends list then you’d probably be pretty annoyed.\n\nOverall 8-Bit Armies is fantastic. The gameplay is simple but really enjoyable and there is a great amount of content and replayability. Anyone who has wanted to try the genre but not known where to start should try this one as the gameplay is easy to pick up and it’s just great example of a brilliant RTS.","May 18","true","7.1"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","21","22","0","1"

I still recommend it but theres a few issues. 1 Multiplayer menu is very laggy and takes a while ( upto 5-10 minutes ) to get a game going online and this brings the game down slightly.\n\nI feel that the game is very tank rushy, so far every game ive played has basically been, who can spam the tanks fastest wins and for me that really kills it as I want to try and develop a play style of my own instead of just joining the rest of the crowd and tank rushing.That is a real shame I think it brings the game down slightly.\n\nAlso really not a fan of the resources running out and the game just stagnates completely with no way to change your fate once resources are gone. So basically no "comeback is real" opportunities which kept the late game very interesting in C&C.\n\nI love the fact the game is simple however, its almost too simple. I completely understand its supposed to be clean etc but, would be nice to have a few more units with some abilities. Not over the top but just a few.\n\nSurprisingly the Nukes are not a game finisher which is good as people in old RTS's used to just avoid super weapons because they would just reck any player and would be a bit lame. So thats well done.\n\nImo this game has great potential, polish up the multiplayer menu responsiveness and match making, add some more units and try and get away from the rapid tank spam as usual and I think this would be a GREAT quick and easy RTS.\n\nRIch","April 25","true","8.1"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","19","23","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Psygineer/recommended/427250/","Psygineer","Psygineer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Psygineer/","1505 products in account","Introduction\n8-Bit Armies is a classically styled Real Time Strategy game that harkens back to the days of Dune 2 and Command and Conquer. 8-Bit Armies feels like someone grabbed the RTS history book and flipped it back to the beginning rather than writing a new page into the book. There really is nothing new here. That is exactly what makes 8-Bit Armies a must have for fans of the old school Command and Conquer series from the time before it switched gears and unsuccessfully became a modern RTS which died soon after.\n\nGameplay Impression\nThe best thing to do is reiterate that this is not a modern style Real Time Strategy game. You have to mine the resources to build your own base and train your own troops. Oh how I miss those features in RTS games! Carefully planning and constructing your base and then defending it against the enemies who intend on turning your hard work to rubble. Bliss! Sadly, I must be a relic of the past myself because I have been finding it increasingly difficult to find new releases of this type of game.  Luckily, 8-Bit Armies is true to form, and other than a few nitpicky issues, is quite enjoyable.\n\nAs with most Classical Real Time Strategy games, you start out with only a handful of buildings and units.  Usually you unlock new ones each mission until you are able to build everything you want or need. It’s a similar system in 8-Bit Armies. What makes 8-Bit Armies a bit different is that not only do you unlock new tech each mission, you can also unlock additional starting resources dependent on what objectives you completed up to that point. If you just want to unlock all the buildings, play through the 25 missions at your pace and do whatever you feel like to complete the main objective. If you want to unlock additional perks to help you get started next time you play and to make the game even more interesting, there are two additional optional objectives available. One of the objectives appears to always be to beat the level in 10 minutes or less. That is a lot of fun and typically the most challenging of the objectives. The other is more random. On one mission it might be to not sell or lose any buildings. On another, it might be not to build a certain unit or building. This makes for an enjoyable extra challenge as you progress through the game. This game can become quite challenging in the later missions, especially trying to beat the level quickly enough to earn the third objective’s rewards. Thanks to that third objective, I no longer fall into the classic traps I set for myself in the other RTS games. You can’t be both quick and a tortoise outside of fairy tales. If you do want to be a turtle though, there is no unit cap, meaning you can build as many units as you want and just send a wave of units to crash across the enemy base. I did that and it was particularly amusing!\n\nThe gameplay is simple enough for anyone to be able to play. From veteran Classic Real Time Strategy fans to people just discovering what this wonderful genre is all about. There are no secondary abilities to worry about manually toggling which is great. That is because in games like StarCraft I often find myself forgetting to use them but, you can rest assured, the AI never forgets to use them against me! One thing though that I dislike about how simplistic the game is, is something that might sound rather trivial. You can’t rotate the buildings. That is to say, if you choose to build a certain building, it will always be facing the exact same way as any other copies of that building. In other RTS games, the ability to rotate a building usually meant you could squeeze a building into a spot it couldn’t otherwise have fit, simply because its footprint is now facing a different direction. Other than that, I have no real complaints about the design simplicity of the game. You might be wondering why you would need more than one of a building. Well in most RTS games, the extra building can produce additional units. In 8-Bit Armies, it speeds up the construction of the units at your primary construction site. This means the more barracks you have, the faster you can train your troops until you practically have an unending stream of units coming out of your base.\n\nGraphically the game looks simple and blocky. The units are blocky, the buildings are blocky, the bullets are blocky, the environment is blocky… everything is blocky! I like this design choice. It kind of feels like it is paying homage to the days where everything was pixelly looking. Back then you thought it looked so real and life like and now you question how you could possibly have thought it looked good. Ah nostalgia! The sound effects in the game are also retro sounding. In general, the design choices made work really well.\n\nOverall, 8-Bit Armies is a wonderful tribute to the classical Real Time Strategy genre. If you miss base building or are tired of all the gimmicks in most modern RTS games, then you should definitely give 8-Bit Armies a chance. There is even a demo you can download to give it a try before you buy.\n\nPros: Classic Real Time Strategy Gameplay without all the modern gimmicks muddying the gameplay\nOptional objectives to give each mission extra challenges. The unlocked bonus will apply to all future missions\nCo-op and multiplayer. If you have a friend, it’s fun to play together\nPlenty of missions\nDestructible scenery\n\nCons:\n\nUnable to rotate buildings\n10 minute timer is a little too challenging on some missions\nEnemies sometimes rebuild structures too fast for you to really make headway when attempting a quick victory. This often leaves you having to ignore the rest of the base and just running towards the target buildings","May 20","true","9.7"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","1"

Do you remember classic real-time strategy (RTS) games like Command & Conquer? You know, collecting resources, building a base, amassing a huge army, and then annihilating your opponent(s)? Or perhaps, like me, you’re a bit intimidated by the seemingly complicated mechanics and high skill ceiling of these types of games. Well, in either case, I may just have the game for you: 8-Bit Armies!\n\nThe Breakdown8-Bit Armies is a pretty simple game: collect resources, build a base, create your army, and then attempt to destroy your opponent(s). It’s simple, easy, and fun. Now of course, the game is a bit more complicated than that, but that is essentially what it boils down to.\n\nResources are gathered using “harvesters” that deliver the main resource (oil I think?) to your refineries. That then gives you a steady stream of cash, from which you can use to build a variety of buildings. Among these are the basic machine gun turrets or barracks to train soldiers in, but you could also build more….interesting buildings like a building to allow you to create aircraft in or even a nuclear missile silo. There’s a few others worth mentioning, like a radar building and a tech lab, but beyond that it’s pretty much what you’d expect. There’s 3 buildings to make troops, ground vehicles, and air vehicles in, and then there’s the “extras” - y’know, the ones that are necessary for both defense and the gradual progression from lowly bungalow to mighty base. Oh, but you can’t just rush all the cool buildings, no, you have to not only progress in a natural order (barracks → ground vehicles → tech lab → radar → air vehicles), but you also need to constantly build power stations to keep your base up and running. I found this to be pretty fair and an interesting handicap since it promotes a fast-paced early game playstyle once you know what you’re doing.\n\nThe basic gameplay is split into three main modes: skirmish, multiplayer, and the campaign. Skirmish is basically the “custom” game mode where you can pick a few settings, a map, add some A.I., and try to defeat your opponent(s). It’s fun in short bursts and the A.I. is definitely quite good, especially on Insane difficulty, so if you’re looking for a challenge the game certainly will provide it. Speaking of challenge, there’s also multiplayer! Uh….yeah, it exists! I got completely destroyed on my first match and never touched it again, so that’s about the extent of my experience. I didn’t really notice any lag-related issues, so that’s a nice touch I suppose, though your mileage may vary of course. On top of that, the multiplayer supports up to 8 players and I believe there's even a separate co-op campaign, so in that department the game definitely isn't lacking.\n\nWhat is probably the meat of the game though is the campaign mode, of which there’s actually going to be TWO campaigns (and very well might be by the time you read this review!). Right now, there’s only a 25-level campaign featuring the “Renegades” faction, but there’s another additional campaign featuring the newly-added “Guardians” faction coming quite soon. Oh by the way, did I mention the developers added a whole new faction with brand new units and buildings shortly after release for free? Yeah, that’s a pretty cool gesture on their part, and they’re still adding updates even after that big one. Anyway, the campaign mode is what you’d expect: it has a 3-star system based on completing various optional objectives, which I found to be quite nice. Most of these are slight handicaps you can give yourself or just a goal of “destroy their base”. It’s definitely fun to attempt to get all 3 stars on each level, and one unique thing the game does is that it rewards you in future missions by giving you extra units, buildings, or cash for any extra stars you earn. This personally really surprised me and helped motivate me to try harder, so there’s an incentive to actually attempt the optional stuff here. One last bit that I’d like to add from my time with the campaign mode is that it seems like the difficulty progression is pretty fair from what I played. I’m not sure if the later levels hold up the same, but from what I played I felt like the game nicely challenged me and yet wasn’t simultaneously overwhelmingly hard.\n\nThe graphics of 8-Bit Armies are not quite what the title claims. I mean, yeah, I get it. Making an actual strategy game these days in an 8-bit style would be pretty difficult, so the developers behind this game decided to go with a more voxel-esque look. I’m not sure if they’re actually voxels, so hence why I say “voxel-esque”. Everything looks like it’s made of blocks, or at least everything is both simple and stylish at the same time. The game looks like something that both kids might enjoy and adults might have a lot of fun with, even if the game isn’t quite aimed at kids but more so fans of RTS classics like C&C. It’s definitely an interesting choice of an art style for a game that isn’t really aimed at the demographic of little tykes. I didn’t have any problems with it, though I somewhat wish it looked more polished at times, since everything looks so simple.\n\nSound-wise, this game doesn’t disappoint. The sound effects are entertaining and the soundtrack primarily consists of some rockin’ instrumental tunes. Nothing really stood out to me here, but it was a nice part of the experience for sure.\n\nProsHarkens back to enjoyable fast-paced Command & Conquer RTS gameplay while simultaneously being a blast for newcomers to the genre\n2 campaigns (one singleplayer, one co-op), with a third on the way\nOptional objectives for each campaign mission add both extra challenge and unlockable rewards in the form of extra units or buildings at the start of each level\n2 distinct factions to play as - one of which was just recently added for free!\nSkirmish mode (with 4 A.I. difficulties) and the game's multiplayer are quite fun and entertaining\nThe graphics are simple yet stylistic. Oh, and the environment is partially destructible!\nSteam achievements, trading cards, workshop support for levels, and cloud support for saves are all included\nConsThe graphics could look a bit more polished\nBuildings can't be rotated, which is a bit odd (though considering how fast matches typically are, this isn't that big of a deal)\nThe A.I. loves to constantly rebuild buildings as you destroy their base, so it can take a little unnecessarily long to try and defeat them (again, this is a small nitpick)\nFor fans of real-time strategy classics or even for potentially interested newcomers to the genre, 8-Bit Armies likely has something to offer. Whether it's taking on the fairly challenging A.I. in the robust campaign mode or in a simple skirmish match, you're bound to have a lot of fun. Plus, there's multiplayer and co-op! Sure, there's some small bits that may be a little frustrating, but overall the game is a blast to play and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who thinks it looks interesting, even if you're not a huge RTS fan.\n\nFinal Verdict: 8.5/10","June 3","true","6.4"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ungotter/recommended/427250/","ungotter","SKIN","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ungotter/","275 products in account","Two-Bit RTS\n8-Bit Armies is an RTS seemingly designed to accomodate newcomers to the genre. That's completely fine and a really nice idea, seeing as RTS is an incredibly intimidating genre for some. However, it's far too thin to last long.\n\nThe game has received a lot of hype by the fact it looks nice and that the people who worked on C&C also worked on it. The soundtrack is also incredible, I turned it up as soon as I got into a game. Excellent rock vibe that stays true to the artstyle of the game with the odd chiptune style music. All good.\n\n\nGameplay Overview\nThe game is incredibly lacking. The game consists of you gathering resources which directly convert into $ so that you can buy units or buildings. Every building costs $ and also consumed X amount of power so you must drop a power building every now and again. That is what managing your economy amounts to. As such, managing your economy is next to nothing.\n\nThese are not the correct names, but you can build:\nResource Point\nPower Plant\nBarracks\nMotor Pool\nAirport\nTechnology\nNuke platform\nRadar\nMachine Gun\nRocket Launcher\nHeadquarters - This is pointless, you cannot build another unless yours is destroyed.There is a tech tree to this all which basically means that you need the resource plant to build a barracks, but once you build the 'Tech' building everything else is unlocked. In total you will have access to:\n\nRiflemen\nRocketmen\nEngineers\nHarvester (Resource Trucks)\nArmoured Cars\nTanks\nArtillery\nScout Helicopter\nAttack Helicopter\nTransport HelicopterThe gamemode is simply to blow up your opponent's base and this happens pretty damn quick even in larger games. Games have not gone over 30 minutes. We played 4 or so games in 1 hour if that is any indication how short the games can be.\n\n\nReview\n\nThe game is played PURELY in your base. You cannot build outside of your base, and you will never see the rest of the really nice level deisgn they have done. I noticed, and a friend also commented, that the map layouts were fantastic. Forget it! You're not even going to ♥♥♥♥ing play on them. It's just 'space' between you and the enemy base. The resource points in the centre of the map will rarely, if ever, be touched. When I first played I sent out infantry squads to lock down resource points or harass the enemies only to find that this is impossible because the resource point and harvesters are IN the enemies base. My friend then sent an infantry force (consisting entirely of riflemen, the base infantry unit) to my base which blew it up in a matter of seconds. It's over that fast! Look at the UI in the screenshots and feast your eyes upon the radar map. Do you see how none of the map is discovered and there is purely a single line between the bases? There you have it.\n\nAs such, harassing and mini-engagements are all but dead in this game. Players usually hold all their forces in their base until they are ready to attack because there is no reason to push out of your base as I explained. Therefore, attacking with a minor force would not net you any sort of benefit seeing as it will be destroyed incredibly quickly and all the enemy has to do is put a few engineers on to repair.\n\nStrategy is almost non-existent. The basic idea is simply to build up a bigger army and not get rushed. There is no strategic variance that I can see. Vehicles absolutely dominate over infantry, especially seeing as tanks can instantly squish through infantry. I am not kidding. So many of your infantry taken by surprise could be wiped out in a second if a tank showed up to roll over them. They just cut through them, no pushing or shoving, just squish. So there is no such thing as an infantry heavy build or anything such. You build tanks and helicopters ASAP, infantry is simply there to make sure you don't get rushed in the first minute. Infantry are further made redundant as Transport Helicopters can either load 5 infantry or 5 tanks. Which would you bloody prefer?\n\nYou can only construct one building at a time. So, for example, in the moment you either choose between the machine gun or the barracks. You cannot put down a blueprint or queue the building (as far as I know) and decide which one gets built first, or just so you can tend to other things. You do not need engineers to construct buildings, they just start going up (and really slowly). I tried to use my engineers to boost the construction time but this feature does not seem to exist either.\n\nThe Nuke was an exciting idea but it is basically a ring of death on the battlefield. It takes a few minutes to prepare, you launch it, and any units in the ring are blown up. It does damage to structures, but will not one-hit them. So it is a utility best used on a large group of enemies. However it is very easy to avoid this and move away from it, it is accompanied by a noise, a ring, and a delay on when it lands. This contrasts with other RTS games like Company of Heroes which only gives a small flare on the map, or a ring on the minimap, or even just a sound queue making it a little harder to dodge when engaged. It feels really lackluster and non-special.\n\nBuildings are produced only to unlock the units that coincide with them. You build a barracks to unlock infantry and so on. They do not provide upgrades or any other sort of functionality like other RTS games such as Warcraft would have them do.\n\nThere is a single 'faction' in the game. So no unit differentiation or bonuses. There is a faction coming up which looks like a wizardy-fantasy campaign. Though I have not seen confirmation that these will be free, and I worry that they may end up as DLC you need to pay for.\n\nThey aimed it to be casual, and an introduction to RTS for new players. They succeeded in the former. However, would anyone really desire to play further RTS games after this I wonder? When I was younger the only board games I were exposed to were Chess and Monopoly. If I had never had a flatmate that loved card games and board games I wouldn't have dreamed of picking up a hobby I now really love. So why show newcomers to a genre really basic, boring, mechanics and say "Here's your intro to RTS games!". You don't need to do that, you can have a really deep game that newcomers can have a lot of fun with too so long as you provide the materials to learn. An effective singleplayer campaign, a ranking system, in-game hints, dev tutorials.\n\nDon't bother. If you want an intro to RTS games find something that looks really cool to you and put some time in to learn it. Learning it isn't always fun, neither is getting your ♥♥♥ beat. But it's a competitve game and some people have the jump in time-played. It wouldn't be any different here, and you're barely getting a game!","April 26","false","1.8"," 51 of 86 people (59%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","59","51","86","3","12"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/watts/recommended/427250/","watts","Wattsbo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/watts/","166 products in account","TL;DR - This game is the rebirth of the classic Command & Conquer style RTS, made by the same people at Petroglyph who once operated Westwood Studios (the wonderful folks who created C&C, Red Alert, etc). It's fantastic.\n\nI had my first experience with the RTS genre back in the 90s  when my friend introduced me to Command & Conquer: Red Alert. The game was hard, but fun, accessible, and extremely addictive. I must have spent hundreds of hours between the online, campaign, and skirmish modes. My friends and I played Red Alet/Red Alert 2 for about 10-15 years, until newer versions of Windows/hardware issues caused too many technical problems for us to carry on our weekly tournaments against each other. Nearly 20 years later, I accidentally stumbled across this. This game's existence makes me extremely happy.\n\n8 Bit armies is essentially Command & Conquer: Red Alert/ C&C 95 with modern touches, such as queing up units, auto production, etc. There is currently (as of April 24th) only one faction, however additional factions are promised to be released in the very near future. The game features a preview of upcoming content in the main menu. The game is still in its infancy, but it is VERY promising, and is one of the most enjoyable RTS titles I've had the pleasure of playing in recent memory.\n\nThis game is not as complex as games from the Company of Heroes or Starcraft series (I currently play and love both of those franchises), but instead is a fast paced, frantic RTS with far less emphasis on micro management. It is simple enough to get anyone up and running fairly quickly (my girlfriend is not a gamer, but she was able to pick this game up and play with me within an hour), but complex enough to keep you entertained for quite some time.\n\nThere is not much content at the moment, but more is supposed to arrive in the coming days/weeks, and even if it weren't there is enough here to justify the price point. For 15 bucks, you can't beat this. I'm quite excited about the 5+ factions that are upcoming!\n\nIf you are looking for a relatively simple RTS experience that is fun and will run on just about any hardware, this is it. Even more so if you enjoyed the C&C/Red Alert (or OpenRA) titles. This game is fantastic, and I can't wait for the upcoming factions, maps, campaign levels, and new soundtracks!\n\n10/10, would recommend to anyone.","April 24","true","11.5"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

While the buildings and units are few, when compared to other modern RTS titles, this makes it perfect for any newcomer to the genre, just like C&C did back in the day, it is easy to learn but hard to master.\n\nGameplay Overview:\nGameplay is pretty simple in the sense that you start with your HQ and the first thing you should do is build a refinery to harvest resources, which are located in various nodes scattered throughout the map. You don’t need to order your harvester to harvest resources, it will automatically do it for you. Building is also as simple as it gets, click a building on the menu and choose where you want to place it and that is it. The only thing you need, besides money, to have a building functioning properly is power, which can be obtained by building more power plants.\n\nWhile unit variety is rather small, this makes it easy to know which unit counters which, even if you’re no military expert. Also, due to their simplistic design and stylized blocky visuals it is very easy to distinguish different unit types amidst the chaos of battles. One other thing worth noting is the fact that each type of unit production building (barracks, motor pool and air control) has its own queue but if you want to train units faster you can just build more buildings of that type.\n\nThe game offers a 25 mission campaign as well as a 10 co-op missions. These missions don’t really have that much story to them other than some text on the selection screen but I feel that these missions are supposed to be some sort of tutorial for what is really the true experience, skirmish, for they gradually introduce you to new units and buildings. Missions offer 3 different difficulty settings and you can replay them in order to complete secondary objectives which will unlock new units for you to use and also unlock more starting units.\n\nSkirmish supports up to 8 players on 10 different maps, and if you don’t fancy getting destroyed by veterans on the multiplayer, you can always just play with AI that has various different difficulty settings to choose from.\n\nPros:Fast paced old school RTS action\nEasy to learn, hard to master\nCatchy music\nChallenging AI (in skirmish)\nOnline co-op\nCons:No ability to rotate buildings\nNo ability to garrison infantry troops - maybe because buildings are so easily destroyed?\nOnly one faction at the moment (more are coming), and it lacks character - C&C had GDI and the Nod, while Dune had Ordos, Atreides and Harkonnen\nOverall 8-Bit Armies is a great addition to the RTS genre, it is a reawakening of classic mechanics with a modern presentation. Highly recommended for those who are new to the genre or for those who’re just looking for some nostalgia.\n\nWelcome back Commander.","May 23","true","7.0"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

This is a fun relatively simple RTS that really feels like an old school RTS like Red Alert 2 in remade in a voxel engine - and that is a good thing. Typical to those kind of games there are various building and turrets and a number of different ground an air based units to unlock. What this game may lack in depth is made up for with the great presentation and simple but fun gameplay. I see in the discussion boards that there are plans to add additional units such as naval units and other factions if the game sells well and I hope this is the case. I would even pay for some of this as DLC since I feel I have already got my moneys worth.","April 27","true","16.5"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

It's extremely simple, but that's the joy of it, you don't have to deal with the problem of so many different unit types and their counterpicks. On the other hand however, at the moment, I wish there were more units to choose from, which is sort of contradicting to what I just said. I would love to see some sort of sniper or APC ground transport. I also wish you could have more then one functioning nuke, but it's not a big deal.\n\nPROS:\n-Graphics are cool af.

This game is fun.  I loved old school Command & Conquer, and 8-bit delivers.  The graphics are blocky, and the sounds and action is a bit gamey, but the simplistic strategy that was C&C is there.  The former Westwood staff did a good job on an initial core game.\n\nI am recommending this game in hopes that it is popular enough for further development on the product.  As it stands now, the dev team has every intention of releasing mod tools to allow custom maps and units.  They also want to add Warcraft units, and make a simple arcade version of one of my favorite old games.  8-bit seems like they want to deliver on all fronts when it comes to the old school RTS games.  Don't let this review sway you, however.  Those features may be planned, but they are not yet implemented at the time of this review.\n\nCons: Units drive through buildings, animations are fully finished, and there aren't a lot of units.  There also are not factions yet.  The Devs state they want to add more factions, like a version of NOD or perhaps USSR or Allies (speculation).  Right now there is only a plain Jane version of GDI with nukes instead of ION cannon.  There isn't mod support yet, though it is planned.  If the game doesn't sell, this may be a quick run on the bank resulting in abandonware.\n\nSummary: If you are a true RTS and even C&C fan, do yourself a favor and pick this up.  The more folks that buy it will add funds to the dev's coffers and they will be able to add cooler features like Warcraft, Red Alert, etc.\n\n","May 4","true","7.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

I noticed a scout to the west of my flank; thinking to myself I have a troops stationed there for defense I'll be fine, but was I ever so wrong.\n\nA minute later the three AI's on the map launched two massive tank blitzkriegs on my frontlines on both fronts. Using a mix of rocket infantry and tanks they swarmed my defenses nearly bringing me to my knees.

It is essentially a clone, but with better and way more intuitive GUI and very basic core mechanics. Learning curve is so minimal I believe a child would grasp the game in no time, and control scheme is gorgeous for an RTS.\n\nBuyer beware though, like I said is a minamilst game brought foreward for the modern generation with an 8-Bit theme/tone, it isn't complex nor deep. It does look beautiful and the city scapes & terrain are those of the asthetics of Tiberium Sun mixed with differentiating levels like in Dawn of War to vary your game play & strategy (Elevations is 25% of the tactics of this game, just for an example). But the base building doesn't get very complex, as in there are not a lot of buildings to choose from. You will be building the same buildings repeatidly as it's part of the core mechanics of expansions and quicker unit generation times involved in the game.\n\nI must say, the campaign doesn't quite have the same C&C charm. Perhaps it's lacking the pixilated ultra violence, or maybe I'm just a sucker for those briefings that really set the whole theme and cut scenes that set the tone of the game back in the day.\n\nAgain, if you like fast paced classic RTS's that have all the bullsh!t just ripped right off the top so you just have the core, and more so the raw micro skill assets, then this is that, but seriously don't expect an ounce more.","April 25","true","3.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

For veteran players like myself, having grew up with C&C and Starcraft amongst others, it currently lacks a little depth in variety of units.\n\nGraphically the game has a charming appeal, and the soundtrack and sound design is well done, as you'd expect from Frank Klepacki.\n\nPetroglyph have always been leaders in the RTS realm, and coupled with Grey Goo last year I'm really hoping we see a revival of this sort of game from AAA studios and indie developers alike.

I've been playing Command and Conquer for over two decades.  I've purchased every game in the series multiple times (aside from CnC4, thanks EA for destroying the entire franchise).  I've been dying for a good, solid RTS without a bunch of crap or unnecessary complication thrown in for the sake of making the game "seem different".  This game doesn't need a gimmick like that, it is good in its own right.\n\nFor those of you who don't know, Petroglyph made this game.  They formed Petroglyph after Westwood shut their doors (thanks again EA, seriously) and from what I understand some of the original Westwood team is still under the roof.  And for that reason, I'm thankful.  They've taken the original, successful formula of CnC and turned it into a fantasic game.  If I could hug these guys for helping to keep the RTS scene alive I totally would.\n\nThe game is base building, army forming, and sweet, sweet destruction.  Buildings don't have their own build queue, additional buildings decrases build time.  Multiple nuke silos don't add multiple nukes, they're on a timer...just like old school CnC.  And don't expect much warning before a nuke hits - it's four beeps and BOOM.  There are additions to the original CnC formula - for instance, an engineer heals all unit types near it.  You have two types of helicopters - a light with MGs and a heavy with missiles.  There are two types of defense turrets, which come in very handy as a failsafe around your base.  The tech tree is in full swing, you will have to do some basic learning of the tree to streamline production.  It's exactly what an RTS should be.  Not overly complex.  It has complexity and the deeper elements lay in battle tactics and strategy, but you don't have to worry about managing multiple types of resources.  You can focus your time on battle strategy...which makes the game very fast paced.\n\nI only have ten hours into the game, but I've beaten the campaign and played some co-op campaign.  The campaign is varied and fun, the mission types are mixed up quite a bit to provide variety.  The co-op campaign is a blast if you play with a friend, it's like a skirmish or multiplayer game with a set of objectives.\n\nCampaign difficulty goes up and adds additional objectives to make it more of a struggle.  I enjoyed this as it helps you fine-tune your build/battle strategies.  The campaign is long too - I think it was close to 25 levels.  The art style is great - it's like they put Minecraft into one hand, an RTS landscape in the other, and smashed them together like handfuls of yogurt.  The buildings are destructible, which adds another layer to the gameplay.\n\nTo wrap up, if you love CnC or enjoy RTS games - don't hesitate.  This is a great game, and at $15, it's a steal.  I had a blast running through the solo campaign, plan to complete the co-op campaign with a friend, and see a lot of replayability in terms of skirmish and multiplayer online.  The Petroglyph team also seems to be organizing online free for alls with the devs with awards for winning the match.  Last week it was a $20 Steam gift card (more than the game itself costs).  Again - great RTS.  Please support Petroglyph, they keep it old school.","May 21","true","11.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/eballin/recommended/427250/","eballin","Eballin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/eballin/","23 products in account","An "8 bit" themed C&C style game where the focus is more on your army as a whole, and less on individual units. I've been waiting for an RTS like this for a while. I loathe modern RTS games (beside Grey Goo maybe) so this allowed me to play in a way I haven't been able to since the early Red Alert series.\n\nPros:\n\n- Game focus is on the macro scale of things. (Out-army the other side)\n- Clear view of what's going on.\n- Easy hotkeys to remember.\n- Building one structure at a time allows you a chance to think about your army strategy.\n- Tough AI that seems to be reactive rather than just on a loop.\n- Awesome retro music and clean art style that really captures your senses.\n- Nice blend of old-fashioned and modern RTS resource gathering. Though, I miss my units just sucking up gems and chrono-leaping back to my base.\n- Fast games that don't drag on.\n- Simplified gameplay but a challenge to master.\n- Single-player campaign missions offer up 25 levels and there are 10(or 11?) Co-op missions. The campaign has tons of replayability since it offer's bonus objectives and cross-mission advancement in the form of starting resources. This is only the first faction too! According to the devs, each faction will have their own campaign.\n- I can finally stop playing my crash-inducing RA2 copy.\n- Tons more I can't bother to list. :P\n\nCons:\n- Wish I could garrison buildings.\n\nSide notes:\n- A lot of people say this game lacks all the structures and unit types other C&C games did, but that's intentional to allow for fun streamlined gameplay, yet still capturing the essential unit types. Engineers can heal too so they're more useful than in the Red Alert series.\n- This game stands on its own. It doesn't need to be compared. It delivers solid gameplay and even expands upon the foundation that many other and I find ridiculously fun from RTS of old.\n\nThanks for reading my review! If you enjoyed the original C&C games, and have grown tired of the distracting mechanics that define modern day RTS games, then play 8-bit Armies!","May 8","true","14.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

When I heard "Welcome back, commander" in the main menu, it almost made me shed tears of nostalgic joy.\n\nGraphics:\nThe graphics are simple and beautiful (or beautifully simple?). I also like how much of the environment can be destroyed. Great use of colors, I prefer that rather than a palette of dark and grey colors.\n\nGameplay/units:\nThe units are distinct and not too many and personally suits me well. I've been a big fan of RTS games for a long time but I generally I don't like too much micro-managing of units. The units in this game have their strengths and weaknesses as in most RTS games, but as said in the tutorial - if you're not sure how to manage your army, just build in large numbers - which is a tactic I love in e.g. Supreme Commander. Thus 8-Bit Armies has a (IMO) perfect balance of micro-managing and mass-spawning units, similarly to C&C Generals.\n\nMusic:\nFrank Klepacki, 'nuff said.\n\nPros:\n+ Cheap price\n+ Classic 90's RTS feeling\n+ Simple yet engaging\n+ Fast campaign missions (if you want to)\n\nCons:\n- Only one faction at the time (which honestly doesn't bother me). Also they already have plans to add more factions, so this won't be a problem soon enough\n- I honestly can't think of anything else right now...\n\n\nOverall:\nTo put it simply - this game is like the original Command & Conquer but with modern functionality (skirmish, co-op, etc), great classic graphics and great classic Klepacki music. If you're a fan of classic RTS games, this one is a must buy (especially at this price). If you're a fan of modern RTS games which are neither too deep or focused on heavy micro-managing, this should be a good purchase too. If fancy 3D graphics and micro-managing every single unit is what you want, you may want to think twice before buying this game. But you'd miss out if you'd not!\n\n10/10 Would cry tears of nostalgia every day\n\n\n","April 27","true","10.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

My Only problem with the game was the AI constantly rushing which the devs fixed this recent patch by giving the AI some personalities! Which was kind of awesome!\n\nSome Ideas:\n\n- New Units; Maybe Special units for 'Factions' ? Rocket Heli's Tanks and Armored Cars are the norm to rush. Creating a Front line then back line. Granted Arty can just decimate the grouped units but I think there should be some hard counter unit to the spam.\n\n- Resources. Once you run out.... that's it, you kind of have an awkward stalemate. Or you make the guy waste his army on you then counter attack to win (it's how I've won recent games) C & C Generals had Oil Derricks: Which always generated $200 no matter what. Even if your supply ran out. You of course had your drop zones, hackers, black markets of the respected factions getting income.\n\nSince the Money Cap is much lower, you can spam freely. If it was raised, like the Nuke being 5k as other games, and give some buildings that can generate some funds periodically it can be an even better game!\n\nIt can even be as simple as a fix as just giving the current oil supply a larger supply or longer for it to run out. I understand the game wants to rush action, but sometimes the game can go back and forth creating a longer game to which the game must provide the players with resources to keep it going!\n\nMaybe go back to the supply crates and use oil derricks as the steady income (such as the old Generals and Red Alert days)\n\n\n- Nukes: As stated above 5K seems like a good cap for the super weapon. GRANTED I love how it's set up now to only be used as a harrassing tool or Unit Clearer. It doesn't do insane dmg to buildings (4 needed to destroy HQ) but it decimates units. Since you can build multiple speeding up the time, at 4 you have about a 1 minute cool down. I think the starting timer should be 6 mins. or 5 mins, just to keep it from being too spammy.\n\n- Spam. As mentioned alot this game requires you to SPAM! My original play style was sit back, and turtle. In this game doing that may cause your death. You must be prepared to RUSH, and SPAM! With that said, it's an interesting thing to see a game WANT to make you spam units. It's by now means over powered because a well placed Nuke destroys the spam. But there should be tweaks to it.\n\n- Walls. Westwood..... come on man you know it's true.\n\n- Some form of Formation, as when units clump together since the nature of the game is SPAM, it messes up when you attack. I guess this can also be counted as a counter.\n\n- MAPS! MORE MAPS! The current maps are made excellently with a good sense of strategy needed for each map. I think once the dev's add a bunch more maps, it'll create even more re-play ability.\n\nWith that said... it's an awesome game and it's only getting better. The points i've listed above are really the only main things I have with this game. I think if the dev's can incorporate at least a LITTLE of what i've mentioned this game can TRULY excel even further than it already has.\n\nI stream this game often:  twitch.tv/themelvinman   If you wanna come check it out in action! It's truly a great game to play!","May 4","true","39.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

As 8 Bit Armies has been presented by many as a true CC style game with those classic game mechanics preserved, I was excited to give it a go. A few minutes after the game released on Steam I was already playing it.\nLet me first tell you, it is NOT similar on the level of  CC. It does not even come close to the same depth or polish. If CC is a fine meal in a restaurant with 3 stars in the Michelin guide, this game is a burger with fries in Mc Donalds. It will do in a pinch, but far from the real deal.\n\nOne of the biggest differences is how the game constantly wants everything to happen fast. The developers advertise they want to  make the game easy and accessible, but it gives  too much pressure to finish each level as quickly as possible. You even have a limited amount of resources, if you spend too long, you deplete your resources and have no means of income. So the game you invested an hour in, yeah, that just stops and you have no way to build units and finish the game. All your units will just sit there and look dumb, so will the enemies.\n\nRushing tacticts is the only game style that is rewarded, and to gain a three star ahievement award on each level you have to rush to the finish line within a given time. Also, many things in the game emphasizes quick reaction skills. For example, when you get a warning the enemy has launched a nuke, you only have a couple of seconds to navigate to the target site and brace your units for it. While, the AI naturally have no reaction time and can push its units away from your nuke in a millisecond. Quite annoying.\n\nGenerally, this kind of approach removes much of the strategy element from the game. Forget about strategically blocking  off enemy supplies, cut off their power with a saboteur and carefully build and manage your base. Rush, rush rush to the level goals. And once you achieve it, the screen is just suddenly changed to the win screen. So, winning tactics often involves doing totally stupid suicide attacks that will destroy your own army, and would not have won the war. But because your level goal is achieved and you wont be around to see the final consequences, it does not matter. Often if feels like you are cheating, and it is also unsatisfactory to not be allowed to crush the enemy completely after the goal has been met. Age of Mythology had a great approach here, the opponent would tell you he surrenders and you could decide wether or not you will accept the surrender, then go to the win screen, or finish him off.\n\nAnother thing sadly lacking in the game is any form of research and unity veterancy. The developers claim they want to make the game more accessible, but surely, unity veterancy would not make things harder for the player? I suppose, with the current rush focus, they think units would not stay around for long enugh anyway.\n\nThe graphics style is quite nice, I like it. The sound effects are quite primitive, and does not have individual unity sounds, just some clicks and beeps. There is no real story in the game, except some short text note explaining what is supposedly going on on each level. But all the story mission maps are basically skirmish levels with different goals, like destroy all the Tech Labs or survive for 15 minutes.\n\nAs you win each level, you are awarded some starting supplies that will stick with you for the rest of the game. So, one level might grant you a Motor Pool building permanently to all games you start from then on. As you collect more and more awards, you basically wont have to build any buildings. This supports the rushing style of the game, but personally, I find building the base and strategically maximizing how you spend resources to be a big part of what makes an RTS interesting. After a few levels, you get so many awards, you can basically just select all your freely granted army immediately and rush it into an attack and crush the enemy before the game has even begun. probably great for those with ADHD, but not so much for anyone who enjoys strategy games.\n\nNot really sure if I should give this a thumb up or down. Finally I decided to give it a thumbs up. As long as you know what you are getting into, this is a cheap, quick RTS fix. Although, the strategy element is almost gone at the expense of an arcade style gameplay. If you take it for what it is, it is quite fun at times.\n\nThe game is shallow, dumbed down way more than any true fan of RTS will appreciate, is not a true tribute to the original big RTS games like CC. Much like the gameplay itself, 8 Bit Armies feels somewhat rushed.","April 23","true","18.9"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

It's really easy to play and the gameplay speed is nice.\n\nThe campain consists of a list of levels you can play. Each level is accompied by a little text which tells the "story". You can select the difficulty of each leven in the level selection screen (Easy, Normal, Hard). If you play Normal or Hard there are 2 additional objectives you can achieve (not necessary for winning the level) e.g. 'destroy HQ in under 10 minutes'. By completing you these extra achievements you may get a bonus in the next level e.g. starting with 5 minigunners or starting with 500 additional cash.\n\nOn the website you can see a techtree of all units and buildings.\n\nBesides the normal campaign there is a coop campaign. Multiplayer is also supported. And of course Skirmish against AI.\n\nCurrently the game is very basic, but the developers are always very supportive on their games and there is already a  "coming soon" picture that you can find via the main menu that shows what looks like a second faction.\n\nThe game hasn't got much depth (yet?), but the graphics are nicely done, the music is not bad and it's simple to play. If you like RTS games and don't necessarily need a lot of depth or  complicated stuff then this is a quite easy "Recommended" for just 15 dollars.

Which makes it very hard and very unfair towards the player. Me and a friend did co op and within 2 minutes i got nuked and had all the teams hit me. The balancing for AI (keep in mind i tried it on the easiest and still got my ♥♥♥ handed to me) needs a major overhaul\nThe balance in terms of troops is insane\nA tank ONE TANK can run over an entire army of troops. and helicopters are op as all hell\nAlso when they start with multiple tanks and i start with little to nothing (and on some maps you dont even GET tanks) the AI is stacked against you hard\nExplosives only damage structures really, bullets only damage troops. I mean they do damage others but they are mainly made for that, which further adds to the frustration. If a soldier with a rocket launcher cant kill a gunman that makes no sense but whatever\n\nOverall the AI and balance is trash and i advise you do not get this\n\nAlso check my screenshots and see how many troops the AI gets compared to us, keep in mind the game lasted like under 5 minutes. The AI basically started with 100 troops. I started with like 10 maybe. When 100 troops per AI, and all 6 or so AI attack you at once, you dont stand a damn chance","May 1","false","7.2"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

The fact that the game uses a similar formula than the classic command & conquer RTS games, which I, being a dinosaur, am a huge fan of.\n2. The fact that the devs claim that they are not finished with the game and will update and add new features especially if the game is succesfull.\n\nNow that you already have my conclusion It`s time to reveal what my specific thoughts on the game are:\n\nLet`s start with the pro`s:\n\n1. Easy to learn and get into\n2. Almost the same User Interface as in RA2 with the table to order units and buildings on the right as well as the amount of resources shown on the top right.\n3. Very polished game, personally i have not encountered any bugs, crashes or lag. The units respond immediately to commands.\n4. Destructible environments such as trees, houses etc.\n5. Faster unit production if one has more than one of the same buildings (e.g. 2x barracks=faster production)\n6. campaign containing 25 missions.\n7. Multiplayer as well as a coop campaign.\n8. one type of resource (oil).\n9. Reward system in the campaign. Every mission contains three objectives, which offer rewards that the player can use the next time he plays a campaign mission. These are rewards like extra tanks at the start of a mission, extra cash or buildings etc. These bonusses are used even if one replays a former mission. This gives the replayability a huge boost in my opinion.\n10. I do like the art style.\n11. Superweapons exist, but they are a lot less powerful.\n12. There is no limit in ordering units (at least i haven`t found one). Previous classic RTS had building queue limits such as 1, 30 or 9.\n13. The random boxes make a return, though this time they only contain standard units.\n\nSo Now the Con`s:\n\n1. As of the time I posted this review there is only 1 playable faction and the campaign enemy is the same faction. To my understanding the devs are already working on more factions but I think it is necessary that potential buyers now this. Hopefully those new factions aren`t simply a reskin but add some variety as well as intuitive gameplay.\n2. The resource gatherers/harvesters AI behaves very stupidly. Mostly they want to unload their cargo at one refinery although i have another right next to it. This means that i get money less quickly than i could. And/Or they all move to the same oild deposit on the map which creates a waiting line instead of dividing themselves up. You can give them orders to change their behaviour but it is still annoying to me. Furthermore if you assign them to a specific refinery they will still go to the deposit they were initially going to, which sometimes creates a much longer path than is necessary.\n3. The distinction between the line of sight and fog of war is too vague. Sometimes I am not sure if there are no enemies in that area or if i actually need to move my units closer.\n4. The radar circle, revealing enemies is always centered around the HQ and not the radar building. If it were centered on the latter the circle could be placed in more advantageous positions.\n5. There is only a limited number of different units and buildings. There are three types of infantry, three of vehicles and three types of chopper.\n6. There are no stealth units.\n7. There is only a limited amount of maps (only 2 1v1 maps for example) and some of them are re-used during the campaign. A level/map editor would go a long way in  adding lifetime and fun to the game.\n8.The maps themselves are quite small. Though it does add to the speed of the matches I would like some longer maps with the possibility to have/build secondary bases.\n9. The Hq itself is immobile, almost all buildings are build at the main base.\n10. There are no naval units. Though this is not necessarily a must, it would be cool to have some longer maps with a significant amount of water.\n11. The only way to get cash are the oil deposits. Other classic RTS offer the possibility to capture buildings such as banks, or build moneyproducing buildings or units in the base.\n12. One is only allowed to build one building or defensive turret at a time. It would be nice if the normal buidings and defensive structures have a seperate building queue.\n13. More defensive structures such as walls and mines could be added.\n14. There is no progression during multiplayer (such as earning points to call in airstrikes and the like).\n15. Normal buildings are destructable but it is not possible to use them as cover for infantry. Unlike in classic RTS infantry cannot enter buildings.\n16. It is not possible to steal buildings (though I am not a 100% sure about that)\n\nAgain overall the game is polished and looks very promising. New features and factions will be added so this is really only a first impressions review. I hope that the devs not only match the classic RTS games but will also surpass them with this game by using some new and intuitive features and gameplay elements.","April 27","true","10.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The game plays mostly (if not also only) with the mouse next to some special "orders" for the units like guard, patrol and co. The Voxel grafic fits anyhow perfectly to the gameplay and it actually makes some kind of fun coz of that.\n\nIf this will not help, make a mass-attack!\nSo far 8-Bit Armies misses a bit of content like special units or other factions (as i wrote the review, only one faction). The units are, so far, nothing special and it gives only 2 kinds of them: Rockets or MG. The only specials are the tank and artillery which are somewhere between.\n\nThe lack of contentThe campaign has 25 missions where you can do 3 "Stars" (Missions) to upgrate your Base with basic gear like more units from the beginning, more money, buldings or like. The main problem is that the whole game has only 10 maps to offer and the full campaign has not even any special/own map. they all re-use very often the maps over and over in the campaign and the Missions are mostly like that\n\nthe first (and main) Mission in one stage is mostly\n-Destroy HQ\n-Destroy a special number of Buldings\n-Survive X minutes\n\nthe second Mission in one stage is mostly\n-Destroy HQ (if you have to survive mostly)\n-Dont train X units\n\nThe third and last Mission in one stage is mostly\n-Do mission 1 and 2 in X minutes\n\nSo as you can see, it lacks in varity unlike old RTS like C&C or Starcraft. The campaign is more or less like or feels like bashed missions on multiplayer maps - which they indeed are.\n\nAll 10 Maps -are- multiplayer maps. You can use them for Multiplayer and  are also used in the Coop- and main campaign, we are still talking about the same 10 Maps. So thats actually a pretty weird concept and the player will feel that pretty quickly - i mean if the game has 25 Missions and only 10 Maps, you can think how often you play one map at least.\n\nThe "re-playable" campaign is a joke.Back to the missions, they said it is "re-playable" since if you got all stars your base will build up/upgrate from the very beginning of each mission. The problem is that it is sometimes impossible to get all 3 stars by the first try since you need to get the unit-upgrate from another mission later. So you actually have to play a lot missions twice to unlock all - and some stuff do you need since it will be harder in the later game.\n\nIs it still worth it?Fans and friends from old school RTS will sure enjoy it but will miss quickly the content or concept. Since the game offers so far only 10 maps with 25 Bashed-on-campaign missions with over and over kinda the same to do, it will more end up in "i just play a round" - and since the last Star in one mission is mostly like "Do everything in X minutes", rushes the game very very hard. I loved to play C&C to see my units and Base grow and going into battle, in 8-Bit armies it feels like "I HAVE TO CLICK LIKE HELL TO BUILD MORE UNITS NOOAAWW!!!" which ruins a bit the gameplay. Next to this are only one faction and not any "special" unit or like (so far) in this game.\n\nSo it sure is nice and i would give it barely a 6 out of 10 since it is still enjoyable (and the 15$ price mark). People who want more should maybe think twice about to buy it at least if its not some %off.\n\nThe devs already said they will update the game with new maps and what not, which maybe changes my review in the future but more i hope it will help the game grow and make it more fun to play since the multiplayer also needs a lil update since it works clunky and a bit laggy.","April 25","true","5.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It was like meeting an old friend again when I saw "Welcome back Commander" also on the defeat screen you get throwback message :).\n\nThe game plays well fast gameplay but quite uncomplicated. It's the Command and Conquer production and resource system and it's not hard to understand what they do. In my oppinion it is the boon and bane of this game, the units currently in game are not really interesting; However, I'll stress that moving your units "feels" very rewarding and fun. For now I'm willing to give Petroglyph the benefit of the doubt because there is only one faction in the game.\n\nThe "campaign" is nice it gives you the feel for the game. I struggle to call it a campaign it's more like playing skirmish missions with different rules. Which is fine it's there perogitive on what they want to put in there games as long as the game is on average good. I haven't had the chance to play the co-op campaign which I think is excellent give the people who don't want to play online something to do with friends.\n\nNow problems. Typing and clicking specifically in the Multiplayer UI is VERY unresponsive. I went to the lobby list and clicked to join a game, it did not put me into the lobby it took so long I thought something was wrong with my game and restarted. When I hosted a game myself people would join and I would see pending in their slot and it took a very long time. Also typing in the chat box it took forever for your words to appear.\n\nAs it stands now 8bit is really fun to play casually only 1 faction and by lack of anything to contrast the units against makes it such. There is potential for people to play competitively on it but more factions/races are absolutely necessary for this as well as improving the UI responsiveness for Lobbies.\n\nIn my oppinion this game is worthe the pricetag\n\n(Based off A+ to D- scale)\n\nA-\n","April 22","true","6.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","1"

Buy this: It's very good, and with time it will be great if Petroglyph follows through.\n\nMechanically, this is a slimmed down C&C for 2016. It's made by original Westwood Studio devs, it's filled with references (Cain and Seth are there, and the first playable faction is called the 'Renegades'), and Frank Klepacki is the genius behind the soundtrack. It's C&C.\n\nShortcomings? Petroglyph want the game to be accessible, so complexity at launch has been sacrificed. The game is easy to understand and get into, but there's not the same depth of strategy as in past C&C titles or StarCraft - yet (I hope this changes as new factions are released and the game matures). There's also still that, imo, annoying building placement proximity 'limit', and no convenient way to expand deeper into maps as no additional HQs can be built.\n\nI'm excited to see what Petroglyph is able to do.","April 25","true","18.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I saw this was made by Petroglyph Games (aka. former Westwood), so I was eager to see this game in action. Once I started constructing a building and heard the music, I was surprised and blown away. lol (The music, Frank Kelpacki, is that you...???)\n\nThis is a C&C game at its roots with a blend of classic RTS gameplay with an 8-bit cartoony twist. I must admit that there is so much more that can be added to the game but with what this has, it's almost like C&C Red Alert without all the expansion packs and that game was good as it was from release. I am seriously looking forward with what might be added in later as this game is quite fun for anybody who wants to try it out both RTS and non-RTS players alike who want classic RTS gameplay. For 15 dollars as it sits right now, it's worth every penny and has a lot of replay value as there is a campaign, co-op campaign, skirmish, and online multiplayer that you can host lobbies to play with your friends.\n\nThis game is fast paced, you get attacked a lot and often if you don't build up your forces and harvesters for the firepower and 'monies' respectively. Having fun with skirmish so far and I'll update this review when I try the campaign. There isn't many units and they  have basic functions, although it's a good idea to have a nice blend of different units in your armies so there are no weaknesses (Hint: go for artillery as fast as you can to wreck armies). You have a few defense buildings, radar building, air unit building, tech building, nuke silo, etc. (C'mon, this is almost like Red Alert.. lol).\nThere are a good reasonable amount of maps, but we all know there can never be enough. So far, this game is solid for 15 dollars.\n\nAnd if you are one of those people who likes Command & Conquer, just f*****g buy the game.\n\nI'm calling it right now, but if I start seeing tesla coils or anything of the like popping up in a future update I will lose my sanity.","April 25","true","3.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The gameplay is the same so it's easy to jump right in swinging. No tutorial needed. Runs smooth and is quite enjoyable. The retro (8-bit) blocky nature of the game graphics is cool, although I would rather have them be closer to the voxel size in C&C. However it in no way takes anything away from this game.

There are no characters or dialogue in the game so don't expect an even vaguely interesting story. But even without story the missions are still fun to play through and while the strategy is relatively simple, it can still be difficult to complete the bonus challenges on each mission on hard difficulty (the third challenge always being a time limit). The soundtrack is great and very reminiscent of C&C/Red alert (It's the same artist; Frank Klepacki) so I recommend getting the soundtrack edition if you like to listen to game music outside of the game.  There is also a separate co-op campaign if you want to play with a friend and of course multiplayer skirmishes.\n\nI like that Petroglyph have gone back to their roots as Westwood with this game, and I hope they create a sequel with a bit more depth and characters to help drive the story.","April 27","true","5.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It plays fast paced and fluidly, is easy to handle and simply super fun to play. The overall gameplay just feels like the old CnC games and the music from legendary Frank Klepacki serves it part.

This game is fantastic and i like it and because of that i want to write now possibilities to improve the gameplay and i want to criticise some points of the game.\nLet's talk first about the pros of the game:\n+ very nice graphic\n+ very detaillated and good looking maps\n+ soundtrack\n+ near to the gameplay of command & conquer but with new accents\n+ animations\n\nSo graphics and animations are very good but they have to work in some points of the gameplay\nCons:\n- with more than 5 radars you can see the whole map ( 4 players map) and that destroys the gameplay (its like spy in aoe3 which makes the map visible for the player who bought the upgrade) ---> no sneak attacks ---> full knowledge---> boring\n- the KI knows exactly the location of your troops so they place their atom bomb directly on your troops... me as a beginner is not quick enough to react and boom your whole army is dead and in return the bots know instantly when you plop an atom bomb\n- if i defeat someones base his units are also eliminated. thats ♥♥♥♥ because it should be last man standing so the defeated player can do a comeback with his last units\n-their should be a tiny income which helps you producing units when all oil ressources are empty or when all your harvesters were destroyed in the beginning\n-harvesters can kill infantry instantly . thats at first a good point but it makes early rushes unwinable. they should just half the hp of infantry. tanks at the later game should crush infantry to 100% how its implemented no in the game too\n-helicopters are too cheap, with an heli only army you have no disadvantages because they are nearly as expensive as the other units. helicopters should be an important addition to the army and it should matters when one goes down.\n\nThese are the main points in my review . I hope the developers will read this, update the game and i also excuse me for my english.\nAnd remember i really like this game !\nThank you\n","May 6","false","9.9"," 10 of 20 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","10","20","0","2"

Because while it's not a bad game in itself, it's extremely basic and barebones.\n\nLong Version:  If you've played the original Command & Conquer (Tiberian Dawn), then you've already got a strong idea of how this game is going to play - only that it's somehow even more simplistic and straightforward.  You've got your base, a resource to collect (oil) along with a harvester to reach it, power plants, a couple of base defense structures, production structures, infantry, tanks, a recon jeep, choppers, artillery, and a nuke as a superweapon.  That's it.  No subfactions, no support powers, no secondary unit abilities, buffs, or specials, no garrisonable structures, or anything else that's fancy.  It's the kind of RTS that you could probably use to introduce your kids or young relatives into the genre, but even they'll pick up the mechanics pretty quickly.  In all likelihood, you've played something more complex.\n\nThe campaign has a bit of length (roughly 30 missions) and does encourage replayability via secondary objectives with rewards that can only be achieved with later playthroughs.  The reason being is that some of the objectives just aren't possible without the later units being unlocked.  And whenever those secondary objectives are completeld, they either unlock additional starting units for that mission, more starting credits, or a new unit to use at the beginning of that particular mission.  That later point is kinda moot though, especially since beating all of the mission's objectives invalidates the usefulness of those extra starting items...\n\nThe one big positive is the multiplayer.  In addition to a co-op campaign with it's own set of secondary objectives (this time for achievement purposes only though, no unlocks), you've got 10 skirmish/multiplayer maps with some that can host up to 8 players.  So if you've been missing the massive swarms of tanks and joint bases that sometimes occured when playing the older C&C titles on the bigger maps, you'll definitely get that fix here.\n\nFinally, the devs have mentioned that they will release a second "Medieval Fantasy" themed faction at some point in the future, but no official date has been given.  Oh, and they might also release something for the modding community (an SDK, perhaps?) but again, no official date or word has been given.","April 24","false","4.0"," 12 of 25 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","12","25","0","2"

It is basically a Command and Conquer remake, but unfortunately including all the bad things as well. RTS game design has improved since the 1990's, so there is no reason to stick to that formula.\n\nHere are my annoyances that likely never will be patched:\n- Harvesters have a lot of health and can kill infantry units as if they were ants\n- You can only build one building at a time, and you can't queue them\n- You can only build one unit of each type at a time, which means that if you've queued a number of units and change your mind, you need to tediously right-click multiple times to reset the building queue to insert the unit you wanted\n- You need to build power plants as upkeep. This is fine, except the "energy meter" is very hard to read and slows you down a lot (for instance, can you afford a +50 power building if your power is at 1125 / 1200? Why can't this be +2 usage of 45/48 instead?)\n- Defense turrets have the same sight and range as your best anti-defense units\n- Almost all of the single-player missions are on a clock, so constant stress factor\n- Super weapons can be launched anywhere on the map by just clicking. This was a problem in C&C as well and fixed by Blizzard in Starcraft 1. I don't understand why you would go back to the old design.\n\n8-bit Armies is not as cool as C&C and Red Alert were, and fails to live up to the game design of every RTS released thereafter.\n","May 7","false","11.5"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","11","23","0","0"

But my hype was let down after playing the game for a bit. The game just feels shallow and made for people who are brand new to RTS games, as in have never played an RTS before, but for players like myself who played tons of Red Alert 2 it lacked alot of depth and unit variety. The game is very simple and at the time of writting there is one faction, a couple units and a handfull of buildings. There are no base expansion mechanics, a small pool of maps. and the strategy is lacking, with a good tactic being just build a crapload of units and zerg rush the enemy with not much in the way of defensive options. I found the art style all right and the music is great but the lack of depth and vareity is what really hampered my experience. Overall I felt let down. To be fair my expectaions might have been too high as I was hoping for a game similar to Red Alert 2 but alas this is not that. It's fun, but very basic which if that is what you are looking for than go right ahead, but for me I just wanted a bit more.","May 1","false","1.4"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","3"

I am a long-time player of RTS games, I fondly recall my time with Dune, C&C 95, and Warcraft 1.\n\nI have followed the RTS genre for a long time and played many titles, but nothing has ever really stuck since C&C Tiberian Sun. At least, until now.\n\nHere we have it folks,  a classic genre is making a comeback bigtime. Don't let the aesthetics put you off, give it a try. (I personally enjoy the design)\n\nIt plays like oldschool command and conquer. A handful of units to mix and match, many many ways you could attack an enemy base depending on what you want to focus on as a commander, and of course, sound design and OST by the legendary Frank, composer of the original C&C soundtracks.\n\nHeres the TLDR:\n\n1) Value for money: YES!\n\nWhat do you get? You get 25 campaign missions, each with easy, normal and hard difficulty and with 3 objectives to complete. Combined with the gradual unlock system (You unlock tech by defeating objectives in the campaign) with adding bonus starting units/buildings (again through the objectives) there is a lot of replayability.\n\nOntop of that, we have 10 co-op campaign missions to play with a friend. Great fun and difficult to boot, following a similar unlock pattern to the main campaign. Beat missions and level up to gain access to more things.\n\nThat not for you? We've got classic C&C skirmish action on 10 maps, with multiplayer available.\n\nSeriously, just buy it. If you are a fan of RTS or C&C in general, you will love this. I am excited for the future factions (they are planning 6) and what else may come for the game.\n\nI do admit i worry they may overcomplicate by adding more units or buildings to the factions, but I hope they will stick to this model and just keep adding more factions with a handful of units/buildings to play around with.","April 25","true","11.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yourwolfsdengaming/recommended/427250/","yourwolfsdengaming","yourwolfsdengaming","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yourwolfsdengaming/","660 products in account","--------- This Review Is Courtesy Of Yourwolfsdengaming ---------\n\n\n- Purchased Copy -\n\n\nFrom what we’ve gathered with our magical and mystical ability of staring at the Steam Store page, there’s 25 offline campaign missions, 12 co-op missions, 10 multiplayer maps, and 1 faction.\n\nSorry, one? We mean, we know it’s more focused on people who are getting into RTS games, but one faction on launch?\n\nAs for the gameplay, it’s your fairly typical lot, except dumbed down. It’s Command and conquer in almost every aspect, but even on release, the first Command and Conquer was a fairly simple game to get into, and just a hard game to master. 8 Bit Armies has mostly thrown out the ‘hard game to master’ bit, and given you the rest. Which sounds great! Meaning, there’s a whole campaign, skirmish against AI, multiplayer, what’s wrong? For one, they did everything wrong Command and Conquer did wrong, and a lot more. For starters, the campaign is weak. Unlike in the superior sequel Red Alert, there’s no cutscenes in the campaign. You select your level, some text appears, you have some side objectives which are almost impossible for said new people the game is trying to get into, you have a few (and we mean a few) difficulty options, and then they’re off. It plays almost identical in every way to just a shorter skirmish match, side goals are either impossible for the ‘beginner’ player audience it’s trying to advertise to, or they can just be done along with the main goal which makes them pointless, and because there are no factions, no story, and no cutscenes at all, it’s just skirmish mode with objectives thrown in. The campaign isn’t fun, it’s boring. We started playing, got through six missions and quit. The bonus objectives are cool, and would help make any other campaign more replayable, especially since they give you bonus things that stack on to your next loadout for the next mission, but it can’t make it replayable if it’s just tedious to play. Skirmish mode made the campaign obsolete.\n\nAdd these problems up, and you have an unneeded campaign.\n\nSkirmish mode is up next, and it’s about what you expect. Again, you have only one faction. As such in skirmish, every faction plays the same, because they are all indeed playing the same faction. You have 10 maps to choose from, the color of the AI, and their difficulty. You have a few different ‘versions’ of skirmish mode available by changing the very few rules, but we really wish there were more game modes, because as is, there’s only ever one game mode, which is deathmatch/team deathmatch. This would be ‘okay’ if there were more than one faction, and the factions had different units and played differently, but they don’t because we only ever have one faction, and there’s only ever one strategy to use. There’s also a problem of the AI. The AI is simple, and (even with an update fixing this issue) the AI still somehow rush and manage an army I’ve never even seen in multiplayer by 2:30 into a match. The problem is that the AI will rush in the beginning with the same units you can defend with, and because turrets both are horrible and have the range of Nerf guns, it just comes down to ‘who has more of x units that happen to counter y units’. The game is a big fan of counter units, but because air units have more mobility and have anti-infantry/anti-vehicle versions, players could just build an army of air units without a second thought. The AI is overly simple, and if they don’t rush, end up being way too easy to beat. The game is enjoyable, but I’m not sure if it’s because the game itself is good, or if it’s because it just took good things other games also did well. Outside of the good elements it took from Command and Conquer, we’re really not sure what it has as an identity, and that worries us about its future. Because there’s so few units or unique types of units/buildings, it comes off as feeling rather generic.\n\nAs for multiplayer, it exists. We tried 15 total games, and 12 of those 15 games just got canceled after waiting in a lobby with other players for 10 minutes. No, we don’t have the time for that. It’s nice it exists, but the game needs matchmaking, because we spent far longer in the menus just waiting for something to happen, the game to start, players to join, or for those in our game to decide what kind of game we should have. It has a feel of being incomplete, and why these options you as a host can’t set BEFORE you open the match to players baffles us. You also have an in-game text chat function. It works fine, but three of the possible colors in the game are really hard to see in the chat. The chat has a faded black background, and our font was black because the team color we had was black. You can figure out how well that went trying to read dark black and a slightly lighter dark black backdrop.\n\nVisually, it looks okay. It’s nothing special, but it gets the job done. We’d say more, but they really don’t do enough with the lighting so we can see what the game is fully capable of, and almost all the maps take place in the equivalency of ‘day’, so it’s hard to judge it. Characteristically, it looks rather bland, and everything from the maps to the units looks generic. This would be okay if there were other factions, or indeed something else there as a contrast, but there’s not. The game runs really well as a plus, and we don’t doubt it probably being able to run on integrated graphics just fine.\n\nFor the audio, the game sounds great. The music was really nice, but the audio effects weren’t really interesting enough or impressive, but it all fit well and sounded defined.\n\nIt’s okay, but we wonder if it’s okay because the actual game is good, or because it took nearly everything that made the Command and Conquer games good, because everything it tries to do comes off as either unfinished or boring. Teasing us with a faction that’s not even out yet is nice, but the game needed more than one faction on release.\n\nIt’s hard to suggest because it just feels so incomplete. There’s a lot of really cool game elements here, but most of the things we enjoyed in 8 Bit Armies were just things we also enjoyed in Command and Conquer, and 8 Bit Armies store page certainly isn’t shy about telling us who’s skin it’s wearing. The problem is that everything the game tries to do itself that isn’t just something you could copy easily, it doesn’t do it well. Multiplayer is boring with just one faction with cookie-cutter units, campaign without a story is just the skirmish mode, and the skirmish mode is too shallow with not enough to do. The game is fun in short bursts, but certainly not for the long hall, and we’ll suggest thing game only under the guise that you as a player wait at the very least until the magic faction they tease gets released. The game is a generic RTS for now, take that for what it is, and we hope that it gets better as time goes on.\n\nPROS\n- The music is amazing, and the sound effects aren't half bad\n- fair level of settings to adjust the game, and the game controls well\n\nCONS\n- Everything feels so generic and bland\n- Nothing in the game has it's own style, and we wonder if it will hold a playerbase a year after its release\n- The campaign is boring, the multiplayer is limited without matchmaking, and the skirmish and unit options are shallow\n\nScore: 6.8/10\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is our full review for the game, the only difference between the Steam review and the one on our website, is we have pictures and text is easier to read and what not.

The same company that brought us Star Wars: Empire at War, battle battalions, and Grey Goo. Now right off the bat, I thought I wasn’t going to enjoy this game. The reason why was because I grew up in the 90’s. I am one of those older guys who played 8-bit games when they were the standard and typically don’t like going back to that aesthetic. I also don’t like Minecraft for the same reason. So I really didn’t have high hopes for this game going in to it and Boy was I surprised! This game is done very much in the old Command and Conquer style with modern 8-bit graphics and mechanics. I found myself sinking immediately back into old habits as the control schemes and unit types were immediately familiar.\n\n8-Bit Armies is a very good RTS and a nice reminder of how the genre used to be. Easily worth the $15 asking price whether you have never played RTS’s before or are an enthusiast."\n\nSee my full Critique here:\nhttps://youtu.be/BY5staYSHNw","May 1","true","4.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I like its CAC style system. Graphics are ok. On its release, the game has a few issues such as the bad campaign, the spammy ai, the defective units and multiplayer issues.\n\nThing is that the units aren't that good. I felt that they were weak. The main infantry, is a machine gunner. It doesn't really work that way.

It really seems like Petroglyph is on its last few dollars and decided to rush something out in Unity.\n\nThe issue with this game is that it seems too indie for a studio that's made very high quality games in the past.\n\nIt has some good ideas, like the bonuses for mission completion giving you a base at start, which is a huge advantage that snowballs into bigger advantages, which allows you to go back to former missions and get missing rankings.\n\nThat being said, the UI is clean but looks really ugly. The effects seem to be missing sometimes. The victory animation lags up the game and just looks... bad. It looks just so rushed. It's... eh.\n\nI really just bought this game to support its development. When it shapes up I'll give it a more positive review.

I've been a long time fan of their games and have played Command & Conquer since the beginning. I originally wrote a negative review for this game and I will explain why under the Cons section. However Petroglyph has been actively updating this game with new fixes and balance changes, many of which were previously listed as negatives and have been suggested by the community and promise to add content in the future. If I could I would give this a neutral rating. I chose to go with Positive because a lot of people (will) enjoy it and I believe in the long term it will be a worthwhile investement based on the planned updates.\n\nPros -\n\nThis game is really pretty. It's wonderfully minimalistic, the models look nice, the animations are fluid and beautiful, and the lighting is fantastic. Performance is great, I can run it very well on my powerful PC as well as on a $350 laptop. You can definitely tell this was made by the original C&C developers. It has the same formula, although paced differently, and of course has a fantastic soundtrack written by THE Frank Klepacki. One of my favorite things to do in C&C was  to build massive bases with hefty defenses to ward off units as a build a massive army to completely swarm the enemy and that (mainly) remains an option.\n\nIn addition to supporting skrimish matches with any combination of AI controlled armies there is a (quite difficult) Co-op campaign as well as a singleplayer campaign. Skrimish matches support up to 8 players, human or AI. The gameplay is enjoyable and is paced a bit differently so even C&C veterans will have a small time do adjust. The cities are destructible and they satisfyingly crumble, as do the bases.\n\nPetroglyph has promised to keep updating this game and adding content. A lot of the things they have promised, when implemented, will gradually shorten the lengthy Cons section of the review. They've commented on the review and have hinted at some upcoming features such as multiple HQ's, adjustable resource amounts, harvester AI improvements, and of course a second faction. As time passes I expect the Pros and Cons of this review to switch places in terms of size and I really can't wait for that to happen.\n\nCons -\n\nI had this rated negative because I think this game falls a bit short in areas and it is not technically complete, despite Petroglyph selling it as one. It is NOT in Early Access as some seem to believe, but I think it either should be or should have been delayed. 8-Bit Armies stays true to the C&C forumla, but it needs work. There's only one faction that has a fairly small amount of units. There's 2 combat infantry units, one with what looks like a minigun and the other with a missile launcher. There's 3 combat land vehicles, the anti personel armored car, artillery, and a tank. For air units there is two combat helicopters, one with a machine gun and the other with missiles. The entirety of the units consists of one with a machine gun, the other with a missile of some sort. The defense turrets follow that rule as well. There is one unarmed transport helicopter, an engineer, and the harvesters.\n\nHarvesters brings up another issue. The AI (I sent one heli in the back of their base and forgot about it for awhile and it destroyed over half of their base, despite their very sizeable army/constant unit production) and its pathfinding is not good. There's not a lot of support for base expansion, either. You have the option to build another HQ, but it is always grayed out. The only way to expand is to build off the local build radius of other buildings. The problem is there are resource points all over the map, so your harvesters have to drive all over to get to resources and it's difficult build any support structures for them or closer refineries. Harvesters also all tend to gravitate towards one resource point and clog it up, rather than having a limit of 2-3, like other games, to prevent it. I personally think a finite amount of resources is lame, and the resources run out in about 30 minutes of gameplay which I find far too quick. It would be cool to see either slowly regenerating resources (Red Alert games for example) or structures that passively earn resources (Generals games.)\n\nAnother problem arises with the lack of base expansion. The game wants you to build a lot of buildings and there's no clear build radius. Building multiple unit production buildings will decrease the unit production time. Your base starts to get crowded very quickly if you want to maximize unit production. This is an issue not only because you run out of room, but unless you keep a lot of space between your structures your harvesters will start getting stuck on structures and each other.\n\nThe maps are all pretty similar and bland. They have cities but they make no impact on the gameplay. You cannot garrison units, there's no unique/resource structures, and they all crumble with one missile and quickly disappear in combat as if they were never there.\n\nThe only bug I've run into so far is when I change the graphics settings the game will switch monitors. I have to adjust the settings a few times for each setting to keep it on the rigth monitor. Other than that it's been very stable and multiplayer works great. Alt tabbing can cause some DeSync but that's pretty common in RTS games but it is worth noting.\n\nTl;Dr/Conclusion\n\nKeep in mind if you buy this you are paying for an unfinished game and, in addition, is also only $15 so don't expect something with a lot of content or mechanics. This can be a good thing, though. The game says true to its homage to the classic C&C games and the simplicity can make it easy to pick up and play and is friendly to those who haven't delved deeper into RTS games. It's a cool and cheap game to pick up and enjoy with your friends. Whether I recommend it really depends on what you're looking for. If you want a cheap and simple RTS game to play solo or with friends and/or you want to support the future development of the game I definitely recommend it. If you're looking for an in depth RTS with a lot of replayability or aren't a fan of buying incomplete games I recommend you wait for the future as more content is added.","April 23","true","3.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","22"

Starcraft 2, Age of Empires, and mainly Command and Conquer will bring much memories and examples into this game. It's somewhat basic at the moment to be honest, however I'm certain the devs will be adding a lot more into this game and fixing some minor issues. But thus far, it's an awesome game and I'm diggin everything so far.\n\n- Visuals are nice and is unique from other RTS games.\n- Audio is awesome and gets you hyped af, esp when you get swarmed or when you jump someones base.\n- Interface is very similiar to C&C and same building skematic.\n- Easy to control units and navigate them.\n- Random drop crates: Either units, money, or a booby trap.\n- Nuke: Pretty much wreck a bunch of enemy units or damage/destory enemy buildings. Can be used offensively or defensively so use them wisely since there is a time limit.\n- The modes: Campaign, Co-Op Campaign, Skirmish, Multiplayer.\n\nJust a tip for all of you guys, bots rush so damn hard and your harvesters are stupid 99% of the time, so have fun.","May 1","true","7.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

Starcraft 2, Age of Empires, and mainly Command and Conquer will bring much memories and examples into this game. It's somewhat basic at the moment to be honest, however I'm certain the devs will be adding a lot more into this game and fixing some minor issues. But thus far, it's an awesome game and I'm diggin everything so far.\n\n- Visuals are nice and is unique from other RTS games.\n- Audio is awesome and gets you hyped af, esp when you get swarmed or when you jump someones base.\n- Interface is very similiar to C&C and same building skematic.\n- Easy to control units and navigate them.\n- Random drop crates: Either units, money, or a booby trap.\n- Nuke: Pretty much wreck a bunch of enemy units or damage/destory enemy buildings. Can be used offensively or defensively so use them wisely since there is a time limit.\n- The modes: Campaign, Co-Op Campaign, Skirmish, Multiplayer.\n\nJust a tip for all of you guys, bots rush so damn hard and your harvesters are stupid 99% of the time, so have fun.","May 1","true","7.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

Everything else is okay such as the troops dmg and so on, but its the rush that enemies do in the first 5 minutes and just want to end the game quickly, this is what has put me off the game simply because of people constantly rushing and destroying the fun, i cannot enjoy the game if people want to end the match too quickly.\n\nBUT\n\nI suggest that devs rethink about this and maybe they could make the better troops longer to make such as the tanks, the helicoptors etc, and also add a grace that allows the people in the match to have a good start without being **** on in the first 3 minutes of the game.","May 7","true","28.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

We've had a few games, and we're pretty much eternally grateful for the update stopping the AIs rushing at the start. The aim of this game seems to be to provide players with a quick, simple match which can be over in a few minutes. I haven't checked out the singleplayer yet, but from what I can tell from the multiplayer, there's not really much content. Each game is over in about half an hour, longer if you're evenly matched with your opponents or frustratingly short if you're outclassed. Different map sizes help extend game time, but overall each match is pretty short. Which is ok, on its own. Match length doesn't affect the quality of most games, take League of Legends for example (As toxic as the community is, the game itself isn't too bad, but back to my point). The match length isn't the problem. It's the lack of context, and content. Every game is extremely linear. Refinery, barracks, motor pool, lab, radar, air control, nukes, spam units. That's all you can do as a player, and all other players can do as well. There's no variety of units, and every match feels almost the same as the last. Longer games become a match of exhaustion, when all involved players have used all the money they have and can get, and they're sick of carrying on. Don't get me wrong, I have four hours on this game, and it's only been out a couple of weeks, so I've only played a few games, but I've already started to notice this problem with content in games. Adding colour-specific weaponry and units might help add some variety to the games, and prevent this repetivity, but I get that the game is supposed to be simple for everyone to play. If the gameplay doesn't want to be touched, maybe add a levelling system outside the game that can add minor bonuses, like Shellshock Live. It might not prevent each game from being repetitive, but the progression would make each game feel worthwhile. This is by NO means, a bad game. Hell, if it adds enough content to flesh it out, then it'd be amazing. This game could be one of my favourites, with just a few more months of development, but for now I'm just going to wait, I think. Well done on making something nice, clean, and good to look at though. We've encountered barely any bugs, too. So, good job, and keep it up :D","May 7","true","6.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It really seems like Petroglyph is on its last few dollars and decided to rush something out in Unity.\n\nThe issue with this game is that it seems too indie for a studio that's made very high quality games in the past.\n\nIt has some good ideas, like the bonuses for mission completion giving you a base at start, which is a huge advantage that snowballs into bigger advantages, which allows you to go back to former missions and get missing rankings.\n\nThat being said, the UI is clean but looks really ugly. The effects seem to be missing sometimes. The victory animation lags up the game and just looks... bad. It looks just so rushed. It's... eh.\n\nI really just bought this game to support its development. When it shapes up I'll give it a more positive review.

I like its CAC style system. Graphics are ok. On its release, the game has a few issues such as the bad campaign, the spammy ai, the defective units and multiplayer issues.\n\nThing is that the units aren't that good. I felt that they were weak. The main infantry, is a machine gunner. It doesn't really work that way. Rocket men are just so weak that you need to spawn a blob of them to take out 2 jeeps.\n"Blobbing" is the only way to win (Blobbing is creating an army that is so big that it can be seen from the radar btw).\n\nDon't worry, if you bought this game, don't uninstall and refund. The community should be able to help this game be stable as it is in its first days of release.\n\n\nDo i recommend it? Yes but if the game is stable enough. Game is i guess, fairly priced.\n\n\n6/10\n\n"Hey, at least its better than a pay 2 win game"","April 25","true","2.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

First, if you have played C&C or any similar games, you should be so called hope here. Ok this has the blocky graphics on purpose and I think it works. The usual things work, choose your group by keeping like left mouse button holded and moving around the group and when all selected, ctrl - 1 for example. Very basic. Also you can change any keys, for example i wanted to change the moving of screen to wasd, just need to double click on the key to change on settings. Music is a bit "old school" and also works, at least to "older players" I would think :) There are some background stuff also, like birds singing... Very easy game to get into, but probably hard to master at later levels especially if you want to have all the goals (like do things in certain time). This is for single player stuff of course, so I haven't tried multiplayer yet.\nInteresting take to the old concept, mostly I guess with the "lego" graphics, which to me at least, work pretty well. I'm sure it can get very fast paced on multiplayer, but as said not yet checked.\nI have yet to see if there are any limits to amount of like soldiers you can have - so far to me, seems can have enough...  if not infinite - that is if you have the money :) The more buildings for like barracks you have, faster you build the soldiers. I would have wanted more troops, but seems they want to keep it simple (or I have not yet seen "all").\nAs said, a bit like C&C, maybe even more simple, but for quick matches seems to work very well. I also think the price is pretty ok.\nCheers...","May 7","true","5.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","2","0","1"

The graphics in the game are extremely pretty, and the core structure of the game allows each player to develop his/her own strategy as they play. Even in early access the game shows extremely high potential and is a must buy for RTS fans. Highly recommend it :)","May 8","true","15.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

First, if you have played C&C or any similar games, you should be so called hope here. Ok this has the blocky graphics on purpose and I think it works. The usual things work, choose your group by keeping like left mouse button holded and moving around the group and when all selected, ctrl - 1 for example. Very basic. Also you can change any keys, for example i wanted to change the moving of screen to wasd, just need to double click on the key to change on settings. Music is a bit "old school" and also works, at least to "older players" I would think :) There are some background stuff also, like birds singing... Very easy game to get into, but probably hard to master at later levels especially if you want to have all the goals (like do things in certain time). This is for single player stuff of course, so I haven't tried multiplayer yet.\nInteresting take to the old concept, mostly I guess with the "lego" graphics, which to me at least, work pretty well. I'm sure it can get very fast paced on multiplayer, but as said not yet checked.\nI have yet to see if there are any limits to amount of like soldiers you can have - so far to me, seems can have enough...  if not infinite - that is if you have the money :) The more buildings for like barracks you have, faster you build the soldiers. I would have wanted more troops, but seems they want to keep it simple (or I have not yet seen "all").\nAs said, a bit like C&C, maybe even more simple, but for quick matches seems to work very well. I also think the price is pretty ok.\nCheers...","May 7","true","5.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","2","0","1"

I have always loved that the interface is placed on the right, and that you do not need to select a building to train or produce. Thanks to Petraglyph for that. Second, the game runs very well. Quick to boot, fast to exit. Great colors.  But this is where it stops for me. The title of the game (8-Bit Armies) is horrendous and just communicates that they did not care enough to give the game a proper title. Besides, there is no 8-bit look to the graphics. The graphics are big, bright and colorful. But units are boring, infantry looks like the guys from cubemen, and none of the units feel powerful when they fire. There is a total lack of ‘ooomph’ when tanks or artillery engages. As for the audio, it is virtually non-existant. I do not review the music, only sound effects which have nothing to offer. The game lacks the seriousness of RA, with that extra spark of lightheartedness that reminds us all that war can also be very fun.\n\nAs for the map selection, all of them are 100% symmetrical. Remember when these maps started to arrive? They are called ‘tournament maps’ and are boring and stiff. To top it all off, when you win a game, you are treated to  ‘a winner is you’ – message trying to cash in on ancient ‘all your base are belong to us’ – jokes. Jokes that need to be at the expense of japanese games, which RTS games are not. That message is totally out of place and toe-curling.\n\nC&C and Red Alert was made free many years ago. There is even a pumped edition of RA out there, with modern resolutions, the ability to use the nice infantry from C&C in RA, instead of the infantry RA was born with, OpenGL, Direct3D etc. Yes, totally free and MUCH MUCH better than 8-Bit Armies.\n\nGet Red Alert for free or put the money towards Deserts of Kharak. Armies is a game that fell asleep when they started working on it and never woke up. There is some fun to be had with the game, it is just far from enough for the price. Touting this game as being on par with C&C and Red Alert is ill-advised at best.","April 24","false","1.2"," 6 of 22 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","6","22","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BLDShepard/recommended/427250/","BLDShepard","Shepard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BLDShepard/","338 products in account","At first I was excited to find a new RTS to play (sadly there are not many), I had informed my friend about it and he said it looked interesting. So I went ahead and purchased it and played the tutorial. First, I was a bit upset at the fact that you could only build one building at a time. Second, if you build multiples of the same production building you cannot select the new one you made and have it start producing units in addition to the first building. Instead it only speeds up the first building. IMO that is pretty lame and simple. I wanted this game to be fun and I played some of the campaign (1 mission) and it was just so dull and simple. Over all this game is too simple. Its like a bare bones RTS game made for either elderly folk or little kids. I spent a good time idling in the menu as I dicussed it with my friend who had then bought it, which I then spent more time trying to get multiplayer working, and once we did (after a good 10 minutes) it was just more of the same. Boring. I felt it had no strategy in it at all, just spam units and you win. The AI is also pretty (for lack of a better word) stupid. I would have an entire army rip apart an AI base but because the AI units couldnt see my units destroying the base, they didn't react. All in all this was a pretty oversimplified RTS that has no right to have Strategy in it's name at all. Half this time was spent idleing or trouble shooting.

I'm one of those people, in fact just recently I did a play though of Yuri's revenge and was pleasantly surprised to still find the game fun to play and engaging.\nHowever my experience with 8-bit armies was not as great.\n\nI picked it up for the co-op campaign and what I found was that the AI was uh..."challenging." So challenging in fact that they were given many advantages over the players. Access to more units, more money, faster building speed and worst of all, the ability to micromanage perfectly. Units designed to counteract other units have the ability to zero in on the unit they work best against even when there are dozens of units on the screen and mow down troops in a matter of seconds. This made bonus objectives like "don't use rocket troops" or "build no turrets" feel insurmountable. It maybe my imagination but it felt like my units lacked any sort of direction at all on top of all that.\n\nWorst of all was on many occasions, the AI was allowed to make several artillery units, place them just inside the fog of war and bombard your base repeatedly. Sending out troops to deal with this was futile as they were easily and quickly overwhelmed. Perhaps the most annoying part of this was that once the AI had destroyed a random number of your buildings they would leave, give you enough time to rebuild, then return and repeat the process. AI could only seem to be overcome by building turrets down every street and once the missions  allowed the AI to build air units along with artillery, this strategy no longer worked.\n\nI would be willing to let them work on it and wait, but the game is not in early access and so I have requested a refund. I hope they will continue to work on it as there is a lot of potential but I cannot recommend it at this time in it's current state.","May 2","false","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yes I am waiting for more factions (even if they are DLC).","May 29","true","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is no real strategy here except flood units. no real tactic needed, build buildings, go forward with swarm, kill enemy swarm, repeat. maps are tiny and influence this play style heavily. however that being said, it does stick to the original formula westwood put out so many years ago, and it can be fun in short bursts, which is something i shouldn't be able to say about an rts, but its there.\n\nUnit Variety is lack luster, with no real point to spam anything but heavy tanks and heavy helos. youll spend most of your 4 minutes in a multiplayer match speeding through building your buildings while simulataneously spamming these two units. Then sending your swarm forward to steam roll everything.\n\nIf you play alone youll want to spam early on and destroy the initial AI army, then just destroy their harvesters as they leave the enemy base and build an army of your own, which is dull and repetitive to say the least. Though at first the enemy AI will curb stomp you because even on easy they are little tyrants. Spamming their units at super computer speeds you cant keep up with, initially.\n\nHowever there are other units like artilary and the like, that do area damage at a decent fire rate, but the damage they do merely isnt enough to defeat a heavy swarm or offer any real hinderence, then the enemy swarm rushes them and they are wiped out. Perhaps if these things are buffed than maybe the game will balance itself out and allow for more thinking to take over.\n\nIn its current state, it's not so much a strategy game as much as it is a swarm simulator. Though it does have a nostalgic feel, and an easy to understand UI, it just doesn't feel...Strategic.\n\n3/5","June 5","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have always wanted a game like this where it is kind of like clash of clans where you build up armies, but it is much more fast paced and you get right to the fun stuff. The multiplayer is fun, but does take a while to get into a lobby, especially if you want 3 v 3 or FFA. But this game is super fun and I have put more than 9 hours into this game just today. God i need to get a life. But seriously. Get this game.","June 5","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It reminds me of games of old such as c & c and red alert 2. With that being said what I see as a con is the release of a new race but  charging for that  new race when it should already be included in the game, that is something I do not see as a customer friendly aspect but a money grab.","June 3","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
