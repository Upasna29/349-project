Several of their offerings already explore life and on the high seas. Not to disparage the other fine offerings already on hand but I hold the opinion that Choice of the Pirate is the best one of them yet.\n\nFor one, it presents a wide scope in the narrative with a meaningful choice between civilization and freedom. Neither side is shown to be an absolute good but rather present different views on what people value in life. It also has a strong Carribean feel with native magic being intrinsically tied to nature. The set pieces are fun, especially as you meet creatures like merfolk, sea monsters and ghost ships.\n\nOverall it is well-written and a fun romp. Each playthrough takes approximately 40 minutes which is decent for a CoG title so no fear of a truncated game either. I won't lie, the previous two offerings from CoG did not impress me much. Heroes: Redemption was basically the author strongarming the reader into listening and playing along with the author's political views while Sea Eternal was kinda meh. Choice of Pirates on the other hand is a strong offering that ranks alongside some of their best works.","May 21","true","2.7"," 18 of 23 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","18","23","0","0"

I'd advise anyone from purchasing unless they were looking for something different to play. Choice of the Pirate is a game centered around your choices you make in the storyline that ultimately effects the plot in the end... I had a lot of fun choosing and reminding myself to be wary of what I choose... but I gotta say that some of the choices I made didn't really seem to bite me in the ♥♥♥ in the end at all. I never heard that character at all ever again after that choice I had made, and I was really expecting them to come back later on and try to stab me in the back for it. It didn't happen though, which was disappointing. I liked being able to pick out my signature clothing as a pirate, however that "choice" seemed to be purely asthetic... I created my own piece of clothing and I expected the game to sorta "substitute" my choice within the conversation when it came to that point but it never happened. A lot of the characters in the game are meaningless and you won't really need to remember their names since you'll only interact with them two different times out of the whole playthrough. The "love interest" really isn't interesting. After hooking up the relationship really isn't brought back up in the story at all until the epilogue in the ending. Another thing, the whole "pirate king" title barer is a mystery.... but.... it's not... the story makes it painfully obvious from the very beginning who the pirate king really is..","May 23","false","6.9"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

As to be expected of a choose-your-adventure game, there's a multitude of options:  but they're gripping, well played out, and genuinely change the course of the story.  Your skills and relationships influence the plot as well; they're not superfluous percentages that have no bearing on your gameplay.\n\nAs should be the case, what I loved most was the /story/.  The excitement of battle, the attention to detail, the complicated politics -- all very well done.  The writing is very good.\n\nWhat initially tipped the scales for me to buy the game was the fact that it offered not just an option for the MC to be queer, but ALSO gave you the chance to be poly, AND gave you the chance to be trans or nonbinary (or trans nonbinary).  Like, damn.  What game does that?  Those features were crucial to my engagement wit the game, though I do wish my gender identity had been mentioned/acknowledged a bit more.\n\nOverall, yeah, strongly recommend Choice of the Pirate.

I have been a fan of ‘choose your own adventure’ since the early 1980s when there was little else to do but watch all 3 channels on TV, listen to the radio or play Atari. For those who don’t know there is a whole line of ‘choose your own adventure’ books out there and can be enjoyed again and again just like this game! There is more than one story and more than one way to win – but then again there is more than one way to fail and lose. BUT that is the fun of it! Finding out what was around that corner or behind that door you didn’t try to open the first time. I bought a whole set of books for my oldest son for Christmas the year he turned 9 just as I was when I first discovered them. He now has his own Steam account and has played this game and loves it just as much as I did.\n\nI give the game a 10 out of 10 for reminding me that it’s not about graphics or physics, sound and musical score or what high priced actor lent their phoned in talent to the game play. It is about the vision and creativity of the author and I thank everyone involved for bringing this vision to life and sharing it with all of us.\n","May 29","true","13.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There are many skill bars but not so much that it feels overwhelming or plagued my numbers at an point. The story is engaging and wraps up well by the end. Romances are somewhat earned, and while given scenes aren't the focus. You get a good feeling of customisation with your character while playing. The decisions feel like they have unique consequences even if the storyline is linear overall. There's a sense of danger as your character can fall before the end of the game. Everything works very well, except maybe that characters don't get explored deeply enough and are instead rather two dimensional. And of course, I wish the game overall was long.\n\nI've played it several times since I brought it last night and reccomend it to fans of the genre, particularily if you like pirates.

Not one akin to say Uncharted Waters or Sid Meier's Pirates, definitely not alike the Monkey Island series either. Simply put, Choice of the Pirate places you in a slightly magical pirate world where you're dropped into the action in the midst of ship-to-ship combat. Your choices boost certain stats, allow for certain events to happen, etc..\n\nSo far, you might think it not very different from other choice of games, but this one has its unique features. True, not every single choice has a huge impact, such as the cosmetic ones for your flag and article of clothing... But most do influence things delicately. And the storyline has quite a bit of humor in it.\n\nGood points-Good story\n-Good replay value\n-Ghost Ships\n-Many paths to walk\n-Interesting NPC's\n-Good integration of magic into the setting\n\nBad points-Somewhat few NPC's to romance/etc.\n-Not that long, a playthrough can last 1 hour +/-\n-Does have some Deus ex Machina plot devices\n\nSpecial mentions-You can work 7 years in front of the mast for a mr. Jones in one ending.\n-Befriending inhumans and magic users really helps.\n\nConclusionFor the price Steam asks, this is definitely a good game to buy.\nThe author's done a fine job on immersion and plot, though\nof course there's still room for improvement here and there.\nIf you haven't ever played a text game though, or if previous\nchoice of games disappointed you, then try the demo first.","May 21","true","2.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I mean I am the Butt Pirate, I need the option for me to ♥♥♥♥ my victims.\n\nAlso, for those wondering about the novel based on the trailer, this isn't a SJW novel that has heavy themes on gender and sexuality. Even though about half of the trailer advertises these features, it really amounts to less than 5 choices in the game. There just tiny options that don't really affect much about the game, they are not shuffed in your face like how I thought they would be.","May 21","true","5.7"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","6","15","0","2"

It goes by pretty fast, but it's offered the most in-character and fun experience of playing one of my constant characters I've ever had. If you like pirates, the sea, or anything related- 10/10, best game, exact right amount of water.","May 21","true","2.0"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","4","0","0"
