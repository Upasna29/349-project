With such a quirky name I just had to find out what it currently has to offer (the name should give you a good idea I think) and to see if it’s actually worth your hard earned digital cash (spoiler: yes, it is).\n\nGameplayIf you ever played The Ball then you pretty much know what to expect from Steamroll. The setting is different, however, and there’s a bigger focus on puzzles and smaller areas in my opinion. If you have never played that game then I shall try to explain it shortly: you control a ball (which, in turn, is controlled/powered by steam technology) and your goal is to get the ball to the end of the level while solving puzzles. That’s actually a narrow and very shortsighted explanation of the game and saying this in general wouldn’t do the game justice so let me use the next few paragraphs to explain it all better and in a bit more detail.\n\nSo generally you control the ball by generating steam, which in turn pushes you forward. There’s a meter on the left side of the screen that shows how much you can still generate and once it’s empty it’s game over. So you have to balance how and when you use it and cannot just keep the button pressed.\nYou will have to move the ball across (homemade) platforms, while pressing buttons (usually in the form of a puzzle) and blowing things up (which also usually appears in the form of a puzzle).\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=527495816\nAbout these last two points: on the right side of the screen you have your ‘controls’ UI (which could use some work, though). There are specific parts in the levels where you can install the ball and change into a shooting form. From that point of view you can then move the camera around for a better view and, more importantly, shoot balls with portable walls or bombs. It speaks for itself that the bombs blow up things like rocks (and yourself if you’re not careful enough!) and that the portable walls can be shot and installed so that you can ricochet either bombs or ‘regular’ balls off of them (usually for hitting switches).\nAlright, enough balls talk.\n\nNow for the puzzle part: the puzzles are nicely balanced, and while there are a few complex(er) puzzles most of them can be solved fairly quick. The levels generally only last between 5-30 minutes, by the way. And while you sometimes might get stuck on a puzzle they can most of the times be solved with some logical thinking. Thus far it always required a mix of setting up bombs and walls while hitting switches and physically moving around.\nThe camera is a bit low during the static puzzle scenes and I sometimes couldn’t clearly see what I was doing. Some puzzles also depend on trial-and-error gameplay, but this is limited fortunately.\n\nSo that was all good stuff. I’m afraid there were also one thing that influenced my experience negatively, with the first being performance issues. There was enormous slowdown in one section where I had to try a part again and again. The game would drop below <5fps and sometimes it would restore itself after a minute or so, but one time it didn’t fully respond anymore and the only option was to ‘hard’ quit the game and restart it. It doesn’t seem to be a memory leak, as far as I can judge, but it does seem to happen if you take a (very) long time somehow.\nOther things that caught my attention were the rather basic menus and the fact that when there’s a lot debris the ball doesn’t always roll the way it should (despite the ‘ball prediction’ working normally). Nothing too big - although the debris problem can cause gameplay problems - but as always it’s at least worth mentioning.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=527495790\nAudio & VisualsThe music of the game is kind of peaceful, considering the setting. I expected something with a few more beats but I personally liked it. It also tries to keep your attention on the game itself: there are plenty of games out there with music so loud and in-your-face that I ultimately start to focus more on the music than on the game itself, which is never a good thing. So: ultimately it was a good choice here.\n\nGraphically the game can be considered simple. With simple I mean it’s not overly complex. You can clearly see the details in everything and all of it is nicely modeled, but the levels are very similar to each other and there’s nothing in it that will ‘wow’ you. I agree with you if you say that games are not only about graphics (it’s a cliché argument, though), but I do think it’s usually a combination of the two (with the second being the actual gameplay). So don’t expect any bells and whistles here, but there are plenty of options that can be turned on or up to make the game look even prettier.\n\nLength/Replay ValueFirst of all: don’t expect a really lengthy game here: the Early Access version currently includes 10 levels, and this is including two levels that act as a tutorial. The levels are rather short. A full playthrough should take you about 4-7 hours I think (max), and this includes puzzles where you might get stuck for a few or tens of minutes. Considering the price it is good value, but like many other puzzle games there isn’t much incentive to replay it again once you’re done. So I hope the developer will gradually release more content to keep players occupied and, of course, to test if everything works as it should.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=527495869\nConclusionSteamroll is a good example of Early Access done right. It’s not the biggest or most spectacular game out there but it definitely has its heart in the right place. The setting is done very well, but despite that it certainly would’ve been nice to see a little more variety in its levels. The puzzles are balanced well and everyone should be able to play through it without getting (too) frustrated. It’s a little light on content right now, but I was told the game will offer at least twice as many levels in the full and final release of the game. With that and its current quality in mind I expect that it will be nothing less than a fun, solid game of at least equal quality during the beginning of 2016, when it will release in its final form.\n\nToo long, didn’t readPros:\n+ Nice Steampunk vibe\n+ ‘Simple’ but effective graphics\n+ Tight, solid controls (with controller)\n+ Puzzles are generally nicely balanced\n\nMixed:\n+/- Sometimes it randomly drops to <5 frames\n+/- Menus are still a little basic\n+/- ‘Shooting form’ UI could use some work\n\nCons:\n- Camera angle during static puzzles\n- Some trial and error puzzles\n\nPlease note: a Steam key for this game was provided by the developer.\nRating: 7.6 (out of 10)\n\nWant to read more of my unbiased reviews?

The game has a steampunk theme which ties in nicely with the mechanics of the entire experience. Above is a short video of gameplay, and below are my initial thoughts on the game and purchasing recommendations.\n\nTheHiddenLevels.com was provided a preview copy of Steamroll by Antico and for that we thank them.\n\nThere is a sense of humor to this game that had me laughing within ten minutes of rolling my ball around. I blew up an entire mineshaft and the operator of my ball reacted appropriately, which I found hilarious and genuine. The gameplay reminds me of a childhood classic in Marble Madness with a slight twist. There are a few hiccups with audio and video that I found, but beyond that this is a solid title with real potential for replay especially if it becomes steam workshop capable after release.\n\nI had to stop and really consider a couple of the puzzles and as you can see in the video, I make mistakes like blocking a follow up shot with a piece of my solution. I found that aspect to be satisfying, and the puzzle completions felt like an accomplishment. There are new mechanics added in as you progress and they really are unique. You can change your steamball to be a wall or bomb early on, and those options in conjunction with one another make up your potential solutions.\n\nThe only downside I could find is there are a few graphic and audio stutters here and there, and certain aspects need some finishing touches. That is to be expected from an early access game so I can't see any reason not to pick this one up if you enjoy puzzle games, or were ever a fan of the old Nintendo game "Marble Madness". I personally enjoy this type of game mechanic and motif so this once hit a home run for me.\n\nThanks for watching and reading. Check out www.thehiddenlevels.com for news and reviews.

I’ll admit that I didn’t get particularly far in the game but what I did experience was very much enjoyable. Maybe eventually I’ll even be able to make it deeper into the mines to uncover whatever mysteries lay below and to rescue any trapped miners. Until then, though, I might need a map…or walkthrough.\n\nhttp://cliqist.com/2015/10/16/steamroll-perseveres-despite-failed-kickstarter/","October 28, 2015","true","2.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

I specially liked all the elements introduced on the first levels, the available steamballs and the game mechanics available so far.\n\nAs they said on their Greenlight and Kickstarter campaigns, a lot of attention has gone into creating a beautiful environment, both on graphics and music, which makes it really inmersive to play. Too bad to miss the opportunity for downloadable soundtrack and artbook from the kickstarter rewards.\n\nSome parts of the game are indeed still unpolished, like the menu system and maybe some of the transitions between levels, but that is very likely to get more love as the game progresses.\n\nSince some of the first levels are a tutorial, i ended up really looking forward for harder and harder levels. On one of the levels I got stuck and the mix of frustration and "Ohhhhh dammit" moment just left me waiting for the next challenge. Some of the levels get crazier and crazier, and feels like the developers are trying to tell us their plans for the future.\n\nThere were also a lot of ideas on the Greenlight campaign like a co-op mode, so I'm really looking forward to seeing what this game might become.\n\n\nDisclaimer: A key for the game was provided by the developer, as I helped beta test for early access.","October 1, 2015","true","8.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

If you're a fan of physics based puzzle games then this is well worth a look, particuarly if you enjoy the steampunk theme.\n\nThe gameplay has an interesting mix of turret based "pinball" shooting combined with a movement mechanic (I'd call it light platforming without jumping if that makes sense). While the sections focused on movement are not the most enjoyable parts of the games they are integrated into the puzzles in a manner that's more integrated into the puzzle than the simple "clear a path to the exit" that you get in a lot of puzzle games.\n\nMy primary complaint with this is probably the length. I was able to complete the entire game (including achievements) in just 7 hours the first time through. I'm not opposed to short games in general but the problem with short puzzle games  (including steamroll) is that a short game means that you don't really get a chance to build up a repetoire of tactics that you can use in future puzzles. That's particuarly noticeable here, each level feels completly different and for the most part strategys and tactics that work on one have very little impact on another.\n\nNow saying "each level feels different" does sound like an odd complaint but for a puzzle game I like it when later levels build upon skills and tactics that have been taught and used in earlier levels because it generally means that the puzzles have a greater level of depth to them. Steamroll doesn't really have that, each level and to some degree even each turret spot has a single, relatively unique solution to it that probably won't come up again.\n\nOverall though this is still a solid game. The gameplay is fun, the plot is decent and the artwork is solid.","May 1","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
