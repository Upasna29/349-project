Unfortunately the LUCK factor is very prominent. There's only so much you can do with 'good tactics' .\nStill I have enjoyed this simple board game very much. The mechanics are working as they should and the graphics are suitably subdued.\nPerfect game to spend your inbetween hours on.","December 8, 2015","true","1.6"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","23","25","2","1"

It was created by Egyptians in a tech park ("smart village") outside of Cairo, Egypt.\n\nThe second video on the store page shows some of the gameplay. The game is quite similar to backgammon, except you're playing in the same direction, and a blockade (sort of) is formed by two or more pawns in sequence - there's never more than one pawn on any space of the board. The game provides little backstory. It is a single player against AI (3 levels of difficulty) or hot-seat two-player gameplay. The game runs fine even on older computers.\n\nThe pieces move across the board in a Z-shapes path, i.e. right on the top row, left on the center row, then right on the bottom row; your aim is to move all of your pieces off the board before your opponent does. Since there can never be more than one piece on any square, you can generally only move to unoccupied squares; you can also swap position with an opponent's pawn if it has no other pawn adjacent to protect it. Your "dice" are 4 sticks colored red and white; the number of whites is your roll, but if you have all red, that counts as 5. You get to roll again on any 1,4 or 5, as often as they keep occurring; play switches to your opponent as soon as you roll a 2 or 3 and make your move. To reduce swapping in the endgame, every pawn needs to reach the 5th to last square (with the paddles), from there, a 5 moves it off the board, 4,3 and 2 move it to end squares where it needs to stay until moved off the board with a throw of 1, 2 or 3 respectively; and a 1 (which must be taken if no other pawn is movable) moves it to the water square, which moves it up a row to the rebirth ankh, or if that's occupied, to the first unoccupied square before it; the same thing happens to pawns that get swapped out on the end squares. Strategy is generally to keep your stones grouped (any group of two or more is safe from swapping), preventing the opponent from forming groups and setting your own stones back, while trying to swap his own stones back.\n\nI'd say that games are faster than backgammon because pawns that get "hit" don't move back as much; and the strategy is slightly easier, for the same reason. The rules are easy to pick up because the game marks all of your pieces that have legal moves.\n\nIf you plan to play against a friend, I'd recommend the tablet version (iOS or Android) since that's more comfortable than hotseat on a PC (the board is probably too small for a smartphone screen though); but there's nothing wrong with the Steam version. You're getting a simple board game, no bells and whistles; while you could easily make your own board or use a free flash version (or Tabletop Simulator for online multiplayer), this'll provide an AI to play against on your own and helps you learn the rules.","September 25, 2015","true","1.2"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","18","21","2","0"

They are still fairly easy to understand, so you don't have to worry too much. Also keep in mind that there are different difficulty settings, to suit your taste.\nOnce in game, the gameplay is simple to understand, but at the same time very fun and engaging. There's a local multiplayer mode available if you wish to share this experience with a friend.\nOn top of all of this, the design is great and accurate. The illustrations are cool and they contribute to the atmosphere of the game.\n\nOverall, I strongly recommend this game. Whether you enjoy board games or not, you will still find Egyptian Senet fun and fresh.","January 3","true","1.7"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","9","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LightFear/recommended/391580/","LightFear","NoPing[apm210]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LightFear/","20 products in account","According to the description, Seneth is an Ancient Egypt table game. Most probably, its an oldest game that requires players to use counters on the desk.\nThe idea of the game is quite similar to backgammon, as you start from the one side of the desk and the point is to move your counters to another one, while bothering your opponent to do so. However, four sticks are used instead of the rolling dice.\nIt was my first experience with the game, so I would like all novices to understand how easy it is. However, you'd have to practice and think in advance in order to become really worthy player. The rules are described in the main menu; everything is quite simple and understandable, so once you'll enter the game, you'll find out how to play fast enough.\n\nLet's move to the most important aspects of the game:\nMusic. Music in the game matches its overall appearance great and even adds some notes to its atmosphere of an Ancient Egypt. Music is calm and cute, it doesn't go boring and never bothers you while playing.\n\nGraphics. The game looks quite beautiful and nice, furthermore, enhances an atmosphere of an Ancient Egypt.The eyes don't go tired even after playing few hours in a row, so you can hold even quite long sessions with no pauses.\n\nGameplay. As I mentioned above, the game is quite easy-to-master. There is nothing complicated in controls, though it's a table game. There are few difficulty levels that make the game much more interesting.In conclusion, for those who're still not sure: if you're a fan either of Ancient Egypt theme or of table games, you'd better buy without even thinking. Refill your collection with one more exciting and interesting game and enhance your playing skills.","April 18","true","10.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

At the price this one is very unique and worth while to any game collector who likes to play something different every night. It didn't take me too long to figure out the rules. I spent a couple of hours playing before I knew it.\n\nThe only real lacking component of this game would be to polish it up a little more. The rules were plain text, though it was still easy enough to follow along. Overall good value for a different kind of game.","November 27, 2015","true","10.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

How I perceived this game whether it’s positively or negatively is entirely up to me.\n\nEgyptian Senet is a casual board game in which you have to move all of your pawns to the far end of the board. It's somewhat similar to backgammon and checkers, It is also the earliest known board game in history.\n\n\nPROS :\n\nPrice -  For what it's worth the game is pretty cheap (Less than $5)\n\nGameplay - At the start I was pretty confused on the rules and set in the game but after 5 minutes i was having fun, It's more fun and exciting if you are playing with someone since the game is designed for 2 players\n\nNo Bugs - It's no suprise that no game-breaking bug is found since it's a board game with no delicate mechanics\n\nCONS :\n\nGraphics - The game could be better if the graphics would be improved.\n\nMultiplayer - Hotseat Multiplayer is nice but i think the game's replayability can be lengthen by having a online multiplayer\n\nOverall : 7.5/10 - Egyptian Senet is great game for it's price i would recommend getting this on sale for the optimal "Bang for your Buck"\n","January 27","true","1.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
