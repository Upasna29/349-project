It's currently in early development (and it shows), but shows a lot of promise and is already fun to play. The general gameplay is divided into three parts: exploration, combat and character management.\n\nUnlike most dungeon crawlers, you don't just walk around with your character peeking around corners. If you're not currently fighting, you're presented with a simple map showing a series of connected rooms. You move by clicking the neighbouring tiles, which in turn reveals more rooms. If there's something worthwhile in a room, you'll have to fight for it. This could be items, allies, shops, healing, food, to name a few. Moving around the map eats up your Hunger stat - more on that in a moment.\n\nWhen you decide to fight, the game jumps to a 3D view of the room you're currently in. You will see your character/s, the baddies, elements of terrain, and stuff you can later click on to loot. Combat is turn-based and takes place in a classic roguelike fashion - one action at a time. Some actions are faster, some are slower, thus quickening or delaying your next turn (think "ADoM" and energy costs). All charaters have 3 floating bars at their feet, which represent Health, Stamina and time until next turn. Each weapon has two different attacks - heavy and light - which can target specific body parts, thus inflicting various flavours of boo-boo upon your enemies (and you). The specific effects of getting hit and some other actions (like running) aren't described in the game yet, but they're there, you just have to figure that stuff out by yourself.\n\nCharacter management is rather developed at this stage. You manage your Health (which keeps you alive), your Hunger (which lets you explore), and the money-thing called "Ice". If you deplete your health, you die. If your Hunger drops below a certain threshold, you suffer severe penalty to stats. Without Ice you're weak. Speaking of Ice - you gather it by killing enemies, looting stuff and disassembling items at your inventory screen. In turn, it lets you upgrade your stats and equipment. Also serves as currency when you find a shop.\n\nRecounter is in early development. That means unfinished interface (everything is accessible and usable, just a bit clunky), little variety of content, and balance issues (i.e. I cleared the first dungeon level just fine and then I got completely massacred in the first room of the second floor). The core mechanics are there, and the game is enjoyable already, which is something notable in an early-access game. Recounter is dirt cheap, costing 6 Euro (3E on sale, currently), so if you're a fan of the genre, I suggest supporting the creator. And if you're skeptical about early access, just pay close attention to the title, it may grow into something great.\n\n\nEdit: I don't know why it says i received a free key. I'm pretty sure I didn't tick the box and I bought the game myself.","May 5","true","1.2"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

It incorparates many different ways of attacking with grenades, guns, and melee weapons. You can have multiple characters in your party as well. Some things are still a little rusty, such as the lack of instructions and tutorial on what to do but it's easy enough to figure out! I reccomend checking this game out and if you're looking for a video explaining that check out this link.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/zIX6uF_MqyA\n","February 9","true","0.7"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

It had everything I loved the why you moved with the side bar. It had stuff like I loved how the movement had side tab. I would of like you using WASD to move. But I thought that feature was super cool. I also liked the where you could strike. But I wish you can add QWER as your attack powers. Their also should be an online mode I really liked the game. I would just add those things and your game will be perfect. I loved how the anmation how the charcter moves. But I felt like the charcters can move faster because I feel like thats what will fix the integrity of your game. Music is very amazing and I love it. I would love to work with you on this game with grapics with point of making them look sharper and higher quailty.\n\n#### PROS ####\nLoved How Charcters Moves\nMusic Was Amzing\nLoved the side menu were you controlled Everything\n#### CONS ####\nMoving with WASD\nVery Laggy\nAttacking with QWER\nIn discloseur I got this game in exchange for a review.\n\nFrom,\nEthan Seth Klein","March 2","true","0.2"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","6","12","2","0"
