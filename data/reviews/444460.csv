Game is broken in so many ways. I've played a lot of early access games and a lot of them were fun right off the bat from the start. This one wasn't. Playing it made me want to go to sleep and cry.","March 15","false","0.6"," 41 of 62 people (66%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","66","41","62","9","6"

It is so severely broken that you cannot progress past the first level. As soon as the second level loads you are no longer able to move. The character models are severely uncanny and should be addressed. There is little to no effective gameplay, it's mostly a walking simulator with no real difficulty. The storyline makes no sense. The voice acting is ridiculous, obviously done by the devs on cheap mics. The dialogue is broken and at times incomprehensible gibberish.\n\nThat said, I don't want to discourage the devs, certain aspects like the overall art style are very promising and the idea itself is good. Work on your character models so that they are more abstract.  Put less detail into them so that it isn't quite so jarring when they speak or move. Stylize them so that they are more unique and memorable. Hire or recruit someone with writing talent to design your plot. Hire or recruit an actor, preferably from the area you wish to set the game.  Invest in a higher quality microphone for this actor. Get a native English speaker to write your dialogue for you, and another to proof read it.\n\nAll in all, I see a lot of wasted potential in this game. I think that if it is financially feasible, the developer should move on from this project and start anew. They should work on a smaller scale, and work to their strengths and weaknesses. I look forward to seeing this company mature in the coming years.","March 17","false","0.2"," 21 of 30 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","21","30","3","0"

I Don't care what that tiny text below "about this game" says, there is no blue box saying Early Access which means this isn't Early Access as the dev decided to put it up for sale as a finished game.

If I ever manage to get the game to work and Any opinion of it changes then I'll change this but I sincerely doubt that ever happens as even the intro is poorly written and the first level is absolutely insane and has nothing of substance to it.","April 10","false","0.2"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","0"

However the game is very slow and incomplete.  The WSAD & mouse only controls are really ackward to someone who prefers to use a controller.  Movement is slow, the guy just courches and walks slowly.  Having to use a mouse to select people would have been better if all movement was controlled by the mouse.  But I'd still prefer a gamepad and opponent selection system.  Still, I waddled my way through the first level, took out the 3 guys I could see, searched them, found nothing, and didn't complete the objective.  Just seems broken / incomplete.  The only thing I like is the shadow mechanic that acts on your opponents.  The visuals, control, story, and sound are all very much a minimalist proof of concept.
