Alien Rage's chance of success, while probably never really high to begin with was only further diminished after professional critics tore the game to shreds - which is a terrible shame because underneath all the Halo/Gears of War (insert any other shooter featuring marines in space) similarities is a terribly old-school on-the-rails corridor shooter that should be appreciated more by gamers who grew up playing the original DOOM and Wolfenstein back in the early nineties.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=301430217\nSet upon a massive asteroid that has become home to both humans and an alien species who are seemingly able to co-exist jointly mining the rock for the highly efficient energy source known as Prometheum until this shaky alliance is turned on its head when all the human miners are systematically eradicated by the alien hoard. With all operations further suspended your task is to get into the mining facility and destroy it using what ever force necessary.\n\nThe game will have you battling through 14 intense (and I say intense) levels because Alien Rage was designed to be difficult. With difficulty settings starting at challenging some might find it a tad too difficult during the initial levels and I have to agree with some of the more professional reviewers that the game does suffer from some severe difficulty spikes that I could well see a person leaving the game due to frustration. Things do bed down a bit once you start unlocking perks which can then be applied to your character such as 50% less damage from projectiles (which I found incredibly handy because at the start of the game any alien shooting projectile damage towards my character would instantly result in his death). The game does use a checkpoint system to save the game and thankfully they are not used sparingly so as difficult as the game can get sometimes the player should be able to make steady progress. Alien Rage features a leaderboard and uses score modifiers so the more headshots and destructible environmental damage you cause the higher your score.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=288804235\nAlien Rage was developed using the trusty Unreal Engine 3 and it shows in some of the games more unique underground mining settings. While plenty of reviewers were quick to point out that the player runs through an endless labyrinthine of generic levels, I have to disagree. Yes while some level design is often repeated throughout the 14 scenarios presented I found some of the levels particularly striking as I stood still for a few seconds just to take in the sights and sounds. Alien Rage can really be quite the looker for the most part and if you don't believe me just run on over and take a squizz at the screenshots I have posted for the game.\n\nIf I do have some slight gripes it's that of all the weapons presented I found only a handful of them were really effective which forced me to discard experimenting with various weapons early on in game because most of what is needed to see yourself safely execute this mission is presented from the get-go. The games boss battles are also a source of frustration. They are long and tedious fights of attrition and often you will find you have run out of ammo which results in you having to fall back on your weaker arsenol such as your pistol - which while still effective - only end up dragging the boss fights on longer than need be because of the smaller damage they do. Most bosses go through two or more phases during a fight which is is where the frustrating aspect rears its ugly head because should you die during the bosses second or third phase you are doomed to repeat everything from the beginning. One particular boss fight near the end of the game really had me on the verge of a rage-fit but thankfully a step away from the game for a while was all that was needed.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=297264842\nChallenging and sometimes incredibly frustrating - Alien Rage is not going to appeal to everyone but if you looking for a solid run and gun shooter that refuses to hold your hand then Alien Rage may just be the game for you. Despite its failings I still ended up really enjoying my time with the game which is a lot more than I can say for other recently released AAA titles in this genre. If you are not prepared to pay the full price of $19.99 ( I got the game in a bundle deal for less that $4) then I can heartily recommend you pick it up during a Steam sale.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","August 17, 2014","true","16.6"," 79 of 102 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","79","102","0","8"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sysg3n/recommended/217920/","Sysg3n","Sysgen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sysg3n/","4616 products in account","A fun but flawed first person shooter.  AI has shown the capability to flank however the appearance of rushing the player is apparent.  Aliens do have the ability to melee as well as stasis the player so I won't hold AI rushing against the game.  Aliens can and do flank though they are not the brightest bulbs and will get themselves killed rather easily when isolated.   Boss fights are numerous but straight forward not showing much imagination.\n\nThe game has three difficulty modes each increasing in challenge.  I started with the middle difficulty but initially my life lasted as long as a Gastrotrich, so normal it was as my mood was for limiting restarts as much as possible given the game's propensity to kill you.\n\nStory elements in the form of recordings are spread around the levels but I only found one third of the content. Whether I missed their obvious placement by chance or because they were hidden is unknown though the story can be ignored from the small portion I heard.  Bonus mini pyramids are also strewn about, three per level but again I never completed a set.  The pyramids add to your score as Alien Rage awards points during game-play and includes leader-boards as well.\n\nSecondary ammo is also strewn about.  They look like suitcases so they aren't hard to miss although initially I wasn't sure what they were which brings us to the weapons.  An important part of any shooter.   The weapons are imaginative.  You get to carry only two plus a revolver.  There is a high reliance on secondary fire in order to implement much needed crowd control.  Primary ammo is picked up through gun pick ups as a dropped gun retains it's ammo or by walking over the same gun as you possess.   Weapons in the game consist of both alien and human.  Human weapons consist of differing semi automatic rifles, a sniper rifle, mentioned revolver, shotgun and rocket launcher.  Sounds and reads standard however each weapon has an important secondary fire mode as mentioned.\n\nThe rocket launcher, for example, when equipped will affect your sprinting ability and to use or un-equip the launcher the full animation must be run through making the weapon a bit strategic and difficult to use, a welcome feature considering the weapon's ability to quickly change the battlefield.  Which reminds me of enemy hit-boxes which I found to be well implemented.  I can remember shooting a rocket through enemy legs and cursing myself for lack of careful aiming.\n\nThe alien arsenal consists of energy weapons and is somewhat more limited.  No rocket launcher for example but the weapons are fun to use.  The alien rifle for instance has no reloads, however the weapon will overheat, again ensuring the player makes strategic use of the weapon.  The alien shotgun is very cool and very powerful, the cool anti gravity  secondary fire helps immensely.  To summarize the S in FPS, the shooting is exceptional, it's explosive and fun.\n\nSome reviewers have panned the levels as being too generic.  So what.  The game looks and sounds great.  You feel Alien Rage, your feel of the game, both visual and auditory is significant.  Many of the levels have nice set pieces and it's great to see a publisher like City Interactive enable their development team to build a game with strong immersive environmental elements.  Great explosions not only permeate the combat but play a central role.  Graphically the game is exceptional though performance will vary but not enough to detract from the game.\n\nLastly I will address the utter disaster that is the Alien Rage checkpoint system.   Wait, it is not a system.  Systems by definition imply some sort of systematic routine.  No, the check-pointing, no, make that the checkpoint restart logic in Alien Rage is not just buggy.   I've come to the conclusion that it is unfinished.  There is no other reason for checkpoint restarts missing assets, many of which will prevent you from continuing the game.  Explosives for blowing apart levels to continue, needed secondary ammunition for combat , platforms not reset so you're left looking like a shopper waiting for a mall elevator.\n\nI've found that after each death, instead of using the checkpoint continue, I had to exit to the main menu and continue from there.  It is beyond my wildest imagination how the developers obviously knowing that there checkpoint restart system was broken could not of just rewired their checkpoint code to use the continuation logic from the main menu.  From the continue on the main menu the game loaded correctly every time.  As the game loads very fast,  circumventing the intended method for checkpoint restarts is not a significant issue.\n\nIf you enjoy a good FPS then Alien Rage presents itself as a very challenging fun FPS that will satisfy most any FPS urge.","January 8, 2015","true","17.3"," 52 of 63 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","52","63","0","7"

The hardest difficulty will kick your ♥♥♥ and is probably nearly impossible to beat. This game is not for newcomers to the genre or for casual players.\n-Too linear.

Bugs, inconsistent framerate issues, slowdowns, glitches - the game had it all. I gave up on it and decided to wait.\nTurns out it was well worth it.\nDevelopers listened to all complaints and did honorable job by fixing most of of the issues this game had at launch. Now after 3 months I fired it up and was pleased with the results.\nGame is not even close to being Old School FPS, that it wants to be, but it's still pretty challenging and fun to play. You got your usual stuff, machineguns, shotguns, one very overpowered pistol with unlimited ammo, few alien equalents of said guns, few perks that you can unlock by playing the game and racking up score, you can jump (even though it's only there for laughs), crouch, sprint and slide after sprinting. Graphics are nice, sounds are okay, weapons are pretty cool and have their own secondary firemode and story... well, it's there, but it's nothing special to write home about.\nYou should definitely pick up the demo and see for yourself, but I enjoyed it alot and now that it has been pretty much patched it's pretty good.\n\nNote: Difficulty in this game is something else. I play it on normal and I had my moments when I literally wanted to rip my guts out because of the sometimes really, REALLY unfair challenges and punishing difficulty. But on the other hand, it made it so much more fun and rewarding.

The description makes it look and sound like a Bulletstorm clone. Bulletstorm is awesome, but this one... this one is not. There's a variety of moves you can pull off which result in you earning points. Make a headshot and you'll earn a certain amount of points, destroy enemies using explosions and it'll earn you points as well. Well, you get the picture, right ? There aren't enough moves to keep you going so after a while it becomes tiresome and the joy of earning points diminishes.\n\nThe levels and enemies are fairly detailed and the whole game looks pretty good, especially considering the price they ask for it.\n\nThankfully, it's also a pretty short game. Finishing it will take you about 6 hours overall. More than enough if you ever decide to give this a try. There are so many difficulty spikes that it becomes more frustrating than fun halfway through the game. I don't know who programmed this AI but it's terribly unbalanced.\n\nAnd even though it's not the best game out there it definitely had some good moments. I just wish there were more of those...

I found it very hard to follow the story due to the only source of it coming from a fifteen second intro on each level, but my guessing is that the devs weren't intending for the story to be the main attraction to this game.\n\nAs you battle through the 14 increasingly hard levels, you encounter lots of different types of enemies and scenarios which will probably kill you over and over again until you finally work out the optimal way around. I started out playing on a controller but it quickly became apparent that a keyboard and mouse were needed because this game is brutal.

Crisp graphics using the Unreal Engine, aliens attacking you at every turn, massive explosions, an Unreal Tournament style announcer when you achieve special kills, simple story line, etc. I almost want to call this game underrated as I picked it up in a bundle and to me it seems better than what one would expect to find in a bundle.

This game went under the radar for me.I bought it recently, and I’m very glad I did.\n\nDespite the corny jokes, thin story and character development, Alien Rage represents a throwback to the roots of first person shooters. It stands on its own and proves that you don’t need a great plot to justify the fact that you’re just shooting aliens in the face.\n\nThat said, the story intrigued me at first. In a time where Earth is facing an energy and financial crysis, humankind discovers a resource called Promethium, which is able to produce enormous amounts of energy. Shortly after settling down and beginning mining operations, an alien race appears. Despite the initial cooperation between the two, things go south real fast. Thus, it is your job to make sure that the enemy can’t get their hands on this precious resource. What better way is there to do that than killing and blowing up everything in that forsaken asteroid?\n\nThe game is ridiculously hard on maximum difficulty, so only consider playing on it if you’re a masochist or a godlike player. I played on  Hard setting until the very last boss. There I changed to Normal because it was too frustrating after dying many times.\n\nPros:10 unique weapons, each with two different fire modes\nEach weapon feels authenthic and satisfying to use\nUnlockable perks, such as more ammunition and more weapon damage\nDecent enemy variety\nMemorable and challenging boss fights\nVisually the game still looks pretty good (it uses Unreal Engine 3)\nRewards exploration with tokens that grant you points and audio logs, which reveal the events before the game\nSkill and accuracy is rewarded with more points\nNeutral:Regenerating health. This might appeal to some people, while to others it might be a big negative.\nIt is an on-rails shooter with a very linear campaign\nCons:Somewhat short, took me around 6 hours to beat it\nOnline multiplayer is dead\nThe story started out nicely, but quickly fell apart and became bland\nOverall experience:\n\nAlien Rage - Unlimited is an hectic and frantic shooter, and it was refreshing. It is one of those games that stands out in an era where most FPS take place in a modern or near future setting. The gunplay is extremely satisfying and you’re able to pick between sticking with human or alien weapons. Despite the fact that what you mostly do is gun down aliens, there are some memorable moments, such as boss fights and when your character starts screaming while you’re unloading a minigun clip. I highly recommend Alien Rage to any fans of first person shooters. It is well worth your time!\n\nRating:\n\nI’d rate Alien Rage - Unlimited a solid 8/10.\n\nWant more recommendations?

The moment it got cheaper (50 %) I bought it and have to admit that I got excellent fast-arcade-first-person-shooter-experience. If you have 3d vision you should definitely try the game as it looks excellent and immerses you straight ahead (make sure using helix-fix). I understand the critics that the level design is somewhat linear and may get boring after a while, but overall I would say for 7 hours first play through I never felt annoyed by the same kind of levels, actually I had fun until the end and the bosses are epic, are huge and afford a little bit effort in tactics - not a lot so that you won't get bothered fast. I would love to say sth to the Multiplayer, but it is not possible for the reason that no one plays it. Overall I'll give it a 7/10 which is very high on my scale. Check it definitely out if you play 3d vision. If you don't, you should get it when it's cheap. It still has a great design, great gunfights, great achievement system, and much fun!","January 7, 2014","true","10.9"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","0"

That's it, no more, no less. It's YOU.SHOOT.STUFF.PERIOD. type of game. You are accompanied by great gunplay that makes shooting so awesome, as every weapon feels incredibly good. Weapons are not sophisticated ( rather standard ) but they dont need to, as they look, sound and shoot awesome, even basic pistol is great. Story is nice and simplistic, just enough to keep you going. Level design looks very good as you pass through diffrent sections of the game, it has all one dominant overall metal/rock blue/gray theme to it, but it all looks great and feels "big" at the same time, but I cant say especially which levels especially, to avoid spoilers.\nIt is a FAST run & gun game where you have to be aggresive, but mindlessly running in the middle of the group of enemies will get you killed.\nIt is a HARD game : don't touch BRUTAL difficulty mode if you are a casual player, at least not at first, because it is not "casual-hard" you might expect from other games nowadays, it indeed is BRUTALLY HARD ( don't worry, it's still totally manageable on CHALLENGING or HARD difficulty modes).\nSounds are good and music sets you in the right mood. Music especially that sounded somehow similar to Unreal 2 ( which is a good thing ).\nGame seems to actually utilise all cpu cores and runs butter-smooth on my old core2quad@3.4 ghz and gtx 570.\nComparing this game to similar in it's genre that I played recently : Hard Reset and Fear 1 ; and considering overall fun from shooting part ( or shooting mechanics if you will ), Alien Rage is definitely on par with these two. No nano-suit here, or other fancy stuff. Only thing it has is the SYSTEM OF PERKS that adds to the gameplay ( bigger ammo clips, bigger health & armor, overpowered insta-kill pistol [very cool!] ). In fact, Alien Rage has nice replay value, and overall is one of the best "honest" simple shooter fps games that I ever played. I finished the game on "hard" mode, loved to bits, and would definitely recommend to give it a try.","December 2, 2013","true","44.7"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

Sure, the game looks great, and feels great, at times- but with only one type of environment, this gets repetitive quite fast. The score feature is kinda neat, albeit unneeded. I can look past the linear almost nonexistant story, that's not what I got the game for. I got the game for a solid shooter. I did not get a solid shooter.\n\nThe game suffers from poor movement mechanics than end up feeling more clunky as time goes on. Your crosshair bobs up and down and sways as you move- you could argue it adds realism, but for an unrealistic game that is trying to be an arcade/arena shooter? Not needed- only frustrating. You apparently also cannot run while shooting, and jumping needs more of an impulse- things even at hip height that you should be able to jump over, you cannot. You'd think this game would have some kind of cover system, but it does not- you can only hide behind things and hope that cheap explosives or minigun shells won't noclip it. (This happens quite a bit, btw.)\n\nThe AI is horrible and half the time they are only standing completely still firing shots at you. Enemies only really feel challenging when they are using an overpowered weapon. The game only saves during checkpoints- which wouldn't be so bad if there were more of them, but instead they should 2 or 3 huge encouters at you before each one.\n\nBosses soak up damage like a sponge and fire instagib shots at you rapidly, over and over. But otherwise have pretty boring moves or mechanics- boss fights basically become a game of cover and shoot, for the next 5 minutes. It's not hard, its just annoying. And dying to one shot because you weren't 100% covered, and having to replay the last boring 5 minutes, feels like a collasal waste of time.\n\nThere is nothing really good to say about the game, other than it looks really good. It's challenging, but not in the right ways. The mechanics are boring. The AI is boring. The story is not interesting. I much rather play through the original Unreal, Half Life, or Doom, or Quake... than have to play this game again. I'm an old shooter vet. I've seen other shooter vets promote this game. I guess the only difference between me and them is...

I found a keycode for it online super cheap and figured it'd be worth a try. Can't get too burnt when it's only $5 right? Having played the Xbox 360 version, I can say this is definitely an improvement in many ways. For starters, the PC version runs significantly smoother with even better graphics and it even has online multiplayer functionality. Steam only has me logged in at around half an hour of play time on the PC version but I've played the game quite a bit on Xbox.\n\nBasically the game is an homage to old-school shooters but with fancy new graphics and such. If you've played Doom or Quake, you've played this game already (not that that's a bad thing by any means.) It's a simplistic FPS title with a nice variety in guns and some halfway-decent AI, but linear in its narrative. Don't expect anything spectacular, however. As far as gameplay goes it's pretty standard fare, but for a budget shooter it's presented nicely. Firefights can be fun and engaging and the game has a points system very similar to Bulletstorm where different types of kills will net you a variety of points/combos/etc.\n\nSound and level design are okay-- again, don't expect AAA quality. Mostly just trudging through hallways, picking up ammo, dispatching enemies, etc. Boss fights were slightly more interesting. Voice acting is just awful but it makes the game really funny.\n\nHaven't played much multiplayer, don't think there's a big fanbase for the game right now (and it's a little over a year old.)\n\nIf you can take this game for a little more than face value and appreciate it despite its shortcomings, you have at least a halfway decent FPS.\n\n8/10\n\n","September 14, 2014","true","1.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I finally quit in frustration after repeating the same sequence of battles over and over and over again; every time I die I respawn at a checkpoint that forces me to repeat, yet again, an overly long sequence of areas to fianlly reach the room I can't beat, at which point I die and start over. If I turn the difficulty down, the game is too easy and no longer any fun. Why couldn't the developers either allow saving or at least place checkpoints close enough together so that players don't have to play the same frustrating sequence so many times?","June 10, 2014","false","5.2"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","9","15","0","0"

The pistol, in particular, is awesome and a huge amount of fun to use.\n-OK weapon variety\n-You can move quickly\n\nTHE BAD\n\n-Entirely linear. There are a few times when it opens up into slightly larger rooms but they are still just rooms with one entrance and one exit.\n\n-Monotonous visual design, which makes it even more boring. The visual design in a game can sometimes alleviate the boredom brought on by linearity, but here every level looks the same, which makes it worse.\n\n-Frequent bad checkpointing. The game itself isn't as hard as it's cracked up to be. I played it on the easiest difficulty because I had heard the hype about how hard it is, and that was a mistake. I didn't die that much. Most bosses I didn't die at all. (The game wasn't compelling enough for me to give it another playthrough on a higher difficulty.) However, when I did die, I usually re-spawned right back into the middle of a firefight and immediately died again before I was able to get to cover. C'mon developers, checkpoint placing is a really basic thing, how did you screw it up?\n\n-There just isn't enough playstyle variety to make the Bulletstorm-esque style points system interesting. You can get headshots, explosion kills, and kill streaks. That's it. If you're going to make a style points system in your game you have to at least give you more than two basic combat methods.\n\n-Terrible performance. I have an i5-3470, GTX 970, 16GB ram, and a 144Hz monitor. On medium/high settings I can sometimes get 144 FPS solid, but at other times it tanks down to 40 FPS for no apparent reason. Even locked 144 FPS or locked 60 FPS feels pretty bad and stuttery, so it seems like the game has wildly erratic frame times. Games should feel smooth at 60+ FPS and when they don't that's because the game engine blows at regulating frame time varience, which is pretty basic stuff for any competent developer.\n\nOverall it's just got too many problems to recommend. If not for the performance issues, I would recommend it as a sub-$5 buy for FPS fans as it's a decent enough mindless romp, but the performance problems are unpleasant enough to put it solidly in the "don't buy" category.","November 8, 2015","false","6.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game has some problems too.\n\nCons\nBullets seem to hit you whether or not the enemy is shooting. They'll just stand up and you'll start getting a damage indicator. Makes it really hard to recover.\n'Bosses' are way to similar. They just get slightly bigger or have slightly more health. Only the last boss was kind of fun to fight and I'm not even sure how it died. I wasn't even shooting at it when it did die.\nThe enemy ai is literally r3tard3d. Not figuratively. LITERALLY. They take cover behind a barricade. They then get up and SPRINT to another barricade, then INSTANTLY get back up and start sprinting to ANOTHER barricade. Like wtf is happening!\nThe dialouge is poor. It's just bad. It either sounds strange because no one in the world would say it or it's in a spot that doesn't fit at all.\nThe difficulty system is strange. I played on normal which is the easiest mode and I still died a ton. Don't get me wrong, I like a challenge, but I like a fair challenge. Enemies have pin point accuracy and will follow you everywhere. Ducking behind barricades doesn't help at all as explosions go through everything so you're always getting hit by something.\nEnviornments are super similar. I know you're on an asteroid in a mining facility but COME ON! Nearly every room looks exactly the SAME!\nReally short game. Took about 4 hours for me to beat.\nPros\nDecent graphics.

I can't say much for the lower difficulties, but this is definitely a good game to pick up if you're looking for something to put your FPS skills to the test.\nThe graphics are simply amazing for a game produced by a smaller team, and the guns handle really well. It has a few flaws that might be difficult to overlook, such as explosions killing you in one hit and going through boxes as though they weren't there, but there's nothing really game-breaking. The bosses are unique, each with a general strategy and set of moves that you can eventually figure out.\nIf you're able to power through a game like Dark Souls, ignoring the deaths as you persue your goal to master the game, then this is right up your alley.","December 4, 2013","true","9.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

This is a shame, because it was close to being a surprise hit.\n\nThe shooting feels great and there's some variety in weapons, but you're restricted tactically by the 3 weapon carry limit. The game has regenerating health, which I've never liked. However, the enemy AI is VERY aggressive, they don't just sit back and let you hide behind a crate until back on full health, so its not as bad as some other games. Level design is very linear, and full of corridors blocked off by tiny objects that you're not allowed to jump over.\n\nThe story actually has some depth. You're the standard tough guy space marine sent into a mineral processing facility that is under attack by hordes of aliens. But I got the feeling that the aliens might not be the ones who started the conflict and I was interested to find out more. Unfortunately, most of the back story is told through collectable audio logs, and I missed a few of them so I couldn't fully understand what happened. Its also one of those games where friendlies talk over comms while you're in combat. Note to games industry: if I'm busy trying to stay alive, I'M NOT LISTENING TO THIS. Let me secure the area before you talk to me.\n\nThere's a basic perk system, but its not implemented particularly well. You earn points for killing aliens and when you reach certain score milestones you unlock some perks, but I honestly didn't even know I'd unlocked the first tier until I was browsing my achievements on the steam page.\n\nAround the middle of the game for a couple of levels I hit lots of frustrating difficulty spikes, until I reached the third perk tier and unlocked "50% more health". After that the difficulty felt correct again, which tells me that the perk/score system isn't properly balanced (I needed to unlock that perk about an hour earlier). The frustration of those couple of levels was also increased by the checkpoint only save system.\n\nThere's alot of immersion breaking HUD clutter, including waypoint markers (which are absolutely unforgivable and unnecessary considering the linearity of the level design), a massive score counter in the top corner (why not just update me at the end of the level?) and frequent popups regarding events like "headshot" or "double kill" along with an Unreal Tournament style voice announcer.\n\nNo complaints from a technical point of view. Graphics are quite pretty, framerate is mostly stable, weapon sounds are decent, voice acting isn't the best but I've heard worse. Didn't experience any significant bugs or crashes. Mouse and keyboard works great and you can fully rebind all keys.\n\nI sound like I'm being very critical, its not a terrible game, but without these annoyances it could have been really great. I would recommend it to serious fans of the FPS genre, but also bear in mind that I finished in under 7 hours so its probably best to wait for a sale.\n","December 15, 2013","true","10.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/excruciate/recommended/217920/","excruciate","Excruciate","http://steamcommunity.com/id/excruciate/","717 products in account","Just know that before I say anything, the last boss fight in this game completely ruins the entire game. It is without question the worst final boss fight I have ever had the misfortune of playing. I had previously said the last boss in Cavestory+ was the worst but this one beats that by infinity.\n\nEdit: it wasn't even the last boss but the boss right before last lol. I used to be able to proudly say that since I've been playing PC games since around 1997, I have not ever once in my life had to download a trainer for a game to cheat until now, and I have played them all. Not literally of course, but I have played a countless amount of games. Yes the next to last boss is that horrible. And after I beat him, I just was so tired of this headache of a game that I didn't bother turning the trainer off and finished the last boss and the game with it on. I could tell that the last boss was just as horrible as the one before it.\n\nThis game uses the same control feel and engine as the game Bulletstorm. Even the main assault rifle is the same and the main voice actor is the same guy from that game as well. The main difference between the two games is that this game is very sub-par and Bulletstorm is a good game and a cult favorite.\n\nUnless you have some good twitch style gaming skills you will be doing parts over and over again. I am a pretty solid oldschool twitch gamer and I was redoing parts a lot. This is without question the hardest FPS I have ever played and I wouldn't say that it is hard in a fair way which is unfortunate for this game and is its only real major downfall. It is hard for no other reason whatsoever other than it floods you with enemies and your guy can quite literally only take a slight few bullets then lights out. Two or three bullet hits puts you in red-screen heartbeat mode then one or two more hits and you are dead. Possibly the worst are snipers that can kill you in two shots and their sniper rifles can fire about 4 times a second. You can barely pop out of cover to shoot them so good luck with that. No single cover spot in the game is safe: you will get killed by a grenade shot or aliens will run up to you with super speed and use a melee stun move and you will get shot to death in two seconds or less while you are stunned. So far the first two boss fights are among some of the worst I have ever seen. They are not fun in any way, just getting a boss' life down low then dying over and over and over again is not fun. This first boss is only beatable by staying behind a pillar and fire/hide the whole time i.e. not fun. The second boss you can only dmg him when you explode a tank next to him and other than that you are exposed and will be constantly hit by him and die repeatedly. Enemy weapons fire a near constant laser stream of bullets at you and can even destroy your cover leaving you exposed. Another major downfall of the game: it punishes you incredibly hard when you die, making you replay large sessions, killing dozens of aliens over again. You can be doing really well, clearing an area of a swarm of aliens that takes what feels like an eternity, then one alien can just inexplicably finish you off or take you out entirely on his own, forcing you to redo a ♥♥♥♥ load of work by way of respawn at often poorly placed checkpoints. So like I said, if you have some good oldschool twitch FPS skills then you will not have a huge amount of trouble with it, but you will for sure have at least some trouble no matter who you are. And all of this I have said is on the second difficulty out of three possible. It goes from 'challenging', to 'hard', then 'brutal'. As incredibly hard as it is now, I have no desire to ever try it on 'brutal'. If skill was involved then sure but not when the only reason it is hard are the reasons I pointed out.\n\nBeing extremely difficult for the wrong reasons aside, this game gave me some fun times, however much so that now that it is over it is uninstalled and will never be played again. The graphics look very good and it sounds good too. The story is honestly... I haven't been paying close attention to the story. It's a game called ALIEN RAGE who gives a ♥♥♥♥ about the story lol. I think the story is "kill aliens before they kill you!" yea that's it. It controls well, mostly runs smooth (minor slowdown/lag), and can be fun sometimes. It would be even better had it not been difficult for the wrong reasons. When I got to the level that had me riding a mine cart and you die in a fraction of a second around every turn and I retried the sections probably twenty times each, that was the last straw and I lowered the difficulty. This game would have been a lot better had it been much more balanced. You will never feel like "oh man I legitimately died". You only ever will feel like it is hard for the worst possible wrong reasons that the developers could have made it be.\n\n6/10, but because of the next to last boss fight being unbelievably bad, the worst boss fight I have ever seen in a game, ruining the game entirely, and then the last boss being just as horrid, 3/10. Not worth the headache even if it is on sale for a dollar.","November 25, 2014","false","6.6"," 16 of 30 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","16","30","0","2"

There are objective markers leading you from one section to the next, but there really isn't a reason for it because you have no other direction to go. The weapons are few and lackluster. The enemies are few and lackluster.  The environments look the same until the very last levels (and even then, ... they look the same).\n\nIt is a skill-based FPS, where you are meant to rack up points by streaking head shots and by getting 10,20, 30, (and so on) special kills using secondary fire or explosions with the many, many explosive things to shoot at that the enemies conveniently take cover near.  There is a points (xp) based perk system tacked on.\n\nAlso, your bullets from different weapons do take time to travel a distance (so you have to lead on moving targets), and even have a little bit of a drop the further they go.\n\nThe story is actually pretty good, and there were some moments in the game that made me laugh.  The audio logs are hidden in plain sight, but blend with the environment so are easy to miss.\n\nOverall the game is very fun.  Enemies rarely spawn behind you, are easy to kill, and if you plot an escape route with each battle, you can make a mess of the idiot aliens.  If you like being an ultimate bad-♥♥♥, this game is for you.  Just don't plan to be one in multiplayer.  No one is playing.","February 20","true","10.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/recommended/217920/","widgetguy","widgetguy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/","972 products in account","Quick Summary: Fast paced First Person Shooter with regenerating health (so you can charge in like a badass) and semi destructible environments. You can choose to replay chapters as you want in order to get higher scores and unlock “perks” which are passive bonuses such as increased health or damage.\n\nYou play a kind of space marine sent in alone to investigate what has happened on the asteroid Deimos, a “promethium” mine. Deimos happens to be the site of first contact with an alien race called the Vorus who are also very interested in the promethium. Everything was going well for a long time, so a sudden Vorus attack caught everyone off guard, and it’s up to you and your 2 teammates (a computer AI and a shuttle pilot) to get to the bottom of it while blasting the hordes of Vorus guarding the mines.\n\nI mentioned that you have teammates on your mission, but they don’t actually help you in the game. Instead they serve as support, telling you which direction to go and giving you someone to talk to/banter with throughout the 8 hour game. There are 3 difficulties to choose from: Challenging, Hard, and Brutal. I chose Hard as my first runthrough, thinking that it was the equivalent of “medium” but I was wrong. Hard mode can be extremely difficult because you have no clear “advantage” over your enemies. They have access to the same guns you do, including the “secondary attack” of each weapon, which most of the time is some kind of underslung grenade/rocket launcher that can kill you in one shot (and they use them A LOT). The first couple of bosses are especially frustrating because they use chainguns that can tear apart whatever you’re taking cover behind (not giving you a chance to regenerate). The later bosses are actually much easier to beat (maybe because I unlocked some decent perks by then).\n\nAs for the weapon variety, there’s actually quite a bit to choose from, and they all have a different secondary attack. Personally I found the Vorus guns to be more useful since they don’t need to reload (just cool off once in a while). The player “perks” that I mentioned earlier are unlocked in tiers as you progress through the game, earning as many points as possible with special kill types (headshots, environmental kills, melee streaks, etc). I suspect you earn points faster on Hard difficulty because I unlocked all tiers of perks about halfway through the game. You can only equip 3 at one time though, so I focused on defensive perks. You really don’t have a lot of life on Hard difficulty.\n\nPros:\n+Nice graphics and action packed gameplay. Like Halo or any other modern shooter for that matter, you can pick up just about any gun dropped by fallen enemies and just run/gun through the levels. No need to play it too safe scrounging for ammo or health kits (your health regens automatically).\n+The game’s plot is told in “audio logs” that you find throughout the game and adds some nice backstory. The situation on Deimos really isn’t what it seems from first glance.\n+There are a number of giant alien bosses to fight with your arsenal of guns.\n\nCons:\n-Multiplayer is dead. It’s not too surprising since this isn’t a very well-known game and there’s no co-op gameplay.\n-The Steam achievements are bugged. Some of them refuse to unlock and may require multiple playthroughs. For example, I’ve played through the game twice and haven’t gotten the “find every weapon” achievement even though I’ve unlocked the “kill an enemy with every weapon” achievement pretty early.\n\nOverall, I’d say Alien Rage is closer in gameplay to Bulletstorm than anything else, but without the constant vulgarity, and with much less humor.\n","April 21","true","12.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game sells itself as an old-school shooter but I'm sure what they meant with that is that they tried to design a modern shooter with Nintendo Hard difficulty: you have a two weapon limit and a pistol with unlimited ammo, you have regenerating health that you recuperate by, you guessed it, hiding behind cover, every enemy is basically a terrorist who shoots a gun but with an alien model instead. The gameplay is very fast paced and every time you enter a room enemies will spawn in and you have to shoot them all then proceed. It's almost identical to Bulletstorm which was also made with Unreal Engine 3.\nIt would be an otherwise acceptable budget shooter if it weren't for the aforementioned difficulty: you have a very tiny health pool and you can even die in one shot from enemy attacks if you're unlucky enough. Taking cover behind objects is also a matter of luck since enemy explosive attacks (rockets) cause splash damage even if you're hiding behind object and can kill you outright while you're sitting still behind cover waiting for your health to regenerate. If the player health were increased and  splash damage were removed this would be an acceptable game if you're a fan of the genre, but as of right now it feels like it's trying very hard to extend what would otherwise be a 3 hour campaign by killing you over and over. There's better and genuinely good pure action shooters on Steam: Serious Sam 1 and 3, the Shadow Warrior Reboot, Bulletstorm, Hard Reset, the Rise of the Triad  remake and the first Painkiller.

When I restarted the checkpoint the enemies from before had respawned, despite the fact them dying is what gave me the checkpoint in the first place. My only option then was to run back to a previous area and hope I didn't die in the process.\n\nAnother area had me shoot a switch to make a bridge appear but the middle was missing. I assumed I needed to do a running jump or find another switch or something but no, the bridge just didn't work for no reason.\nIt was only after dying in that area five times that the bridge decided to work as intended.\nIf this were some kind of physics based game I could maybe understand but it's not.\n\nThere are a ton of these kind of things, most recently a boss fight where the exploding tanks you use to injure the boss weren't shootable. They were visible on screen but mine and the enemies bullets just passed right through them.\nThere's no rhyme or reason to these things either, it's pure luck when you reload a checkpoint whether something will work as it's supposed to or not.\n\nMechanically some of the guns are fun to use and when you fix the texture streaming issue the game looks nice and runs quite well.\nThe story is little more than an excuse plot (at least at the point I'm at, about half way through the game) and the characters are all entirely unlikeable.\n\nFor the right price some people will probably really like this but I can't recommend it I'm afraid.","January 21, 2015","false","3.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I read some reviews, thought that it was obviously very pretty, and the first level was quite a bit of fun.\n\nFPS's aren't unfamiliar to me, but they are also not my first pick. I've played and beaten games like bioshock, Halo, Unreal Tournament 3. So I'm incredibly comfortable with games of this sort.\n\nIts very fast, always mkes you feel good about your kills, which is a good thing because the first boss...\n\nwell lets put it like this.  (NORMAL DIFFICULTY)\n\nNever in my life has a game made me so infuriated, that I not only uninstalled it, but sent me on a rampage deleting the local content of about 10 more games I never play anymore, or just didn't like but hadn't found the time to uninstall them.\n\nthe first boss attacks you with a large minigun, is accurate to a fault, and consistantly bombs you with rockets. I hid in a corner  that has a vent you can crawl into, and would often get him to 25% of his HP by cowardly poking my nose out the vent when he occasionally stops firing.\n\nThis worked great until I ran out of ammo, The second I attempt to dash/slide across the walkway to pick up some ammo, his precise aiming (and my low health pool) guaranteed I'd be dead.\n\nSo if you decide to pick this up. be prepared to have the game inflate your ego, then tear you down.","June 21, 2015","false","2.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The weapons are big and occasionally fun to shoot, but everything overheats quickly and swapping between weapons is cumbersome, making keeping up with the large and fast firefights more frustrating than fun.\n\nThe game is pretty on the nose with the fact it spawns in enemies right in front of you and, more annoyingly, behind you. It has a points scoring system like Bullet Storm, but it's not as interesting as in that game, doesn't really incentivise playing differently, and you can basically ignore it as it does nothing for you.\n\nThe dialogue occasionally approaches wit, but these moments are like finding a needle in a haystack. Mostly, it's par for the course with rote fourth wall breaking and cheesy delivery: "It's either owned, or be owned!" The story is absolutely nothing to write home about. The game flounders between wanting to be a cinematic experience and an arcadey points-based romp, and doesn't particularly succeed at meeting either goal.\n\nThe moment to moment gameplay isn't satisfying, and often relies on you finding a bottleneck position to camp in while wave upon wave of AI come running at you. There are turret sequences and on-rails sections a-plenty, neither of these are fun.\n\nThe game looks decent, but not as good as the screenshots on the Store page make it out to be.

You can choose to replay chapters as you want in order to get higher scores and unlock “perks” which are passive bonuses such as increased health or damage.\n\nYou play a kind of space marine sent in alone to investigate what has happened on the asteroid Deimos, a “promethium” mine. Deimos happens to be the site of first contact with an alien race called the Vorus who are also very interested in the promethium. Everything was going well for a long time, so a sudden Vorus attack caught everyone off guard, and it’s up to you and your 2 teammates (a computer AI and a shuttle pilot) to get to the bottom of it while blasting the hordes of Vorus guarding the mines.\n\nI mentioned that you have teammates on your mission, but they don’t actually help you in the game. Instead they serve as support, telling you which direction to go and giving you someone to talk to/banter with throughout the 8 hour game. There are 3 difficulties to choose from: Challenging, Hard, and Brutal. I chose Hard as my first runthrough, thinking that it was the equivalent of “medium” but I was wrong. Hard mode can be extremely difficult because you have no clear “advantage” over your enemies. They have access to the same guns you do, including the “secondary attack” of each weapon, which most of the time is some kind of underslung grenade/rocket launcher that can kill you in one shot (and they use them A LOT). The first couple of bosses are especially frustrating because they use chainguns that can tear apart whatever you’re taking cover behind (not giving you a chance to regenerate). The later bosses are actually much easier to beat (maybe because I unlocked some decent perks by then).\n\nAs for the weapon variety, there’s actually quite a bit to choose from, and they all have a different secondary attack. Personally I found the Vorus guns to be more useful since they don’t need to reload (just cool off once in a while). The player “perks” that I mentioned earlier are unlocked in tiers as you progress through the game, earning as many points as possible with special kill types (headshots, environmental kills, melee streaks, etc). I suspect you earn points faster on Hard difficulty because I unlocked all tiers of perks about halfway through the game. You can only equip 3 at one time though, so I focused on defensive perks. You really don’t have a lot of life on Hard difficulty.\n\nPros:\n+Nice graphics and action packed gameplay. Like Halo or any other modern shooter for that matter, you can pick up just about any gun dropped by fallen enemies and just run/gun through the levels. No need to play it too safe scrounging for ammo or health kits (your health regens automatically).\n+The game’s plot is told in “audio logs” that you find throughout the game and adds some nice backstory. The situation on Deimos really isn’t what it seems from first glance.\n+There are a number of giant alien bosses to fight with your arsenal of guns.\n\nCons:\n-Multiplayer is dead. It’s not too surprising since this isn’t a very well-known game and there’s no co-op gameplay.\n-The Steam achievements are bugged. Some of them refuse to unlock and may require multiple playthroughs. For example, I’ve played through the game twice and haven’t gotten the “find every weapon” achievement even though I’ve unlocked the “kill an enemy with every weapon” achievement pretty early.\n\nOverall, I’d say Alien Rage is closer in gameplay to Bulletstorm than anything else, but without the constant vulgarity, and with much less humor.\n","April 21","true","12.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

At first, the two races seem to get along and share a giant meteor where promethium was found in abundance, but later the Vorus decide they want it all for themselves. You play as a badass marine that is sent to wipe out the aliens and stop any mining operations on that meteor. Parts of the story are told later on with the help of audio logs that you can find as collectibles and a more sinister plan is unveiled half-way through the game.\n\nLevel design is liniar, made up mostly of corridors connecting rooms and larger spaces for the boss encounters. In general, the action takes place inside the meteor's mining facilities and structures, with very rare moments when you go outside and get to admire the great sci-fi scenery. There is a turret ride and another level where you get to shoot things from inside an alien mech. Except for these, you can roam freely between checkpoints without many cut-scenes to bother. I also found some minor bugs, but nothing game-breaking.\n\nGameplay is very fast because many enemies will rush on your position. Tactical play is not impossible, but most of the time it is a run and gun scenario. Killing aliens is rewarded with points and badges pop-up at the top of the screen for certain actions (double-kill, explosive-kill, etc.). There is also a perk system that will unlock bonuses once you scored enough points. Aliens come in different types, from fast flankers to heavy armour, so you need to adapt and use weapons from both races. Guns feel great as aliens tend to melt under fire. I favored the energy weapons, but there is a weapon suited for every situation. Boss battles are brutal and you can die very fast if you don't stay in cover. Learn the specific mechanic for each boss and strike at the right time to succeed.\n\nTakes about 8-9 hours to finish the campaign and you will die a lot. Fans of the FPS genre should not miss out on this game.","May 19","true","10.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

In the far future Humanity has reached the stars in search of new energies, earth’s natural resources are almost depleted and we need a solution, it happens we found an asteroid full of some new energy called Promethium, but we are not the only ones, another species called Vorus has also reached this asteroid in search of this new energy, so both races start jointly to exploit the mineral, everything was good for a time until the Vorus turn on the human miners and wipe them out. So Jack, our main protagonist, is sent to investigate the situation, kill the Vorus and destroy the facility.\n\nGameplay\nThe game is just a linear, first person shooter with zero variation, kill all enemies, go to the next stage, kill all enemies again, find mini-boss or first boss, end stage, next. Most levels look the same, they are mostly a corridor, except for when you reach certain larger areas to find enemies coming from multiple points. According to the game info on Steam, gameplay offers a cover mechanics to help you stand your ground over waves and waves of enemies, though, this apparently does not work or simply doesn’t exist, anyway, the gameplay is difficult, especially on hard and insane difficulties, so be prepare to die many times. Alien Rage has a scoring system, depending on the way you kill your enemies you are rewarded with medals, multi kills and blast master badges, among many others.\n\nEnemies are not that varied, but they are fast and hard to kill at times, or just spawn in multiple waves over and over again, they also tend to blend with the stage’s environment, making it hard to see sometimes, in other occasions, they will just get you from behind or simply flank you, this tends to happen when you are being crowded, enemies also count with spawn options they have scattered all over the place. Weapons are not that varied either, and some of them are just useless or slow to use because you will usually have long distance fights by trying to use the “cover system” to your advantage, fortunately the secondary firing option of some weapons cause a lot damage and give you a break from the multiple enemies waves. Overall, gameplay is monotonous and it doesn’t offer more than what you can see on a gameplay or in-game images. So don’t expect anything out of the ordinary, Alien Rage is a simple, dull FPS.\n\nGraphics\nAlien Rage uses Unreal Engine 3, it looks good in game, flashy and shiny, some aspects of the limited access we have to the level’s environments are detailed, while some others show some muddy graphics, at times we encounter multiple layers of textures not loading properly, as most levels look the same and the lack of variations is patent, there is not much to add here, Unreal Engine shows off at key moments if we consider the amount of explosions that look great, the chaos we can create demonstrate the power of the engine regarding physics.\n\nSound and voices\nThe in game sounds and effects are decent, not groundbreaking, but they do their job, explosions and weapon effect sound exactly as you may expect from a game like this, nothing new, but they fit the concept here.\n\nAs for the voice acting, yeah, they are ok, main protagonist sounds always overly heroic and he tends to sound like a typical pseudo action man, annoying at times, yes, but I guess the voice acting fits the concept as well, the other two main acting voices exist only to give you instructions and deliver a quota of relief, with bad jokes and some sort of internal issue between them, they are just there doing their job with minor help.\n\nThe Bad\nWhere to begin? Alien Rage is filled with gameplay issues and graphical problems, starting with the mechanics of the game, there is no cover system to begin with, extremely necessary for a game that is relentless with many waves of enemies, AI is totally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, Vorus just run towards you shooting nonstop waiting to be killed, The main character is very limited in movement, he is slow, big and clunky, sometimes during combat, the same stage is a total mess with explosions, bullets from every direction while you desperately look for a decent cover while trying to see where fire is coming from, multiple enemies that blend with the environment make the gameplay a continuous disaster regarding mechanics, I rather wait in a corner for the enemies to come to me so I can kill them one by one.\n\nGraphical problems are constant here, textures not loading, muddy details, monotonous levels and stages, overly glossy elements invisible walls, of course there are invisible walls, the game is linear as hell, so you have a certain pattern to follow. Usually the textures don’t load properly every time you enter a new level or when you load a last save, showing the engine’s known issues.\n\nCheckpoints are terrible, they constantly let you in the middle of enemy fire, you die, you load last save and again, multiple enemies surround you so you die again unless you act quickly enough to find some corner where to hide and recover or use the “cover system” to save your skin, again, the game has a terrible balance between you and your enemies, it is hard, I understand the crying over the difficulty is not an option, but handicapping you is also a problem when it comes to running or jumping, the latter is nonexistent, why the jumping mechanics are so messed up? I don’t really know, so you better bind the default space bar to another more functional action.\n\nWhen it comes to boss battles, things are equally terrible, most of them are just bullet sponges that do a lot of damage and the lack of a proper cover system will only give you one option, which is running from one place to another trying to avoid enemy fire or whatever the attack is, they have weak spots so you have chances to beat them, running out of ammo will be always present in those moments, so you better shoot correctly. Some bosses will glitch-out at times, it happened in my play through a couple of times, these battles are not that challenging, but they tend to be monotonous and boring.\n\nConclusion\nAlien Rage is a terrible decent game, it doesn’t offer original ideas or storyline, nor is any character worth remembering, which are not that many anyway, but if you want a challenge, a difficult one that will lead you to rage, this game is for you, other than that, you will be disappointed since the beginning. In my opinion, this game barely makes it to get a thumbs up, but as there is no neutral option between good and bad, I tried to be explicit regarding the bad side of it.\n","May 1","true","7.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

Great graphics, really hard and good shooting, okay writing that is aware of its meathead genre and has fun with it. You play a Warhammer 40k-esque space marine who has so much armor that he can barely jump half a foot, and he's on a one-man-mission to do something or another that involves killing a bunch of aliens. The plot may or may not basically be Quake 2's plot (last-ditch attempt to stop invading alien marauders by taking the war to their homeworld), but after taking a break for a year I've completely forgotten whatever is supposed to be going on.\n\nWhich is fine, because who cares why I'm doing the things I do. The enemies are extremely fast and fairly powerful, the guns you get are really powerful and kind of samey, and there is a scoring system that encourages you to improvise and go nuts deep into every encounter. It's like a combination of Bulletstorm and Quake 4, but less ambitious than either of those. Less great level design, less interesting set pieces, but not exactly bad either. The levels are gorgeous in terms of their architecture and the vistas they present, but the layouts aren't anywhere near as interesting or clever. On the other hand, the encounters (how the enemies show up, which ones show up, where they show up, and the timing between their spawns) are consistently excellent, and every firefight feels like you're clawing your way out of hell.\n\nAnd the game is ♥♥♥♥ing difficult. I'm playing on hard and need to take a break every thirty minutes from the sheer stress of it all, which is great. I get my shooting out the way and can play another walking simulator. It's like all that domestic fantasy ♥♥♥♥ Blazkowicz was mumbling about in the new Wolfenstein game, except now I'm mumbling it. It's the horror of war for the everyman.\n\nFix society: play Alien Rage.","January 9","true","3.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The game was critically thrashed by every major reviewer and certainly didn't get the attention it truly deserved and same goes for all the titles developed by City Interactive. However it isn't a bad game, and certainly doesn't deserve  1's, 2's and 0's.\n\nPros\nAlien Rage is a very fun and fast paced first person shooter. It looks beautifull, something that we can say for all the games created by CT Interactive. The game relies heavily on running and guning system and you have to make sure you are constantly moving otherwise the enemies will put you down, explosions look sick and pop ups appear every now and then to remind you of your badassery level (UUULTRAA COMBO!, KILLING SPREE!, EXPLOSIVE KILLS, 5 x Explosive KILLS.........u get the idea). It certainly isn't a walk in the park type of experience, the games lowest difficulty is Hard, so u are going to die ''A LOT". Enemy AI is somewhat smart I'll say. They will get behind covers, give suppressing fire, so that the others can get an advantage over you and force you to find cover as soon as possible, the enemy will often try to flank you by cloaking and then stunning you. The gameplay feels solid every gun has a distinct taste to it that makes them unique, each gun is also equipped with a unique alternate firing mode which further adds and expands your alien killing arsenal. The game has a decent amount of guns, the game also introduces new enemy types from time to time to keep things interesting. the boss battles are also somewhat well done, each boss battle requires you to be fast and to be on your toes, if you rely on cover too much you will die, if you don't take cover you will die, so act smart strike at the best time and then move your ♥♥♥ away from the enemy and repeat. Some of the boss battles also require you to shoot specific parts of their body  in order to bring them down. The game unlike old school FPS games features your standard ADS and regenerating health, something that everyone complains, but I simply have no issues with it. The game isn't long but has replay value, you can find hidden audio logs, complete some in game challenges to set your score on the leaderboards.\n\nThe Cons\nDespite it's best efforts, there are a lot of issues with the game, something I can see that might have played a huge role in earning this game 2's and 3's. There are tonnes of bugs, from occasional crashing to broken level design.....you name it, this game has it......sometimes the doors won't open preventing you from advancing, the bosses become invincible, explosive containers go missing from the level which result in you dying all the time no matter how many headshots you score and all of these issues require a restart. There was this one section where you were on a moving tram with a minigun and you had to stop enemies from killing you untill you reached your destination, but after dying once in the level, I retried but found that the explosive containers had all gone and I literally had to deal with everyone of them individually which resulted in me dying all the time and requiring me to restart the game. The game has weird texture issues and the framerate drops like ♥♥♥♥ during intense firefights. The game also has a very poor sense of explosion radius, if an enemy is firing rockets at you and you are standing behind a metal wall, which is thick as F**k, you'll still take the same amount of damage as you would have if it hit you directly to your face,  if an explosion takes palce meters away from your cover u still take tonnes of damage, instantly killing you in the process and in the worst case scenario u end up throwing your controller through the window. This issue makes bossfights feel like pain in the ♥♥♥. The game also has a very weird framerate lock in it's multiplayer part and it just doesn't feel as fast as the main campaign. You character can't jump more than two inches in campaign but can seriously parkour it's way through in the multiplayer. It's issues like this that pulled alien rage back from easily becoming the old school shooter we always wanted.\n\nStory\nIt has a nice touching story in which it eventually tells the player to go fk themselves because they were expecting one\n\nVerdict\n6/10\nPick it up during a sale. It's above average but in no sense deserves 2's. It will keep you engaged in it's explosive combat if you know your way around the multiple game breaking bugs it will thow at you.","November 21, 2015","true","9.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","3","5","2","0"

They did try to develop it further via Audio logs scattered around the levels but I never listened to them since you can only hear them in near proximity, thus slowing down the pace of the game. You can find the collected Audio-logs in the main menu (missed this, thanks to user "Storm_at_Sea" for this information)\n\nGameplay:\nAlien Rage's biggest problem is the player's low health. You'll often find yourself hiding in cover, waiting for your health to regenerate, which is a tremendous pacebreaker. There is an upgrade that grants you a 50% health boost, but you'll most likely unlock it very late in the game and it won't improve your situations all that much.\nEnemy AI is quite aggressive but it works well, though I felt that the Grenadiers are extremely ruthless, sporting pin-point accuracy and in some cases react in an instant, which led to unfair deaths. Snipers are also quite nasty, being just as accurate and will decimate you if you're not aware of them. The gunplay is decent, the weapons are rather interesting, each one having an alternate firemode. However there are only 5 individual weapon types in-game for each faction. Level design is linear and not worth mentioning. For some reason the developers found it necessary to play a lengthy animation each time you open a door or use a console. It looks OK for the first time but it gets annoying very fast.\nCity Interactive claims Alien Rage to be an oldschool style shooter but this is a lie. The tone of the game feels oldschool, but the mechanics are not.\nThere's also Multiplayer but don't bother checking it out, as no one is playing it.\n\nPresentation:\nAlien Rage runs on the Unreal 3 engine and City Interactive did a very good job with the overall graphics. The game features very atmospheric lighting, nice looking particle effects and some rather beautiful sceneries. It's such a shame that 90% of the game consist of Promethium mines and corridors. Video options are rather disappointing, and a few of them were lacking at release (such as the FoV slider) but have since been patched onto the options menu. Alien Rage suffers from frame drops from time to time, most prominently at places just before you enter larger areas. Otherwise you should be able to keep steady 60FPS, even on older cards.\nSound design is really standard. The compositions are decent but nothing memorable, sound effects vary from good to lacking. The voice acting is good and has some decent lines here and there.\n\nConclusion:\nUnfortunately I cannot recommend Alien Rage. It's incredibly frustrating on higher difficulties and becomes more and more stale the further you progress.

I've become rather tough on games in recent years, and I can't even count the number of games I've played this year that I gave up on out of frustration. I tend to have an extremely short fuse when it comes to gameplay mechanics, but I enjoyed this one almost the whole way through.\n\nI'll get this out of the way up front, though. There are some frustrating fights, you will likely die a LOT (even on the so-called normal difficulty), and the weapon choice is severely limited (ie some are entirely useless).\n\nThis game hails from the Serious Sam school, where games are almost perfectly linear, and waves of enemies spawn at pre-determined points for pre-determined lengths of time. Unlike Serious Sam, however, this game is short enough that the gimmick doesn't wear out its welcome. I ended up beating Alien Rage in about 6 hours, which I think is just perfect for this kind of mindless action. It seemed like the final level of Serious Sam 3 alone stretched out that long.\n\nThe graphics and sounds of Alien Rage fit their purpose as well. The music and sound are nothing to write home about, but the graphics are actually surprisingly nice. There were more than a few points where I simply stopped to admire the scenery. In addition, it's hard not to have a smile on your face while you're running around blasting alien creatures, bits and pieces of them flying around the screen. Such fights are somewhat rare, however, since you will be blasted full of more holes than a cheesecloth if you stay in the open for very long.\n\nSpeaking of battles, the boss fights are unfortunately quite poorly-done. There will be early ones where you will die over and over and over and over, and be millimeters from clicking on "delete local content," and then there will be later fights where you get a chaingun immediately before (and I do mean IMMEDIATELY), and demolish the boss in a matter of 30 seconds without even having to move. I had far more difficulty with the recharging boss than every other boss combined. Including the final one.\n\nThere are a wide variety of level types on tap as well. There are rail shooting levels, mech suit levels, and one style of level where the lights are mostly out and your gun emits a small scanner which illuminates cloaked enemies.\n\nThis game will inevitably be compared to Hard Reset, and while the two are quite similar, Alien Rage outshines it in a number of areas. First of all, you can jump in this game, and while that is never EVER actually needed, it makes the movement feel much less stuffy. In addition, the story and acting in Alien Rage are really quite well done. Where Hard Reset's story felt ridiculous, poorly-acted, and peppered with lame attempts at humor, Alien Rage's story is actually complex, engaging, well-acted, and somewhat humorous. It's worth mentioning that Alien Rage's story is almost entirely told through audio logs which can be missed, but I mean it when I say the game is linear; it would be hard to miss too many logs. I didn't look too close, and ended up with 29/33. It's also worth mentioning that there are a LOT of pop culture references. I found them funny, but I know how those annoy some people.\n\nOverall, if you enjoyed Hard Reset (or other oldschool-ish games), you will enjoy this too. It's difficult, fast-paced, bright and shiny, the AI is dumb, and it keeps track of high scores for the competitive folks out there. It has multiplayer too, but I didn't try it. I have a feeling it's just deathmatch.\n\nI recommend picking it up. I can't honestly say I would have happily spent more than $10 on it, but I am notoriously cheap. :)\n\n-DrB","July 22, 2014","true","7.0"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","11","21","0","0"

The level design is somewhat all very similar, like they were dipped in metallic paint. However, given the context of the game - you are fighting an alien robot race - it fits pretty snug.\n\nLike I said above, this game is very fast paced, giving you little to no time to stop and think. Your finger must stay on the trigger at all times if you expect to survive.\n\nThere are ten weapons found throughout the campaign. You can carry two side weapons and one main weapon (Pistol) that has infinite ammunition. Each weapon has an alternate firing mode giving you multiple advantages in battle. Killing enemies skillfully increases the points given, and you can unlock perks for your character. There is an entire perk tree to choose from, but you can equip up to three at a time.\n\nFourteen levels to play through and eight huge, tough-♥♥♥ bosses to mow down.\n\nTrue to it's hardcore reputation, the easiest difficulty is called "Challenging", with the next two being the "Hard" and "Brutal" difficulties.\n\nVery highly recommended to fans of first-person shooters that like a heavy challenge.","November 20, 2014","true","9.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The plot (if there is any) is not the main point of the game. It is an Arcade styled shooter, meaning kills equals points. At the end of the mission, you are shown your stats for that mission and move on to the next.\n\nThe gameplay is awesome in this game. There is a variety of guns in this game. The gunplay is good, shooting aliens in the head and seeing orange blood spill out is amusing. The Arcade style of this game works really well with the concept of this whole shooter. There are perks that can be used in the game to help you survive and kill aliens, earned by playing for points.\n\nWhen I say, I've played enough of Alien Rage, doesn't mean it's bad, it's just, it's not optimizied very well. The game runs at 60 on high, but at every moment of battle (almost everywhere) the game drops to 25 frames and below, make the game run low and laggy. I like 60 frames, if CI took more time and just fixed that this game would be great.\n\nThe graphics on this game created by Unreal Engine, looks very well. The atmosphere of being in space and all the other surrounds looks amazing with Unreal. Glad CI used this engine.\n\nThis game, is amazing. Since, CI, made some mistakes and didn't optimize the game to well, I say, wait till it goes on sale. If it every does get fixed, I shall re-write this review, so people can know that it is fixed but, for now, I give this game a 5/10. If you want a game just like this, go buy Bulletstorm, it's a lot like this game in the way of weapons, gameplay, and Arcade styled game.","September 29, 2013","true","1.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

It has its moments of frustration with the difficulty spikes, but the weapons and score-based mechanics really make it shine over other titles in the genre. However, I barely tried the multiplayer and unfortunately, the servers were quite empty.\n\nPROS:\n+Lengthy single-player campaign (for a budget title)\n+Impressive visuals (maybe not Crysis 3 quality but decent looking though)\n+Fun weapons\n+"Old school feel" with challenging fights and boss battles. The scores on the screen is reminiscent of the old arcade gaming.\n+20$ (at release).\n\nCONS:\n-Story is incredibly bland\n-Lots of difficulty spikes (I played on Hard setting though)\n-Cheesy dialog\n-Empty MP servers\n\nRECOMMEND:\nI suggest giving it a try if you enjoy arcade style first-person action. Sure the game is a generic FPS title but I think Alien Rage got unfairly bashed; maybe because the reviewers sucked at playing old school FPS games? Yeah, must be that!\n\nBottom line, you seek an old school arcade-ish FPS game?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NeoGalaxy/recommended/217920/","NeoGalaxy","[EDF] Shadow Dragon™","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NeoGalaxy/","444 products in account","I played this game for like 10 hours or so, but I can't lie... this is by far the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ FPS I have ever played. The checkpoint system, the instant teleport ahead of you of the enemy and the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ bosses... it all adds to what I call the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ FPS played by me to this date.\n\nAll I can say about the graphic direction this game takes... 90% of it it's useless, pointless and easy to ignore. Every level is just a simple "go to B from A", alone, without any real interest to it. There's real map design, most of it doesn't make sense anyway, but this wasn't the main focus on the developer team for sure. The sounds are nice, I don't play with music so I don't really care about it, but the sounds are ok. I can't lie but... the graphic direction taken by game is really boring, all the neon detail... useless and boring like hell. It's obvisous that the developer team had no talent in designing some decent levels, or some interesting bosses or some interesting fights or mechanics, all they could do was to put as much neon detail on everything.\n\nThe level design si boring and nonimaginative, probably it took one hour to sort it out and the could focus on something else. This something else I can't say... which one is. The level design is boring, the bosses are boring, the level mechanics and fights are boring... let's not forget the checkpoint system... wow that's beyond ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Also... the teleporting ability of the enemy, it always happens when you enter a room... they always teleport right when you are about to enter a room or a colidor. To be honest most of the time, they fire even before they can see you, that's very lame and boring also.\n\nThe AI in this game is inexistant, they use just one tactic: teleport right before the player and fire what you got. If you survive this initial barrage.... headshots on the roll :P. I think I have the record points for every level, due to how limited (to nonexistant) the AI's skill is. But some of enemies are interesting, not all, but some are. The melee warrior is interesting, the medium ranged one is pretty weak, the heavy one is pretty lame, the very long one (using sniper riffles appears just 2-3 times in some levels, lame also).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NeoGalaxy/recommended/217920/","NeoGalaxy","[EDF] Shadow Dragon™","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NeoGalaxy/","444 products in account","I played this game for like 10 hours or so, but I can't lie... this is by far the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ FPS I have ever played. The checkpoint system, the instant teleport ahead of you of the enemy and the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ bosses... it all adds to what I call the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ FPS played by me to this date.\n\nAll I can say about the graphic direction this game takes... 90% of it it's useless, pointless and easy to ignore. Every level is just a simple "go to B from A", alone, without any real interest to it. There's real map design, most of it doesn't make sense anyway, but this wasn't the main focus on the developer team for sure. The sounds are nice, I don't play with music so I don't really care about it, but the sounds are ok. I can't lie but... the graphic direction taken by game is really boring, all the neon detail... useless and boring like hell. It's obvisous that the developer team had no talent in designing some decent levels, or some interesting bosses or some interesting fights or mechanics, all they could do was to put as much neon detail on everything.\n\nThe level design si boring and nonimaginative, probably it took one hour to sort it out and the could focus on something else. This something else I can't say... which one is. The level design is boring, the bosses are boring, the level mechanics and fights are boring... let's not forget the checkpoint system... wow that's beyond ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Also... the teleporting ability of the enemy, it always happens when you enter a room... they always teleport right when you are about to enter a room or a colidor. To be honest most of the time, they fire even before they can see you, that's very lame and boring also.\n\nThe AI in this game is inexistant, they use just one tactic: teleport right before the player and fire what you got. If you survive this initial barrage.... headshots on the roll :P. I think I have the record points for every level, due to how limited (to nonexistant) the AI's skill is. But some of enemies are interesting, not all, but some are. The melee warrior is interesting, the medium ranged one is pretty weak, the heavy one is pretty lame, the very long one (using sniper riffles appears just 2-3 times in some levels, lame also). The main weakness of these enemies is that.. they have unlimited ammunition, and don't care when or how they use it, that's why they also die soo fast.\n\nThe bosses are pretty lame, no tactic or gameplay ideas there, I think by far that these bosses are the most imaginative ones that I have ever seen in a game.

Engine we all know and love , yet  somehow this game will run like poop no matter how expensive your rig is. There are ways around it , tweaking .INI file will solve all performance issues this game has but to make game which runs so bad on such a good and trusted engine is a sin.\n\nAlien rage was first game in 15 years which literally made me sick. I know that people who suffer from motion sickness have issues with certain games making them feel dizzy and giving them headaches. I've never been on that unlucky side. Thou this game managed to almost make me vomit with it's ridiculous motion blur ( which cant be turned off in menu's ) and vomit inducing FX effects . Gladly , again , you can turn them off if you edit .INI file.\n\nEvery time you die , and you will die a lot 'cause game is pretty hard , you get your standar 'restart from last checkpoint' option . What's different from other games is that then you do that half of level wont load . Doors wont trigger open , enemies will be invincible,parts you have to interact with wont be interactable. One must go back to main menu and then load last save again. Keeping in mind that game is hard, you will have to do this a lot which sucks joy out of you.\n\nAnd the worst thing about this game is that.... it's a good game. Game of genre we rarely see these days , old school FPS . Only titles in recent memory which managed to capture this feeling was Hard Reset,Bullet Storm and new Wolfenstein . That's it....and i can add Alien Rage to this small small list now. It's very solid in terms of mechanics, shooting is fun, guns awesome , it requires a lot of skill . No hand helding here. I like it...and i hate how dev's utterly failed to make this game actually playable.\n\nThis could have been GREAT GAME.","April 8","false","8.1"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

The enemy AI is too smart and are all sharpshooters - in one mission, I got killed by a sniper all the way across the level even though I could not see him since he was shooting me from under the rail. Your weapons are overpowered and you are underpowered - just a few hits and you already go into danger zone. Like most games, you would hide, but the problem is that the enemy weapons can destroy just about any obstacle, thus making it pointless to hide. There are dozens of enemies thrown at you at once on a small enclosed catwalk, and every enemy takes too many hits to die. The best thing would probably just melee the hell out of them, but because you can only take a few hits before dying, it ends up being a death sentence in the end. There are also few and inconsistent spawn points, thus forcing you to carry out another 10 minute monotonous fight all over again. The potential is there, but the lackluster experience point system and strong enemies make this game more of a hassle than fun. Oh, and of course the multiplayer is dead.","March 11","false","1.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The graphics are decent enough but it's nothing that hasn't been done before, the story is awful but that's never been the driving force for these style of games.\n\nI highly recommend that anyone interested in this game buys Bulletstorm instead, it's the game that this title wishes it could be.\n\nI got this game in a bundle so pretty much got it for around 10p, it's easy to play through and not the worst 10p I've spent.

Cut-scenes were well done and was a welcomed break from the grinding of enemies to get to the next checkpoint. Once the eye-candy and newness of this game world wore off, I just had to stop. I was really just grinding through this game versus playing the game.

But it's a fantastic strategic-shooter, in the sense that you really have to try different strategies for each area not to die.\nThe plot and dialogue are better than both Halo and Bulletstorm, both of which it has some cultural ancestry through. And yes, it is a little derivative of Halo in terms of the weapon system, but then, Halo was derivative of virtually everything.\nI wouldn't advise any difficulty level other than 'Challenging' - you're really not going to enjoy the game otherwise. But played right, this is reminiscent of the difficulty of Serious Sam 1 on 'Hard' mode, trying to desperately think of a way to not die and go back to your savegame.\n\nThe visuals, though perplexing and detailed at first, quickly become navigable, and in time you'll come to appreciate how polished this game is, both in textural and structural details.\n\nSound-wise - pretty good, pretty standard, though some nice touches here and there.\nAnd I actually found the boss fights pretty satisfying and enervating - a great combination of 'figure out the strategy' and adrenaline-fueled desperation and chasing.\n\nIf you never played an old-school FPS, get used to the following tactics -\n1. Cover is not always going to stay upright, or be perfect at blocking explosions and bullets, depending on how wide it is and where you're placed.\n2. Retreat to better tactical location is always an option, and usually necessary.\n3. Fast reflexes and headshots win wars.\n\nOverall a very satisfying experience, and no-way-near worth the ire it's attracted. Again, not everybody's game - but then, why would it be? And what's wrong with another game that's not as simple or puerile as GoW clones?","January 23, 2014","true","3.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

It will keep you busy for hours and amaze you time and time again with huge boss fights and massive amount of action.

Primary weapons are a done to death assault rifle with no feeling and an alien plasma rifle with no kick.\n\nGames strongest point is it's heavy duty graphics and effects but their effect is minimal as difficulty is wack. You'll die dozens of times in a matter of minutes, setting back progress along with unskipable cutscenes which takes away all the immersion you'll get from the fancy graphics and then some.\n\nLevels, the ai and the weapons are designed with a certain playstyle in mind(You're basically encouraged to run into enemies with a IDGAF attitude and fight in short range, you'll have a painful time if you try to play from long range and as a cover shooter). You get punished if you derive from that.\n\nAI is silly, they sometimes get stuck in "go to different cover" mode. You get to watch alien commandos play musical chairs with covers. They sometimes try to run past and take cover behind you, or my favorite get out of cover run to your face and punch you when they have assault rifles. You feel more like playing against zombies rather than advanced aliens.\n\nThere is a story but you have to discover it by finding hidden collectibles, which is detrimental to the pace of the game. What you learn about the story aside from those is nothing original along with the characters.\n\nOverall it's not a bad game and you might even enjoy it if all you're looking for is shooting stuff AND your playstyles happens to coincide with this games particular style.","December 9, 2013","false","6.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

So much fun and filled those little touches that tell you the developers clearly cared about this. Damn hard as nails too! Honestly can't believe the reviews are not higher than they are. The controls are smooth and mapped out in the standard FPS format. Gameplay is fast and hard: You absolutely need to seek cover and back off a bit to keep from being overrun. Enemy AI is quite good: they seek cover and don't appear to cheat: sometime you can trick them by corner camping for awhile but eventually they will figure it out. Graphics are really very nice if not terribly varied and the storyline has quite a bit of decent humor to spice things up. Unfortunately multiplayer seems to be pretty much dead.

The lone, badaas, spacemarine VS an entire planet full of alien goons reminded me of Quake 2, in a good way.  Effects and animations are great.  Collectables and unlockable perks to encourage exploration and add replay value.\n\nHowever, there are too few types of enemies, so you spend most of the game shooting the same 3 tyrpes of goon.  I wish the devs had made a few more goon types and a few less boss fights (9 boss fights!).\n\nThe environments don't show much variation on the theme of steel hallways.  While there are several weapon types the environments really only favor a few of them and we only get to use the pilotable mech on one level, it seems a waste.\n\nThe Unreal engine does a solid job of holding keeping the game together I did enounter a few gameplay glitches which kind of broke the immersion from time to time.\n\nOverall I can still thourougly recommend this game for a mindless shoot-em up.","November 23, 2013","true","10.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The combat itself is visceral and the graphics are great. However, the enemies all have perfect accuracy and most of them have rocket launchers. The game has a "skill tree" and ridiculously enough, the further you get into the game, the easier it gets. Alien Rage starts off being infuriatingly hard forcing you to constantly hide behind cover praying that the next AOE blast from a rocket launcher wont kill you. By the time you're around 75% through the game, you can run and gun as you please thanks to the upgrades you receive. The game doesn't know whether it wants to be Call of Duty or Serious Sam.\n\nThe final upgrade makes your pistol 1 shot everything. Bosses take like 4 shots to go down.\n\nThis inverse difficulty is one of the most absurd design choices I've ever come across. If this was tweaked, this game would have been pretty decent.\n\nAlien Rage is also full of bugs that warp you to checkpoints that are ahead of you. So when you respawn, you have the joy of fighting all the enemies you "skipped" as well as all the enemies ahead of you. The AI pretty much bum-rushes you the second they see you so have fun!\n\nFull review:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0umleKRFgE","May 20","false","7.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

If I should sum up the three difficulties you can find ingame; Very Hard, Insane and ♥♥♥♥ You.). The game has an interesting storyline, good characters and voice acting (As good as in a sci-fi FPS they can be.). You may also hear plenty great references to other classics. The weapons have real power, the generic grunt enemies are also a challenge (Meaning they can kill you with a few shots, even the very first ones you'll encounter with in game.), and the entire setting looks great and well crafted, special thanks to Unreal 3. The world of Alien Rage reminds me mostly for the mix of Gears of War, Halo, Bulletstorm and Quake 2, with the hard core and challenging gameplay of the original Doom, Quake and Wolfenstein series. The game is very long, comparing the other games in the genre (It took about 11 hours to beat all 14 levels.). Alien Rage is a very nice fast paced FPS which is very satisfying and reminds me for the shooters of the glorious 1990s, and it is highly recommended for those who love a real challenge.","February 7","true","11.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I mean, what do you expect from a game named "Alien Rage"? A bald space marine mowing down an entire race of bipedals in a xenophobic rampage? Check. Graphics that are shiny and cool in the way twelve-year olds think things are cool? You got it. Endless corridors filled with crates, explosives, crates of explosives and an occasional button to press? It's all here.\n\nAnyhow, if you're feeling up to it, this game is a passable timewaster. The guns feel right and combat is satisfying: Not quite as hectic as the old school shooters since the enemies do tend to soak up quite a helping of bullets before giving up the ghost and you do need to take cover to regenerate health every once in a while, but definitely more briskly paced than your usual modern shooter.\n\nA couple of very annoying bugs have managed to slip in that had me gnawing at my keyboard (explosive crates not respawning after loading a checkpoint, bosses retaining their invulnerability shields forever if you die while they're activated etc. miscellaneous checkpoint-related bugs). Some of the gameplay decisions are highly questionable as well (unskippable animations between checkpoints and boss battles, misguided and unfunny attempts at some fourth wall breaking humor), but overall I daresay I slightly enjoyed the experience. If you just want to shoot some dudes and not worry too much about anything else, Alien Rage is there for you.","September 29, 2013","true","6.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Instead of fending off endless tides of terrorists or Russians in what feels like the same war, you fight aliens on a mining base over a precious substance.\n\nThis game is fast and brutal. I'd consider myself average at shooters and this thing kills you dead quick at the easiest difficulty (Challenging). Don't get me wrong, though, it's not impossible but you need to be fast and accurate to dominate this. At some points I found myself falling back so I can get some good shots off. Explosives are everywhere in AR and a well timed shot can remove a threat and paint half the room in fire and blood. If you see a red-orange glow... SHOOT IT! I can only imagine that the last difficulty level gives you a slight boost on health that Counter Strike gives you as I'm not insane enough to try it yet.\n\nQuality (Read: Lame in spots) writing is what is missing in modern shooters these days.  It's "Sir" this and "Affirmative" that these days but Alien Rage replaces that with the three characters (two are voice overs so no annoying AI Partner/s) taking verbal shots at each other as you find out what's going on. On the first level there are alien drones casually minding their own business as you have a firefight with some Warriors and a Grenadier. After killing a drone for the first time, the main character, Jack, says "They took our jobs." Thank you, South Park and the need for lame one-liners.\n\nThe guns... What is a shooter without its centerpiece of destructive tools? Every weapon has an Alternative Fire function instead of an underbarrel grenade launcher or Underbarrel shotgun. Hell, the alien shotgun fires a ball of death energy that tosses enemies into the air! "PULL"! The minigun shoots a ball of plasma and is insanely satisfying to watch enemies fall before your bullets. Aiming is fast and arcade-like. If you've played Unreal Tournament before then you'll know what I mean. The pacing of the game makes me feel like I'm playing a more interactive Light Gun shooter at a movie theatre arcade. In the scene where I mentioned the drones. You blow the door open, you meet the Grenadier in a camera zoom and accompaning title display, and it's straight to the shooting. Alien rage wants you to continue playing it even after you beat the story with its perk system. After gaining so many points (by racking up kills from headshots, explosions, melee kills, level completion), you unlock a tier of 3 perks and you get to select one to three perks to use making previously hard levels easier but still challenging.\n\nWhat about multiplayer? I dunno. I got into one match and the server was empty so I can't say anything about it.\n\nOver all: Pretty, fast, brutal, worth buying to kill some time when it's on sale, and explosions.","January 1, 2014","true","5.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","0"

At only about eleven hours long, you need to budget a little.\n\nUnbelievably harshly criticised, this game isn't anything like pro-reviews are saying.\n\nThis is IGN's review.\n"Between its lack of personality or distinctive, original features of any kind, and completely non-existent multiplayer community, the only memorable aspect is its annoying and frustrating difficulty spikes."\n\nComplete rubbish. It has originality because there just aren't any FPS sci-fied up games like this about. (No comment on multiplayer other than there might be if they gave it a fair review.) The difficulty spikes are a myth. I played through on hard, out of 1 - challenging, 2 - hard, 3 - brutal. I finished only minutes ago, and I never got stuck on a difficulty spike. I was very worried about getting this game because of this comment. However I loved the demo, and risked buying it, and I am glad I did. Sometimes I had to repeat bits, but I loved it coz I was having such a good time. The weapons and the bad guys are sci-fi spot on. Often I passed checkpoints first time.\n\nIt's fairly straight forward. Pick up guns, run over ammo to collect, and shoot the baddies. The plot plays out as you go along, so you just have to get from A-B in one piece. The only time it got tricky was with the boss fights, but I got most of them quite quickly beaten. The last boss may be my favourite all time boss. It was just so cool.  The last level was like it was lifted straight out of the closing twenty mins of an action sci-fi movie.\n\nThe graphics literally sparkle but you don't need a massive rig to run it. Something like a gen 1 i3 3GHz, and a GTX 650, and you're away with it maxed. I added x32 AA in the Nvidia Control Panel so it looked tidy.\n\nMy only criticism is you start every level with a minimum of ammo. Even though you just maybe walked through a door from the last level, you loose heaps of ammo.","June 30, 2014","true","35.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Most criticism I think comes from those that only played the game a little and gave up on it.  This game gets better and better as you play.  Graphics are amazing (even if some trickery is used to acheive them and keep the frame rate up on slower systems).  There are some truly beautiful sights and intricate details in the environs, especially near the halfway point.  Difficulty isn't as bad as it may seem... perseverence and old school pattern recognition pays off.    If you rush in guns blazing like Master Chief, you WILL DIE.  Even at the beginning.  You must have tactics and use cover, playing defensively.  The game is rarely, if ever, "cheap" with its difficulty.  You usually die because you screwed up.  Weapons are satisfying and fun to use.  Enemies are diverse and aggressive.  Soundtrack is decent, and I began to warm up to the quippy companions you radio chat with and the audio logs tell a decent story, even if I was underwhelmed that there's basically no closure to it by the end.  This game is basically the love child of Doom, Halo and Gears of War.  "I was told there were no gears in this!?!"  Self-depricating humor for the win.  I was sad it was over, which is rare for me with shooter campaigns that last more than 8 hours.","January 6, 2015","true","12.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rejzor/recommended/217920/","rejzor","[HiVE] RejZoR","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rejzor/","352 products in account","Hey, it's actually pretty good first person shooter! Graphics are amazing thanks to Unreal Engine and what I have to especially compliment, FOV adjustment that actually works, something you hardly ever see in any modern games these days. Player movement and aiming feels the same as all UE3 engine based games so that's an awesome start, because some games just feel awkward to move around. Not this one. Weapons feel pretty solid and destructive, ranging from projectile "human" weapons to energy based alien weapons. There are tons of bosses to fight and they aren't just gun them down, you sometimes have to think a bit to make them die.\n\nOnly downside are sometimes really crappy placed checkpoints where you might die a lot. And by a lot i mean A LOT. However, despite all the rage (funny how they placed that in teh game title) you'll have, the game will just keep on pushing you forward. You know those moments when game throws this seemingly unbeatable challenge at you and even though you're so close at throwing the game in the bin, you just keep on trying and trying. It's like that. It makes you hate the game so you love it. Weird, I know. The main reason for this are also player perks that give you special boosts. I'm not gonna tell you what they are, play the game and seeing how much you need to unlock them will make you want to play further. I'll just tell you they are so worth it, especially in the last 1/3 of the game. You can also change these perks on the fly so you can adapt to the given combat situation and they can help a lot especially for boss fights.\n\nIt might not have the most complicated story and it took me only a bit over 7 hours to complete, but I have that satisfying feeling in the end. I think the game is greatly underrated and should get a bit more attention. And I think this is by far the best game from City Interactive and actually very decent in general. They used to release very mediocre games, but this one certainly stands out quite a bit. And they even prepared it for a sequel. For a change, I'm actually looking forward to it. Bring me the Alien Rage 2!","January 7, 2015","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LaCr0/recommended/217920/","LaCr0","LaCr0","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LaCr0/","283 products in account","Well this game has rly mixed reviews on the Internet, and I wanted to find out why. At 1st it looks like an oldschool shooter with an awesome sci-fi setting but as soon as you start playing you realize that it's more like Duke Nukem Forever. Mixing Old and New stuff but not doing a rly good job with it.\n\nGraphics:  So the game looks quite nice. However the textures are low res. Sometimes I felt like playing Darsiders II because the game has rly cool aesthetics but the tech is inferior. It runs fairly good on my PC tho there are some places when I felt some FPS drop. The other problem is the variety. You are in a spacestation, a mining facily, an alien mothership, labs....and all of them look the same! Thats a rly big problem with the game. These should have been different from each other in aesthetic wise.\n\nSound:  The game uses many public domain sounds but in a good way. Every sound effect sounds right and nothing feels out of it's place. The weapon sounds are punchy too. The voice acting is nice especially the announcer who sounds almost exactly like Don LaFontaine. The dialogs are funny and cheesy but in a good way. I had some smiles listening them. The music is okay.\n\nGameplay:  So I mentioned DNF at the begining now I tell you why. You have a weapon limit system of 3. The 1st one is the always the same backup pistol and 2 other weapons you can pick up. This means you have basically 2 weapons and a pistol. There are alien and human wariations of the same weapon which is cool but they are basically the same. You can also pick up a minigun but it's basically a carry weapon which means you have to drop it if you wanna use any of your other weapons. Another problem is the regenerating health. I've found myself in cover almost every time I had a fight. And sitting behind chest high walls waiting for my health to regenerate is not fun. And the game is difficult. I died many times on the middle difficulty  (Normal, Hard, Brutal). You can get scores from kills, bonuses and other destructive stuff just like in Bulletstorm. If you have enough points you can unlock perks. These perks can add more firepower, defense, or other bonuses for you. This is a nice little feature but nothing special. However the last perk is cool.\nThere are collectibles like Bonus points and Audio logs, but these are not rly well hidden because of the extremely linear level design. Seriously you are always walking in 1 lane. Sometimes 2 but thats extreme stuff.\n\nReplayability:  You can earn achievements for multiple playthroughs but I think the game is not that great. If it had more variety in aesthetics and level design I would recommend it but in this case it's just a one time run. And it lasts 7,8 hours if you are exploring the levels for hidden stuff.\n\nOverall:   Pros:\nVoice acting\nNice grapics, tho low rez textures\nFunny, cheesy dialoges\nNice animations\nSci-fi aesthetics (which gets boring after 3 hours)\nMusic is okay Cons:\nWeapon limit\nHealth regen\nAlt fire uses shared ammo and not rly differs from each other\nSometimes unfair spawns\nDOF and Motion Blur, however they are used in a less irritating way\nOne of the most annoying flashlights of all time\nInvisible walls, linear level design\nAll cover, no man\nAlien grenade launchers...those things...\nUnskippable cutscenes and checkpoints before them...\nNo autosave or any kind of save feature outside of the checkpoint system\nI died while I was watching a cutscene... very irritating cuz you can't do anything\nYour weapons shoots everywhere without ADS (seriously get rit of ADS is this kind of games)\nYour jump is almost non existent.\nNo vertical gameplay\nVerdict:  This is a mediocre game but has some cool ideas and funny moments. It's not bad but not great either. If you have some time and you liked DNF you are problably going to like this one. I had some good moment and some bad. I'm not recomendig this at full price. I think City Interactive needs good game designers because I can see the talent there but somethings gets in their way every time they want to create a good game.","December 30, 2014","false","9.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The waypoint system could use some tweaking as it's spaced out in fairly far areas that leave you respawning over and over in some annoying spots.

Shooting those aliens is just fun, albeit somewhat frustrating at times, as headshots seem to pop up randomly even if you just load up those 50 bullets in the direction of that alien head. Also some enemies shoot rockets and grenades that deal quite a lot of damage en masse, so be ready to die a lot sometimes.\n\nStill, those ~8 hours of gameplay were fun.\n\nPros:\n- fast paced action\n- alternative fire mode, quite useful\n- story is nothing new, but does not drag down the pace of the action\n- arcade style of the game - just shoot those aliens in the head, explode them, meele kill them and rack up points\n\nCons:\n- most guns are useless - I've beat this game with just an alien rifle and a rocket launcher\n- visuals are really poor sometimes\n- cheap deaths\n- misplaced checkpoints\n\nIt is worth to play, but not at such a price as 20 Euros. Check out game bundles, you can buy it cheap from time to time. Good game, but for one playthrough.\n\n___\n\nDobra gra akcji, choć momentami potrafi podnieść ciśnienie. Same spluwy są dość standardowe jeśli ktoś grał w gry takie jak Quake i Unreal Tournament, chociaż niestety, tylko kilka z nich jest użytecznych.\n\nPerki to ciekawy pomysł, tyle że wiele z nich nie pokorzystamy, bo pojawiają się dość późno (ot trzeba zebrać ileś tam punktów by je odblokować) i w sumie to nie wprowadzają za dużego urozmaicenia - ot wybierz czy wolisz zadawać +10% obrażeń z karabinu czy też mieć +10% większą szybkostrzelność. Coś w tym stylu.\n\nNie powiem, grało mi się dobrze, może to po prostu urok tego typu przeciętnych strzelanek - podobny poziom jakości co w tytułach takich jak Singularity.\n\nPlusy:\n- szybka akcja\n- fabuła nie zamula\n- alternatywny tryp strzelania jest całkiem klawy\n- arcade'owy styl gry - strzelaj, rozwalaj bossów, zbieraj punkty\n\nMinusy:\n- tanizna w postaci przeciwników grenadierów\n- grafika czasami nie daje rady - widać ładujące się tekstury\n- checkpointy są słabo rozstawione, nieraz trzeba powtarzać dłuższy etap\n\nKupić za 20 euro nie warto. Ja kupiłem w jakiejś paczce gier i właśnie w takich paczkach ta gra czasami się pojawia.\n\nPozytywnie się zaskoczyłem.

It even one-ups the previously mentioned game because it allows for iron-sight shots. The AI is also pretty impressive as even if you run back the way you came down a corridor to avoid being overwhelmed, the aliens will not just wait for you to come back but will come-the-f*ck after you and in a big hurry.\nIn short, good mindless fun FPS like Quake 1 and FEAR 1 without throwing in tryhard gimicks that would ruin the game. The only real negative compared to the old-school FPS is you can only carry 2 guns at a time, other than that it easily holds a place beside old-school FPS games.","May 30, 2014","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If I had known how entertaining this game actually was I would have bought it a long time ago.  The graphics are pretty good and the game holds a steady frame rate of 60...  Most of the time.  You can die very easily but it's pretty fair about giving you a lot of checkpoints so it never gets repetitive. now, the environments all pretty much look similar but they're very well designed so it never really got boring to look at.  The enemies were fun throughout to blow to pieces as well as the boss fights.  I read a lot about people being frustrated about how hard the game was event on easy but I didn't find it too bad.  It does get frustrating at times but it's just the right amount to stay fun instead of making you want to uninstall it.  It actually reminded me a lot of bullets storm which is never a bad thing.  Actually, I would say if you enjoy bullets storm this one is definitely something you might want to look into.","February 22","true","11.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Decent graphics with pretty colors that runs smoothly, with a steeper difficulty.  I started this game on hard, the second out of three difficulty levels.  Halfway through the game I switched the game down to normal because some areas just felt impossible on hard.  The game throws you into it with a quick cutscene intro and a couple other very quick cutscenes.  Most of the story will be told through audio logs you pick up.  The ai will take cover but most of the time they just rush you, it does not take much to take you out.  You will have grenades shot at you a lot and there are plenty of things that the enemies and yourself can blowup.  The shoot-outs were still fun and fast paced but most of the combat can easily be handled by waiting for the enemies to run around the corner.  Shooting enemies in the head is very effective even on harder enemies (not bosses) and the sound when you get a headshot is my favorite thing about Alien Rage.\n\nI recommend this game if you want a fast shooter.

They are depicted as collectibles, roughly 3 to be found on each map. If you play it and walk away, you won't be able to hear it. If you play it and get attacked by aliens then you won't be able to hear it. Thus it is like a little extra add on to the game, much like the bonus collectibles.\n\nDespite this, the games visuals blew me away, the difficulty was spot on and the game is over all, intense! The environment starts to all look the same after a while but nonetheless, it  looks absolutely stunning. I'd never heard of this game before seeing it in an inexpensive bundle so understandably, my expectations weren't too high.\n\nThe boss' in the game do pose a bit more of a challenge which I appreciate. Each boss is normally just the same as the last boss but with an addon function, say a jetpack or a minigun ect. Although, they create a unique experience and it doesn't feel repetitive and is overall a  good experience.\n\nIf you're a gamer who likes a good story with your FPS chaos then I would recommend to give this one a miss, but if you're just looking to enjoy shooting things with nice scenery then I would definitely say to give it a try.","February 1","true","5.7"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

The gun play is really good, and I had a blast for the first few levels. Its main issue is the lack of variety in level design and look. Aside from the bosses and the odd turret section all the levels look....the same. The scoring system is simular to Bulletstorm with points being scored for different kills but sadly theres not enough of them so what could have been awesome just feels unfinished.\nTheres alot of stuffy reviews about this game which I personally feel is due to 1 thing - This game is balls to the wall hard. Even at the lowest difficulty the enemies cut you in half if you dont look out. I started it at middle difficulty - I put it down 5 minutes later.\nThis game is a cheap blast, pick it up on a sale and if you like FPS's you will most likely have a few hours fun with this.\n\n","December 22, 2015","true","9.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It even one-ups the previously mentioned game because it allows for iron-sight shots. The AI is also pretty impressive as even if you run back the way you came down a corridor to avoid being overwhelmed, the aliens will not just wait for you to come back but will come-the-f*ck after you and in a big hurry.\nIn short, good mindless fun FPS like Quake 1 and FEAR 1 without throwing in tryhard gimicks that would ruin the game. The only real negative compared to the old-school FPS is you can only carry 2 guns at a time, other than that it easily holds a place beside old-school FPS games.","May 30, 2014","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I liked so much, when I paid I didn't believe that was a good game, but after play I can say: It's a great game, like UT or GoW. An excellent game by a little price. I RECOMMEND!","June 19, 2015","true","19.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"
