An evenly paced colourful plat-former, about 5 hours in story mode but provides additional length through challenge stages unlocked by maximizing designated hidden in game tokens.  The Steam leader-boards are an exceptional touch.   Not in the vein of Super Meat Boy or any other punishing plat-formers, OOZI is a plat-former that you can actually finish and have a pleasant time while doing so.\n\nDifficulty selection ranges from "Kid" to "Hardcore" though the latter just makes the game slightly more challenging.  Players are not punished for failure and retuned to checkpoints with previously collected assets intact, which means that for example, discovered secrets persist on restarting checkpoints.\n\nThere are numerous game play mechanics which vary the experience.  Additionally, OOZI introduces "Quantum Ghosts", holographic recordings of other players that appear in your game.  This also means that your game-play is being recorded as well for an appearance in other OOZI instances.\n\nThe layouts of the levels are homogeneous and are only distinguished by theme and obstacles.  More diversity in this regard would of been welcomed.  The controls are tight enough for precision movement though I felt that the wall mechanics could of been better implemented.\n\nOOZI: An Earth Adventure featuring a nice array of Steamworks features; Steam Achievements, Leader-boards, Cloud Save, Trading Cards and Full Controller Support.  The developer is also very responsive.  I reported a broken achievement and it was fixed in 10 minutes.   Their hard work is apparent by the high level of polish and Steam features that have been applied to this adorable plat-former.","December 18, 2013","true","13.1"," 38 of 46 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","38","46","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/citrine/recommended/257990/","citrine","ゆき","http://steamcommunity.com/id/citrine/","594 products in account","Well let's start out with the good. The rendered 2D World is absolutely beautiful. A lot of vibrant colours, whimsical looking enemies. Oozi is very reminiscent of games like Rayman Origins and Legends. A very cartoon like visual that's fun and eye pleasing. The animations do not feel completely fluid, however, that does not mean it detracts from the rest of the visuals.\n\nEach new world is pleasant and visually pleasing, each one different from the last to keep you entertained. The game offers a plethora of visual cues to warn the player of an incoming and/or timed trap. I never felt like the game was trying to pull a fast one and sneak in a random kill on me.\n\nThe platforming mechanics are solid with tight controls. Oozi never felt sluggish when jumping or turning. Any time I missed a jump or fell it felt like it was my fault by dropping an input or jumping too soon. Being able to chain multiple jumps and bouncing off opponents just feels so natural in this game. One jump to the next is fluid, mid air turns are quick and responsive. Oozi does feel a little floaty while jumping, but I don't feel this is a problem with the mechanics and most of the time it was advantatious to use this floatiness.\n\nThe only complaint I have with the mechanics is the Wall Jumping, it's very clunky and slow. I found it can be incredibly frustrating to deal with. Perhaps I've been spoiled by other platformers that feature wall jumping, but I just can't dismiss this. All in all the mechanics are solid though and wall Jumping is just a small part of the entire game.\n\nThe game has four different difficulty modes ranging from Kid to Hardcore. Higher difficulty modes typically add more enemies, lower Oozi's life hearts by one and adds more traps to each level. Kid mode is unique in that Oozi has a much higher jump. While the game is certainly never difficult to the point you want to tear your hair out it never claims to be that way. If you're looking for a Super Meat Boy difficult then it's probably best to avoid this game. If you want a fun and relaxing platforming experience that can some of the time offer a difficult challenge then look no more.\n\nThe game features three game modes. A Main story that follows Oozi in the search of his lost spacesuit and spaceship. Each level is followed up by a cute comic describing his adventures and to provide some semblance of a plot. As you progress the main story you unlock new abilities for Oozi such as the ability to Wall Jump or "Pound" Enemies. This kept things slightly more fresh as you progress and adds more elements to the platforming experience. While the levels can be fairly long the game offers plentiful amount of checkpoints in case of screwups. Each world has its own unique boss that are pattern based and felt slightly on the easy side. This isn't exactly a huge problem, but I would have liked to see more random elements added to bosses.\n\nThe second mode is the Challenge Mode. Challenge mode presents you with a variety of challenges ranging from something as easy as Completing the level to killing a specific set of opponents. There are also a variety of bonus challenges within each level to add a layer of difficulty to further challenge the player. Arcade Mode is the third and final mode. It offers a timed checkpoint based challenge. The main objective is to complete the level with as many points as possible and not dying the entire way. You do earn health through so missed jumps or damage skips are possible to save time. There is a bunch of bonus content to keep you interested. I feel there might be slightly too many challenge levels, but that's just a personal opinion on that.\n\nOozi: Earth Adventure offers a great platforming experience for any fan of the genre. It harkens back to the day of old school platforming where mechanics were solid and tight. It doesn't try to be more than that, but I don't believe the developers are trying to be different. Oozi offers a refined platforming experience many of us grew up with. I can't help but recommend this game to anyone who's a fan of platformers.\n\nPros:\n- Great Visuals and easy to navigate menus.\n- Refined Classic Platforming Experience.\n- Fairly good music that fits the games aesthetics.\n- Great Value for a lot of content.\n\nCons:\n- Some clunky mechanics like Wall Jumping.\n- Bosses feel too predictable.\n- Some levels feel too long even with checkpoints.\n- Occasional Crashing.","December 11, 2013","true","17.7"," 22 of 27 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","22","27","0","0"

No its perfect.\n+ Funny story and cut-scenes, a lot of levels to play around 40 on story mode, and a lot of different levels and worlds to beat, and some really fun boss battles.\n+ Fun doesnt end here. Over 80+ arcade and challenge levels that unlocks as you play the story.\n+ It has ghost system, which shows your steam friend's character playing next to you as a ghost, you can set it to "random" or "best score", kinda fun seeing them and trying to go faster than they did.\n+ Controls are simple and good.\n+ Overall the characters they all look so adorable I just love this about the game, they all look livelike and their animations are really great, and the world just looks amazing.\n\nCons- Double jump is very overpowered, you can basically ignore so many platforms and enemies by double jumping without having to go through the platforms near them.\n- Both wall-jump and wall-grab abilities are very annoying to use, you get used to it eventually, however its still difficult and unsatisfying.\n- the 5 stars on each level which should be a bit hard to find are actually easy to find and I finished the game without missing one.\n\nRating I give this game 8.9/10, its really fun and spent a lot of time playing it since it delivers a lot of fun levels to play, and a lot of achievements to grind on.\n\nAnd seriously the bosses, the enemies, everything looks so great the style they chose to do this is the reason i picked this game without even checking a gameplay footage before.\n","July 14, 2015","true","3.6"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","16","18","0","0"

Some levels can be frustratingly difficult, but it feels damn satisfying to get to a checkpoint after the tough parts. I'm glad there are various checkpoints throughout the levels, since they are relatively long.\n\nThe game consists of four worlds with five levels and a boss fight in each world. The environments, enemies, and music are all unique to each world. I have to say that I loved the soundtrack. Even on challenging levels where I was forced to listen to the same song for tens of minutes, I was still bobbbing my head to it. Along with the story mode, there are also over 30 challenge levels to prolong the experience.","February 23, 2014","true","7.6"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

But I'd hesitate to call it any more than that.  It's certainly playable, basically bug-free, and accomplishes what it sets out to do, but it just...doesn't seem to feel all that fun, to me.\n\nSpecifically, the gameplay feels very, very linear and constrained.  There are few "creative" solutions possible to problems -- it's like, there's the obvious solution, and then that's it, and any attempt to try something less obvious will result in failure.\n\nPros:\n+ nice, colorful visual designs\n+ simple, easy-to-learn controls\n+ vaguely interesting storyline, with visual details that correspond to it\n+ secrets are easy to find (good for completionist nuts).\n+ low basic difficulty (good for people new to platformers, such as children).\n+ bonus challenge levels for more advanced players.\nCons:\n- is too long to keep interest.  The gameplay stays largely the same, through all the levels.  While some enemies are defeated in different ways, and new stage hazards are introduced, the core gameplay of non-boss levels is essentially identical.  Each level drags on a little, and then having all these levels just drags it on even longer.\n- some boss fights are rather tedious.  Example: the second area boss (the rock boss) -- if you screw up twice or touch the lava, then you just have to wait through that whole cycle again.\n- gameplay doesn't lend itself to easy skipping.  If you screwed up earlier and respawned at a checkpoint, you'll still have to go past those same obstacles.  Though at least in this current version, stars stay collected and enemies don't respawn, which is a good thing.  (Bomb walls respawn, though.)\n- controls are a little floaty in some ways.  (e.g. jump height)  Hit detection is pretty reasonable, though.\n- some inconsistencies.  For example, red-aura enemies are supposed to be invulnerable, but some can be defeated, while some enemies without red auras are invulnerable.  If you're going for max points, this will annoy you.\n- gameplay leaves very little room for creativity.  Moving faster is one example, speeding up boss fights is another.  You just can't do these things.  Crushing stone blocks are designed such that you can't run past two of them at once and you simply must wait for them one by one.  You can't move fast enough to pelt that boss with two bombs in one cycle, nor can you pick up bombs in mid-air.\n\nThe soundtrack is okay -- not particularly notable.  It becomes a little repetitive, but this is because (1) the same track gets used over multiple levels, and especially (2) the track starts playing from the beginning every time Oozi dies and respawns, making it more repetitive than is necessary.\n\nOverall, this is a platformer with simple, straightforward, easy-to-learn controls, which are decent (albeit a little floaty).  I'd recommend this for people who are looking for a first-timer's platformer, especially for children given the flavor elements (i.e. the whole story about an alien visiting Earth, which looks nothing like Earth anyway in the game, haha), and it's a solid game in that regard, though there are probably better offerings out there, such as Mutant Mudds Deluxe with its very good learning curve which leads it from easy to more challenging gameplay.  Meanwhile, anyone who's played at least a few platformers will probably find this rather boring.\n\n(Disclosure: I acquired this game as part of the Groupees Build a Greenlight Bundle.)","March 16, 2015","false","5.6"," 24 of 36 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","24","36","0","0"

For children this gives you some nice options. Personally I wouldn't bother with the different difficulty settings and just start on Hardcore because it's not unforgiving, it just gives you less hits to take (but you have checkpoints anyway).Im indifferent on the story because to be fair, it's as generic as can be. Personally I didn't find too much about the game 'funny' but this might be a thing of taste, because other people have been finding things in the game funny.\n\nNegatives:\nThere's quite a few flaws that make this game a rather mediocre to even bad experience.\nTime-wasting mechanics: The cycles....  Spike-cycles, you have to hide in the background in this corridor enemy-cycles, basic enemy cycles. Besides this there's also the classic 'things that shoot from the ceiling-cycles' that you have to wait for. It doesn't really add anything to the gameplay, it just makes things tedious and disrupts your flow in the game.\nThere's just nothing special about the game, it's about as generic as can be.\nSlippery floors at places where floors aren't supposed to be slippery.\nHitboxes that just aren't right, on enemies as well as the edges of platforms (sometimes you fall through them, sometimes you can 'walljump' off them).\nThe game/platforming is really repetitive.\nThere's been a couple of times that the camera started to glitch out for a few frames in a row (mostly on auto-scroll level challenges).\nI'll give this game 6 out of 10 and recommend it based on the fact that it doesn't do too much wrong, it seems to be a matter of taste if you enjoy the style of gameplay yes or no.","January 17","true","9.7"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

Without replaying for extra achievements, I put in 5 hours to beat it, so it only cost me somewhere around 20 cents for each hour played so far.\n+ The art... both levels and characters... are excellent, and the goofier ones remind me of beloved cartoon characters and props, like the Three Eyed Fish from The Simpsons.\n+ Much like the Super Mario series does with coins, collecting the abundance of stars gives you a sense of fun and satisfaction.\n+ The length of the game is perfect, and although there are only 4 worlds, there is enough to explore in each of the worlds' levels that it feels as if there are more.\n+ Upon completion of each of the first three worlds, you get a new powerup that helps you on your quest and provides a new gameplay mechanic (e.g. gloves that allow you to latch onto walls.)\n+ Ever download one of those free Mario clones from Google Play? Imagine someone actually spent time on the level design, didn't throw a bunch of ads at you, and actually updated the gameplay mechanics as you go along (such as the aforementioned glove example.) Such is Oozi!\n+ No gimmicky puzzles: pure platforming!\n\nSome nuanced critiques:\n\n- The difficulty of the bosses isn't the most balanced... I found the second boss to be much more difficult than the third and fourth bosses. They also can be time consuming to defeat, so it can be a little aggravating when you almost have your battle won, die, and then realize you have at least several more minutes to go to get back to being as close to beating that boss as you just were.\n- Oozi's death groan got under my skin a little, and after awhile I found myself imitating it in order to cover up the game's loud and croaky rendition of it.\n- The ending is really short.\n\nRecommended: Absolutely. It plays like a classic 2D platformer, and though it doesn't reinvent the wheel, there's certainly nothing wrong with that.","January 28, 2015","true","7.5"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

The sound fits in very well with the game's atmosphere.

The game has 4 difficulties, but even the hardest HARDCORE one isn't much of a challenge. Sometimes is harder, but you'll never be stuck for long. The bosses are kinda dull and repetitive. And the story leaderboard is broken, because hitting bosses and dying will keep netting you points, even after retrying. So, if i beat a boss on the first try, i get 2000 points. If i hit him 2 times and lose, the retry and beat him, i get 4000 points. It just doesn't work. But the challenging mode is cool. Although it's never overwhelming, it's challenging. And i hated the arcade mode. It's a cheap way to extend the game's life, because you have to play the story levels again, but this time with a timer. And getting max rank is hard, because the stages are long, and if you lose you have to start from the beggining. It isn't fun. At least the challenges are shorter and fresh. But the arcade mode just fells cheap. But beside these flaws, it's a good game, just not as hard as you may expect. Like i said before, it's a fun casual platforming.","June 8, 2015","true","37.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","5","5","2","1"

If you're a fan of platformers this is a good title to have in your collection.\n\nOverall Oozi: Earth Adventure is a great platformer at a decent price. They've designed this game to appeal to all ages. There are several difficulty levels from Casual all the way to Hardcore. As you play you unlock challenging bonus stages--stages such as avoid the rising water or collect everything in a given time period.\n\nThe levels are varied enough and the occasional boss fights are great. There isn't much of a storyline but that is something common in platformers. Sound effects are okay but the music gets a little bit repetitive if you are trying for the high scores on some of the harder levels.\n\nAt normal difficulty you can expect to get through the main levels in about 6 hours and the bonus levels in another 3 hours. If you play at the hardest difficulties, and go for everything, you can easily expect to invest more than 20 hours in this game. Gameplay can get repetitive or feel like a grind, especially if you are trying to unlock everything, the modes and challenges available are varied but the levels you play on sometimes start feeling too similar.\n\nThey've taken the time to polish the game and add Steamworks features too. You'll find cloud save, working leaderboards, and even achievements.","December 9, 2014","true","7.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

But to me, I think it is a little (and I do mean LITTLE) gem in a sea of games of various qualities and polish.\n\nOozi is a humble platformer about a Rayman Wannabe who crashes his ship on a random planet, and thus is thrusted onto a quest to get his stuff back and return home. Storywise, it isn't much, but in this day and age, I suppose a simple plot is better than the overly dramatic stuff you get nowadays.\n\nOnce you get into the first level, though, the game certainly does start to charm you, with its lovely art style, its decent soundtrack (That is forgettable, but still nice to listen to throughout the game), and its easy to learn gameplay. It isn't a hard game persay, but it isn't a walk in the park either. I had times where the game did surprise me with some challenging platforming, which kept me interested and provided some satisfaction when I managed to survive past a difficult challenge to the next checkpoint. The game also throws out some interesting (if short lived) gimmics at you as well to spice levels up as you continue on your quest, from rock titans that can only be killed with short-fused bombs to security systems that require timing and smart jumps to avoid in order to progress through a part of the level. Sadly, many of these gimmics are often one level only, which is a shame they don't use some of these gimmics more often, because some of them really are interesting.\n\nIn the case of Bosses, there are four worlds each, with a boss in each of them. Ironicly, the first boss might be the hardest, because every boss I fought afterwards (even the FINAL BOSS) was rather mild. They still kept you on your toes, but they didn't seem awfully threatening. Really, the levels before the boss is where all the fun is, what with all the secret stars you can collect in each level to unlock challenge levels you can play to, well, challenge yourself, so there is at least a bit of replay value after the story is complete.\n\nSure, this game isn't the best platformer out there, it isn't gonna get any "oooohs" or "Ahhhhs" or even "11 out of 10s" out of you, but if you are looking for a decent little platformer that you can easily get into that'll provide a satisfying experience for a low cost, this is worth checking out. For anyone expecting something more intense, though... Look elsewhere.","November 26, 2014","true","3.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This is how the game is officially described and although it does fit the description well, it does have a few flaws that certainly take away from the experience\n\nEssentially, Oozi: Earth Adventure is just straight-up platforming. No gimmicks, just platforms. This did appeal to me before I started playing it, but then I realized how repetitive that could become. The gameplay itself is relatively simple, as that is how the game is advertised. It does have all of the platforming basics, movement, jumping, moving platforms, gaping holes, etc. There are also enemies that can be destroyed in a variety of ways, depending on the type of enemy. Usually, enemies are destroyed simply by jumping onto them, Mario-style, but some can only be killed by a ground-pound and some just cannot be killed.\n\nYou also have your basic platforming obstacles, like moving platforms, spike traps, lava pits, etc. Very basic features. The game adds little to differentiate itself from other platformers, but I do tend to review games based on what they are, instead of what they're not, and this game is advertised as a classical platformer anyways. This would certainly appeal to platforming fans looking for a simple, laid-back experience that takes about four hours to beat. The game also features amazing visuals, as well as amazing music. The music is very fitting to its corresponding world, with each world having its own personality.\n\nThe world and level design is well-executed, each world having its own special set enemies, obstacles, music, etc. I really enjoyed the third world, which was inside a laboratory with bright white walls and radioactive waste everywhere. The gameplay can become repetitive at parts, especially when you get stuck at one checkpoint and end up dying a dozen times trying to reach the next checkpoint. Most of the checkpoints in the game were reasonably placed, but a few were placed a little too far out, causing me much frustration as I died repeatedly just trying to reach said checkpoint. I would sometimes die a few steps from the checkpoint and have to redo my whole run from the previous checkpoint, which I found very aggravating.\n\nThe game seems to be lacking in replayability, however. The only reason I can see someone replaying this is to get a higher score for a higher position on the leaderboards (which I placed 13th in after I beat the game) or to collect the hidden stars in each level, which unlock more stages to play, like challenge and arcade stages. The challenge stages were simply the same as their corresponding stage, just with a few extra objectives, like not taking damage, or beating it in a certain time.\n\nOverall, Oozi: Earth Adventure can find its true audience in those looking for a simplistic platforming experience. Although the game has limited mechanics and repetitive gameplay, it's still a new experience that platforming fans can take up just for the fun of it. Oh, I'd also like to point out Oozi's smile. Just look at that! The corners of his mouth GOES ABOVE HIS EYES.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Znj♥♥♥1ShfE","December 6, 2013","true","8.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Oozi: Earth Adventure is a game where you play as an alien named Oozi as he crash lands on earth. His goal is to get his things back.\n\nOverall, Oozi is a generic platformer. There is literally nothing new here. If you enjoy a platformer with good controls, decent level design, but is generic to the point where it feels like you've nearly played this before, then it might be an enjoyable experience. Levels drag on immensely. It can take you up to 20 minutes to finish a level and by the time you get to the end of it you're just happy it is over. Boss fights are predictable and follow bland patterns. I beat the final boss in one try without it being a hassle.\n\nThe art style is appealing. It's nearly a high-resolution version of the original Rayman or something similar. It's fun to look at and some of the environments are interesting.\n\nI suggest waiting for the price to get lower before picking this up. The game advertises as an "old school" experience like you had during your childhood, but you can pick up games like Sonic the Hedgehog on Steam for half of  this price. Maybe wait until it is 5 dollars on a Steam sale.","December 5, 2013","false","8.2"," 27 of 51 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","27","51","0","0"

I used level "Normal" which was good for gaming if you have any experience about platformers before that.\n\nShortly said, this game was excellent platformer. Controls was made very well and it was a pleasant experience to play. There were no lots of buttons to learn so you could just start and play and game will teach you in game all what you need to know.\n\nMusic was nice, only some loop starts did not sound to match perfectly but not a problem. Also the graphics were awesome. It is very easy to recommend this platformer to others.\n\nIf I would have to whine about something then I'd like to say that sometimes levels were too long. It is not a problem if you have lots of time, but I personally prefer levels which takes about 5 minutes to play though. That is surely just a personal preference and your mileage may vary. Shorter levels would give you more possibility to do quick gaming sessions. Anyway this is not a big deal in this game because it was so great anyway.\n\nAnother one what I'd like to whine is that it would have been nice to see some short video or something in the end.

The art is quite nice, animation is smooth, and the overall style is bright and quirky.\n\nThe challenge level varies wildly, though.  There checkpoints are placed in some strange areas, where you could easily get stuck redoing a large section of the level because of a really tricky part just before another checkpoint.  However, it's impossible to "lose", since if you die you just reappear at the last checkpoint, and you can retry as long as your patience hold out.","December 5, 2014","true","28.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/recommended/257990/","Harley365","Harley365","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/","212 products in account","\nPoor Oozi. The perpetually grinning yellow alien isn't likely to join peers like Mario, Meat Boy, Rayman, and Sonic among the ranks of the platforming protagonist elite anytime soon. Awesome Games Studio has indeed erected a vibrant and deadly world for its fledgling hero to charge through, but for all its visual creativity, Oozi: Earth Adventure is missing a certain spark to elevate it beyond its by-the-numbers approach to the platforming genre. It touches on all of the familiar bases without adding anything particularly interesting to the mix. That doesn't make it a bad game, though finding a reason to keep plugging away when the unflinching difficulty gnashes its teeth is a struggle.\n\nStars boost your health and your score.\n\nOozi is a likable-enough fellow. He's cheerful, slightly dim-witted, and prone to dying from the littlest of scratches. His day job as an intergalactic deliveryman hits a snag when he runs out of fuel and crash-lands on planet Earth--only this isn't quite the Earth you're accustomed to. Overrun by strange critters and humanoid aliens that are wrecking the place, Earth isn't such a friendly planet anymore. It's here where Oozi wakes up alone and without all of his high-tech doodads to help him. His quest to recover pieces of his missing gear and ultimately find his ship so he can be on his merry way starts off simple but soon ratchets up to a serious challenge.\n\nAt its core, Oozi: Earth Adventure is a no-nonsense 2D platformer that draws many of its mechanics from classic games of the past. Rather than innovating, it's concerned solely with testing your reflexes and your patience as you zip along and navigate your way through increasingly insidious stages littered with deadly obstacles. Checkpoints are liberally scattered at first, though they stretch out in the later stages that really push you to master the environments through repetition. Oozi can only run and jump to start, but recovering pieces of his missing suit grants additional abilities that change the gameplay up in mostly predictable ways. Before long, you can double-jump, butt-stomp, punch enemies, and wall-jump. But even as new skills are added to your repertoire, none of them feel particularly exciting. They're familiar to a fault; the constant recycling of old ideas saps much of the sense of reward you get from earning new powers.\n\nDespite their mundane scope, these fundamental abilities are still handy as the environments get tougher and throw bigger challenges your way. Sneaky stage designs quickly scale upward in complexity to ensure your trek isn't an easy one. Spikes, monsters, lasers, platforms, and all manner of other obstacles are meticulously placed to provide maximum irritation. Reaching checkpoints becomes an especially grueling process in the latter half of the game.\n\nOut of the woods and into the mad scientist's lab.\n\nThe fact that environmental dangers do get a little more inventive as you go helps balance some of the frustration of dying over and over again. Hauling and hurling timed explosives through long stretches to take down walls is an interesting and nerve-racking challenge. Ducking into the background to avoid monsters is clever too, and the screen-warping visual effect that kicks in as you approach running out of air in poison-gas zones is a nice touch. These accoutrements complement the overall excellent visual design. Oozi: Earth Adventure is a sharp-looking game.\n\nStaying alive is a tricky endeavor. Oozi is a fragile fellow, but collecting a certain number of stars as you jump and pummel through each stage does let you boost your health. Hunting down special bonus stars also unlocks extra stages to play in Challenge mode. Infinite lives is the ultimate savior here, since death comes frequently--sometimes even seconds after your last respawn. Oozi's jump mechanics and midair responsiveness aren't always as tight as they need to be for certain maneuvers. Wall jumping in particular feels off too. Despite hitting the controls with precise timing, you won't always stick or rebound as you should, and these sequences turn into aggravating wrestling matches with the game mechanics that frequently end with a drop to your doom.\n\nAs a result, pushing through tough spots to hit the next checkpoint can feel grindy, though your reward for making it is not having to ever replay that same stretch again. That is, unless you're a true glutton for punishment. Arcade mode lets you revisit stages for speed runs that have you pushing to a high score as fast as possible. Challenge mode is more enjoyable, since it offers up fresh stages with primary and secondary goals to complete.\n\nWho knew that such evil could leap from the sea?\n\nIt's hard to fault Oozi: Earth Adventure for simply sticking to what works within its genre, like so many other games before it. But there's not much here that feels fresh or exciting. The platforming action poses a formidable challenge and offers some nice variety across its diverse areas, but it's disappointing that this cartoonish adventure rarely pushes beyond the bounds out of its tidy, safe little box. Being generic and sporadically punishing doesn't totally outweigh the fun, as there is some to be found here, and the frustrating moments are pushed through with a bit of patience. Oozi: Earth Adventure just doesn't do enough to stand out in a crowd of similar games.\n\nThe Good\nNicely crafted visuals and art direction\nStages are cleverly designed\n\nThe Bad\nMajor game mechanics lack originality\nHeinous difficulty spikes hamper the fun toward the latter half of the game\nMovement controls are spotty when wall-jumping and in midair","April 27","true","1.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I wish there were more games like this on Steam. They are fun to play and remind me of the good ol' days.","April 18, 2014","true","9.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For me the story mode took a bit of time and was worth it. As you may of seen in the other reviews, the game is very repetitive and not even that fun in comparison to other platformers. I am not the biggest fan of puzzle platformers, but this one kept me entertained for a good amount of time. It has a lot of features to keep to playing like arcade mode, story mode and challenge mode. None of those are that challenging but it's a nice amount of levels for a game thats $5. I actually got this game for less so for me it was worth the money. In my opinion $5 might be a bit much unless you are trying to 100% it or get all the achievements. The game is very colorful and playful which is nice to see from a casual indie game. Also the fact that this game has achievements, leaderboards, Steam Trading Cards and controller support is a big plus for me. I have only played this game with a controller and although sometimes it can be finicky, that could just be me, The trading cards are nice for people trying to level their account or just for people you want to make a few cents. The achievements aren't that hard either but what can you expect from a small indie platformer.\n\nAll in all I think most people should give this game a shot because it's a lot of fun and has a lot of features that will keep you coming back again and again.","November 8, 2015","true","30.5"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

The story is pretty much nonexistent, but the fun level is there. The game introduces new mechanics at (an almost too) leisurely rate. The challenge level overall is pretty average, but it can be significantly raised for fans of games such as Mr. Bree+ and Super Meatboy.  Enemies stay dead once you've killed them, though, even if you have to repeat a section, so if a particular area is giving you a hard time, you can clear it first before attempting to navigate the environmental hazards. 5 hidden "secret stars" on each level provide a bit of replay value.\n\nThe Good: Bright, crisp, colorful graphics,with beautiful detail. Controls are fairly responsive, although Oozi does do a tiny slide upon landing that can be a bit annoying on particularly tight jumps.\nThe Bad: No options to configure controls (what is this, 1996?). Does not recognize any controller except for Xbox 360. There is no way to see how many secret stars you've collected on the current playfield.\nThe Indifferent: Music is acceptable, if redundant. Hitbox is sometimes wonky, and the camera occasionally tweaks out.\nRecommended? Yes, but I'd wait for a bundle or sale, as $10 seems a bit steep, especially with minimal configuration options and no way to rebind keys.","August 22, 2014","true","2.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thedarkchaplain/recommended/257990/","thedarkchaplain","DarkChaplain","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thedarkchaplain/","2659 products in account","I first finished this game around May or June 2013 after I got it from a Greenlight bundle. I loved it for the art direction, the simple mechanics that induced nostalgia in me, and the comfortable gamepad controls (I would not play a game like this with mouse and keyboard, out of personal preference).\n\nHaving grown up during the old age of "jump & run" games, or platformers, I felt right at home with Oozi. It pulled all the right strings for me, and made me remember my old Sega days with all those simple yet enjoyable games.\n\nOozi has 24 levels in its story mode (whereas the story is just a basic framing on loading screens and between the four zones), of which 4 are boss fights. That may not seem much compared to games like Super Meat Boy or A Walk in the Dark, but it certainly is enough in this case.\nLevels can last a good amount of time, depending on difficulty and skill level. You'll definitely get many more hours out of the game than out of pretty much any modern shooter.\n\nOn top of the main levels, however, the game also comes with an Arcade Mode, which puts you back into those levels with a more specific goal than reaching the end: Collect as many stars as you can before the timer runs out. If you die, start from the beginning. Checkpoints replenish a bit of time, which is very tight all the way through the level. If you finish the level, you will get a rating from one to three stars, depending on the amount of stars you caught.\nThis is quite tricky in a lot of levels, and will require almost perfect runs to get 3 stars.\n\nThere are also Challenge and Bonus missions, with varying goals. From reaching the end of the level while avoiding rising water to "kill all enemies" missions, you'll get a lot of action. Additionally, those, too, have two additional goals each. All three goals need to be met for a three star rating. And they run on a timer!\nThese missions are tough as nails, and will probably infuriate you a lot. However, they are satisfying to beat, and well-designed - if you are good at platformers, test yourself on them!\n\nThe overall level design of Oozi is simple on first glance, without any elaborately hidden secrets (not unless you run through levels blindly), but the trap and enemy placement really builds a nice difficulty curve.\nWhile you start out with only your basic double-jump and can only knock out basic enemies, every zone delivers a new set of skills and mechanics. This ranges from stomping over wall-jumping to picking up bombs, punching stunned enemies and hiding in shadows. The traps get more mean as the game progresses, and while a lot of them and the enemies are similar or just visually different from previous encounters, the sheer variety of things that may kill you is a plus.\n\nTruth be told, the game still has some glitches and bugs here and there (restarting one challenge mission would get the objective stuck, for example), but nothing that would really deter from the game's enjoyment. Those things are easily fixed and worked around.\n\nAs it stands I would recommend Oozi: Earth Adventure to fans of platformers, and oldschool platformers specifically. It is a refreshingly enjoyable game without any of the more "pretentious" elements or big stories, and simply focuses on challenging the player. Which it does excellently!

It was rather lackluster in performance.\n\nCons\n-The storyline was poorly done. (it was told with text on pictures,no animations or anything)\n-The humour in the game was crude at best.

The boss fights had Oozi- Not very bright yellow thing (or something like that) vs. I dont remember specifically but one of them said "he also smells"\n-The boss fights were fairly simple, easily done in one go.\n-The "challenge levels" were not very challenging imo.\n\nOverall I feel like Oozi compares with a browser type platforming game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maghook/recommended/257990/","maghook","Maghook","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maghook/","1308 products in account","Oozi: Earth Adventure is a game for children, including those that have never played a video game before, who have little to no expectations. The game is focused less about quality and more about being able to let players freely progress through a game without constantly dying. Fortunately enough there is a kid specific difficulty level suited for these players.\n\nThere is no charm here, at least none that would satisfy and keep the attention of a child. No idle animations, no funny voices or sound effects, no memorable soundtrack (which is on a very noticeable short loop). There are DOS games that are filled with more fanciful flavour and variety than this and it doesn't help that Oozi: Earth Adventure does absolutely nothing to progress the tired, old, trope-filled platforming genre; floating platforms, ground spikes, climbing up vines, stomping on monsters, enemies who fly side-to-side, etc.\n\nThe controls are clunky and unresponsive. Climbing walls is an absolute chore and you will often find yourself flying into a deadly trap or another enemy due to the floaty control scheme. Every level slowly progresses with a variety of enemies and each chapter concludes with a boss fight. Once you've started the next chapter you soon come to realise that the new enemies you're facing now are just reskinned versions from previous levels. The camera system does you no favour as it sticks to your character, rather than allowing any wiggle room, and it generally will not be able to show you any nearby traps or enemies if they happen to be just a few pixels out of its field of view. This will often cause you to go bouncing into roof spikes or falling into an enemy just off to the side.\n\nThese issues would be perfectly fine if there didn't happen to be a thousand other games that do the platforming genre more justice than Oozi: Earth Adventure. Most children are more likely to have their first gaming experience with the Mario series, so by the time they discover Oozi: Earth Adventure they will very quickly realise just how inferior this game is in comparison.\n\nEdit: I've now discovered that the more you play this game the less smooth it will run. Whether it is due to a memory leak, I do not know. This has caused the game to drop its frame-rate to less than 20 frames per second, unacceptable for a 2D sidescroller that depends on reaction time for most of its puzzles. There will also be times where the game will seem to suddenly stutter for a split second. This wasn't happening when I first started playing the game. There are also bugs with one of the enemies. If you die, respawn, and come across the enemy again, they will spawn in their death state and automatically die. It's almost like no one tested this game before release.","February 18, 2014","false","6.5"," 10 of 20 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","10","20","0","0"

The absolute hardest difficulty is a breeze, and the only reason you die is because you hit a patch of bad game design, either through ridiculous boss battles, the stiff controls, or a camera that can't be bothered to follow you until you're too close to the edge. If anything, this game is great for kids, because kids will play anything and they don't have a filter for crap. For anybody else, it's something to do when you're bored and there's almost nothing else to play at the moment. To top it all off, the music is forgettable and the visual style is trying too hard to be Rayman.\n\nSo, why am I giving this a recommendation? Well, I paid thirty cents for this game after getting a hefty coupon, and I'll be damned if it wasn't worth every penny. At full price, though, I would have steered you guys away as if this game had an STD.

Also random crashing - luckily only when loading a new level, not midlevel. If there was a "neutral" or "mixed" option I'd gladly use that instead of "Not recommended".

Let's say you're jumping to the right over a pit to a small platform. In midair you let go of the right direction to land on the platform, but the physics continue moving you slightly right for a half second before stopping horizontal momentum.\n\nYou also have a high jump and a low jump. There didn't seem to be any in between, which makes precision jumping even harder,\n\nAdditionally, I landed on multiple enemies from above but would be hurt, the hitbox shapes must be rather strange. And the sneaky snails that dash at you for some reason can't be jumped on at all, which doesn't make much sense.\n\ntl;dr - It's hard to control precisely, you will die a lot and it will frustrate you because the controls are too floaty.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dizzydown/recommended/257990/","dizzydown","Dizzy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dizzydown/","118 products in account","Let's start with positive things about Oozi. The art style is great, the main character and the inhabitants of the game world are both offbeat and vibrant. Everything is colorful, and everything has googly eyes. The controls are incredibly tight, to the point I was legitimately surprised, and collecting stars feels satisfying, mostly due to their large quantity.\n\nNow, time for the design. The game is very, very, very simplistic. This in itself is not bad, but the developer seemed to have run out of ideas by the end of the first world. I had lost count of the number of times I'd seen the same hazard re-used. I'm not using hyperbole, here. If I see one more corridor where a spike trap bounces slowly from top to bottom, I will cry. It's not as though the developer didn't have plenty to work with.\n\nHe was aiming for simple gameplay and simple mechanics, but he treats said mechanics as though they're brand new, although they've been around for decades. The game doesn't even begin to explore the most basic platforming elements, including the double jump. There are one to three hazards -often reused- where the double jump is used creatively. To make matters worse, the game betrays its own selling point. It claims to be free of puzzles and gimmicks, but it frequently introduces new mechanics that are never explored thoroughly and quickly swept aside. Oxygen timers, bombs, security cameras, hiding in the background. They're all entirely one-note mechanics that are recycled throughout their respective stages and then discarded, rather than built upon.\n\nIf the game were say, an hour or two long, these flaws wouldn't be as noticeable, but entire levels sometimes felt copy-pasted, and they drag on for quite some time. I was pretty happy with Oozi at first, and it wasn't the simplicity that killed it, just the developer's unwillingness to explore his own mechanics. Nearly every other indie platformer has something unique or interesting to offer, even if their package as a whole is lacking. Oozi is entirely void of any distinguishing design, and I sadly can't recommend that.","June 12, 2015","false","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MeanSpeed/recommended/257990/","MeanSpeed","MeanSpeed","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MeanSpeed/","95 products in account","Oozi: Earth Adventure is a very simplistic and visually appealing platformer, which will appeal to both casual and somewhat hardcore gamers because of it's features ranging from a mode where you can't die to challenges where even the easiest of mistakes can make you lose.\n\nThe gameplay is what you expect from a platformer and it's pretty enjoyable, but it does get repetitive after a few worlds. By that, I mean the same kinds of enemies appear,  doing the same attack patterns but differing in their visuals or amount. The hardcore mode isn't what makes the game hard for me, it's the harsh checkpoint system. Checkpoints get very scarce later on in the game, and you'll be quite frustrated with how rare they become and how much you have to accomplish to reach the next available one. That being said, if you are decent at platformers, know the game mechanics and have at least 2 levels of health, you should be fine.\n\nThe levels drag on for quite a while as well, and I'd say each one (Excluding boss fights) will take at least 10-15 minutes. That being said, the game is definitely worth the price (Though I'd recommend waiting for a sale if you don't enjoy platformers too much) because of it's longevity, as well as the '100% pure classic platforming fun' that is in the game description.","June 9, 2015","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Oozi's adventure sure helped me kill time but not all of it was fun. Honestly it was quite repetitive. The game is rather boring if you don't play it on hard. There are optional challenges you get that basically make you replay the already boring story with very difficult challenges you must fulfill to get full credit. With clunky game controls that don't help at all (not to mention the total immersive story), You're forced to walk through hell and back, then you must crawl through hell and back.

It's most likely aimed at a younger audience with not much consequence for when you die; you respawn at the last check point and continue with the level. There's an extra feature, that you can turn off, where the ghost's of other players appear in your game with you, they don't do anything that affects your game. You collect stars, and find 5 larger stars thoughout each level. The music is sweet and the contols are extramly easy to grasp.\n\nI would recommend if you're looking for a relaxing game that's simple and doesn't require a lot of thought.","August 6, 2015","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
