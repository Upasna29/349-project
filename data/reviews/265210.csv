It is a “simulator” style game with purposefully “silly” controls and movement.  It is the kind of game where there isn’t much to it, but it is fun while it lasts.  Expect a handful of hours of playtime.\n\nThere is only one map and it is pretty small, but is actually perfectly sized.  It is designed well; big enough that you can enjoy looking around without it being too big that things get boring trying to clean.  The amount of time it takes to actually beat the campaign (read: finish cleaning everything) is just enough to be substantial without getting too tedious— 1 to 2 hours.  The game still might get a little tedious if you are going for all the achievements.\n\nFor the most part, though, it is pretty damn entertaining.  As you look around at the mess that you are cleaning, you’ll notice that it tells the story of what happened.  It is very amusing. There are several little Easter eggs and such as well.\n\nIt has multiplayer where you can connect directly to a friend.  The game would definitely be more fun to play with someone than alone.  I feel this is a kind of game that would have greatly benefitted from old school local multiplayer.  I feel like it would be fun to sit on a couch with your significant-lover or a buddy and play a stupid game like this.  Perhaps it will be added at a future date from when I wrote this.\n\nUltimately, though, don’t expect too much.  You’ll get an amusing couple of hours, maybe a bit more if you bring a friend and/or unlock the achievements.  After that, you will never play it again.  Of course, Viscera Cleanup Detail: Santa's Rampage is also probably best enjoyed around the holidays, as it is extra comical when juxtaposed with all the real holiday spirit you will be exposed to in real life.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","November 18, 2015","true","5.5"," 96 of 111 people (86%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","86","96","111","9","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Snickerf/recommended/265210/","Snickerf","Snicker","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Snickerf/","356 products in account","First of all, this is not a long game.  It is, however, entertaining for the content it does have.  If you've ever heard the Weird Al song "The Night Santa Went Crazy," this videogame explores the aftermath.\n\nBased on the Viscera Cleanup Detail series of games, instead of being set in a typical video game world ("Space Janitors!"), this one takes place in Santa's Workshop, where you play the one elf who appears to have stayed home the night before.  The rest your fellow toymakers can be found strewn about the workshop in various pieces.  Santa's Rampage has left no survivors, (no, not even the reindeer), and it's up to you to clean up the mess.\n\nYour job here is to mop up the spills and smears of blood, pick up and dispose of any inappropriate objects and generally return the workshop to it's original state, as much as possible, given that at least one door was blown off its hinges.  Gameplay is fairly simple, though sometimes a bit wonky in the controls.  You get a mop, a "mess detector" and a pair of gloves.  You can also pick up buckets of water or biohazard bins to help in the cleanup.  You use the mop to wipe up the mess, then dunk the dirty mop into a clean bucket of water, cleaning the mop, but eventually dirtying the water.  Disposal of waste is handled in the most efficient manner possible: the fireplace, of course,   Care must be taken because some objects are more volatile than others, and disposing of them in the fireplace can be hazardous to your health.   But a steady hand, and lots of patience will see you through the game.\n\nIt's not high entertainment by any stretch of the imagination, but for an hour or so of laughing every time you pick up a mangled elf corpse ("Fritz!  He killed Fritz!  That lousy, stinking, pot-bellied slave-driver! That despicable animal toy-monger!"), nothing beats Santa's Rampage.","December 18, 2014","true","17.5"," 28 of 31 people (90%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","90","28","31","7","2"

Game isn't violent, it's just that it's very bloody.\nThe whole proccess takes about 1.5 - 2 hrs (at least on your first try).\n\nYou will have to get rid of the bodies (by burning), then wipe away the blood and get rid of all the broken stuff, then a bit of layout adjustment.\n\nYou might be thinking that it is too repetitive and will become boring, but in fact it isn't like that at all.\n\nOne really impressive thing is the sense of completion this game gives you. If you step on the blood you will leave footprints, that's why you are most likely to clean areas bit by bit. You really feel how the place changes around you. There is also coop in this game.\n\nI am dead serious. No joke. Give this game a try. This game itself is a short demo to their upcoming game that is set in a space station (with numerous levels to choose from). The is also another demo which features the first level of the newly released Shadow Warrior remake, but personally, i think this is a better version.","December 17, 2013","true","13.7"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","19","21","0","0"

The handling of all the stuff is a bit cluncky so you now and then kick your own bucket and you can start over again.

How much destruction can a jolly old man cause you may be wondering? Well to put it lightly Santa put quite a bit of his free time into knife throwing lessons and has adorned the walls with bloody elf corpses. Limbs are everywhere, the rooms are smeared with blood and Santa even had to nerve to hide a few bodies as to avoid being charged with 100 murders because anything more than 99 is just barbaric. A nice little detail is that searching Santa's office will fill you in as to why he went postal and feel a bit sympathetic for the fat man until you realize that you stepped on some blood and created footprints all the way from the hall. It was around this point that I remembered I was a janitor, not a detective so I went on my merry way to get a bucket of water from this rather odd machine built solely to dispense buckets of water. Back into the room I go, I set down the bucket and turn back only to see a new set of footprints have been made on my way over here.\n\nI clean and I clean until my mop starts making more of a bloody mess instead of cleaning any of it and I try to clean my mop in the bucket. As it turns out you have to be at just the right place to dunk it in water but foolish old me just started trying different buttons and ended up smacking the bucket right into Santa's desk and knocking over his whiskey bottles straight to the floor. So out I go to get another bucket of water and the machine plops out a raw hunk of bloody meat dirtying up the area even more. It is at this point that I slowly nod to myself, go back into Santa's office and threw a stack of TNT into the fireplace out of spite. I then left the job site and into the night as I started to realize this wasn't too bright. As you can imagine my boss was more than displeased and this good ole janitor was fired on Christmas Eve. Er, poor Christmas rhymes aside this is one title where you will want to pay attention as the slightest slip up can make the room messy again. As this game also features online coop this will be the perfect title to either work as a team or get them to hate you and your clumsiness.\n\nCleaning is a very time consuming process in this game. Your mop gets dirty and so does the bucket eventually, making you walk all the way back to get another one. Corpses are your biggest concerns as whenever you pick them up and accidentally bump them into something, blood splatters onto the surface of the area. The elves never run out of blood oddly enough so there is no limit to the amount of mess a single corpse can create. At first I simply stuck them into containers but they quickly all filled to the brim. I eyed the fireplace and as it turns out you are actually supposed to cremate them in there. It's not just the corpses and blood you must clean. You are supposed to burn everything from corpses, antlers, whiskey bottles and Santa's guns. If the cheery Christmas melodies start getting on your nerves you can simply toss the jukebox into the fire as well. Even the buckets with the bloody water must be burned. Everything must be burned and the fireplace can be quite some ways from where the mess is so you can stuff them into your giant storage box and carry them back. It would be far easier to simply burn the house down but oh well, that's the life of an underpaid janitor I suppose.\n\nAs you can no doubt tell by now this game is rather morbid and filled with dark humor. You don't even have to work if you don't want to, you can just toss elf corpse onto the table like if this was a wrestling game. Toss bottles, paint the room red with your bloody mop and stacking all the bodies near the entrance so however enters has one heck of a surprise are some of the things you can have fun with if you are not a cleaning kind of person. There is no price or anything other than achievements for cleaning so there is no real point for doing so unless you are really dedicated to your role of janitor. Only one map to explore and nothing to unlock so what you see is what you get. If you are taking the game seriously and are actually cleaning it should take you a bit over 2 hours to fully clean it if you are by yourself. It is quite a graphic intensive game due to all the objects that you can manipulate and looks pretty good as well however it is a fairly small map. All in all it is a rather enjoyable cleaning game with enough freedom to be able to easily get some decent entertainment for the price. It's not a game I find all to enjoyable personally but if you are in the market for a cleaning game based on the great elf massacre that drove Santa into being a dangerous fugitive then this is the game for you!","December 24, 2015","true","2.2"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","100","7","7","4","1"

It IS based on a game in alpha/beta status, and the devs have said basically that "things go wrong" in that items (mostly swords & stuff) can glitch into the floor. I had one item I couldn't reach and two more that were reached with the console command to remove 'dirty' items (supported by the devs for this exact reason). Otherwise you would have to be VERY careful during your play-through and restart if any items fell into the world, as you enter and leave your 'job' – no saving.\n\nA couple of the achievements are going to be utterly infuriating if you want to 100% it so perhaps pass it over if that's your thing until it's fixed.\n\nYes, it's super simple. Yes it's not for everyone..

Tidy and use your head about it.  You do not use a bloody bucket to clean a floor do you.... It makes more mess.\n\nThe coop really sets the game apart... Cleaning together and accidently knocking your friends bucket which is full of blood and whatever making it all messy and more mess, shooting at each other etc, top fun\n\nIt is stupid cheap which is a perfect buy. I brought this and then brought the official game in space station for $7 and got a free key of this game so I would say go to the website and preorder the official space station version and you get a steam key for both this game and the one coming out.\n\nThe graphics are actually pretty decent which surprised me.\n\nWorth a buy and play.","December 14, 2013","true","0.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Instead of being the hellraiser, you're the cleaner. In this game, you clean up messes. Yeah.\n\nThis is the third Viscera Cleanup Detail. There's the Shadow Warrior one, which came with the base game. You clean up the bodies Lo Wang left behind. Then there's the original Viscera Cleanup Detail, where you clean up the mess a generic space marine left behind when he was having all the fun. Now, you're cleaning up a mess Santa made. The mess where he murdered all of his elves.\n\nThe gameplay is simple enough. You get a mop, and a blood detector. Your goal is to clean up the blood, and get rid of all harmful items. A water bucket and a disposal bin are also included in your arsenal of cleanliness. You need to dispose of the dead bodies, shattered whiskey bottles, and so on. The only real hazards in this game are the TNT around that can blow up, and the fact that you can make more blood with footsteps and your dirty mop, which needs frequent cleaning. It's simple, but hey, the game's cheap, and is always being updated. It's a clever idea, executed very well. It definitely won't cater to everyone's tastes, but it is a fun time waster.\n\nIf you like to clean, you're gonna have a field day with this one.","January 22, 2014","true","3.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Santa subsequently snapped under the pressure, purchasing several crates of 12-gauge shotgun rounds, steak knives, and dynamite sticks, and fashioning several makeshift molotov cocktails (likely under the influence of alcohol). Santa then went on a murder spree, mutilating several elves and reindeer, and destroyed parts of his workshop in the process. He left the scene through unknown means.\n\nAfter these events, the company "Polar Sanitation Co." employed the player and sent them to clean the workshop, where the player's role in Santa's Rampage begins.\n\nFor the ending of my review i can say that the developers did not do the normal online game, where each can play with friends or just a stranger who finds your game.\nMy mark is 8/10.","January 5","true","6.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dpxmsk/recommended/265210/","dpxmsk","DeadPoolX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dpxmsk/","1182 products in account","The paper-thin premise for this game is that you are a janitor whose job it is to clean up the mess Santa Claus made after he went postal at the North Pole. That's about it for story and background, but if you're interested in this title, you're not here for the in-depth plot and character development (which is good, because there is none).\n\nYou arrive in Santa's workshop and you see the entire place is a huge mess. There are body parts (of both elves and the reindeer, including Rudolph) strewn all over the area. There's copious amounts of blood and other chunky pieces of meat in various places, sometimes even in areas you wouldn't normally expect.\n\nA lot of detail has gone into the environment, including a hole blasted through a wall (complete with scorch marks) and numerous items, ranging from chairs to presents to toy guns (which the elves apparently used to "defend" themselves against Santa) that you can interact with.\n\nJust about everything can be manipulated through the game's physics engine, so while it can be neat to see how one item can affect another, it can also lead to awkward positioning. For instance, there are bio-hazard boxes you can use, but it's often a real chore to get the elves' broken, twisted, and sometimes dismembered bodies into them. What usually ends up happening is you'll see an elf's head or leg clip through the side of the box, which will then sometimes lead to the box jumping around by itself. Basically, it's the same old problem ragdoll physics have always had when bumping up against an object.\n\nNow... onto the cleaning. Your mop can clean up blood, but in the process it gets blood-soaked. After a while your mop will start spreading and smearing blood. When this happens, you can grab a bucket of water and rinse the mop. It'll be clean again and available to wipe away various bloody bits.\n\nHowever, each time you rinse the mop, the water in the bucket gets bloodier and bloodier.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dpxmsk/recommended/265210/","dpxmsk","DeadPoolX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dpxmsk/","1182 products in account","The paper-thin premise for this game is that you are a janitor whose job it is to clean up the mess Santa Claus made after he went postal at the North Pole. That's about it for story and background, but if you're interested in this title, you're not here for the in-depth plot and character development (which is good, because there is none).\n\nYou arrive in Santa's workshop and you see the entire place is a huge mess. There are body parts (of both elves and the reindeer, including Rudolph) strewn all over the area. There's copious amounts of blood and other chunky pieces of meat in various places, sometimes even in areas you wouldn't normally expect.\n\nA lot of detail has gone into the environment, including a hole blasted through a wall (complete with scorch marks) and numerous items, ranging from chairs to presents to toy guns (which the elves apparently used to "defend" themselves against Santa) that you can interact with.\n\nJust about everything can be manipulated through the game's physics engine, so while it can be neat to see how one item can affect another, it can also lead to awkward positioning. For instance, there are bio-hazard boxes you can use, but it's often a real chore to get the elves' broken, twisted, and sometimes dismembered bodies into them. What usually ends up happening is you'll see an elf's head or leg clip through the side of the box, which will then sometimes lead to the box jumping around by itself. Basically, it's the same old problem ragdoll physics have always had when bumping up against an object.\n\nNow... onto the cleaning. Your mop can clean up blood, but in the process it gets blood-soaked. After a while your mop will start spreading and smearing blood. When this happens, you can grab a bucket of water and rinse the mop. It'll be clean again and available to wipe away various bloody bits.\n\nHowever, each time you rinse the mop, the water in the bucket gets bloodier and bloodier. Eventually the bucket will be so bloody (and this is readily apparent) that dipping your mop in there will only serve to get more blood on it. Fortunately, you can get an unlimited number of buckets of clean water from a machine in Santa's workshop, although sometimes that same machine spits out a torn off leg or an unidentifiable chunk of flesh.\n\nTo keep people interested long after the novelty of wiping away blood has grown stale, the developer put in a bunch of achievements to gain. Most of these are fairly easy to acquire, but a few can be difficult and time consuming.\n\nThere is no way to save your game, so although you can "clock out" near the workshop's entrance, you won't return to the point you last left off. This isn't a huge deal, but if you've gone through the effort of meticulously cleaning Santa's workshop, you'll want to take some screenshots as it'll be a mess again when you return.\n\nI should note that "Viscera Cleanup Detail: Santa's Rampage" is actually a variant of a free game (technically an alpha), created by the same developer (RuneStorm), simply entitled "Viscera Cleanup Detail."

It's the janitor, the sanitation engineer, the industrial hygenist, and you get to step into his shoes to do just that in Viscera Cleanup Detail. The developor, RuneStorm, is working on the main game but has released this (Santa's Rampage) and Shadow Warrior mini-game versions ahead of it.\n\nWork with a mop, your hands, and a sniffer (stain and junk detector tool) and clean up the mess that, in this case, the jolly bearded guy made after drinking one too many Slack Spaniel Whiskey and Hurlington Eggnog concoctions. Watch out for the various weapons of mass destruction he left unused in his wake though.\n\nThis Santa version and the Shadow Warrior version comes 'free' if you pre-purchase their main game on their website. If you purchase Shadow Warrior you get the SW version. Personally I recommend the Shadow Warrior version because it's a lot more polished and less buggy.\n\nThis game is worth getting even if you later pre-order their unfinished game. Currently at least, you can always give the Steam key to your friend (it's through Humble's store).

This is a super fun game that would not sound so cool on paper, cleaning up santa's workshop, not that fun sounding. But as a game this is something worth cheaking out. at 2.50 you can't go wrong with this. But if you want to see I you might like this game or not you can go to the website and download the alpha version of the full game. for me I kinda like this one better maybe cause it's not as big as the full one so less time to spend cleaning.\nI realy like this game I recomend you check it out.

Most of the games realeased now-adays are you enter a room, kill everyone, and leave. But this game brings a new perspective to that. Instead it places you in the position of someone who has to CLEAN up that bloody room. When you first start playing it seems like it has little promise for fun. But then it kinda grows on you that its actuallly a very "Intressting" and fun game. There's no thrill of combat, but there is enjoyment. And for $2.00 you can't really go wrong. If you think it looks compelling to you, then GO FOR IT, it is a very, again "Intressting" experience.","December 31, 2013","true","8.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's the janitor, the sanitation engineer, the industrial hygenist, and you get to step into his shoes to do just that in Viscera Cleanup Detail. The developor, RuneStorm, is working on the main game but has released this (Santa's Rampage) and Shadow Warrior mini-game versions ahead of it.\n\nWork with a mop, your hands, and a sniffer (stain and junk detector tool) and clean up the mess that, in this case, the jolly bearded guy made after drinking one too many Slack Spaniel Whiskey and Hurlington Eggnog concoctions. Watch out for the various weapons of mass destruction he left unused in his wake though.\n\nThis Santa version and the Shadow Warrior version comes 'free' if you pre-purchase their main game on their website. If you purchase Shadow Warrior you get the SW version. Personally I recommend the Shadow Warrior version because it's a lot more polished and less buggy.\n\nThis game is worth getting even if you later pre-order their unfinished game. Currently at least, you can always give the Steam key to your friend (it's through Humble's store).

Thanks, man.)\n\nA decent experience on Steam, a janitorial simulator.  Choose to make it cleaner, dirtier, or....emptier than when you started.   Great for those who have an obsessive urge to clean up messes...or just to burn stuff.  Although the experience is decent, the replayability for it is limited unless cleaning/burning/messes are habits you'd like to satisfy.  Though, some of it can be more rewarding in real life than in the game.\n\nMy complaint, however, is that there are some areas that your sniffer (a radar that picks up grime and clutter, only it works on a hot/cold system rather than a radar) reacts to, yet when you try everything, the invisible mess is still there.\n\nDefinitely not worth full price.

If you have an extra few dollars in your Steam Wallet I say go ahead and pick this up and give it a go, it's a good time passer.\n\n10/10 Would collect decapited Elf heads and take them back to the office again.\n\nFeel free to message me if you have questions about the review/game\n\nThanks for reading,\nMonkeyWrench","December 23, 2015","true","9.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I would be walking like normal and then suddenly I would be blasted across the map and my hard work would be ruined.\nI had a molotav randomly explode when I picked it up- and half the stuff was glitched.\nEverything is just too hyper sensitive- I tried putting things in the waste basket to make things easier and I knocked it over and it flew across the room by putting a knife in it.\n\nIt's not bad game!

Thanks, man.)\n\nA decent experience on Steam, a janitorial simulator.  Choose to make it cleaner, dirtier, or....emptier than when you started.   Great for those who have an obsessive urge to clean up messes...or just to burn stuff.  Although the experience is decent, the replayability for it is limited unless cleaning/burning/messes are habits you'd like to satisfy.  Though, some of it can be more rewarding in real life than in the game.\n\nMy complaint, however, is that there are some areas that your sniffer (a radar that picks up grime and clutter, only it works on a hot/cold system rather than a radar) reacts to, yet when you try everything, the invisible mess is still there.\n\nDefinitely not worth full price.  Get it while it's on sale if you're interested in it.\n\n6/10","February 24","true","15.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

At the the price of about $3 the game has suprisingly good quality and graphics for something that inexpensive. However it does take a long time to pick up   but is more fun and helpful when playing with friends on Steam that also have the game. There is lots of small details on the map that are interesting to find and some you get achievements for finding. The only problems I had with the game was the length of time the game took to complete and how sometimes the clock off button did not work. Overall I do reccomend this game and hope you enjoy it aswell!","December 26, 2015","true","4.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Probably one of the most interesting aspects of this game is its ability to take something as disturbing as cleaning up dismembered elves and gore and makes you view it as a janitor would - as a job. Very quickly, you will stop perceiving the scene as a horrible, bloody murder and instead think about it in terms of how many buckets of water you need, what you can fit in a bio hazard box, where you need to stand so you don't track blood on the floor you just cleaned and so on. For such a simple basic concept, Santa's Rampage is very entertaining.\n\nIt is, however, held back by niggling problems. There's no tutorial of any kind, for one, so you're left to guess at what any of the tools do. This is especially problematic with the "sniffer" which finds... Blood and "broken thing" I think, but I've no real idea what it racks or how it works. You're never given an explicit objective other than a very general order to clean the place up, but you can never be too sure what you're supposed to destroy, what you're supposed to keep or what anything does. Worst is the fact that success requires the cleaning of ALL stains, which can sometimes be so faint as to be invisible or in inaccessible places (the high ceiling) or behind objects. I've yet to succeed at this, and I can't figure out why for the life of me.\n\nIn the end, though - for the price that the game asks, this is WELL worth buying. I would heartily recommend it. Unless you're squeamish.","December 16, 2013","true","5.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

You will walk out into the world and find out you've been playing the game for 20 years.  And 3 years later you will become the same janitor cleaning up everything until you finally quit, massacre everyone on a space station with the help of aliens, then you will turn on the aliens and use you 2nd item and shove it up their ♥♥♥ until everyone on the space station is dead.  You will find yourself cleaning up the mess with your imaginary coop friend and once you clean everything up you destroy you imaginary friend with the plasma gun and findout you just shot the generator, exploding the space station while your brain fries cause of oxygen deprivation with the vaccum of space destroying your brain you remember when you were a 20 year old playing the same exact game that your living in... and right before your brain is completley gone, you remember this all started with the game called viscera cleanup detail: Santa's rampage.  Couple years later you have been revived and you find yourself shooting aliens while stopping more aliens that will destroy the human race called reapers.

This game had it all to be pure gold, but unfortunately I cannot recommend this at the present time. The amount and severity of bugs make the game not enjoyable at all. Invisible dirt spots, objects getting stuck in corners or under the floor, movement glitches, janitor's box glitching in several and disastrous ways, fireplace not destroying some items no matter how long they're kept in (had to re-insert them to make it work), items going trough the buckets and disposable bins, itens flying violently all over the place when a laid down bin is put in the right position... I could also list some refinements that make gameplay better, but these glitches and bugs are way more important, and they're not being addressed so a list of improvements is unnecessary.

You will find yourself cleaning up the mess with your imaginary coop friend and once you clean everything up you destroy you imaginary friend with the plasma gun and findout you just shot the generator, exploding the space station while your brain fries cause of oxygen deprivation with the vaccum of space destroying your brain you remember when you were a 20 year old playing the same exact game that your living in... and right before your brain is completley gone, you remember this all started with the game called viscera cleanup detail: Santa's rampage.  Couple years later you have been revived and you find yourself shooting aliens while stopping more aliens that will destroy the human race called reapers.

These guys just keep pumping out original content while polishing the main game for release. I thought this was a gag when my friends first told me about it and I'm glad I was wrong.\n\nThis edition was a treat. Viscera Cleanup Detail is all about you trying to clean up someone else's mess after everything gets bloody and blown up. This time, you're going to the North Pole. Santa's workshop is a colorful wonderland and your in game radio's Christmas tunes do a good job of keeping your spirits up as you dispose of dynamite, knives, and tons of elf bodies. Oh, and lots of empty whiskey bottles.\n\nI have to touch on the cons though, before I can say what else I love about this game. Dynamite is ihe bane of this particular iteration. When Santa went crazy, he went dynamite happy. Careless handling of dynamite can toss messes way out of the reach of your mop, leading to lots of profanity and frustrations and rendering a full cleanup almost impossible. Given that the bucket machine now tosses live dynamite at you on occasion, it just feels like the devs are being unfair to the players. Of all the messes the space janitor has had to clean up, this may be the hardest. And while the warm mood lighting makes this game's setting pop with color, it also has the unfortunate side effect of making some of the lightest blood stains super hard to see, especially against the wood grains. Hopefully this might be corrected in a future version of the game, but at least your trusty sniffer still works well for finding the lost messes. Back to the pros!\n\nThe gameplay VCD is known for is still here, and, like they did in the Shadow Warrior level, there are side objectives you can do as well for Steam achievements, namely tracking down all of the toy guns and officially licensed Rooks Keep action figures for your trunk. When you clock out, the punchout machine lists what souvenirs you dropped into your trunk. There are also numerous achievements for how well you cleaned. Did you manage to not break any of the delicate Christmas ornaments around the shop? Did you scorch the place clean of all holiday items? Did you throw your bucket dispenser's hat into the fire? The number of Steam achievements here gives the game some replayability beyond trying to see how fast or how messy you can clean things up.\n\nThe black humor found in the game's macabre setting is hit and miss, however; some of the fun in a new level of VCD is seeing how awful the messes are and figuring out a way to efficiently get things done. Some of the outlandish deaths and scenes you uncover work great, but I think the humor found in Santa's letters that outline his descent into booze and bullets felt like the writers were trying too hard. There are nuggets of humor but we get it when all the kids just want the latest expensive gadgets even though they behave like brats. A few letters are fine but after a while they all sound the same.\n\nThe physics can get wonky still in a few places but this level still shows the level of polish that Runestorm is trying to create with their small team. Who knew that Santa going on an alcohol-fueled rampage could lead to one of the best Christmas releases ever?\n\nSo what are you waiting for? Strap on your candy striped rubber gloves, grab your mop and get ready to save Christmas!","December 14, 2013","true","10.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

These guys just keep pumping out original content while polishing the main game for release. I thought this was a gag when my friends first told me about it and I'm glad I was wrong.\n\nThis edition was a treat. Viscera Cleanup Detail is all about you trying to clean up someone else's mess after everything gets bloody and blown up. This time, you're going to the North Pole. Santa's workshop is a colorful wonderland and your in game radio's Christmas tunes do a good job of keeping your spirits up as you dispose of dynamite, knives, and tons of elf bodies. Oh, and lots of empty whiskey bottles.\n\nI have to touch on the cons though, before I can say what else I love about this game. Dynamite is ihe bane of this particular iteration. When Santa went crazy, he went dynamite happy. Careless handling of dynamite can toss messes way out of the reach of your mop, leading to lots of profanity and frustrations and rendering a full cleanup almost impossible. Given that the bucket machine now tosses live dynamite at you on occasion, it just feels like the devs are being unfair to the players. Of all the messes the space janitor has had to clean up, this may be the hardest. And while the warm mood lighting makes this game's setting pop with color, it also has the unfortunate side effect of making some of the lightest blood stains super hard to see, especially against the wood grains. Hopefully this might be corrected in a future version of the game, but at least your trusty sniffer still works well for finding the lost messes. Back to the pros!\n\nThe gameplay VCD is known for is still here, and, like they did in the Shadow Warrior level, there are side objectives you can do as well for Steam achievements, namely tracking down all of the toy guns and officially licensed Rooks Keep action figures for your trunk. When you clock out, the punchout machine lists what souvenirs you dropped into your trunk. There are also numerous achievements for how well you cleaned. Did you manage to not break any of the delicate Christmas ornaments around the shop? Did you scorch the place clean of all holiday items? Did you throw your bucket dispenser's hat into the fire? The number of Steam achievements here gives the game some replayability beyond trying to see how fast or how messy you can clean things up.\n\nThe black humor found in the game's macabre setting is hit and miss, however; some of the fun in a new level of VCD is seeing how awful the messes are and figuring out a way to efficiently get things done. Some of the outlandish deaths and scenes you uncover work great, but I think the humor found in Santa's letters that outline his descent into booze and bullets felt like the writers were trying too hard. There are nuggets of humor but we get it when all the kids just want the latest expensive gadgets even though they behave like brats. A few letters are fine but after a while they all sound the same.\n\nThe physics can get wonky still in a few places but this level still shows the level of polish that Runestorm is trying to create with their small team. Who knew that Santa going on an alcohol-fueled rampage could lead to one of the best Christmas releases ever?\n\nSo what are you waiting for? Strap on your candy striped rubber gloves, grab your mop and get ready to save Christmas!","December 14, 2013","true","10.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

(Santa is tired of  increasing taxes, children wanting one of everything, and the tedium of being a jolly ole soul for over a millienia). What ensues is a bloody and eggnog fueled rampage from said jolly ole soul. The game has you cleaning up dead elves, reindeer, bottles of booze/eggnog, letters from a unfaithful Mrs. Claus and other bits of ridicliousness. Kudos goes to the game dev. for a orginial game and funny concept. Where the game falls flat is in the actual development .I can't be to hard on this because of two things,first this is a indie game that is still in development and second the price tag is only 2.50. For the amount of gameplay/achievements that you get the price tag isnt bad at all. But when the game will not let you complete said achievements because of  under development it can be problematic.\n\nGraphics  8/10\n\nThe graphics do a good job of  dropping you into the jolly legends workshop. The happy, cheery enviroment is a stark contrast to the blood and gore  in the game. It is a very detailed (right down to tracking bloddy footprints behind you when you step in viscera). The graphics arent the best in the world but they do get the job done.\n\nSound 8/10\n\nThe sound is much the same as the graphics they  are very detailed. All of the sounds that you would expect to hear are present and accounted for, If you pick up a eviscerated elf you will hear the jingle of the bells  attached to his  shoes. This is just one example of the sound design. As a side note there is a radio that plays terrible Christmas music that...if you are anything like me...you  will quickly destroy the radio.\n\nFinal Note\n\nI can't recommend this game in its current state. The graphics,sound and gameplay all make for a interesting game. I can recommend someone  to keep a eye on this game because with more time this could be a fun  game.. Also the game is fun and very funny I enjoyed myself with it I just wish the gameplay was there a bit more,","September 16, 2014","false","8.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamusKnight2K/recommended/265210/","SamusKnight2K","Samus Knight","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamusKnight2K/","79 products in account","As the title suggests, play the role of a janitor sent to clean up the aftermath of Santa's rampage through his workshop. When you first enter you'll be surprised to find just how bad the rampage was. Gameplay is pretty basic, clean up the workshop and dispose of Santa's victims to clear the game. The mop cleans up blood and soot, the tracker locates messes or objects, and your hands grab/throw things. The mop has two uses first is to clean and the other kind of acts as a mean to strike/hit objects. The tracker's blue scanner tracks nearby messes while the green tracks potential objects you need to dispose of to clear the stage in a "hot-and-cold" style. Low slow beeps when nothing is near to high rapid ones the closer you get. With your hands you can pick up just about any object or activate machines to dispense tools to help you clean.\n\nOne machine will dispense water buckets used to clean your mop when it's absorbed too much filth. Another machine will produce special bins you can carry trash, items, and objects in to dispose of. Oddly enough the only way to dispose of dirty water, objects, and bins themselves is to drop it into the fireplace. Sometimes however the bucket dispenser will drop out TNT bundles or body parts which can make your task even more frustrating. It's recommended you keep a water bucket at hand to drop the TNT into as quickly as it appears to prevent it from exploding. Unfortunately this isn't information they tell you and I lost count how many times I had to flee from the room to prevent getting blown up. Adding insult to injury you then have to clean up the mess left behind.\n\nThe bins can be equally frustrating. Meant to make your task easier they can also make it tedious. Objects are easily knocked around and if you bump into the bin from the wrong angle expect it to tip over. They do give you the ability to rotate things back to a standing position via grabbing and using the activation button. However if you have anything in that bin expect it to go flying all over the room. I must have knocked over the same bin at least a dozen times or had to clean it up again because the objects went flying. For the most part if you fill it right and properly grab the bin it remains fairly sturdy when moving it around. So they do have some use.\n\nNow the biggest annoyance has to be the messes themselves. Even after playing for a few hours, scouring every spot I could find there were still hidden spots I couldn't and choosing to "Clock-Out" would deem an automatic failure. A tiny invisible splotch of blood you can't see, a smudge from an explosion. The tiny bulbs that hang on the tree and garland count as messes too if they leave a colored paint splatter upon breaking. Sometimes this can be on the ceiling out of reach because a stick of TNT went off. Only way to reach them requires cheating. Due to bugs the mess you need to mop up might be hidden under the floor preventing you from finding it too. The tracker is little help since it doesn't specifically show what you missed. So again in this case you may need to resort to using the "KillNearbyMess" command to clear it. Currently the game is still in a beta-like stage so hopefully this will be fixed in later patches.\n\nOverall the game is a novelty and can be fun if you only want to cause mayhem, especially for the price. But after you've beaten it (There's only the workshop.) then that's it, after all that you won't likely play it again. Tossing dead elves around or blowing things up with the TNT can only entertain for so long. If you have a friend who's already bought the game, try it out for yourself before you buy. In the long run there's other games that can offer more replayability than this. Viscera Cleanup Detail: Santa's Rampage for the price is pretty good, but frustrations and having to resort to cheating just to clear it prevents me from giving a recommendation for now.","December 25, 2013","false","3.4"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","6","15","0","0"

He really enjoys the game and I think has put at least 50 hours into it. I write a review after 10 hours of playtime unless I can't stand it. I've wanted Santa's Rampage for a long time and I finally got it.\n\nThe controls work most of the time, random times when carrying buckets and elf body parts fall for no reason is really fustrating. The graphics are fantastic. A full on 10 for that. It may not be a FarCry landscape but they are not bad graphics. Being a janitor in a game... what the hell? Who wants to play that? It's first-person. You mop up stuff, YOU MOP UP SANTA'S WORKSHOP. The fire-place is your main place to go, that's where you put the Elf parts that cause blood and all the extra items you want out of the area. You use the mop the most, cleaning up blood, booze, weird ornament ooze? You also have your bare hands where you can pick up elf parts and buckets and cans and all this stuff. The next thing is this weird radar that still to this day, I don't know what it does so to me, it's useless. Now to actually start my review.\n\nYou basically have 5 rooms, each time you play the game with a new job to clean, it's randomly generated blood and gore. It's just you. The easter eggs are a great part of this game and without giving too much away, finding the floor boards and rudolf's nose. Cleaning with the mop is very easy and very fun to do, you will have to dip it into the bucket multiple times which gets dirty and then you need to get a new bucket. This is actually a pretty fun concept until it's greatly overused. There's an achievement for cleaning the whole workshop and I put 4 hours into it trying to do it, ending up at the end not getting it because an ornament was stuck behind a plant. That's pretty fustrating. The greatest sense of accomplisment at ALL in this game is cleaning each room and completely finishing it. What I find pretty cool is at the beginning you can get a BRAND-NEW generated character, find out the age and backstory... BUT IT HAS NO MEANING WHAT-SO-EVER. I don't expect Viscera Cleanup Detail to have a story-line but it's the same game but in Santa's Workshop. There is one way you can die and that's blowing yourself up with TNT which half the time isn't throwable so you can't choose to die... you do it anyway. You can find Santa's shotgun and pistols but nope, you can't shoot them. I'm not expecting them to be able to shoot but it would have been a cool easteregg. This game is $2.49 and that's a pretty good deal but not entirely for this game, I'm sorry. You don't have much workspace and it's close-corredored. You are a guy but it doesn't matter who you are because it has no meaning. Most of the achievements and controls don't work and the stupid radar thing isn't useful. There's no tutorial so you have to find out how to do stuff, throws you right into it.\n\nMultiplayer is a joke and I hate saying it. My friend and I played it once using IP addresses. You have to download this stupid program to get your stupid IP address to play, how would you know that? Besides, even with a PING on both sides of 20, it's super laggy and with your resolution down. Also, did I mention the game is not full-screen unless you set it to be full? The only time when it's not laggy is when you're using your mop or hands and not moving around. There is a jump function, what do you need it for? There's one game mode, there's not even a game mode... you clean. < That I don't complain about because it's fun for an hour and that's about it.\n\nLet me say what I like about it (unfortuantely, it's not a lot) the graphics are really cartoony and cool. It's something fresh that a 60 dollar game doesn't really have. The backstory and name's and ages of characters before play is cool even if there's no follow-up to it. Clocking out is feeling legit even if it's a 2-second thing. Using the mop is a blast for a bit, it's something new. Making it first-person is super cool. Finding the easter eggs is pretty sweet. Making a bigger mess and clocking off like a terrible guy at his job makes getting the achievement for it so much sweeter.\n\nUnfortauntely, this is my first game that uh... I like and don't like. Even for $2.49 which may seem good, the game is not worth the money. It's about an hour's worth of gameplay if you weren't going for achievements and easter eggs. Otherwise, you get about 10 hours of playtime like me. Multiplayer sucks, fix it and don't use IP addresses. Give us a tutorial, if it weren't for my friend... I don't think that I would've gotten very far into the game without getting fustrated. Controls are 50/50, mop works the best out of everything. Easter-eggs don't do anything (shotgun and pistols) and same with character development. You know what I would've wanted to see maybe at one point like when YOU COMPLETELY CLEAN THE PLACE and about to clock-off... Santa comes. If the game was about a dollar or maybe even free-to-play it would be worth it, but in my opinion and I love the original Viscera Cleanup Detail and hope to see more, Santa's Rampage isn't worth it and it may get a couple laughs out of you but you won't last more than an hour unless you find a way to.\n\nCheck the floorboards upstairs and remove them, you get a surprise inside. -Detroit0127","February 21, 2015","false","10.4"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","3"

Viscera Cleanup Detail started as a standalone mini-game for Shadow Warrior. While it was boring cleaning up dead guys, the gore shocked most. Now in this edition, apparantly Santa got pressured by elves, dumb wish lists, and reindeer crap. He took a shotgun, a knife, and rage, and killed everyone. While this is disturbing for those young Steamers out there, once again, the gore shocked most into playing it repeatedly. The game features those surgeon simulator graphics, so it wasn't realistic. However, the graphics mean nothing. The only thing that caught players' attentions, was the shocking aftermath and story.\n\nSo in conclusion, the cleaning is boring for most, but the fact that Santa melted under pressure shocked players into enduring @#$! to clean it all up!","February 16, 2014","true","4.2"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Didn't take long to lose interest and uninstall. For starters, it throws you into the game without directions. Once I looked at the control setup in the options menu I was able to figure out that I needed to get buckets and disposal bins from the machines. Just throwing that on the screen upfront would have been nice.\n\nThen the mopping. You get like 3 swipes of the mop before it starts splashing blood everywhere making a bigger mess than the 3 swipes you cleaned up. While this may increase realness, it also sucks the fun out of it. And I kept knocking over the water bucket whenever I went to dip it. Is it really necessary to make the water bucket fall over that easily? It's just so tedious. I couldn't imagine it being fun in any way after realizing I'd need to clean my mop every 3 swipes. And you leave footprints everywhere any time you step in blood and well, there's blood everywhere. Hard not to step in it. And the first person view makes it hard to see what is directly below you. And if your mop starts throwing blood around, it seems a surefire way to get it on your shoes. I'm sure if you have patience for this game to move at a very slow methodical pace, taking inch by inch, you could probably master what the game expects. I don't know about other players, but I don't really want to spend hours dipping my mop and cleaning up my shoes. It's just unappealing.\n\nThere are a lot of setting options. I had to adjust resolution, toggle off window mode, adjust field of vision and mouse sensitivity, and toggle off head bob. So it's nice the options are all there to customize, but it still made me nauseated playing.","December 29, 2013","false","0.2"," 9 of 28 people (32%) found this review helpful","32","9","28","0","0"

Repeatedly pressing left click just to mop is actually alot of fun, and moving elf body parts to Santa's fire to burn them. It's hilarious knocking over your friend's bucket filled with blood right after he finished cleaning or accidentally blowing him up with dynamite and creating a big, gorey mess that you both to clean up, only to fling one of his arms behind a table to be found later. Finding Rudolf's nose, elf corpses used as throwing knife targets, letters to Santa, and even empty Jack Daniels rip off bottles called "Spack Spaniels" are hilarious little details. The writing is also hilarious, from the bios of your employee records to the spoiled kids sending letters to Santa. I really suggest getting this game because it's hilarious.","April 18, 2014","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

But I think this game is better with friends because it will take you over 30 mins. to clean Santa's entire workshop and stables. I have not yet cleaned the entire place but am very close! There are a couple of suggestions I do have for this game but highly doubt these will happen considering this was one of the 1st games this developer has made and has made such an improvement! Anyway my suggestions:\n\n1) THOSE DAMN BLOODY BUCKETS! I know I'm not the only one who has droped  a bloody bucket making more of a mess then I'd started with. If that could be disabled I will be very very very very very very very very happy.\n\n2) If there was an option to join a random game with players already in it instead of having to enter a password that would be cool too and a lot easier.\n\nThanks for reading my Review and hope you get the game!","January 30, 2015","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Slowly the tale of a man who's taken too much, burdened by impossible bills, a deadbeat brother, and elf union activism, comes to light. Armed with a shotgun, knives, explosives, and way, way too much whiskey, Santa has laid terrible waste to his own workshop.\n\nAnd it's your job to fish pieces of elves out of the craziest places and throw them in the fire, while flailing with your mop at the bloodstains *everywhere*. And trying not to break any Christmas presents.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EDMYuki/recommended/265210/","EDMYuki","EDM Yuki","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EDMYuki/","48 products in account","Viscera Cleanup Detail: Santa's Rampage is a charming, yet buggy, game. It's a simple janitorial simulator where you are in charge of cleaning up the aftermath of Santa's murderous rampage. You will see the gibs of many elves and reindeer, broken eggnog bottles, weapons, blood, etc. You must get rid of all evidence of foul play and make it presentable for the people that will take over the workshop.\n\nThe environment is fun to look at and chat about. If you are playing with a group of friends you will find yourselves laughing at letters written by spoiled children as well as the way the killing spree played out. If you are in a chatroom with many people, this game is a great way to have fun if you are into roleplaying... that is if you are able to get the multiplayer working. In order to play online with friends you need to be able to port forward your router or use a VPN, such as Hamachi or Tunngle. If you are unfamiliar with these, or if you are unlucky and can't get it to work, you will only have access to single player. This sucks because playing this game by yourself is boring. After cleaning up for a good hour or so you will realize that cleaning the workshop is not worth the effort. Why? First, getting the workshop 100% clean is a chore. Sometimes items will become unreachable due to the bugs in the game. Other times, it is almost impossible to dispose of the dynamite or molotov cocktails properly. You need a water bucket to place the explosives in. When you put the bucket into the furnace it will tip over. This only happens with the water bucket when there are explosives inside.\n\nThere are achievements for this game, but I don't feel that they are enough to keep you coming back to this game. Overall, it's a great one-time experience with a group of friends. I recommend it to anyone who is able to set up the multiplayer and have a chatroom of people. If you can only play single player due to your unfamiliarity with port forwarding or VPNs, then I would not recommend this game unless this game is your type of game in the first place.\n\nThere could be some fun in looking and exploring the environment, but once you have seen it all it will get boring. It's only $2.50 on Steam, so it's not that expensive. At the same time, there are better and more exciting games you could be playing with that kind of money. I recommend it so you can look at the environment, but don't expect much after an hour or so of playing if you are playing alone.","July 27, 2014","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Cleaning out santas office, I see a couple bundles of TNT. Oh, ill dispose of it. The little sticks of TNT didnt do much, but it made a little mess... ill get rid of the rest all together!\nSo after ive gathered the rest of the TNT I can find on the map, I throw it in a hazmat bin into the fire and back up.\nand it explodes.... much bigger than I thought.\nI died. I didnt even think you could die. Huh.\n\nSo in comes my replacement, and I go to the water bucket machine. Better clean up myself, I suppose. I hear the machine grind, and expect a hand or chunk of meat to come out instead of water. Well, not exactly. Its another bundle of TNT. Lit. I die.

Mutilated elves and raindeer are found sticking to the walls and ceiling, with blood smeared all over the place. There are notes found in Santa's office and the platform upstairs detailing the back story before the masacure took place. Apparently he was being hit with hefty fines, which got to a point where he couldn't pay off his debts. On top of that he received notes from naughty children, who wanted specific things fromg him so they could do naughty things. There's also a note where Santa's wife, Mrs. Clause, stating that he was leaving him. The final note was apparently a receipt detailing the list of weaponry he bought.\n\nYou'll have to remove the items on said receipt, basically burn them all in the fireplace, along with the dismemebered body parts of workers and raindeer. Every smudge, bloodstain, and soot must be cleaned from the workshop in order to get the achievement for cleaning up the mess. What you do after that is up to you.\n\nTL;DR:\n\nAwesome game, makes me wanna clean up my house.","January 19, 2014","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
