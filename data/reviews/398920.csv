Meaning that even though parts of the game a rough around the edges, it oozes with indie love. This one man team created a very deep puzzler with a ton of varying gameplay rules resulting in some interesting twists. From multiple line creations, changes in gravity, tons of powerup items or the infamous Skull tile these and more create a ton of puzzle styles.\n\nIf you enjoy puzzlers, take a close look at this one, its worth it!","August 31, 2015","true","0.3"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","12","15","0","0"

The gameplay is comfortable and easy to grasp from the beginning and takes a bit before it gets challenging, but once it does it offers a good variety of gameplay and level types.  I would like to see the visuals cleaned up a bit, but overall its a solid experience that I recommend, especially for people looking for some quick, casual gaemplay.","September 2, 2015","true","0.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

I would like to say that Tisnart Tiles is IMO the best match 3 game I've played..!  Not only does it keep you on your toes, but is very fun to play. After the easy levels (not many) the game gets intense and game play is amazing with it's twist and turns. Gravity is just over the top and screen rotation is very cool among other great features.  Bonuses and power-ups are awesome and the sounds in the game fit it perfect. If you like match 3 games, Tisnart Tiles is perfect to add to your collection. I would highly recommend you download and play it. Everything about the game is amazing. Watch out for Mr. Skull. Also you'll find some hidden secrets. Not giving it away and you'll have to figure it out for yourself. The author went over and above in this well thought out match 3. Tisnart Tiles is an amazing game. 5 stars from me and 2 thumbs up..!! Excellent job....","September 2, 2015","true","2.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","6","7","2","0"

Unfortunately the difficulty curve kind of breaks down at the later levels; they're so fast you don't really have time to strategize, but by that point in the game, you basically have an infinite supply of coins and can keep dropping bomb powerups whenever the tiles get too high, so it feels oddly too hard and too easy at the same time.","February 27","true","7.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Downloading a game off the BBS by some lone developer. Sure it's not the most graphically intense, but there's a certain charm behind indie developers.\n\nYes, it's a match 3 game. Yet, this is NOT one of those overly polished games like "Candy Crush" made by a giant corporation . Those insidious games designed to tear your money away from you. I'd rather pay for a game up-front rather than play a freemium game designed to torture me until I give them all my money.\n\nHere, you get well designed gameplay. There's a nice gradual ramp up in difficulty. Gameplay features are added before it gets too stale. When you start to get close to the edge of losing, it becomes rather exciting as you rush to clear any tiles.\n\nLooking at the negative reviews:\n"It's not color-blind friendly!"  Look, indie developers can be just one guy/girl. Chances are there was just never any thought of color-blind people. I'm sure the developer isn't color blind so they might not know how to fix this. Make a suggestion in the forums. I mean come on, you're a color-blind person playing a match-3 style game based on colors. Doesn't make much sense.\n\n"The sound is awful": No, it's not. Though, I'd prefer less generic music. But, hey! The great thing about these types of games, is I can mute them and play my own music.\n\nAlso: It's easy to rip on people's games. Indie devs don't have giant teams. You can dislike a game and not be a ♥♥♥♥ about it. These games are still developed by real people. You may think you're funny, but you're not.\n\nOverall: A fun game. Good game design. That's hard to do in with all the Match-3 games. Suprisingly it starts to get a little challenging at later levels. Ok graphics and sound.  It doesn't wear out its welcome by providing a lot of new and interesting gameplay elements.  This is the perfect type of game to kill a few minutes at a time, and have fun.\n","September 2, 2015","true","0.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","5","7","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/retroalarm/recommended/398920/","retroalarm","Alarm","http://steamcommunity.com/id/retroalarm/","2513 products in account","Not colour-blind friendly.\n\nThis game initially seems like quite an interesting variation on the classic Japanese Chain Shot!/SameGame formula.  It adds new features to the game and, if you like the genre, may be worth playing.\n\nHowever, when I reached the eighth level, they introduced green tiles and for me - a person with red/green colour-blindness - it then becomes a 'guess if the tile is green or red' game.  This is not unique to this game - puzzle games for decades (and other genres) have failed to provide an option for those who cannot easily distinguish between two certain colours.  It would be very simple to add such an option, yet many game designers neglect to think of those with colour-blindness (around 8% of men; a smaller percentage of women).\n\nIf you have 'normal' colour vision and like puzzle games, you may enjoy this.","September 1, 2015","false","6.4"," 11 of 22 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","11","22","2","0"

The difficulty grows gradually so you won't have a feeling of the game being overwrought (but you can get this feeling if you decide to play more complex levels after a while since you have played previous ones). And yeah, sometimes this game will really have you on the edge, as they have promised. So, it could be of interest to you if you're into match-3 games.","December 4, 2015","true","9.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"
