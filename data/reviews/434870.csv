This review is also in an early state.\n\nThe American Election is a great topic .And it also have an interesting core mechanic in this game.\nBut at current state.it isn't a good game.\n\nYou can go to 50 states of America(as 50 or less stage and developers says they will make more special rules at each state)With your three AI Opponent. You must convert more citizen than them to win the battle,At last you can win the election.\n\nThe way to convert the citizens into your team is:stand still to make a speech...\nActually,that's not a bad idea. But when your control is awkward, the mechanic seems too weak to play.\nThe mouse control will make wrong route 50% of all time.\nthe speed is too slow sometimes.\nThe competitive part of this mechanic seems frustrated. And there doesn't have many ways to directly attack the AI.\nThe AI still have some bug,which will ruin the experience.\nIf you can make their own personal style into the gameplay more, and make them can fight each other as a way to win the battle,this game will better than now.\n\nThe Graphic is good, the cartoon style will increase the effect.and the color is soft and bright,that's alright.\nBut the sound of the candidate....maybe too fast i think,that's not enough hilarious but a bit of repetitive,if you play a whole game(50 states). You will be mad at Barack's voice.\n\n(I'm not an american, so there may have some problem in my review.Please forgive them.)","February 26","true","0.5"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","20","22","3","7"

The cartoon graphics and audio are lively and catchy, which may appeal to the young public. The gameplay and mechanics are quite unique and original, however it might feel repetitive if we have to do the same thing in all 50 states. I am currently in the first 10 states so cannot judge yet.\n\nWhile there are still some minor bugs due to the Early Access phase, the game is totally playable and enjoyable. I'd say give it a try if you are interested in the US Election.","March 1","true","3.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","1"
