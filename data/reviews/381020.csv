Blow up 2 labs? Easy Peasy; until you realize that each is surrounded by SAM and AA turrets. You make a few passes, but then you see that the Alert Level has gone up. Fighters are launching from nearby hangars, carriers, and/or aerodromes. This mission just became much more complicated.\n\nYou get one life, one shot at each "day". Early in a "day" you'll have full health and a couple mission targets; but as you shift your attention to fighters, the facilities that launch them, and weather the AA defenses the mission gets much more difficult. You really only need to blow up your target, but kills/destruction grant extra points and can reduce incoming fire during strafing runs. You'll have to decide between getting a mission done quickly at high risk, or try to endure long enough to take out all the defenses.\n\nWhen you inevitably die, you get XP based on your performance. If you level up, you'll get to pick a weapon/item/plane from a small random selection. Then you're thrown into a new Day 1 with a new mission. Every Day/Mission is randomly generated, going from 'moderate' on Day 1 to 'impossibly hard' a few days later.\n\nIn my first draft of this review, I said you could "skip" a day. I was incorrect. If you land on a friendly pad or return to your carrier BEFORE destroying your Mission Target, you can change your loadout and re-launch with full health. Once your target has been destroyed, landing on any pad will end the mission.\n\nI'm already happy with my purchase, I would definitely recommend this game to fans of other arcade-style flight games like Strike Vector, HAWX, Ace Combat Assault Horizon, or Crimson Skies.","August 1, 2015","true","47.2"," 38 of 40 people (95%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","95","38","40","4","0"

You will fwoosh through the air as you face an assortment of fighters, bases, and warships. As you progress you earn more tech points and cash to purchase armaments such as the cluster bomb, heavy flak cannon and other awesome weapons of destruction. What I really loved about Sky Rogue is the Mod support, you can fly around in a TIE Fighter, Viper, or even the Swordfish II from Cowboy Bebop. This takes all the wonderful features of Sky Rogue and let's you choose your fighter of choice, or even make your own! On top of that all Sky Rogue controls incredibly well and is extremely fun and enjoyable. For an alpha title it has very little bugs but plenty of great room to grow. Adding more weapons, more enemies, and mission types. Things such as controller support, and Co-op are just the cherry on top of this fantastic Early Access title.

(Looking at you, Assault Horizon and JASF).  My benchmark, usually is the Ace Combat series.  (Specifically '5: The Unsung War'.)  But Sky Rogue doesn't really make that a fair comparison.  It feels more like Ace Combat mixed with a bit of After Burner, because of the general fast pace of gameplay.\n\nOverall, I'm very impressed with this game.  Works great with a Gamepad.  Controls are responsive, and the minimalist graphics give the game a very sharp and clean look.  The Dogfighting feels deliciously visceral, the Weapons are all useful in some way, there are a load of Aircraft available, and the AI is quite challenging.\n\nMy only real criticism at this point is the control scheme.  Generally, in most Flight Games, Guns and Missiles/Bombs are bound to two seperate buttons, because Missiles/Bombs are generally 'Primary' Weapons, while Guns are more 'Secondary' Weapons.  In Sky Rogue, all Weapons are bound to a single button, and are swapped between using another button.  This makes it awkward to switch between Guns and Missiles.  I'd recommend to the developers to adopt a system similar to the one I mentioned.\n\nI give this game a good thumbs up! :D","July 31, 2015","true","44.7"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/johneldridge/recommended/381020/","johneldridge","Chris","http://steamcommunity.com/id/johneldridge/","247 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nEnjoyable little arcade shooter, but needs work to give it staying power past an hour or two.\n\nCurrently, Sky Rogue is in alpha. This gets you: a single level, a small cluster of islands in the middle of the ocean. Not a lot, admittedly. The landmass in the middle of the ocean might be randomly generated between waves; I didn't pay enough attention to tell you if they were. At the start of play, you're given an objective or objectives ("HANGAR", "2 COMMAND", "3 AWACS" etc), and you customize your plane and weapon loadout to suit your needs. You start with a single plane with three basic weapons, but upon subsequent deaths you unlock more weapons and planes in what seems to be some hidden slot machine mechanic.\n\nYou then launch from your skybound aircraft carrier, blow up designated targets, and then fly back to the carrier to end the "Day," the game's designation for waves.  The game ups you to the next day, with harder enemies and more objectives. You're given the chance to reconfigure your aircraft before the next mission. Fairly simple.\n\nThe game's strength lies in its tight control scheme. Controls are responsive; your sci-fi jet fighter, obedient. Those who have played Ace Combat will feel instant familiarity, though the traditional button to change targets in AC is, in Sky Rogue, the button to swap weapons. I suffered several rounds of accidentally cycling through my weapons before I had the good sense to change the key bindings on my 360 gamepad. Chasing down enemy fighters, dodging missiles, and swerving out of the way of enemy AWACS tumbling out of the sky is a treat, particularly for those of us longing for Namco to revive the AC franchise.\n\nThere are some downsides that make Sky Rogue tough to recommend. For one, you're locked into a single, uninteresting map. After a few rounds, I was desperate for something—ANYTHING—different than green clumps surrounded by blue water. Second, the music. Rather, the song. There is a single tune that accompanies you in the air, a chiptune throwback to the SNES era. It's highly reminisicent of a Starfox tune, and while it starts out catchy it soon becomes irksomely repetitive.\n\nLast, and most important, is the unfortunate fact that most the mission objectives are a chore. If the game is feeling charitable, it might throw a couple AWACS planes your way. Chasing down the AWACS and their fighter escorts is fast and tense—one might forget they weren't playing Ace Combat for a minute. Sadly, the common objectives are fortified ground targets, buildings that take many, many passes with anti-ground ordinance to destroy. From Day 3 onwards, these ground objectives are surrounded by long-range SAM sites, making carpet bombing from above the ideal tactic. This is exceptionally boring, as it requires you to line up your shots with an insufferable slow targeting reticle that shrinks when your plane is not pitching or yawing, and then turn around and repeat the process multiple times. Worse, as you'll have brought an aircraft built around bombing and not air-to-air intercept for these, you'll be at the AI's mercy when it throws its higher level fighters at you.\n\nThe game is in Early Access, but there's the rub: as we've seen over and over the past couple years, there's no guarantee that an EA game will ever progress beyond its current alpha form.  After a couple hours of play, I was stuck with the feeling, "Is that all there is?" I tend to play Ace Combat on Ace difficulty, and it does not take long for me to reach the point where I can progress no further in Sky Rogue. I hit my inevitable death after passing by for my fourth bombing run of a target, get tossed back to the beginning, and it feels like something's missing. Variety, perhaps. Or maybe I'm missing the fun. There's a game in here somewhere that I very much enjoy and very much want to play more of, but it's locked behind uninteresting, ultimately futile bombing missions on an unintersting group of islands in the middle of an uinteresting sea. Ultimate, Sky Rogue strikes me as one of those games that comes inside another game as a distraction or Easter egg, not a retail product.\n\nPerhaps the game will expand, but perhaps not. This is Early Access, after all, where nothing is certain. I would not hedge my bets on the game making good on its implicit promise of scratching that itch we feel for a good arcade flight game, and cannot, therefore, in good conscience recommend this game. If you are absolutely desperate to feel the thrill of the Ace Combat games, wait for a sale. Yes, it's only $10, but you should still wait for a sale.\n\nI also hear that a PS2 emulator will play AC4 just fine, so there's that.","August 21, 2015","false","2.1"," 16 of 26 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","16","26","0","0"

Although it's limited to one set of play, the different types of 'Aeros' and weaponry allow for a lot of replayability. It gives a good balance between trying to clear the whole island, or just go for the objectives only.\n\nThe Good:\n- Feel like an absolute badass,\n- Combat: is very fun. Blowing stuff up feels very good.\n- Steam Workshop: gives you so many new Aeros some of my favourite planes have been recreated by the community.\n- Art: Simple setup, I like it.\n- Difficulty, It gets very, very hard in a few days, which keeps pushing you to perform and reach another day. +5 days is insane. A real challenge!\n\nThe rest could be fixed by the developer in the future:\n\nThe Bad:\n- Music: is limited, one song for flying, one for the menu.\n\nThe Ugly:\n- Countermeasures: one simply is better than the rest, for consistent use.\n- No cockpit view: Some community built Aeros have a cockpit view, which really adds to the experience!\n- Gamemode: just one for the moment. Still this hasn't put me off yet.\n- The islands are a bit dull, could have a bit more stuff, like civilian structures perhaps.\n\nConclusion:\nA game 20+ hours in, easy to pick up, rewarding and engaging. Even with a bare points of functionality it keeps dragging me back in.","January 14","true","24.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It looks great, the controls are easy to learn (I recommend using a gamepad, though; "mouse and keyboard" controls are a bit awkward, and I heard that there is joystick compatibility, as well, but since I do not have one, I cannot comment how good it may be), there are several different types of planes to unlock, lots of weapons to unlock and outfit your plane of choice with, and since all of the terrains and main missions are randomly generated, no two levels really feel the same, which makes the replay value incredibly high. And apparently, there is custom Workshop content that you can use in the game, as well.\n\nIf I had to compare it to another game, I would obviously have to pick the games that are in the Ace Combat series. This game is a godsend to me, in that regard, since I love that series, but since my laptop is a violently-obsolete mess and I never use game consoles anymore, I cannot play any of those games whatsoever. This game, however, runs perfectly at the highest fullscreen resolution settings for me, even without turning VSync on.\n\nThis game is still in Early Access, and the price is apparently supposed to jump up by about 50% when it either enters its Beta phase or reaches version 1.0 (predicted to happen in early 2016; at the time of this review, it is early April, so it could possibly happen any time now), so I highly recommend picking it up before either one of those points are reached.

This is not a game about realism or technical complexity, nor about peaceful and lengthy flights. It bears far more resemblance to StarFox or classic Top Gun games than to DCS or Falcon BMS. You will be fighting enemies the minute you're off the deck, often in overwhelming numbers. Ammunition recharges, and planes can pull of maneuvers a MiG pilot could only dream of. But there is balance in Sky Rogue's simplicity. It packs in arcade-y style to make it fun to just pick up and play, but it retains just enough realism to make you feel like you're actually flying. The planes are more maneuverable than some real-life aircraft, but you do still have to think about stalling, gravity, and how your speed is affecting your turn rate. Ammunition regenerates, but weapons have limitations like radar cones. Everything, whether flying, shooting, or dodging enemy fire, has a nice visceral feel to it.\n\nSky Rogue is the perfect pick-up-and-play combat flight sim. There's enough complexity of systems and skill required to give it longevity, but you won't need to watch a 4-hour tutorial just to be able to play the game. And you won't need to devote an hour to playing at a stretch. You can pick it up and play it for however long you want, be that 5 minutes or 5 hours.\n\nPros:\nVery active dev who really listens to the community's wishes and opinions\nGreat modding community\nEasy to mod (would be a great place to dip your toes into modding)\nEasy to learn, tough to master\nFeels good to play\nSolid replayability\nLovely art style\n\nCons:\nNo toggle switches\nNo online multiplayer (yet)\nStill in development, so there are some bugs","February 8","true","36.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Unlike Fox McCloud, however, you play as an unknown pilot, and completing missions from your flying aircraft character. Battles are restricted to the atmosphere, and take place on islands, which allows enemies to defend in the land, sea, and air. Depending on your craft, you can utilize different gear to suit a mission (for example, using a bomber with cluster bombs to destroy a ground target or an interceptor with guided missiles to take out a flying target).\n\nSooner or later, however, you will crash (or be shot down) and then you choose what kinds of technology to develop, either new weapons or new planes. The amount you can research is based on your tech level, which, in turn, is based off kills. This sets up a nice incentive for you, the player: to stay in a mission, getting lots of kills to upgrade your tech when you eventually falter, or to leave sooner to get a further run.\n\nAlso, theres mod support. Right now it's restricted to new ships (which are basically new models, such as X-Wing fighters from Star Wars), and skins for your plane and carrier.\n\nControls are good. I love the controller support, and the advanced controls seem pretty natural. Theres also beginner controls if you want something different.\n\nThe game is in alpha but im seriously loving it so much, you should totally get it.","October 6, 2015","true","13.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game is fun in short bursts as a palette-cleanser, but unless you're really into shooting the same stuff over and over again then I doubt this is the kind of game that you'll be playing for hours at a time.  The "procedurally generated" missions aren't what they're cracked up to be; everything's going to look and feel exactly the same on every single playthrough. Difficulty curve is pretty inconsistent too; Days 1 and 2 are usually pretty easy, Day 3 provides an enjoyable challenge, and Day 4 and beyond is balls-to-the-wall batshit insane. This cycle last for about 15 minutes and then after you get your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ravaged the game boots you back to Day 1 again. It's a little jarring; I think the difficulty should start off just a tad bit harder, but it shouldn't skyrocket as quickly as it does.\n\nWith the negative stuff out of the way...the game controls great. I don't play a lot of flying games (my flying experience is limited to stuff like Just Cause and GTA) and in my opinion the flight model is a great balance between realistic and arcade-y. You won't be accounting for heavy wind or lightly adjusting your trim, but you also won't be turning at angles sharp enough to tear a plane apart or kill the pilot with g-forces either. On keyboard, the controls are awkward at first but if you have enough patience you can get used to it. An Xbox 360 controller, on the other hand, instantly feels natural with default settings. The game's also playable with my Logitech Wingman Extreme 3D, although it was a little tricky to bind the controls at first.\n\ntl;dr Sky Rogue is repetitive and hard, but if you enjoy shooting things with a plane and don't care too much about realism then it's a good way to kill a few minutes. Get it on sale if you can.","May 18","true","4.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This is probably its biggest flaw as there is clearly a single dominate strategy that essentially becomes necessary in the later levels to use (establish air superiority then use bombs to destroy everything from outside of the SAM's range)\n\n\nAll that being said this game still is fun and worth your money, just beware of its flaws.","August 10, 2015","true","7.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

At one point in my life, I wanted to be a fighter pilot. But alas, it was never meant to be. So, I live that dream in video games.

I don't remember too much about it and I haven't played it in over 10 years, but I remember it being fun.\n\nSky Rogue does something similar to that game. It mixes Rogue-lite elements with an arcadey flying game that is incredibly satisfying to play. The game has very simplistic polygon graphics and the game files are under 50MB, so it can probably run on most computers. I would recommend a 360 Controller or a flight stick if you have one. I haven't played with KB+M, but I wouldn't imagine it being as fun.\n\nThere are tonnes of weapons that are unlocked steadily after each run, and plenty of planes that have different speed, handling and weapon types. This game has plenty of replayability as well, and can be pretty difficult in later levels. I haven't beaten the game yet, but I hope to soon.\n\nEarly access-wise, this is a good one.

I personally find that death is usually hillarious - and that's when you get to research new tech anyways! This is so, so much fun split-screen co-op. If one person dies in co-op, you lose all your money - but if the remaining player finishes the mission then you both start the next mission respawned and ready to go! Money gets spent on upgrades you already unlocked and they last till you die (or any player dies in co-op). Tech points get spent after GAME OVER to unlock new tech - and these remain unlocked forever. So far tech items are new planes, weaponry, or special equipment. I didn't find this out till just recently, but you can also go into cockpit view instead of 3rd person (plane?) by hitting select on your controller.\n\nI see a lotta potential in this game for an Alpha. It's already super fun so I can only see it going up from here with more tech to unlock an enemies to fight. You can even get modded planes from the Steam Workshop - and though they aren't necessarily balanced - many are very fun ;-) Main point: MOD SUPPORT. ALREADY!

When it went paid I didn't have the cash at the time to get it, but then I heard it was coming on Steam, so I waited patiently, and now I have it, and now I have played it again, with all its updated features I missed because I only had the free version.\n\nIt was worth the wait, it will be worth waiting for the full release version. It's still just as fun, it's still just as awesome looking. Beautiful, slightly abstract graphics, blistering pace, high danger and wonderful controls, coupled with a great weaponry unlock system equals a wonderfully fun game.\n\nWho would have thought that a Roguelike flightsim could possibly be a thing? Well, Sky Rogue proves it is, and that it can be, and that done right, it's amazing. There are so many wonderful little touches as well (which as you know are all important). Things like destroyed aircraft still being physical objects you can crash into and die as a result of, escalating threat level as you blow stuff up, both sky and land targets, the simple yet dynamic flight controls, the simple but engaging music, solid 60fps framerate by the looks of things, wonderful way of levelling up and unlocking stuff...\n\nSPLIT.\nSCREEN.\nMULTIPLAYER.\n\noh yeah you like that? Course you do. Ace Combat classic action style right there.\n\nGet this right now. You won't regret it. I paid £6.29 for this. I would have gladly paid £10 for this, MINIMUM. I could easily pay up to £15 for this and still feel it was absolutely 100% worth it.\n\nHonestly I think the only downside is that they're selling this game short!\n\nSo in summary, do you like games like Afterburner, StarFox/Starwing, and Ace Combat? Then you will absolutely adore this game. And you should get it. It's ridiculously cheap even at full price.\n\n[edit] Oh goddammit I keep loving this game. I cannot stop playing it. I seriously adore it! it was awesome when it was free and it's even more awesome now that it's not free.\n\n[UPDATE 8/1/16] Yes, this game is still very highly recommended. Yes it's still bloody incredible, yes you should still buy this game. The pricetag is relatively tiny, the framerate is blistering, the action is still hot and hard, the modding support is getting better as time goes on, the ability to upgrade your weapons too adds more to the game, and theres more stuff to spend your scrap on now as a result. :D Every update makes the game even better than before!","July 30, 2015","true","16.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Looked like a lot of fun, and it plays very simple too. Reminds me of Starfighter on 3DO or Starfighter 3000 (same game, different publisher) on PS1 or Saturn. Just fly around and blow stuff up. There are mission objectives to do, but even after completing those, there are other things to attack as well.\n\nOnly problem is the game almost requires you to use a gamepad. On the Aerolab and a few other areas, it says use the stick to select and a and b to proceed. I have a gamepad, so that is no problem, just wasn't plugged in, but might be an issue for keyboard or mouse users.\n\nFor mouse users, the controls are KINDA similar to War Thunder.\n\nI do recommend it, I get the same thrill playing this as LuftRausers tends to give as well.","July 30, 2015","true","3.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Sky Rogue works fine and doesn't do anything wrong - but it doesn't do a whole lot particularly right, either. It is a very standard arcade fighter-jet shooter. The only thing roguelike about it is maybe permadeath.\n\nThis is the kind of game I would expect to see in the corner of a pizza shop, sometime in the mid 1990's.\n\nMy main issue was that it was not addicting at all. All the weapons feel ho-hum, and while the graphics work for it, they are fairly generic.","September 8, 2015","false","0.8"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","8","15","0","0"

I understand the game came out yesterday, and that it is still in early access, but the menu is COMPLETELY unusable for someone attempting to play this game with a simple keyboard/mouse like me. The controls simply don't work. I can't go back, I can't get to the research part of the menu under loadout... Not to mention that the Aerolab in the campain menu doesn't work at all (It's all glitched out). One time when I started the game the letters were just a bunch of mutilated pixels. Another time I couldn't even start. I realize I haven't played this game long, but that's simply because the menus are unusable.\n\nNow actual gameplay? That's a different story. I absolutely LOVE it. The style, the sounds, and yes, even the anoying cheezy music. It's very well-made. I have a great time when I'm in the game, but in-between levels I have to fight with the menu so much that it drains the energy right out of the gameplay. I'm sorry, but I can't honestly give this game a thumbs-up with the horrid menu.\n\nFix the menu controls, and this game could very well be legendary material!\n\n[EDIT] I played this game again and looked up the menu controls. They still glitch pretty bad, but I understand the menu a little better. I think I was a little too harsh with my review. Thumbs up. Still, the implementation of mouse controls or at least fixing the keyboard ones would be a HUGE improvement.

It is pick up and play type of game. But there is also a learning curve and nice weapon layout to add some depth which a big draw. I would call this game a Arcade Flight Sim Rogue! Crazy Right!?! You unlock new gear with cash and experience you earn from blowing things up and completing missions which is very rewarding. But you can lose some of that gear by dying! Nice risk and rewards feature. Although what you lose seems very random, you never know what it's gonna be? May be one item you have equipped or 3! It plays flawless with a Xbox One controller. The planes you start with all handle different and have noticeable pros and cons. I tried the extream 3D Pro Joystick, and it worked kinda...... I need more time setting it up to see for sure, I wish it was a little more plug and play. The throttle worked, at 0 50 100%. Would have liked a little more control, especially for mapping the missles, guns, targeting, etc. But for what it is I feel more comfortable with the controller anyway. This is my first Early Access experience, and it's been a very good one and I'm excited to see where this game goes! It's worth 10 easy, even with the obvious tweaks that need to be addressed.

I enjoy flying games but often I find the really hardcore sims are just too much for me (DCS, Falcon, etc.). As such, it's nice having this more accessible game, but what really impresses me about the design is how it still manages to convey so much of what makes modern air combat interesting in such an easy-to-play package.\n\nThere are numerous types of aircraft, all of which handle significantly differently from each other. Add on top of that you can load out the different planes with different weaponry (but you can't overload your airframes maximum payload!).\n\nThe game procedurally generates islands for you to conduct your air war, and each island poses a different challenge that can be completed in multiple ways. If your target is a ground structure, do you want to destroy the enemy carrier so you won't be harassed by enemy aircraft and can bomb with impunity? Or do you want try to get a fast plane to dodge enemy fire and zip in-and-out of range before they can catch up?\n\nThe developer is very active and responsive, and I'd imagine this game will expand in some very interesting directions. But frankly, even if it doesn't, it's well worth the money for the accessible-yet-deep air combat you'll experience with the game as-is.","August 4, 2015","true","1.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Rather than delete it, I just decided to put this in to tell you to skip to the next paragraph if you're not interested.  So i was going to the steam store after a little vacation away from my pc with my family, to check out new deals, and this review window popped up for sky rogue, which i bought and played quite a lot of before I left. So, I figured I might as well write the review. Anyways, Sky Rogue is a nice little gem, if it was rather hidden for a while. (And still seems to be, as far as I know, I saw it had been released by looking at the new releases on the mobile steam app, as poorly designed as that app is. Like I said, it might have been on the front page, might not, idk)\nOn to the review. Sky Rogue is an interesting game, originally a game you could get for free (or pay for, if you liked it, which i think is pretty cool of the devs!) on their website, although i forgot what the site was. They might still have an old version up for free, last I knew they'd stopped releasing updates for free. It is a nice game, with a (imhop) neat art style, reminicsent of some more recent old arcade games that I can think of. The controlls are nice, as long as you have a controller, the keyboard and mouse controlls are ok, but not amazing. There are a few different building types and enemies, although I haven't gotten very far. It is a rogue-like, after all, you get tech points and cash by destroying enemies and buildings, and you can develop new technology using these tech points. Among these things you can unlock are new planes, bombs, homing missiles, guns, engines (which give special abilities like dodging and boost), etc. When you die, you lose some of the weapons you were carrying, but (thankfully) not the different planes. you then can use the money you earned to buy these back for use. It sounds kinda annoying, but it isn't too much of a bother. The missions are varied, whether to destroy a lab, large plane, or giant helicarrier with missiles and drones. there are many weapons, and I especially like using the bombs. There is something... beutifull about passing by a building from several kilometers in the air, and watching your carefully dropped cluster bombs hit their marks directly, as you fly into the distance. anyways, I definitely think this is well worth its cost, and that it is an amazing game.","August 6, 2015","true","7.5"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Start over.\n\n\nThe real tragedy of the obnoxious difficulty curve is that it presses the player into a more narrow choice of play-styles than the game would seem to otherwise allow. There are ground attack missions, but don't try making a low-altitude loadout based on rockets or cannons because enemy fighters and SAMS will vaporize you. The only way to survive ground attack missions is to drop bombs on your target from a mile away and flee back to your carrier before more fighters spawn. Those giant long-range interceptor missiles look cool, but don't ever use them because enemy fighters turn on a dime and dodge them every time. Even dogfights are reduced to nothing but an endless turning battle with stupidly maneuverable enemies while you mash the button that deploys your (finite) countermeasures to deflect their (infinite) missiles. Half the planes go unused because they can't survive the world the game generates. It's frustrating, but more importantly it's monotonous.\n\nI'm thinking the flight sim format doesn't blend well with roguelike elements like procedural generation and permadeath. The game gives you the tools of a traditional flight sim but they're the wrong tools to deal with the challenges of a roguelike.\n\n","October 25, 2015","false","9.2"," 7 of 19 people (37%) found this review helpful","37","7","19","0","0"

The game attempts to provide the player with a large sandbox with several targets and objects to shoot and destroy.\n\nThe issue I have is not that it is graphically simplistic (it appears it's only for the aesthetic, and not even for higher frame rates or anything), the issue is not that the game is poorly set out or that menus are atrrocious.\nThe issue I have is that the game is not fun.\n\nAfter working the unintuitive camera and targeting system, you line up a shot and blow up enemy jets only to see a 2D explosion and the simple model slowly move down from where it was. The buildings when shot produce a particle effect and are absorbed into the ground at a rate comparible to osmosis.\nThen there's what you're doing. You have little idea what's shooting at you, and often it appears as if you're killed by an enemy sneezing at you.\n\nIn the game blurb at the top of the store page the last phrase "when you die, you're dead" is a silly tautology that makes little sence. But once you play the game realise that what that means is when you're shot down, your progress is reset and you start all over again.\n\nThat fits into the next part, the dificulty curve. Following the tutorial that a 3 year old could probably complete, you're thrown into a mission that has everything set up against you, enemy jets, SAMs, etc. So you have to go thorugh securing air superiority, then dominating the ground, THEN you can go and strafe at the mission dependent target.\n\nMore or less, the issue I have is not that this game is in Early Access and that so many parts of what I didn't like would change, my issue is that the core gameplay mechanic was not fun, it was not satisfying and importantly wasn't rewarding enough. This is why I think you probably should be sceptical of this game and really consider if you really want it.","August 6, 2015","false","1.2"," 9 of 39 people (23%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","23","9","39","0","5"

Where do I start here? I guess I'll start with a question. You! Yes, you, Reader. Don't look at me like that. The fourth wall cannot protect you here. What did you think this was, a work of fiction? No, this is a video game review. Now shut up and listen, because I'm monologuing here and I will not have my rhetorical questions interrupted with that uncouth glare of yours.\nReally. Am I going to have to confiscate your eyebrows?\nNo?\nGood.\nAs I was trying to say before I was so rudely interrupted: I would like to start this with a question. That is do you, the reader with the funny eyebrows and the tendency to rudely throw a writer off his train of thought, like to blow stuff up?\nIf the answer to that question's yes, then you will like this game.\nIt's really somewhat more complicated than that - you will also, for instance, need to learn to fly a variety of aircraft in a variety of horrifically dangerous situations, many of them involving missile spam, bullet spam, enemy spam, turret spam, and very nearly every other kind of spam except the true, original, Monty-Python-Sketch-Inspiring ham-like meat product. (Incidentally, that sketch is where the term "spam" comes from. See, we can learn things even on the internet! Knowledge! It ain't just for breakfast!) Simply put, this game's a blast. The levels are procedural, with mission objectives chosen semi-randomly from a list of possibilities; the more missions you complete, the more hideously dangerous the skies become. And, of course, dying sets the counter back to day 1.\nThe game does have its downsides - it's an early access title, so there are some hiccups in the current build. For instance, sometimes a target won't recognize that it's dead and will linger in your targeting system until you fly away and find something else to shoot at. And in the indev version, there's that finicky little thing where pressing "back" in a menu will instantly ask you if you want to return to the title screen, resulting in some wacky hijinx and occasional selection glitchery.\nBut if you're willing to overlook a handful of minor flaws for the chance to fly around blasting minions like the Red Baron on way too much caffiene, then this is a game for you! The devs update regularly and respond to the community on their Steam page fairly often; mods are supported, up to and including ships from Wing Commander and Cowboy Bebop, and, of course, with a certain loadout you can barrel roll between the hails of missiles like Starfox on a Tuesday afternoon!\nFinal summation: if you like your flight sims, give this game a shot. If you like explosions, give this game a shot. If you like arcadey shoot-em-ups where you get to perform flights of flying-ace-like derring-do - I think you see where this is going - give this game a shot.\n","September 5, 2015","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Galjin and Wargameing have huge development teams and spend billions of dollars on the most cutting edge graphics engines and events... three guys doing this themselves as a project pull the rug out from under both of them!\n\nPros:\n\n+Fun graphics: The game has a retro look. Honestly has a Nintendo feel to it\n\n+Lots of cool jets and weapons: all the jets are awesome, and you can completely customize their loadouts. you'll soon find out why people during the Vietnam war that thought jets like the F-4 Phantom wouldn’t need gun armament anymore quickly changed their minds... and why jets still have cannon armament today...\n\n+Replayability: When Warthunder or World of Warplanes pisses me off... time to fire up Skyrouge and let off some steam. You can sink hours into this game. And its procedurally generated missions mean you never know what your going to find when your plane leaves the deck...\n\n+Easy and enjoyable: No trashy, half done, "sorta but not really realistic" physics here. Its simple, and anyone can do it and be good at it.\n\n+Portable: The game barely downloads at 200mb. And its obviously not graphically intense, which means it would run just fine on your laptop. Works great on mine.\n\n+No bugs... not an exaggeration! I honestly haven’t encountered one yet...\n\nNow for some Cons:\n\n-Repetitive soundtrack: its fun for the first few hours, but starts to get annoying, different tunes for each battle would be nice...\n\n-Difficult controls: Yah you REALY need an Xbox remote or a Joystick to get complete satisfaction playing this. Anyone that thinks they can just use their keyboard and mouse are in for a very frustrating time… most of the bad reviews your going to see are rants about this…  GET A XBOX REMOTE!\n\nOld school "when you die your dead" progression system: Not really a problem to be honest: when you get shot down, you start all over. However your pilot continues to level up as you play, so you can keep the jets and missiles you unlock. It plays like a First Gen Sonic or Mario game. The whole game plays like survival mode in Modern Warfare. When you die, its back to level one. Might be annoying for spoiled newer gamers. ;-)\n\nUm... cant think of anything else... there’s almost nothing else I have to say bad about the game.\n\nTired of the grind fest and the unrewarding experience of Warthunder or any other of the big combat sims?\n\nHonestly get this. Its a good game, simple to play, and best of all, its FUN. What’s truly important in a computer game...","November 25, 2015","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The playstyle of this flight simulator, the music and the low-poly graphics all make this an insanely fun and interesting arcade-style dogfighter.\n\nI find the rogue-like elements interesting, (when you 'level up' you choose between 3 new technologies after death for each level) and the fact that they're expendable adds a lot of lasting value to the game. I do wish that you could switch loadouts between levels in case you wanted to use your new stuff before a death but it doesn't detract from the game.\n\nIt has an offline couch co op multiplayer which is also insanely fun, I'm hoping that eventually there's a head to head version of this included as I think it would be awesome to go at it with your friends.\n\nOverall this game is definitely worth more then it's being sold for, so if you're looking for something fun, easy to pick up and has a great difficulty curve, check out Sky Rogue now!","October 13, 2015","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game scratches an itch that many other flight combat sims do not, and allows you to enjoy the thrill of flight and aerial combat without the immense frustration of repeating a difficult failed mission over and over to progress. If you fail, you are simply given a new series of missions, procedurally generated missions with objectives that you must bomb off the face of the earth or shoot out of the sky. Each mission also presents numerous optional objectives which you can destroy for additional credit towards unlocking the next tech, which can be new aircraft, weapons, or utility items like afterburners and IR flares.\n\nThis game is rather reminiscent of the sleeper gem Starfighter for 3D0, which had similar graphics and open-world objectives (and many other remarkable features).\n\nVisually the game is appealingly simple, flat vector graphics with striking aircraft designs featuring pleasant details and moving parts that react to your control of the craft, such as a swing-wing interceptor that changes configuration as you accelerate.\n\nThe controls are smooth using a gamepad.\n\nDid I mention it has local co-op with splitscreen?\n\nI bought three games the other day, this one was the cheapest and also completely dominated my attention out of the three. Highly recommended if you like to be a Top Gun. It's lovely, challenging and fun. Can't remember the last flight game that kept me coming back for more.","August 10, 2015","true","41.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's simplistic, quite a challenge, and very addictive. If you die in the middle of a mission, you lose some of your weapons, so after you beat missions and save up money, you can buy them back. Once you die, you start on a randomized first level and have to get as far into the levels as you can, until you lose. Splitscreen is extremely fun and is even better than the single player.","August 12, 2015","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Galjin and Wargameing have huge development teams and spend billions of dollars on the most cutting edge graphics engines and events... three guys doing this themselves as a project pull the rug out from under both of them!\n\nPros:\n\n+Fun graphics: The game has a retro look. Honestly has a Nintendo feel to it\n\n+Lots of cool jets and weapons: all the jets are awesome, and you can completely customize their loadouts. you'll soon find out why people during the Vietnam war that thought jets like the F-4 Phantom wouldn’t need gun armament anymore quickly changed their minds... and why jets still have cannon armament today...\n\n+Replayability: When Warthunder or World of Warplanes pisses me off... time to fire up Skyrouge and let off some steam. You can sink hours into this game. And its procedurally generated missions mean you never know what your going to find when your plane leaves the deck...\n\n+Easy and enjoyable: No trashy, half done, "sorta but not really realistic" physics here. Its simple, and anyone can do it and be good at it.\n\n+Portable: The game barely downloads at 200mb. And its obviously not graphically intense, which means it would run just fine on your laptop. Works great on mine.\n\n+No bugs... not an exaggeration! I honestly haven’t encountered one yet...\n\nNow for some Cons:\n\n-Repetitive soundtrack: its fun for the first few hours, but starts to get annoying, different tunes for each battle would be nice...\n\n-Difficult controls: Yah you REALY need an Xbox remote or a Joystick to get complete satisfaction playing this. Anyone that thinks they can just use their keyboard and mouse are in for a very frustrating time… most of the bad reviews your going to see are rants about this…  GET A XBOX REMOTE!\n\nOld school "when you die your dead" progression system: Not really a problem to be honest: when you get shot down, you start all over. However your pilot continues to level up as you play, so you can keep the jets and missiles you unlock. It plays like a First Gen Sonic or Mario game. The whole game plays like survival mode in Modern Warfare. When you die, its back to level one. Might be annoying for spoiled newer gamers. ;-)\n\nUm... cant think of anything else... there’s almost nothing else I have to say bad about the game.\n\nTired of the grind fest and the unrewarding experience of Warthunder or any other of the big combat sims?\n\nHonestly get this. Its a good game, simple to play, and best of all, its FUN. What’s truly important in a computer game...","November 25, 2015","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Very much like Ace Combat only with an aesthetic that sort of recalls an era before that. No plot, no frills, just a very fun set of mechanics. Works perfectly with an XBox 360 controller plugged in, doesn't require the latest most expensive hardware, I can't really fault anything about it at all to be honest. Get it, it's good.\n\nEDIT: Something happened in a patch since my original review and I can no longer get my flight stick to work, and this appears to have been a long term problem for a lot of people trying to use a flight stick, so I can't really recommend this game as unreservedly as I once did.
