You click through various story branches where each next option requires you to click x more times after selecting the current achievement from the pause menu. While the story itself is interesting, it is not deep at all. The whole game is more a joke game, an anti-clicker game that is not as bad as the one in the Basement Collection,[1] but dull enough in gameplay terms that you need to reflect on your gaming habits. Do you play games for achievements? Great, grab this, click 10k times and have another 100 percent in under an hour! Do you play for fun? Then avoid this! Or if you really play it, take the lesson you get from it, which is how stupid clicker games really are, why they only work as idle games, and even then only as glorified Skinner boxes.\n\nGraphics:\nThe graphics are like a flash game. There is not a wide variety, but the different mayo jar styles are humorously done.\n\nSound:\nThe sound consists of a forgettable track and minimalistic sound effects.\n\nGameplay:\nClicker. Without any gains from idling. 10k clicks (pause menu to choose storyline excluded) and you are done.\n\nRecommended?\nNo, I can not recommend this at 59 cent, or the standard price of 99 cent. This is made to be a joke gift to your friends, but buying for yourself would be silly unless you go for achievements. But even then, you could have gotten games that are more fun and longer in the last sale.\n\n\n[1] http://edmundmcmillen.blogspot.de/2009/02/avgm-retrospective.html - Thanks to freezing_rain for posting the link in his review http://steamcommunity.com/id/freezing_rain/recommended/434260/","February 15","false","0.9"," 214 of 272 people (79%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","79","214","272","13","7"

His game was called "AVGM" which stands for "Abusive Video Game Manipulation". It's even available as part of the "Basement Collection" here on Steam (it's a hidden game in there).\nAs it stands AVGM had an interesting message, which you can read on McMillen's Blog here:\n\nhttp://edmundmcmillen.blogspot.de/2009/02/avgm-retrospective.html\n\nSo this game about the Mayo Jar here is basically exactly the same, but it's not a free game with a message like the one from Mr McMillen was... take from that what you want...\n\nWell, at least you could use an auto-clicker to farm 100% achievements in a couple of minutes... but that's about it.\nNot recommended.","February 15","false","0.7"," 135 of 168 people (80%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","80","135","168","6","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jadarma/recommended/434260/","Jadarma","Jadarma","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jadarma/","267 products in account","OverviewMy Name is Mayo is a short, click spam game where you click on a jar of mayo in order to uncover different stories told in one-liners that are also achievements. I will try to write this review as serious as possible, though... come on. This is meant to be a joke. (I hope!)\n\nThe Pros:It's a teeny bit fun - And by that I mean, it's so bad it's good. You get a chuckle during your first (an hopefully only playthrough)\nGreat Gag Gift - When this goes on sale, it's half a buck. Not even a real jar of mayo can't beat that price. Send them to your friends before you give them the actual gift.\nEasy Achievements - Half an hour of clicking (I suggest making a click macro if you can, so as not to wear your mouse for no reason) and you get 50 easy achievements along with a perfect game!\nTrading Cards - At this point, every stupid game on Steam has these. Let them idle so you can at least return your investment a bit.\nLeaderboards?! - This actually has a Steam Leaderboard that ranks you based on how many times you've tapped the mayo jar. Some of these entries (although clearly illicit) show just what people can do out of boredom.\nThe Cons:It costs money - While one buck is not going to break the bank, I can't think of any reason to spend it on this. There are loads other even stupider games that go for free. Unless you're in for the achievements and / or trading cards, go elsewhere.\nCould have been... longer? - Although I don't regret not being able to play this game more, it had the potential for the joke. Much more content could have been put in, even if it made it would make it in a cookie clicker clone.\nConclusion:Seriously now, I love myself some occasional $h!ts and giggles, but at some point you have to draw the line between what should be somewhere on Newgrounds with a donate button, and an actual game for sale on Steam. There's nothing wrong with this game (apart from everything) but Steam just is not the place for it.\n\nIf you enjoyed this review and want to see more of my work, consider joining my group and follow my curator page!

About an hour of playtime, maybe.  Depends on how long it takes one to click a total of 10000 times.

The jar of mayonnaise does play at "dress up" along the way, just to be silly.  There are 4 absurd 'storylines' of one liners, and 12 accurate facts so the educational aspect is "covered".\n\nFor achievement hunters and card collectors this game is probably worth the $1 (or less, if on sale).

You click like 50 times and then you pick another icon and keep going.\n\nSo I did that for 30 minutes and guess what? I've completed the game. Really what is the purpose of this game?

Uhm... Okay. I won this game in a giveaway and tried it out of pure curiosity to begin with, which doesn't serve me right most of the time. Writing a review for this one will be a challenge. I really should appreciate the way developers' mind work here. Even now I'm trying to get my head together to think about something imaginative to say about a mayonnaise jar, and as absurd it may be, some people managed to make a whole game out of it!\n\nEhm... My Name is Mayo is a clicker game - and aside not really being the most absurd one that I've ever seen in the market either, has a weird sense of humor targeting a selection of pop culture references wrapped in a vintage display. There is really nothing into it aside clicking on a mayonnaise jar while listening to the repetition of the same pesky 40s advertisement jingle tune. After a certain amount of clicking, you unlock short and absurd story paths for your mayonnaise jar and given the opportunity to dress it up in various accessories. As being the mission of any and all clicker games, your primary motivation here is to kill some brain cells while looking at your screen with empty eyes, silently drooling and clicking with your mouse to fill the illusion of you are actually doing something. Well done! It takes 10.000 clicks to collect all that there is within this game, never to visit again. If you are a strict achievement hunter and got it for an easy completion; sure, this is your game. You might consider running a script rather than actually clicking it through anyhow though.\n\nCould I recommend it? Sure, why not if you strictly know what is it that you are getting here? I, myself prefer games with actual stories but also know first handedly the mindless therapeutic relaxation of being able to not think anything serious as a long time player of Clicker Heroes. My Name is Mayo is a perfect medium for that. The game deserves some appreciation for being humorous without being imposing, obnoxious or promising false depth anyhow. While we ponder on the philosophy, the boundless ethical and existential conflict hidden behind a mayonnaise jar, we keep clicking.

And I spent 2 hours clicking a button to simulate tapping on a 2D image of a jar of mayonnaise. Unlocking achievements in which I was rewarded a bikini for a my jar to wear, a mustache, among other things like a ball of yarn for it to spin. All while still clicking. I didn't find the actual jokes funny, I didn't find the practice of arriving at the jokes humorous. At its core, this game, the IDEA of this game is very funny.

Unfortunately, he proceeded to purchase this game and give it to me, much to my dismay. After thoroughly chastising him for this act, I decided to load it up to see if the game really had any flavor or challenge to it. After lightning loading it, I entered the game. As the first image loaded onto my screen, I was sent into a state of pure agony. I bolted out of my seat, ripping the earbuds from my head, causing a tearing of my ear cartilage. Bleeding, I dashed to my kitchen, grabbing a steak knife. I proceeded to return to my computer and firmly lodged the blade in the top of my monitor. I slowly and painfully dragged the knife through every LED on the way down, cleanly slicing the monitor in two. It was at this point I felt a compelling urge to click my mouse more. I realized that this game was not a piece of malware, or a virus. It was corruption at its finest. Death is better than this.

This is the memory that I will keep in mind about one of the first paying clickers with a "Very positive" review on Steam on its release day.\n\n+ Many nice references with a lot of intended humour\n+ Unlockable outfits for the mayonnaise jar\n+ Treasure hunt-like progression through the many achievements unlocked\n+ 50 easily unlockable achievements\n+ Moral lesson at the far end of the "story"\n+ No DLC\n\n- Requires at least 10.000 clicks to finish it at 100%\n- Lacks of stake to keep us involved in clicking that long\n- Daring choice to make us pay for such an empty game\n- Shame leaderboard to show your... clicking like a donkey skill?\n- Almost no soundtrack\n- No replay value\n\nNot even thinkable without an auto-clicker, that game should never have been payed for.\nIt is not bad, though. It will allow you to keep you busy for a little amount of time while clicking like a no-brainer but won't offer you more.

Is not the purpose of a game to waste our time? Distract us from the crippling reality around us? This game definitely did that for me, but for about three minutes. I was so shocked to see this on the front page of Steam. It was on sale so I checked it out and I thought...hmm this cannot be for real...?\nBut oh it is, and I spent real money on this game. Money that I actually earned at a job. I would have been better off investing it. But I decided to throw it into the mayonnaise jar, and I don't even like mayonnaise.\n\nThe whole point of this game is for the achievements. I'm an achievement ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• so naturally I said hey now...\nBut my main gripe with this game is that I am almost 100% certain that it was meant to be a mobile app game. Without a doubt. You play a finger that just taps on the glass of the jar, to navigate the menu you have to slide it down. I can honestly say within the first five minutes of purchasing this game, I regretted it. But such is life. I do not recommend this game but you know, it is what it is.\nIf you don't mind throwing away 50-99 cents for this game for the achievements/badges/trading cards then pick it up.","February 15","false","0.6"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

The guy in the top bunk has his girlfriend sleeping over. To try and keep quiet, they devise a code. His girlfriend will say "tomato" if she wants him to go slower and "lettuce" for him to go faster. As they begin to make love, the girl starts to moan, "Lettuce, lettuce, tomato, tomato!" The roommate on the bottom bunk wakes up the next morning and says, "Stop making sandwiches at night. You got mayonnaise in my eye!"\n\nSome interesting facts of mayonnaise:\n\n--- As a sauce it wasn't used till the early 19th century. You wouldn't have guessed it, would you?\n--- Its name originates from the French word moyeu which means egg yolk.\n--- Mayo offers a very fast way to get fat - one tablespoon can contain almost 100 calories.\n--- It does NOT have a short shelf life: various preservatives and acids are added so that it can be lengthened (contrary to popular beliefs).\n--- Although some might find it difficult to believe, there are countries where mayo is preferred to ketchup. In the Netherlands, for instance.\n--- Very good against sunburns! Eases the pain quickly and reduces the burning sensation (verified by myself).\n\nOh, about the game: get it if you want one more game with 100% achievement completion. It requires 10 thousand clicks (can be achieved in roughly an hour). As an extra challenge, don't use any autoclicker software.

You have experienced the game and saved 99 cents.\n\nThe trailer gives you a good idea of the game's humor, which is the only selling point. Do you find it funny to see a jar of mayo with an emo haircut? What about dressed as a banana? If so, spend the dollar. You might get a few laughs. If not, don't bother.\n\nTo unlock all the achievements, you'll have to click the mayo 10,000 times. Clicking progresses you through little storylines. Getting through all of these will take you roughly 4,000 clicks. After that it's 6,000 clicks with nothing new or entertaining (again, opinion, maybe you find poop rain really amusing and that will be enough for you). When that's done, you just let it idle for cards.

The gameplay is essentially just "mash left mouse and space bar until you damage your tendons", but there area several little chunks of story that you unlock as you click along.\n\nIt's a fun, quirky little game that I had a good time with","February 21","true","0.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

And when you know you have to do something but instead of doing something, you keep asking yourself "What do I do now?".\n\nWell first of all, you should feel scared of failing, failing is scary and it's devastating. But that's normal, everyone is scared of failing. Second, you shouldn't keep problems to yourself, it's just like math, more people you share with, your problems will be less hard.\nSharing success with others is easy, but sharing failure and asking for a hand is not so easy. You probably feel uncomfortable showing negative emotions to others, most people keeps them to themselves and only try to show the positive part. I mean why would you burden someone with your problems? But sometimes a problem is too much to handle by yourself and when you are faced with that kind of a problem, talk to someone. And when you see someone with that kind of a problem, don't step away from it. Even if you're uncomfortable, go talk to them.\n\nNow you know what to do when faced with a problem, but how do you start? Well "My Name is Mayo" is a game that explores the habit of hiding one's self to others. And hopefull this game will encourage you to be more open about yourself.\n\n"My Name is Mayo" -just like it's strange title- is kind of a strange game. You start with an ordinary jar of mayonnaise, and as you progress through the game you will unlock stories of the ordinary jar of mayonnaise.\nAt first glance, these stories seems like nothing but a joke, at first glance this whole game looks like nothing but a joke.\nBut after completing the first playthrough and you take a second look into each story, you will see that this game is far from just a joke.\nThere are four stories of Mayo[i.imgur.com], four very different kind of stories(which I wouldn't go into much detail about, because unlocking the next part of each story is something you should experience for yourselves). All four stories deal with the same idea, that we should be more open to others. Whether it's in a relationship, with your parents or with your friends, you should always feel comfortable sharing.\nAs seen in each story, not being open to others have consenquences. You might break up, you might get into fights or you might lose someone important to you.\n\nSo why keep a problem to yourself? You gain nothing from it, and you won't lose anything from sharing it. After you played through this game you'll know, whenever you ask yourself the question "What do I do now?" just open yourself to others, open a jar of mayonnaise.","February 22","true","0.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

You'll be able to get 100% in one sitting so this game is obviously for you if you're an achievement hunter looking for easy achievements! The achievements require you to have a number of clicks to unlock it and some consists of a one-liner story which made me chuckle. Out of the 50 achievements, 12 of them are random facts and the rest are 4 different story plots which changes the ‚Äòclothes‚Äô of the Mayonnaise jar.\n\nThe game also has trading cards sooo if you're someone who's in it for steam trading cards, go for this.\n\nI'm not really asking for much since it's only a ‡∏ø29.00 / $0.99 game.\nIt's a plain game where you have to click a jar several times to unlock achievements and that's all there is to it.

Boil the potatoes until they are fork tender. (If you're not sure how to boil the potatoes...well you're ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• !) Drain the potatoes and set aside.\n2. Meanwhile, cook the bacon in a skillet over medium-low heat until crisp. Remove bacon with a slotted spoon and place on a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons of the bacon drippings in the skillet.\n3. Add the MAYONNAISE, mustard, sugar and salt to the reserved bacon drippings in the skillet and whisk to combine.\n4. In a large bowl, combine the potatoes, eggs, celery, onion and green pepper. Pour the dressing over the ingredients and gently stir to evenly coat. Stir in the bacon.\n5.

You pick a story as you unlock them and can read through according to color coded mini chapters concisting of a few sentances each. The more you click while dressing you jar within the lates chapter of a story, the closer you get to hearing the end of the silly short tail.

No "your hero becomes stronger by your equally heroic click finger", no "each click will hoard delicious resources". Nothing that became the gaming sickness of the last years (let's leave aside the *philosophical* problem of most of our games just making us click on stuff). Clickers are strange games, and like good old cow clicker, Mayo is more a parody of your run-of-the-mill fingerbreaker than a true game.\n\nBut it is parody with some nicely drawn images and a few hilarious moments in its micronarratives. Pick it up on sale because it really is overpriced at a dollar. But in a sale, why not. Use an auto-clicker if you want, just enjoy the weirdness and then some mayo.","April 8","true","0.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Wonderwaffle33/recommended/434260/","Wonderwaffle33","Wonderwaffle33","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Wonderwaffle33/","186 products in account","This game is a prime example of what a great year 2016 will be for the Video Game Industry. My Name is Mayo brings a revolutionary game to the table, a game that immerses the player into the life of your not so average mayo jar. My Name is Mayo tells a touching story, a story that rivals the epics of Homer, it is deep, emotional, heartwarming, and a puts a genuine smile on your face. Now the gameplay of My Name is Mayo is where this game shines. You see by either hitting the space bar or by clicking on the jar, you progress in the game. You see what is great about this is that the game has no time limit, or speed at which it must be played. You are in control, you drive the bus here, YOU the player get to expeience this adventure by your rules! Now if this isn't convincing enough for you did I mention that this game has a beautiful soundtrack? The music in this game surpasses any great symphony or musical piece ever written. It puts Motzart to shame, Bach can't even begin to comprehend how amazing this musical masterpiece is. Now if you aren't convinced of this game's amazing value by now then frankly you shouldn't even be allowed to use a computer anymore, because obviously you can't comprehend how amazing this game is, but if you still aren't convinced then let me tell you one last thing to change your mind. This game has achievements! Yes! Achievements! And these achievements not only make you feel really good, but you can show them off to your friends too! Trust me, Billy down the street won't be the cool kid anymore once you stroll in with your big list of achievements, not only that you can whip out that handy dandy smartphone or laptop of yours and show everybody that you're on the top of those world leaderboards for number of clicks. So you may ask, "Wow this game is amazing, there's got to be some catch" or "There's got to be one bad thing about this game right?" NOPE! My Name is Mayo is flawless, utter coding perfection. I mean come on, Fallout 4 on release had so many bugs the damn game was unplayable, but My Name is Mayo? Nope, no bugs here, 100% bug free since launch day. And the graphics? Well, My Name is Mayo takes complete advantage of your PC's advanced and powerful processors and video cards, it has zero restrictions whatsoever. No capping at 30fps to fit those console peasants, My Name is Mayo is 100% PC Master Race compatable. My Name is Mayo will change your life, are you single? Show a girl (or a boy) your high score and we'll see how "single" you are then. Failing math class at school? Play this and you'll learn advanced math with no problems. Are you overweight and want to drop a few pounds? Play this and your constant clicking will burn through that fat in no time. And best of all, you get this masterpice of a game for only $0.99! I'm telling you people, once we make contact with alien life, this is the game we'll show them to prove how advanced we are. NASA uses this game to help train their astronauts, seriously, it's that good! Tai Lopez himself uses this game, without this game he would have no knowledge, and with no knowledge there would be no garage, and with no garage there would be no fuel units, and then where would we be? My Name is Mayo GIVE YOU KNOWLEDGE. KNOWLEDGE.\nSo what are you waiting for? Don't stare at your computer screen like a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, Buy this game now!","February 21","true","0.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Wonderwaffle33/recommended/434260/","Wonderwaffle33","Wonderwaffle33","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Wonderwaffle33/","186 products in account","This game is a prime example of what a great year 2016 will be for the Video Game Industry. My Name is Mayo brings a revolutionary game to the table, a game that immerses the player into the life of your not so average mayo jar. My Name is Mayo tells a touching story, a story that rivals the epics of Homer, it is deep, emotional, heartwarming, and a puts a genuine smile on your face. Now the gameplay of My Name is Mayo is where this game shines. You see by either hitting the space bar or by clicking on the jar, you progress in the game. You see what is great about this is that the game has no time limit, or speed at which it must be played. You are in control, you drive the bus here, YOU the player get to expeience this adventure by your rules! Now if this isn't convincing enough for you did I mention that this game has a beautiful soundtrack? The music in this game surpasses any great symphony or musical piece ever written. It puts Motzart to shame, Bach can't even begin to comprehend how amazing this musical masterpiece is. Now if you aren't convinced of this game's amazing value by now then frankly you shouldn't even be allowed to use a computer anymore, because obviously you can't comprehend how amazing this game is, but if you still aren't convinced then let me tell you one last thing to change your mind. This game has achievements! Yes! Achievements! And these achievements not only make you feel really good, but you can show them off to your friends too! Trust me, Billy down the street won't be the cool kid anymore once you stroll in with your big list of achievements, not only that you can whip out that handy dandy smartphone or laptop of yours and show everybody that you're on the top of those world leaderboards for number of clicks. So you may ask, "Wow this game is amazing, there's got to be some catch" or "There's got to be one bad thing about this game right?" NOPE! My Name is Mayo is flawless, utter coding perfection. I mean come on, Fallout 4 on release had so many bugs the damn game was unplayable, but My Name is Mayo? Nope, no bugs here, 100% bug free since launch day. And the graphics? Well, My Name is Mayo takes complete advantage of your PC's advanced and powerful processors and video cards, it has zero restrictions whatsoever. No capping at 30fps to fit those console peasants, My Name is Mayo is 100% PC Master Race compatable. My Name is Mayo will change your life, are you single? Show a girl (or a boy) your high score and we'll see how "single" you are then. Failing math class at school? Play this and you'll learn advanced math with no problems. Are you overweight and want to drop a few pounds? Play this and your constant clicking will burn through that fat in no time. And best of all, you get this masterpice of a game for only $0.99! I'm telling you people, once we make contact with alien life, this is the game we'll show them to prove how advanced we are. NASA uses this game to help train their astronauts, seriously, it's that good! Tai Lopez himself uses this game, without this game he would have no knowledge, and with no knowledge there would be no garage, and with no garage there would be no fuel units, and then where would we be? My Name is Mayo GIVE YOU KNOWLEDGE. KNOWLEDGE.\nSo what are you waiting for? Don't stare at your computer screen like a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, Buy this game now!","February 21","true","0.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Had me on the edge of my seat at every moment. With a Gripping Storyline which resembles a mass effect meets Robert kirkman esqe deal, you will be enthraled and overjoyed at every moment. Watch as you and your other condiments (Ketchup, Mustard...no spoilers..) take on the "galactic fridge". A large empire of other foods whom use the dark side of "the fork". This empire seeks to bring mold to all foods in the kitchen. You play as Mayo, a strapping young condiment who doesnt realize he has the power of the fork. The Story of the game is good, (I dont want to give away to much), but the game really strides with its combat. A reverse third person system almost like CS GO but also nothing like it. I can see 2 more sequels in the future, then 3 horrid prequels, then in like 30 years I can see it being bought by a huge company known for kids stuff and 3 more sequels being squeezed out. Its really a great game 10/10 would totally recommend to a sloth with thumbs.\n\nSPOILER ALERT** Hot Sauce Solo Dies....\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPSA: Obviously this is fake, its a game about clicking a jar of mayo, literally thats it, i bought it for $0.59 I wasnt expecting GTA 6.

My finger hurts, but I don't regret it. My Name is Mayo is a completionist's wet dream, but it's also decently entertaining.\n\n.Premise.\nThis game is about a jar of mayo, as you're likely aware. The "story" is presented in a series of unlockable achievements, both in game and out, and there are a handful of different ones to click through. Fulfilling the clicking requirements for one\n\n.Game play.\nClick. Click for your life. You can cycle through the achievements in order to get more achievements, which also result in a Mayo costume change. Then you click some more. Both the costumes and the story itself are funny for their shock value and off the wall...ness.\n\n.Soundtrack.\nEh... I didn't pay too much attention to it over the 'clink, clink' of tapping against a simulated glass jar.\n\n.Graphics.\nIt kind of looks hand-painted, which is nice. And a few of the props actually moved around.\n\n.Price.\nFor a game with absolutely no longevity, I'd say I can't complain about the $0.59 price tag at launch. 1.00USD is a little steep, but that's up to you.\n\nBottom line: it's amusing and clever and I'd love to see a less casual game from the developers. Definitely worth a look if you have some time to kill. When else are you going to see Mayo in such a sexy state?\n\nMy only complaint is that I ran out of funny story achievements and costume changes at around 5000 clicks, which left a solid 5000 clicks for completion without any added silliness.\n","February 19","true","0.8"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","40","6","15","2","0"

My first reaction was 'is this I am Bread 2'? But I could not have been more wrong. Upon opening the game I will admit that I was not impressed. "It's just a jar of mayo," I recall myself saying, "There's not even a main menu." But I soon realized that there wasn't any need for that. The game in itself was all it needed. What followed was, in my experience, was a few minutes of me clicking on the jar as I figured out the various achievements I could get while said friend watched on my broadcast.\n\nWithin ten minutes I was dressing up my mayoanaise jar. Within twenty I had unlocked all of the achievements other than the ones to do with click number. And that's where my story began, the true journey of self discovery. As my friend laughed, I continued to play and click until my muscles hurt and it felt like my finger would fall off. But I was determined. I watched the number rise. 5000... 6000... and so on until I finally hit that glorious number.\n\n10000\n\nAnd what I realized about myself changed my view on the world completely. If I hadn't given this game a chance, I wouldn't have these precious memories. And so, I say, give things a try even when you're hesitant to. Or be like me and be addicted to clicker games.\n\nStill better than sakura clicker/10","February 17","true","0.5"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BackslashNetwork/recommended/434260/","BackslashNetwork","Backslash [Youtuber]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BackslashNetwork/","50 products in account","TL;DR: Buy if you spare a dollar. Don't buy if you don't like clicker games.\n\nPrice\quality: This game takes about an hour to finish, the normal price of this game is a dollar. The legal American minimum wage is 7.50, it's 8.05 in my state. I have a job so this means that I can easily afford 8 of these games within an hour (taxes not included). Money is not an issue to me. I actually enjoyed this game. I liked that it had an ending. I don't have an issue with clicker games or meme games so that's a major influence in my review.\n\nI enjoy clicker games to a certain extent. I recognized that this game wasn't going to last long, but the art style and the achievements made up for it (I got all the achievements!). It's only a dollar. What can you buy for a dollar? Not an actual mayo jar, nope. That costs at least 3 dollars where I live (*estimation, I'll update this review once I see the actual price in-store). A dollar won't get you that much.\n\nFor a dollar I had a lot of fun. I'm a Youtuber so playing this for my channel was honestly hilarious, I was laughing a bunch of times. I made a livestream of it and some people came to watch me, I'll put the video at the end for those who want to watch the highlights.\n\nI started playing this game with a blank slate of what I was expecting. The only thing I knew was that someone made this game and tried to make it their product towards the world. I do this every day with my own videos, it's already difficult as is with the market saturation.\n\nSo does this game have enough originality to warrant a dollar? Yes. BUT. These are my personal preferences: I like story-driven games, I like games with endings, I have no issues with clickers, I like puns & memes, I love cats, I like mayo, art style in-game is a big plus for me and I liked the design of the pots and the achievements, there were no bugs for me while playing this game, I had no problems with recording, I like indie games and although there are other free games like this, still I can't blame someone for asking less than the price of a real mayo jar for something they worked longer than an hour for to make.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/mNE-wxYxSgI","February 16","true","1.7"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","2","8","0","0"

Their hopes and dreams, struggles with family and intimacy and finding one's self. This game carries a strong message; we are who we make ourselves.\n\nThroughout the game you are rewarded, for the completion of mundane and banal tasks, brief glimpses into the main character's life. The games allows you to reflect upon yourself and attempts to guide you into the realization that it is only through experimentation and discovery that we can find our true selves.\n\nWe know what the game sets out to accomplish; what does it make us feel? I found myself profoundly changed after experiencing this game. I laughed, shuddered, got excited, leapt off my seat, and even wept. I feel that in the aftermath of this true piece of art there will come about a social change. I know that many, like myself, will have their view on life irrevocably altered.\n\nI highly recommend this game and as such will give it a perfect score.\n5/7 Can't wait for GOTY edition!","February 15","true","0.7"," 3 of 14 people (21%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","21","3","14","2","0"

Here are some of my pros and cons on the game.\n\nMy Pros:\nFun to idle/play around with the stories while you are tapping Mayo\nYou can get all the achievements easily (got like 50% of them within 7 minutes)\nDifferent "costumes/gamemodes" that are achievable after playing each story\n\nMy Cons:\nThe Price (It is $1. Luckily I got it for 40 cents in a sale)\n\nPersonally I like the game because I like simple indie/clicker games. If you don't like short games, you should DEFINITELY not  get this game, especially for the price.

Unfortunately all I got was half of an interesting game without a good story. The game did make me laugh at some points with it's strange visuals, but the good story I was hoping for? Nothing. All I got was a silly, forgetable bunch of nonsensical stories that didn't intrest me in any way. I think the reason why I feel this way is because I couldn't connect with the character.\n\n\nIn a game about clicking a jar of mayonaise, I found it difficult to conect to the main character, Mayo.\n\n\nIt may sound strange, but have you ever played a story game for the gameplay? I'm sure about 85% of you will say no, you play a story game for the interesting and memorable characters, for the detailed plot. A plot about a horny, philosophical jar of mayo? No. A plot about a criminal named Larson Hoover who discovers he has lung cancer, so he spends the his last 8 months trying to right his wrongs and reconnect with his family? Yes. That's what My Name is Mayo was lacking, a good story.  Does Mayo have a family? Does Mayo have an occupation? Does Mayo have a secret? Nah, he/she/it's just an admirer of bikinis and a nut for philosophy.\n\n\nSo that's my thoughts of My Name is Mayo as a story game. what about as a clicker game?\n\n\nAwful is the only way to describe it. It adds nothing new to the clicker games. I fact, It took away the only few things that made the clicker games good. All you do in My Name is Mayo is click a jar of mayonaise, and that's it. There are no upgrades, no temporary power-ups, and nothing changes. A good example is Cookie Clicker. For those of you that have played the game, you have probably discovered the "grandma incident". I remember when I got to that moment, all I could say is, "Holy ####, what the #### is going on!?" In My Name is Mayo, nothing like that happens. You just click away and get frequent hand cramps with no changes in gameplay whatsoever. It's boring.\n\n\nSo after ######## about all the bad things, because I'm a glass half empty kind of guy, lets talk about some of the good things My Name is Mayo has to offer.\n\n\nThe game isn't so bad that I want to lock myself in a glass box in front of a kindergarteners and suffocate to death. The visuals and story gave me a small chuckle every now and then and the random facts were fun to read. And I rememer marveling at the amount of time people put into this game to get on top of the mayo clicking leaderboard. That was fun. And... um............ yeah, don't buy this game. Get a gumball with your dollar or something. This game will leave you feeling robbed and unsatisfied.","February 20","false","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The remaining 2% comes from the actual game itself.\n\nThis is one of those games that's essentially played by repeatedly clicking your mouse. That's it.  You don't have to move your mouse, aim your mouse, slide your mouse. You just click. A LOT.  How much?  Well, if you play it right and progress through the "story" and get all the achievements, you can finish the game in 10,000 clicks. Yeah, there's an achievement for clicking your mouse 10,000 times.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vdmond/recommended/434260/","vdmond","vdmond","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vdmond/","52 products in account","My Name is Mayo isn't great.\n\n\nI didn't expect much from this game, but for less than a dollar (when 40% off), I bought it hoping for an interesting game with a fairly good story. Unfortunately all I got was half of an interesting game without a good story. The game did make me laugh at some points with it's strange visuals, but the good story I was hoping for? Nothing. All I got was a silly, forgetable bunch of nonsensical stories that didn't intrest me in any way. I think the reason why I feel this way is because I couldn't connect with the character.\n\n\nIn a game about clicking a jar of mayonaise, I found it difficult to conect to the main character, Mayo.\n\n\nIt may sound strange, but have you ever played a story game for the gameplay? I'm sure about 85% of you will say no, you play a story game for the interesting and memorable characters, for the detailed plot. A plot about a horny, philosophical jar of mayo? No. A plot about a criminal named Larson Hoover who discovers he has lung cancer, so he spends the his last 8 months trying to right his wrongs and reconnect with his family? Yes. That's what My Name is Mayo was lacking, a good story.  Does Mayo have a family? Does Mayo have an occupation? Does Mayo have a secret? Nah, he/she/it's just an admirer of bikinis and a nut for philosophy.\n\n\nSo that's my thoughts of My Name is Mayo as a story game. what about as a clicker game?\n\n\nAwful is the only way to describe it. It adds nothing new to the clicker games. I fact, It took away the only few things that made the clicker games good. All you do in My Name is Mayo is click a jar of mayonaise, and that's it. There are no upgrades, no temporary power-ups, and nothing changes. A good example is Cookie Clicker. For those of you that have played the game, you have probably discovered the "grandma incident". I remember when I got to that moment, all I could say is, "Holy ####, what the #### is going on!?" In My Name is Mayo, nothing like that happens. You just click away and get frequent hand cramps with no changes in gameplay whatsoever. It's boring.\n\n\nSo after ######## about all the bad things, because I'm a glass half empty kind of guy, lets talk about some of the good things My Name is Mayo has to offer.\n\n\nThe game isn't so bad that I want to lock myself in a glass box in front of a kindergarteners and suffocate to death. The visuals and story gave me a small chuckle every now and then and the random facts were fun to read. And I rememer marveling at the amount of time people put into this game to get on top of the mayo clicking leaderboard. That was fun. And... um............ yeah, don't buy this game. Get a gumball with your dollar or something. This game will leave you feeling robbed and unsatisfied.","February 20","false","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is an exciting sci-fi action horror rpg moba cross-over that made me cry everytime i played. If you decide to buy this game, whether it be for you or a friend, you won't end up regretting your purchase. This amazing game includes multiple choice influenced plots and over 950 hours of jaw-dropping, edge-of-the-sit, heart-warming gameplay. This game includes never before seen game mechanics that just tie so well with the theme of the game that it just makes you keep coming back for more. After the first time i played this game i had to un-install because my motor skills weren't mechanically ready for the expert level challenges that is My Name is Mayo. It took me 72 hours of non-stop training to comeback and feel like i was up to par with this game.
