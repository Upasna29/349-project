I got everything I wanted from a Real TIme Tactics game... yet I felt disappointed. This blows away RTW series for melee based combat. There are so many dynamics to the game, and better yet the stats are  not hidden, but layed out in the interface. RTW and other combat games leave a few simple options available to the players. In this game, you can see the effect of open/regular/closed spacing, the effect of other troops nearby, the defestation of ranged archers, plus the usual damage/armor/defense and much more.\n\nYet... I felt disappointed. The battles were challenging, but I still craved the empire building of the RTW series. I wanted to create my army, my way, and not get stuck with historical units.\n\nI know this seems like a negative review, but I feel that I got everything I wanted from this game... and at the same time, self discovered I wanted more freedom. Perhaps, if they took this level of detail and allowed me to construct empires and armies of my own design, I would have loved this game.","November 25, 2013","true","8.4"," 73 of 81 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","73","81","0","0"

Yes it can be compared to Medieval 2: Total War in general, however the battle system is different, it needs more initial planning in order to win a battle, it can be considered as hardcore version of total war battles. The only con here that the game dosent have a campign map, only series of battles, but they are tight and needs a lot of strategy and planning, a battle can last much longer time comparing to total war games. The graphics are nice, better than Medieval 2, and comparable to Empire, while the sound and voice acting are average, the AI is decent, multiplayer is very enjoyable but usually its hard to find people online to play against.","August 20, 2014","true","15.8"," 36 of 42 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","36","42","0","0"

If you like especially Medieval Total War, this is a MUST for you. The game takes place in the XIII. century and you re-fight famous battles from that era. There is no map like a Total War game. It's all about the tactics on the field. Between battles it is possible to earn money and buy some additional troops for your force, that is all. The factions you can choose are England, France, Germany, Mongols but most importantly the Slavs! :-) This game also includes the famous battle between Teutonic Knights and the Alexander Nevsky, so this could be a single reason to buy it (for history geeks like me, of course). Graphics are nice but nothing Ã¼ber which I don't care. The beautiness of the game is in the details.","July 5, 2011","true","1.8"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mester96/recommended/34420/","mester96","Sir Galahad the Pure","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mester96/","109 products in account","XIII Century Is a Real Time Tactics (RTT) game set in the thirteenth century A.D.. It has 5 single player campaigns, each camaign is a series of Historicall battles. There is also multiplayer mode but I cannot review it because I can't find anybody online to play with.\n\nGameplay\n\nThe main gameplay of XIII Century is playing historical battles. The scale of the battles is huge, it is comparable to the scale of battles in Total War games. The battles have great depth so they offer great challenge and fun. Also due to the battle mechanics the use of tactics is totally neccessary in order to win battles, moreover any wrong move can drive your army to it's total annihilation. The UI is prety much simmilar to the the UI of Total War games and it's quite simple and functional so it doesn't cause any issues to the player during battles. As for the AI, it knows how to use it's units and combined with the battle mechanics it offers  a lot of challenge and fun. The battle mechanics, the AI and the UI combined offer a great gameplay, but it would be better if there would be any conquest campaign with a map like in total war games.\n\nVisuals.\n\nThe visuals of XIII Century are pretty good. The models are not as detailed as in the Total War games but they offer some visually impressive battles. Also, there is variety in the soldiers appearance so they don't look like clones. As for the animations, they are a little awkward but there are some of them that may impress. For example the soldiers draw their swords only when the enemy is near which may be something minor but it's an eyecandy that I like. The particles are just ok, when the soldiers are running there are some dust effects and also there are blood effects and gore which make the battles sort of gritty. Unforunately there is one objection that I have, the HDR makes everything to look too bright. Visually the game is great in comparison to many stategy games and it runs with high framerates.\n\nAudio\n\nThe sound of the game is not anything special, it just fulfills it's purpose. There are descent sound effects and the music just fits with the atmosphere of the game. It is not anything imressive or bad, it is just ok.\n\nXIII Century is an underrated game which has been overseen by gamers . It is a game that I highly recommend to Medieval II Total War fans.","January 10, 2015","true","1.8"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

On one hand, it has cool battles and requires you to use some clever thinking to win tough fights. On the other hand, it only works when it wants to. I played several battles, but then the game decided I've had enough and refused to work properly. Every time I try to load a campaign battle, I get an error and a black screen. The sound and narrative play, but all I get is a frozen screen. I think there is a way to fix it for some people, but for me personally, I'm stuck.\nSo how can I review a game that won't let me play? I'll base this review off of my experiences in the few battles I actually played.\nFirst off, the graphics are decent and the sound design is solid ( though the battle sounds of swords clashing and arrows falling are a bit bland). The music is nothing to write home about, but it serves its purpose and is okay. The maps are well-designed and allow for strategic play. You got hills, rivers, marshes, etc. All of these come into play when you are commanding your army.\nThe AI is rather decent. I've seen it counterattck, flank, keep reserves, and press forward when I am weak.  It's not perfect (it's easy to exploit and crush AI units using cavalry archers), but it is aware and will challenge you. At times it can even be relentless and clever, forcing you to really pay attention.\n\nI never had a moment where I was totally relaxed. I was concentrated almost all the time - managing my units, picking off lone enemy sqauds, and positioning my army so that I could best face the enemy. In that respect XIII Century succeeds. The game requires thinking and good unit management. Terrain must be taken seriously and the AI is not one to be underestimated.\nHowever, there are certain downsides. As mentioned before, I get an error before every battle and the screen freezes and goes black. Aside from that, the camera is awkward. It has weird angles and is odd at times. I recommend taking it off the "free camera" mode and putting it on either "horizontal" or "normal" settings. That helps out a lot.\nSo what do we end up with? We have a game with great potential that falls flat on its face. With decent graphics and a stong dose of strategy mixed in with bugs and some awkward camera angles and controls, XIII Century is a game that I would recommend getting only on a big sale. If you don't experience technical issues, then you'll have a blast with this game, but wait until it's on sale in order to avoid spending a lot of money on a product that won't even work.","December 15, 2015","true","2.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","4"

The Second French Mission, fourth English mission and others don't load due to problems the game has generating castles. The German campaign glitches out and units don't appear. There is no way to bypass to these missions either that i have found, i have literally tried everything as i said it is a fun game when working but it just is not worth the time of day, you will be spending Â£10 on about 10 missions rather than all 30 as promised as the bonus missions are only unlocked after the campaigns are done and missions are unlocked after the previous one is completed.","June 10, 2015","false","8.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"
