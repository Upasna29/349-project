First of all, the gameplay is still turn-based RPG, which is exactly what I wanted. The world is the same as the first game, but far more bleak and hopeless (this is not a drawback to me). I got additional party members early on, and I can use one joystick for both movement and menu selection, so those improve on the original! However, I feel like the writing was weaker in the second game, possibly due to the increase in "zany" characters, who came off as irritating and not funny at all. I noticed more grammatical errors and exclamation point spam as well, which could mean I'm just being more picky with the sequel. That said, I still enjoyed the gameplay, and most of the puzzles (a few were not intuitive at all, and one made me rage-quit for a day), and I'm curious to see where the story goes from here. If you liked turn-based retro JRPGs, liked the first game, and are willing to put up with some mediocre writing, I'd say you'll like this.","October 18, 2015","true","17.8"," 30 of 36 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","30","36","0","2"

Not a bad RPG, but there are two design flaws that stopped me over 3 hours into this game:\n\n-Lack of detail for mission progression: In other words, I saved game, and the next day I forgot what I even needed to do. It was obscure. Going back to important characters did not contain the dialogue to direct me in the right direction. I luckily succeeded by chance and progressed. Story is very confusing and not direct.\n\n-Puzzle Mechanism: I could not get out of some puzzles, requiring a full restart. This is a problem, since one of the times I had a lot of progress that went unsaved.\n\nNot recommended, when I compare it to the likes of Last Dream.","August 31, 2015","false","3.6"," 59 of 88 people (67%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","67","59","88","6","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Menacia/recommended/397500/","Menacia","Menacia","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Menacia/","204 products in account","DISCLAIMER: I was given a key for free by the publisher!\n\nNew updates Review after completing Game! (for my original quick first look, just scroll down)\n\nLabyronia RPG 2 is a direct sequel to Labyronia RPG taking place roughly 10 years after the incidents of it's predecessor. Thus most of the main cast, many locations and references both cosmetic as well as story wise will make a more sense to players who have completed the first game. At the same time it has to be mentioned that it is possible to play and enjoy this one on it's own without any prior knowledge. A newcomer will make sense of the story and the relations among it's characters.\n\nGameplaywise is where the major differences between Labyronia RPG 2 and 1 will be noticable. Most and foremost is a more streamlined and focused approach in Labyronia RPG 2. While the first game saw the fere leave his house in the beginning and thus threw the player into an open world without any clue where to start and what to do next; as such requiring the player to call the "oldschool" ability of being able to explore on there own without any guidance.\nHere in hte sequel the path forward as well as the objectives are always clear to the player. You will always know where to go to next and what to do!!!\nThe battles however are still dificult, expecially in the beginning and require a careful and strategic approach. Simple attack spamming won't get you anywhere, just as in the Labyronia RPG 1.\n\n\nOverall I can recommend this game to everybody who enjoyed the first one and to fans of the genre who can get past the fact that this is an RPGMaker VXAce game using many default graphics, simply because there is a very nice oldschool style JRPG  beneath it's surface that I enjoyed very much.\n\n---\nQuick First Look!\n\nI really like the first Labyronia game, but I still haven't finished it and that is the reason why a quick first look at Labyronia RPG 2 will have to do (at least for now!).\n\nLabyronia RPG 2 is still Labyronia!! Everybody who enjoyed the first one will feel right at home.\nHowever there is one major change and that is a more focused approach to the game. This time around you will not just be thrown into an open game world without any clues; this time you will be pointed into a specific direction once the short opening sequence that functions as a basic tutorial has been finished.\nHowever this doesn't mean that the game has become linear. Whether you are following the directions or just wander off exploring, is still up to you, the player.\nThe game world is still open and once again, careless rushing out will get you into trouble easily and simple attack spamming without any strategy will get you killed as fast as possible (the very first enemy got me, again XD - This is  Spar....errr...Labyronia!!!).","August 29, 2015","true","13.9"," 23 of 36 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","23","36","2","0"

To my surprise, however, it appears that the developers learned a lot from their first title and polished up the sequel accordingly. Kudos on that guys!\n\nUpon launching the game, by default it ran fullscreen and while the resolution was rather unappealing, the assets appeared to be improved enough that it wasn‚Äôt unplayable on a 1080p display. Sadly the select button is still inexplicably mapped to the O(PS4)/B(360) by default. Unlike the first Labyronia though, I was actually able to easily fix all the mappings and get a grasp of the games controls before setting off into the world. The opening itself feels like the devs learned a lot from the first game because there was a lot better guidance and exposition in the early game to direct the player. The story was no less generic (the main boss introduced at the beginning was the Father of a thousand evils) but I don‚Äôt feel that I have the right to judge much about a direct sequels narrative when I was unable to play the first game.\n\nOverall, Labyronia 2 feels like a great application of lessons learned, but this is where my big picture judgment takes a turn. Yes, most of the originals issues were fixed, but that only brought this game up par with every other RPG Maker title. Die-hard fans of this style of RPG may get some enjoyment out of it, but there‚Äôs not that ‚Äúwow‚Äù factor to distinguish it from the thousands of other games just like it flooding Steam.","September 8, 2015","false","3.0"," 19 of 30 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","19","30","2","0"

This is because L2 is a continuation of the 1st game and it might not make a whole lot of sense to you if you skip the 1st installment.\n\nANYWAY...\n\nI was a little skeptical about Labyronia 2 after playing the 1st one, because the 1st one left such a good impression that I was afraid the 2nd installment would leave me disappointed.\n\nI was disappointed.

The story has neatly progressed from the events of Labyronia 1, but it hasn't lost sight of the overall storyline, in fact, from the very beginning you can sense the immediate continuations from its former counterpart, the urgency of the characters to survive, to the point where you must pay careful attention to your surroundings, conversations, HEALTH METERS, and manliness.\n\nThe game does prove to be more challenging than the first one. You need to be very careful with where and how you spend your money (however, DO NOT BE A MISER, you will need several items to get through the game), you don't need to grind, but you do need to be very tactful in your battles, especially with the bosses that you will face.\n\nAdditionally, the game has the same ambiance as the first one without being repetitive, boring, or exhausting. You'll keep wondering about several unanswered questions which aren't answered until halfway or towards the end of the game.\n\nDO BUY. DO PLAY.

Without giving spoilers, I will say the world is changing, new Labyrinths are appearing all over the face of the world, and a new, more terrifying evil has taken hold of the land from the Tower of Mysteria. Plunged into an eternal winter, and scattered throughout the world, are the heroes of our story, though can the find the strength and courage to find each other and stop the Father of 1000 evils?\n\nSo far, even early in the story it seems like Labyronia RPG 2 is on par with the original. Visually it is consistent with the first,  Thrust into the story as your village is being attacked, the challenge level appears to be just as high if not a little more so with Labyronia RPG 2. Unlike so many games these days, this seems to be a pretty well done sequel. I recommend if you are going to pick up Labyronia, get the bundle which has both 1 and 2. It is definitely a solid RPG and is just challenging enough to be fun and interesting.

This makes it necessary to spend money on rations and make money really precious. It also require some planning to drop by a town to stock up ration, else we will just die.\n\nb. The starting characters are challenging because they cannot hurt certain monsters and have to flee from them. This both add a sense of urgency and a need to survive in the game. Wonderfully done.\n\nc. Several things add to the challenge. Getting lost running in endless circles without the compass, running from monsters in the dark, etc make the game a lot more fun and time critical.\n\nd, I also love the fact that there is no choice of difficulty level, otherwise I would have just played the game on EASY and that would have spoilt the sense of challenge in the game.\n\nSo developers --- very well done for Labyronia 2 and I would love to immerse my entire weekend in the game.

Spent 24 cents for it and it's one of the best games I played on Steam along with "Labyronia RPG" and "Legend of Mysteria". All 3 are by the same developer.\nThe first day I played "Labyronia RPG 2" I spent 8 hours. Not straight but still. It was that addicting.\nReally love such games. Also love how you learn new spells by leveling up. Think it was the same in Pokemon Emerald (haven't played it in a while so I am not sure) which is similar to "Labyronia RPG 2" in a way. Unlike the first game here you can buy spells not only find them.\nGreat music, art, characters, story, everything. It didn't crash like "Labyronia RPG" did so that's a plus. There was only one drawback that I was going to mention but I forgot what it was so it must've been something minor.\nThe 3 games are connected so make sure to grab them all. Being really cheap, the price\nthey have is fair. Can be easily worth more as they deserve it. 24 cents for ~14 hours of gameplay. Actually "fair price" would be an understatement to say at the very least.\nTakes some time to 100% which is good. Personally I had a great time playing all 3 games. Looking forward to buying other games by this developer. I think they are doing a great work.\nWhichever way you look at it, "Labyronia RPG 2" is a must buy if you are into RPG games.

And i did not see this coming at all.\n\nNow the first game was good but tough. This game is more optimized where it matters the most: encounters(and how to avoid them), storyline and the fact that there is a bit more guidance in the beginning compared to the first game where you are just left into a big open labyrinth world to fend for yourself. Yes there are still those 'oh you just stumbled across a huge boss monster - now you die - reload' -things but they are more unlikely and there actually are sometimes pretty good warnings.\n\nAs for the mechanics itself i don't want to spend too much time telling about them - it is quite default rpgmaker stuff with the inventory management and combat. It's the labyrinthine world and pretty well designed locations/events that makes this game shine over the first one. It still doesn't hold your hand much but the little more it does is a big improvement in my books.\n\nI find myself enjoying this game quite a lot and the more you play it the more addictive it gets.\n\nIf you are wondering should you buy this or the first one - and you are not that into hardcore JRPG style game then i'd actually recommend this one to go for first. There are references to things in the past it doesn't seem to spoil anything. You might feel lost on the overall story somewhat but i dont see that as too big of a problem.","September 12, 2015","true","12.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Labyronia RPG 2 follows on from the sequel Labyronia RPG 1.\nThis game requires you to be good at exploring and good at RPG Games.\n\nLabyronia RPG 2 is set in Labyronia, which was once suppose to be a nice place to live in. Evil creatures and dark ghosts invade this land and feed on fear. Their intention is to wipe out everything that lives and make Labyronia a land of nothingness. So, you start of as a Ranger named Garic (Something like that) in a very small town that you are the boss of. You battle a giant wall crusher and you venture on into the frozen plains and help out each land, whilst finding new accompanies to aid you in your quest. You will soon unlock lots of weapons, armours, helments, trinkets etc... Your main objectives are to get all 3 accomplices, save the Queen and the Sun Emerald, Kill the evil Elven Senate, save the city of Carallan, finish the tournament in the Firelands and fight the end boss and restore peace.\n\nThis is a great and advanced game to play where you need to learn the boss mechanics. However it does require a lot of patience becuase of unexpected puzzles, mazes, labryinths etc.. Recommended for 15+ Contains some swearing and cursing. The content is extremely hard for kids under the age of 13. Hours of exploring, adventures, puzzles, quests in pokemon style!\n\n8.5/10\nTadlicated\n2016\n","January 13","true","18.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Special mention to some new puzzles in the dungeons.\n+It's very cheap, and the experience is very satisfaying.\n+The combat system is much better, and the fight with the bosses are much more interesting, with useful skills, weak section in "Labyronia 1", but improved in this sequel.\n\nCons:\n-It's shorter than "Labyronia 1", we find less labyrinths and big areas, also the walkthrough is shorter.\n-There is nothing outside from the main story, in "Labyronia 1" you had more extra bosses to defeat, big bosses in low level areas, that kind of things that make interesting to come back to the initial areas. So, it's a point to improve, the side quests, the extra bosses (big big ones), more areas to discover, etc...\n-The world map is very similar in every area, it's normal because it's a bleak world, but also in "Chrono Trigger" we find  that destroyed areas with more contrasted places. That's why the Elves area is like fresh air for the game.\n-The designers are very creative, and we want more :)\n\n\nSummarizing, you will not regret buying and playing "Labyronia 2 RPG", it's necessary to play the first game to understand the story and to empathize with the characters.\nHave fun with "Labyronia 2 RPG", and we hope to have third part :)","September 2, 2015","true","10.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
