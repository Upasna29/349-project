The object of all three of the Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective mysteries is to gather clues by deciding on what people and places to visit. Once you have gotten enough information to solve the crime/s you will go before a judge and he will ask a few questions that you must answer correctly.  Getting to the judge and answering questions using the fewest amount of clues that you can will give you a score. The goal is to solve the mystery by using only as many clues as it takes Holmes to solve the mystery. There is not a lot of replay ability in the game except if your score doesn't match Holmes' once you have solve the mystery.  I wouldn't expect it to take very many playthorughs to match Holmes scores.\n\nIf you like Sherlock Holmes , or some not too hard brain teasers, you will enjoy the game. It is only about 60-90 mins of total gameplay in most instances for each mystery. As for the price, I would definitely go the collection route as it's almost half price. I would probably also wait til it might be on sale as well.","January 20","true","0.5"," 20 of 20 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","20","20","0","6"

The only clue left behind is a tin soldier figurine that is facing the opposite direction than all the other soldiers in the collection. Is this figurine somehow linked with the identity of his murderer?\n\nThe best way to look at these Sherlock Holmes cases of which their are three, this one being the best in my opinion is as interactive novels.\n\nThe actual gameplay is minimal but the stories are interesting and you slowly read through the clues question the witnesses and when you have the murderer worked out present the case to the judge, and thats all she wrote.\n\nThe fmv scenes are for the most part excellent, they are dated but thats to be expected given the age of the game. All in all if your looking for a quick diversion down fmv memory lane this is a pretty good time.","September 30, 2015","true","1.3"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","18","21","2","0"

They could have easily had a better game if they combined these for a single more complete game.\n\nAs Sherlock Holmes, you will be tasked with figuring out who killed the retired General. The meat of the game is sifting through newspapers to find clues which perpetuate you to navigate to various locations to question potential FMV subjects.\n\nThe acting isn't bad for the age and budget of this game; but itâ€™s definitely not "Sherlock Holmes" in my opinion. Watson and Sherlock definitely don't fit the bill like I am so accustomed to. Spending more than 1 hour on this title would be a stretch so plan accordingly.\n\nWorth $0.99; you can usually get all 3 installments for a couple of bucks!\n\nAccidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective is a sweet system for playing short one-shot murder mystery games but just like The Case of the Mystified Murderess, the case here doesn't do the system justice.\n\nThere's not particularly any mystery to this case. No intuitive leaps needed. Just follow every lead to its conclusion and the culprit will all but be dropped into your hands by the end. It feels less like a mystery and more like a police procedural. The score system is pretty uncharitable too, but even less so in a case whose "challenge" is in presenting a lot of apparently valid starting points and asking you to brute-force your way through until you find the thread that, when tugged upon,  unravels everything else.","April 24","false","1.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game brings a murder case, which is then investigated via checking newspapers and interviewing experts, witnesses and such. The investigative options are personal visits by Holmes and/or Watson, sending Baker Street Irregulars in their stead or simply check Holmes` archives. When enough evidence is gathered, the player may take the case to the court and answer a few questions pertaining to the culprit and the motive of the crime.\n\nEach action costs a particular amount of points - sending the detectives to a relevant location costs 10 points, sending the urchins instead costs 5 and a missed target (irrelevant location) costs 20. The point of the game, rather unfortunately, is to solve a case with the lowest point possible. This is a little counter-productive, in the sense that in order to achieve the lowest point, one would forego quite a lot of decent acting and so on.\n\nHowever, there is no obligation to follow that path and you can perfectly follow up each and every clue, enjoying what is essentially less than an hour of quite nostalgic adventure gaming. It`s not at all like any conventional adventure game - it has no point-and-click or narrative choices like those of more recent titles. However, Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective features impressive FMV title of the very old school, which can give an interesting glimpse into the 1990s` TV-styled aesthetics of similar games of the period at a absurdly low price.","December 29, 2015","true","0.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You are given a ridiculous number of locations/people (a whole alphabet of them) to visit before you could possibly conceive a reason to visit any/many of them. All you seem to be able to do is "visit" locations and generate a video of the characters at that location. I cant see a way of searching locations (even the crime scene) or asking characters questions. There are no hints about what to do next, so the only course of action seems to be to visit location after location from the long list and see more video conversations. The so called "Clues" in the notebook section of the menu seem to just be a statement of facts you've already witnessed so what is the point of them?! Even for the price, I am dissappointed. It's like a visual novel but without any sort of pathway trhough it or real interactivity.","December 4, 2015","false","0.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
