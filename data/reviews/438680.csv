They stuck with what they said and made the game free. For such a small development team I have to say they did some pretty good work. The only problem that I faced was with the camera controls, how on default, you had to use the mouse wheel to rotate the camera. It was odd for me.\n\nThe attacking seemed jagged and wonky as well, but it's passable.\n\nI'd gladly support these developers for being creative and supportive.","May 19","true","0.2"," 199 of 217 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","199","217","3","0"

It is actually a lot of fun. At first the game didn't seem to be that great. It took me a while to like it (around 15-20 mins in). At first the game doesn't seem punish you a lot, its just upgrades and learning the way it is played. But once you get the hang of it, its quite awesome.\n\nThere is a survival mode, I guess that is where enemy waves will kill if we can't beat it, I look forward to it.\n\nI love the attention to "concept detail" this game has, when you upgrade anything it has a visual improvement, this really matters to me and they delivered on these cases (except for stat boosting, but hey, everything else does look more badass as you progress, even your Troll!).\n\nFor a free game this is amazing, I would actually have payed for this had I known it was so cool and addictive. I would not have given much attention at first because it seemed like a tablet port, usually I just ignore those, but I am glad to have checked this one out.\n\nIt is free!

It can be quite easily finished within a day or two and doesn't provide much game play after beating the three mission maps, you're left with just a survival (endless) mode which is the same but starting again and you lose the upgrades you had on the troll gained during the three levels.\nMore Maps and different modes would really help make the game last longer and give more reason to play through again.\n\nThe music, whilst it's okay, is a little too cheerful and needs more of a beat to match the goblin and troll theme of the game.\n\nThere was several bugs during my play though but I was still able to complete it, it did cause there to be a little extra difficulty to it but it was manageable. Since completing it a patch was released to address some problems although I've not tested it and won't be able to without starting a new game. It's nice to see they're fixing the problems though.\n\nMultiplayer is only available via Twitch, which is a little disappointing, while it's a nice idea it's not going to be for everyone.\n\nOverall it's a good game and a lot of effort has gone in.\nIt was nice that it was released for free and definitely worth a try if you like Tower Defence or even a bit of hack and slash. Given the lack of content it's probably not something I would have bought for much, I'd much like to have seen more verity of game play and possibly a more direct multiplayer method.\n\nVery enjoyable for a short time but not something I'm planning on going back to unless more is added.\nI have no complaints about any of the content that is available.\n\nThere's no micro-transactions or anything you'd expect to find in a free game, you can purchase cosmetic DLC to help support the developers if you liked the game, something I'd like to see being done a lot more with other games. :)","May 19","true","45.5"," 35 of 40 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","35","40","4","1"

I have to say, the game itself is great fun, what small audience happend to be awake at the late hour i decided to try it out seemed to like it too.\n\nHowever, I have a big qualm. The game seems to have little to no comeback mechanics for either side. In the early two forts, I was absolutely stomping the viewers. Archer towers shredded everything they tried to do no matter how they coordinated. I won like 17:3 both maps. Then the third map hit. From the get go, I had no resources, the wave 1 spawns wrecked me, and continued to wreck me. By wave 67 (Theres no failstate in the forts it seems, you 'lose' a wave and your viewers get a +1 to wincount and the next wave begins) I still had barely hit t2 on some of my buildings. The grind became tedious and boring so i gave up and quit. If the viewers get the upper hand you have no way to come back and win it feels like, and if you get ahead they can't catch up either.\n\nBut hey, it's great fun. #go steam #download One Troll army #Speed 3 #Play Game","May 20","true","4.8"," 23 of 27 people (85%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","85","23","27","4","0"

It is a fun tower defense game where you play a big troll and you have to defend a fort from other smaller trolls from a huge army\n\nAlthough the game is fun, the game does have some flaws. Firstly, the game can get repetitive and boring after a while. Secondly, the game's 'main missions' are short, either because I cheated the system (sort of, not with a trainer or what not but I cheated the system and such) or because they are short. And after you play the main missions, you are sent into a survival wave based mission and thirdly the controls are annoying!\n\nNo offence, but we do know from magic and lore that trolls are stupid and this troll in One Troll Army is cute especially when he starts dancing to fantasy music but he is absolutely stupid with the controls. I make him go and kill some enemies but he goes somewhere else unless I hammer the LMB\n\nAlso, the troll's health bar is ridiculously low. You will die after a few hits, I can understand the strategy and the thought process about his health and such but come on, even the first level, after a few hits he's dead and you cannot do anything\n\nThere is no failing in this game and the game is pretty fair. I have to say that after two hours of gametime, I got pretty bored. I am uninstalling it but I would love to try it after a few updates and see if it has improved\n\nOne Troll Army is a very good indie game and I appreciate that the developers actually had the balls to make the game for free, especially for their first game (supposedly) and I hope that the developers don't milk out this game with DLC\n\nPlease don't tinyBuild, I love you!\n\nOne Troll Army is a fun game and people who like little indie strategy games like this should give it a try, it's free to play!\n\nRECOMMENDED :)","May 27","true","2.4"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"

Each wave of opponents gets harder until you lose - but then you continue on, so you won't have to start all over. I guess the main objective is to get the last boss done in as little waves of opponents as possible.\n\nWhen you first play the game, you think "easy" is pretty hard - once you figured it out, "hard" becomes a normal game for you.\n\nI enjoy playing this game, and I'm curious to see in how little waves I can beat "hard" now.\n\nI would even pay to play this game. It's a little short-whiled, but I guess if they come up with a second version with more story - that will be just as great as this one\n\n","May 25","true","14.7"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","1"

Town defenses are useless because most of the time, their vertical attack arcs have blind spots right under the wall, and they will not change their target to a range unit within their arc. Not sure is this just a coding or game design error, or it is just the incompetence of the early units (cant be border to play longer to find out)\nTrading resources for gold has a major glitch, where you can keep selling even if your gold bank is fulled, or vice versa, and waste your resources.\nLooting the bodies of dead enemy is a nice touch, however the body and gold disappear within a short period of time (combining with the slow moving troll), most of the time, you wont get much out of each wave. THIS IS NOT WINDOWS 98, we do not have RAM issuse from a simple game like this.\nThe interval between waves are very short for you to do much, you need to time your upgrades or you are screwed.\nLeveling system is stupid. The campaign locked your progress by limiting the upgrades of your town hall, and forces you to go and restart the entire thing, from scratch. Which slows the game down, and become frustrating and boring very soon.\nAll-in-all if this is the first attempt of someone making a game, it is a good effort, but it requre a lot more polish, and please make it computer user-friendly, and do not look like a stupid mobile port.","May 21","false","2.1"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","13","23","0","2"

It has elements unique to several game styles. You run around and hulk smash with your troll, have to manage your resources and workers like banished yet still having to defend your castle at the same time.\n\nThere are a few minor annoying bugs such as mobs on occasion spawning outside the map forcing you to surrender the battle. When it happens in survival, this causes you to lose obviously but in endless or the campaign, it's really nothing major other than losing loot for the round. Not a biggie.\n\nThe pathfinding for your troll is a bit clunky, sometimes he can't "find" his way to a wide open spot in a field and runs in circles. Still, not a biggie, just keep clicking.\n\nI like how this is a free game with the only DLC option is for skins only. No pay to win.\n\nI have not tried out the twitch stream interacting yet, but that feature looks pretty cool even just in concept, never seen that before.\n\nThis game does have a huge ammount of room for improvement as well. I can picture a ton of more things that could be put in. New buildings, higher upgrade levels, new troll types and/or abilities, etc.\n\nAll in all, well worth the fun!","June 2","true","7.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

By that i mean you're using a strategy to find a way to defeat the wave  that is approaching towards you. The red bar indicates when the nomads are coming. This is a very fun game and a very good combination by the developers. You can stay and farm for your character in a specific world. Once you're done with that world you can go to the next one.\n\nBad - Every game that has been created has a bug. Well some of these bugs disturb me and I really want the developers to fix. Such as the movement. It is not very good, for example when your character is standing still but it runs all across the map. Sometimes when you're commanding your ogre to run to another direction, it spins in circles. Another bug that I came across to is '' skipping waves '' the waves skip by 2 so for example i'm on wave 100, the next day it will be wave 102. Another bug is that when an enemy is at the wall or on the wall. Your guards from a tower cannot even shoot at them. Just pretend that you have been downed and you have no mercanaries.\n\nSuggestions - I would likely want mutiplayer fighting. You go in a 1v1 pretend with another person. You guys have the same amount of buildings and men. You have to fight and successfully destroy the other base. This would be a cool adaptation to the game if not yet added or knownly wanted.\n\nSo if i were to give a rating out of 10 it would be a 7/10 - GooOOOd Combination BRAH :)","May 30","true","3.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

If this wasn't a free game I'd ask for a refund. The controls and UI are terrible, there's no balance to the waves and long-ranged enemies seem to hide at the edge of the field that my troll can't reach (just runs in circles). You can't seem to upgrade your troll far enough to do good damage in high level waves and the specials are not really helpful because there's a massive delay when using them in combat.\nThere also seems to be a max number of goblins that can build or repair at the same time, but the game never tells you this. So if you have a lot of goblins and assign all of them to repairing, half of them will just stand around.\nHonestly this feels like an online flash game or possibly an early access release that needs a couple of months of updates before final release.","May 21","false","4.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","5","8","2","0"

Certainly recommended for those looking to dip their toe into the resource/build/combat genre or anyone who finds the idea of a large troll headbutting gremlins to death amusing. I did not use the Twitch-related functionality but that certainly seems novel and ideal for those who could organise large groups to participate. Those looking for more challenging or complex games should probably avoid.","May 31","true","11.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Is really ok for an free game, basically is a mixture of genres: strategy, tower defense and time manager.\nYou control a a huge Ogre which serves as main defender of your stronghold, this is your base of operations once it is destroyed the game is over. Depending on the level of improvement, you control certain amount of small goblins, who serve as you task force: they create your buildings, improve and repair the already created, also gather resources. There a are many kind of buildings, for example there are towers to improve your base defense, a tavern to hire mercenaries and some other options.\n\n\nPros:\nNice little game to spend free time.\nAlthough generic, the graphics are ok, the gameplay is the strong point here.\nGood genre mix, I felt like Shrek when I was playing this.\nAchievements can be completed without problem.\nCons:\nIs short. The game could benefit with more content, there are just 3 level on story mode.\nCan become repetitive at one point.\nI notice there are some frame drop in late levels when the cpu spawns several enemies.\nI enjoyed a few hours playing this, Square should take note of how release a free game properly.","June 3","true","8.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

No hotkeys that I could tell, all point and click with mouse\n-The enemy types are not all that interesting\n-Fail upwards type system (you are supposed to fail, over and over, without consequence to earn gold and resources and upgrade until you win\n-Gets kind of old quickly\n\nThe Verdict:\nI played this game for 3 hours. It was free and I was not expecting much. It turned out to be a charming experience with solid gameplay. I did not like the lack of PC friendly controls - all of the interface is made for mouse only, so you have to click everything rather than for example hitting a key to do your slam move, you have to move the troll and then click again for the ability - it feels off, like playing an MMO with only a mouse.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Akatsuki_Dawn/recommended/438680/","Akatsuki_Dawn","Flawed","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Akatsuki_Dawn/","387 products in account","A fun little tower defence game reminiscent of flash games from a few years ago that were extremely fun and addicting, but suffered from a lack of content. As with those, One Troll Army is pretty fun to play but all of the game's content can be completed in around 3-4 hours, after which you unlock a "survival mode" that offers an endless version of the game's campaign. One cannot truly complain about the lack of content though, considering the game is completely free to play with no microtransactions that I'm aware of except for some cosmetic things for your troll.\n\nThe game itself focuses around a troll who offers to protect a fledgling goblin settlement from being raided and destroyed by invading migrant beastmen and to do this you are given direct control over both the settlement and your troll itself.\nThe troll is controlled in a manner similar to a real time strategy unit, or an action roleplaying game character; he can move around, be told to attack enemies and has access to several abilities as well as stat and ability upgrades.\nThe settlement itself is controlled through menus and sliders, with goblin workers that are assigned to perform different tasks to gather resources or upgrade buildings. It's a relatively simple progression system, with goblins gathering resources to upgrade buildings that either improve base defence and towers or allow you to upgrade your goblins so you can gather resources even faster. Each building upgrade also gives you more goblins, allowing you to do more things at once and do them more effectively.\n\nThough this sounds a little like a more traditional real time strategy title, it is in fact a wave-based defence game. Each wave is split into two different roungs, with the first being a non-combat round during which you can control the economy and upgrades of your settlement. During this first round, enemy beastmen will begin to approach the settlement and hang around on the outskirts, waiting for enough of them to appear to begin an attack. When enough enemies arrive, the will initiate the combat round of the wave in which all goblins hide inside your settlement and you have to fight back the onslaught with the aid of hireable orc mercenaries and towers capable of firing upon the enemies. When all enemies are defeated or your settlement is raided, the combat round ends and the next wave begins.\n\nThis, unfortunately, is the worst part of the game. If your settlement is raided (I.E, you lose against an enemy wave), there are absolutely no negative repercussions for this loss. All of your resources remain and the difficulty of the next wave will be lowered to compensate for your inability to proceed. This leads to situations in which there is absolutely no reason not to purposely lose every single wave and just focus entirely on upgrading your settlement to maximum, since enemies cannot steal your gathered resources or kill your goblin workers to upset your progression (this does mean you don't gain gold from looting enemies, but since you can trade resources for gold and other resources at a very good rate, this is hardly a negative).\n\nOnce you have upgraded all of your buildings to maximum level, have fully upgraded your troll and and completed all three of the "campaign" levels in the game, you have pretty much seen all of what this game has to offer. It's a fun little game, but it ultimately has some serious design flaws that makes it unlikely that I'll play it again. I enjoyed my three or so hours time playing, but it's not worth investing more time than that. Still, the fact that the game is completely free means that there's no harm in trying it for yourself and having some fun.","May 23","true","3.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Upgrading bases and managing resources however this game fell pretty flat for me.\nTo start off this game is insanely easy. Not in the sense that it is well balanced or that your towers and troll are good but in the sense that there is no penalty for failure. In fact if you lose a wave not only is there no penalty but you keep all your resources. You can cap out all your resources just losing every wave and then max out your fort. Also lets talk about the resource management. After getting every building to level 3 there is absolutely no reason to gather anything but wood. Wood is always the closest resource and best to spam while you sell it all off for gold to buy supplies with to upgrade.\nCombat is very slow and unresponsive. Your troll never goes where you want him to and tends to run around in circles. You have to click his action buttons repeatedly to get them to go off at times. Inbetween waves he will wander around aimlessy 9/10 times sparking a wave to preemptively start.\nMercenaries are broken. In every game ive tried they never come out and fight.\nMy final complaint about this game comes from when i resided my self to 100% its achievments. I didnt enjoy the game at all but saw how quick the achievments were coming so figured id 100% before uninstalling. I was down to my final 3. Higher mercs, kill 1k enemies and do everything. I was at about 930 kills when i realized that since mercs didnt work and therefore didnt die id never be able to hire the 30 needed for the achieve so i decided id start over. The game says it was saved and showed my survival level in the 100s however upon reclicking the game file i discovered that not only had it put be back to the first tutorial it also wiped out all my progress on the quests. It safe to say i did not feel like playing for another 3-4 hours to get my 1k kills back and i also assumed my mercs still wouldnt work so the most id ever be able to get in a save file are 16.","May 21","false","4.9"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","5","10","0","0"

So the player is engaged into playing all the time without going somewhere.\nThere is very good balance between fortress and troll.\nIt is challenging at the right pace.\n\n\nThe bad:\nThere is no "FAIL!" state. As in, at all. You just lose a wave, but all it does is that you can't collect the loot dropped from enemies and your troll starts with minimum HP.\nInterface is somewhat clunky, so you'll have to get used to it.\nFinished whole game in 1 day on easy... And don't want to play it again on medium / hard.\n\nThe neutral:\nSomewhat bad pathfinding for troll for RAM attack.\n\n_______________\nThe good:\n"Stupid funny" as in, if you like throwing things around in games, you'll like this one. It takes little time to get used to the game and then you have hours and hours of fun. Like, a whole day. But that's just it, it will last just a day. HOWEVER! The day will be full of lulz, laughing and, if you'll get the moment, funny screenshots.\nAnd the "Ram" attack can be brought into good because even if it leads to you failing a wave, it's a no problem. You can't fail here. Like, at all. So all the more reason for laughing how troll "dances" around the enemies that he tries to ram. While trampling everyone around those enemies.\n\nI actually laughed while typing this when remembered how this worked well. And failed horribly a few times.\n\nPlaying this game "smart" or "serious" way will take away the fun. For me, playing games by reading guides and calculating my moves is the standard. Here, I didn't want to do that. I didn't NEED to do that to have fun. It was just "bumble around, wreck havoc". "You're a big troll, just run over your enemies! SMASH!"\n\nGraphics.\nWorld of Warcraft style graphics. Just enough, but no more. You won't find super shaders, flares or whatever. It's just enough. But if you like things "fancy", then get a DLC with suits. Dress up your Troll.\nWhy I don't say it's a bad thing? Well, because for the most time it's useful to be zoomed out maximum to have control over battlefield.\n\nGame pace.\nOkay. You get something done, you look at your fortress, you look at troll upgrades, OH NEW WAVE!!! SMASHING TIME!\nNow let's see, something to upgrade, maybe this, maybe that? New wave! BASHING TIME!\nThe pace goes as you read this text in a slow pace.\nPause is a useful button, but don't use it at first or second fortress at early stages. There isn't that much you can do, so don't try to brainstorm it. Smash, bash and trample stuff.\n\n\nBalance of Fortress vs Troll.\nYour fortress IS a fortress. Don't forget that. Your troll is NOT invincible. Don't forget that. Keep both in mind, never lose.\nGot to arrogant and got surrounded? Ouch.\nForgot about fortress and didn't trample those who were bashing it? Restart the wave.\nRan around like an idiot through ranks of enemies till they all were on their backs while your fortress was shoting them? That might just work.\nPss... Abilities rock.\n\n\n\nChallenge.\nAt the easy level it's possible just to look at how the last wave went and figure out what needs upgrading first: fortress or Troll? Both are important. If one is lacking, the other will pick up SOME slack, but not all of it.\n\n\nFAILing.\nYou can not fail. At all. This was, somewhat, frustrating when I got to Survival. Eventually got all achievements at easy and... Um... Now what? I can go and play on medium, but I don't expect to see anything new. There are no achievements for beating game on Medium or Hard.

So the player is engaged into playing all the time without going somewhere.\nThere is very good balance between fortress and troll.\nIt is challenging at the right pace.\n\n\nThe bad:\nThere is no "FAIL!" state. As in, at all. You just lose a wave, but all it does is that you can't collect the loot dropped from enemies and your troll starts with minimum HP.\nInterface is somewhat clunky, so you'll have to get used to it.\nFinished whole game in 1 day on easy... And don't want to play it again on medium / hard.\n\nThe neutral:\nSomewhat bad pathfinding for troll for RAM attack.\n\n_______________\nThe good:\n"Stupid funny" as in, if you like throwing things around in games, you'll like this one. It takes little time to get used to the game and then you have hours and hours of fun. Like, a whole day. But that's just it, it will last just a day. HOWEVER! The day will be full of lulz, laughing and, if you'll get the moment, funny screenshots.\nAnd the "Ram" attack can be brought into good because even if it leads to you failing a wave, it's a no problem. You can't fail here. Like, at all. So all the more reason for laughing how troll "dances" around the enemies that he tries to ram. While trampling everyone around those enemies.\n\nI actually laughed while typing this when remembered how this worked well. And failed horribly a few times.\n\nPlaying this game "smart" or "serious" way will take away the fun. For me, playing games by reading guides and calculating my moves is the standard. Here, I didn't want to do that. I didn't NEED to do that to have fun. It was just "bumble around, wreck havoc". "You're a big troll, just run over your enemies! SMASH!"\n\nGraphics.\nWorld of Warcraft style graphics. Just enough, but no more. You won't find super shaders, flares or whatever. It's just enough. But if you like things "fancy", then get a DLC with suits. Dress up your Troll.\nWhy I don't say it's a bad thing? Well, because for the most time it's useful to be zoomed out maximum to have control over battlefield.\n\nGame pace.\nOkay. You get something done, you look at your fortress, you look at troll upgrades, OH NEW WAVE!!! SMASHING TIME!\nNow let's see, something to upgrade, maybe this, maybe that? New wave! BASHING TIME!\nThe pace goes as you read this text in a slow pace.\nPause is a useful button, but don't use it at first or second fortress at early stages. There isn't that much you can do, so don't try to brainstorm it. Smash, bash and trample stuff.\n\n\nBalance of Fortress vs Troll.\nYour fortress IS a fortress. Don't forget that. Your troll is NOT invincible. Don't forget that. Keep both in mind, never lose.\nGot to arrogant and got surrounded? Ouch.\nForgot about fortress and didn't trample those who were bashing it? Restart the wave.\nRan around like an idiot through ranks of enemies till they all were on their backs while your fortress was shoting them? That might just work.\nPss... Abilities rock.\n\n\n\nChallenge.\nAt the easy level it's possible just to look at how the last wave went and figure out what needs upgrading first: fortress or Troll? Both are important. If one is lacking, the other will pick up SOME slack, but not all of it.\n\n\nFAILing.\nYou can not fail. At all. This was, somewhat, frustrating when I got to Survival. Eventually got all achievements at easy and... Um... Now what? I can go and play on medium, but I don't expect to see anything new. There are no achievements for beating game on Medium or Hard. Or some special achievements for beating bosses on those difficulties.\n\n\nPaying again?\nMight go for Medium or Hard some day, but not sure.","May 22","true","11.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

It's worth around £9.99 I would say based on similar games I have played like this.  I have only played it for around an hour but had fun in that hour.  My only real concern is the controls.  The UI looks nice and everything but it feels a bit clunky and in combat I have to keep moving the mouse curser down towards th special abilities and clicking them.  Makes it all a bit awkward.  Would be great on a touch screen device though.  Also the game didn't work at all with my steam controller which is annoying considering it claims to have controller support.  I tried an xbox controller but it was horrible in my opinion.  Definately only keys for this game.  I also didnt like that I could only move the screen by using arrow keys.  Why couldn't I just move it with the mouse cursor when it was at the edge of the screen?  Small things like this made it a little frustrating.  The gameplay itself though was enjoyable and plenty of character upgrades, fort upgrades, minion upgrades.  The game makes you use your brain by making you choose between repairing your base, searching for loot, collecting wood and buiding new things as you have to allocate your minions to do these things.  overall 9/10 for the game itself.  3/10 for the controls.","May 23","true","1.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I'd actually pay for this.  Get it while you can.\n\nOk so a few more hours in.  Still fun... however... when you get to later rounds it gets really glitchy, especially if you are playing with game speed.  There's a progress bar that fills up to tell you when the next attack will be and I've more than once had it start half full then before you can move your troll it's half dead from ranged attacks that you can't recover from before you're shot again.\n\nSeems to be a way to stop you progressing too far.\n\nIt's not game breaking, and doubtless the devs will fix this issue.  It's more annoying than anything and will probably be the end of some gaming sessions.\n\nOh and for the curious I'm playing this on a Skylake i5 with a GTX980 so should handle it ok.\n\nThat said, I'd still pay for it.","May 23","true","8.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Just over 4 hours later, completed the All quests achievement, 0.20% of all players (at the time) had this achievement. After completing all the quests, I continued for a bit, but got bored quickly, with nothing to upgrade and nothing to work towards. Kind of short, but an interesting game for sure. Totally worth waiting the minute it takes to download and the afternoon to beat it. However, I don't see myself personally replaying the whole thing over from the start on a new save file, unless they update it to allow for further advancement. I didn't notice much difference between the high and low graphics settings, then again, I was always playing on the furthest zoomed out view possible (which I think could be  changed to zoom out a bit further). After beating the final boss and getting his achievement, the game starts to lag from the increasing number of enemies that spawn in each wave. None-the-less, it was an enjoyable game.\n\nThere was one thing that annoyed me in the survival mode though... the later waves with more enemies quite often walked too close to the castle, forcing the wave to start much sooner than expected, even though i had the troll sitting on of the gate to keep him away from getting too close to the enemy and forcing it myself. This caused a couple waves of unprepared, half built/upgraded buildings before the time ran out.","May 20","true","4.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Even during the tutorial level (the first level) my Troll died because I didn't stray from the tutorial path and build an extra tower rite away\n-You are constantly battling your minions to send them where they need to go (you have to keep track of them ALL the time so you don't waste time with them idleing around otherwise its very hard to keep up with the pacing the game wants you to be at).\n\nThats just my oppinion. Like I said at the start its a decent concept but it feels unpolished, more like a beta than anything else.  And again I only played for about an hour so this is just my first impression. If I feel like it I will come back later and try it again from scratch then update this as I see fit.\nIf you like RTS's but you don't like having to scroll around huge maps, or you just want to play casually this could be a game you would enjoy. If you are looking for a more polished and finished game I personally can not recommend this to you.","May 20","false","0.9"," 8 of 19 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","8","19","0","0"

Let's be clear, I love this game. Which is why it's so infuriating seeing something potentially amazing hamstrung by a swarm of bad design decisions.\n\n\nBugs, Balance issues, Missing features:\n\n-Scavenging. Remove this mechanic, make the scavengers a completely separate unit from your Peons maybe tied to the market, or remove the despawn timer on loot. Additionally make the scavengers able to pick up the Gold Coins, which should ABSOLUTELY NOT DESPAWN.\n-Health bars are a vague suggestion and completely meaningless as to how unclear they are. A green blob that gradients to red with lower health would be clearer even.\n-When your Keep is destroyed and you restart, you go to the next day. You keep the gold you picked up (which is scant comfort), but all the corpses disappear instantly. Seemingly those creatures aren't present in the next attack either, so you lose those resources permanently. The attack after next will be at full strength again. OTA is seemingly balanced around having 100% loot collection, which due to the mechanics of the looting system is almost impossible (sometimes literally with bodies falling into unpathable terrain).\n-Troll upgrades jump in cost excessively per level. Some upgrades are such inane power spikes that your Troll literally either steamrolls everything, or dies instantly. There's no middle ground, no sensation of a close battle, it's either your Troll does an imitation of a Silverback Gorilla on steroids fighting a Playschool Class, or a ball of playdough vs chainsaws.  This would even probably be fine if it weren't for the loot system (again). Though the upgrades also don't tell you anything about what the abilities actually do... no cooldowns, no range indicators, no damage indicators, you just get bars which are either blank or full. Presumably they're some kind of scale, but where do they start and end? I'm going to assume they use a variant of the brand new SI unit, the Kilobadinterface.\n-Abilities are locked for what appears to be no reason. Please add a tooltip that says "UNLOCKED IN CHAPTER X"\n-Have the Objective HUD element actually show what the objective subtext is when you hover over it.\n-Microtransactions are fine, just don't put the button for them in the middle of a menu that never changes at any other time other than in one window. So then you conveniently have a button that stuns the player temporarily when you try to go from Troll Upgrades to Town Upgrades.\n-The Troll handles worse than the Mars Rover, only less responsive.\n-Buildings' construction is shown in % of how confused you are. Please use actual time, or time with the %. Information, not Data.\n-Assignments for Peons should have Arrow buttons on either side for +1 or -1. Every time someone uses a slider with no other method of controlling the interface element, an orphaned puppy dies.\n-Have a HUD readout of how many Peons you have in each task...\n\n\n\nI was excited to get playing this. Writing this made me feel very sad. However, I look forward to tinyBuild's next game. Lot of promise shown here, just a lot of fixing to do. Hopefully enough lessons were learned here.\n\n\n","May 24","false","3.0"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Thekairouz/recommended/438680/","Thekairouz","Thekairouz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Thekairouz/","117 products in account","Great game for a free to play game, quite generous if you ask me!!\n\nThe game in a nut-shell:\nYou start with a bare bones base that is guarded by a huge Shrek looking troll. It would seem that the enemies from various places (Ninja Turtles universe) have taken a day off and decided to trash your base. You basically combine tower defence elements with a troll smashing to form the basic gameplay.\n\nHow the game works:\nThe game structure is based on going from wave to wave of enemies when once defeated you get a set amount of time to manage your workers (smaller trolls) and upgrade your base. For the most part the constant switching between phases keeps it interesting and fun though it's not to say individually the combat/base management are perfect in themselves.\n\nCombat:\nDuring combat segments you take control of the troll and face ever increasing waves of bad dudes. The combat system is a very basic diablo-isk top down battle system, which is successful in some regards. It is fun but it feels like it could be smoother and better balanced. For one, your troll never feels impactful or strong. He is actually quite easily overwhelmed and as the waves increase there seems to be a huge disparity between what the game expects you to do and what your troll can actually do. There is a generous death mechanic where you retain your progress but have your wave number winded back to an early (and easier) wave, which allows you to farm enough resources to bring your base to a level that's more consistent with the difficulty of the wave that you lost to. Whilst this mechanic does balance the game it feels like it was implemented to hide a design flaw, which would not be there if the balancing had been fine-tuned better.\n\nThat's not to say that's there isn't good components to the combat system, take the whirlwind ability which feels very impactful. You basically do a spin around and anyone around you gets pounded. Though, a MOBA style key bind would be magical as it's only clicking enabled at this point, which takes away from the action, especially as you gain more skills and have numerous icons.\n\nIn terms of the abilities, it's very hit and miss. You tend to favour some abilities with others being useless. The whirlwind is great but the charge isn't. I avoid the charge because it's wildly inaccurate and sometimes you can run off screen and lose time coming back to where you are. The taunt is another example, not only is the animation too long but the troll isn't all that tanky, this talent is mainly used to kite at best and that detracts from the idea of being a huge troll that smashes things.\n\nMy last thoughts on the combat system is that the troll doesn't feel fluid enough. He can barge through enemies if he picks up enough speed, which is great but when he is attacking and not using an ability it lacks impact. Thematically, is this a large powerful troll or not? It would be awesome if there could be a Dynasty Warrior feel to his attacks (and some abilities give that) because he is a huge creature but instead you sit there hitting one little dude at a time that has more health then it probably should meanwhile range enemies are picking away at your health. I can understand that the developers put in the addition of upgradeable towers but it still feels like combat hasn't got the right balance at this point.\n\nI do want to note that it's strange that the troll uses the same resource to upgrade as your buildings do. Not sure why they didn't implement an XP system. You can only obtain gold during combat but gold is required for upgrading your troll and base improvements. Whilst there isn't a resource issue it doesn't quite fit. The current system isn't perfect but seems little counter intuitive.\n\nCamera: One of the things that really stopped the flow of the action was the poor camera. For the most part it's a fixed angle. However, I have two main issues with it:\n\n1) There is a side of your base that you cannot see and you have to bring your mouse over the base in order for it to go transparent. This doesn't always work so sometimes you cannot see how many enemies are there and what the hell your troll is hitting. Particularly frustrating because the defeat trigger is your base dying.\n\n2)  You can run off the screen when you use charge!! Really poor design flaw.\n\nBASE MANAGEMENT:\nThe base management and resource management system is well thought out (albeit not perfectly thought out). You have an option of four buildings which give you access to different things (Tavern - mercs, Barracks - upgrades, Town Hall - worker efficiency & Trading Post - market place to trade resources for gold). In addition to that you can upgrade your walls and up to four towers, the towers have additional specialisation options (such as archers or catapults).  In terms of resources you have gold & "loot" (which is stuff picked up from dead enemies) and gatherable resources such as wood, stone & iron.\n\nOverall, whilst it isn't perfect the timing mechanic adds an interesting element of gameplay. You have a certain amount of time to improve your base so you prioritise what you want to do and this gives it some depth. Early to mid-game the decisions feel weighty and require you to make decisions and prioritise. For example, choosing between upgrading civil buildings (which gives you access to more workers, which will allow you to more but no defensive value) vs upgrading a tower/wall (which is your bases survivability). The idea is sound and interesting but a few things emerge as you go. Some of the civil buildings are not overly useful early game and the only reason why I updated them was to obtain additional workers and not for the benefit of that buildings. Granted somethings are required (need the store house early or you get resource capped) other buildings you can go without for a long time (like Barracks, which allows you to upgrade towers - too expensive for it to be useful before later on).\n\nSomething that perplexed me was the tower system - they are expensive and lack thought. You have a basic tower and four options (two of which are archer & catapult) they are helpful in battle but basic things are missing. Each different tower has its own strength and weaknesses - range/reload speed and damage. However, range is note expressed as a range visually but you are expected to understand through a meter. I'm not sure what (for example, 2/5 range means in terms of the map). This leads to errors in placement as you are effectively guessing how far the tower can actually shoot (beyond knowing which has the most and which has the least). Not only that but the tower upgrade seem slightly off, for example the catapult has the further range but low damage - as opposed to the archer tower whom does more damage. I'm not sure that makes sense.\n\nThe towers also have to be built one by one and going back to the strategic balance between defence and civil buildings, it doesn't quite fit. I adapt to this because I need to but that doesn't mean it’s a sound mechanic or fun.\n\n\nVerdict:\nI'm obviously picky but I played this for three hours straight and only went to bed because it was 4am. The game is sticky and fun but once you put it down I'm not sure you'd have a reason to revisit it (beat the three levels which makes upgrading your keep to max level the campaign, which was good design).\n\nGranted it’s free and I should be happy but I would happily pay money to see a better balanced and thought out game. Just because it's free does not make it "better than nothing" and "you should be grateful" kind of thing. For the developers, I enjoyed your game and I would pay money but not sure moneytising cosmetics is the way to go. Maybe the three levels that you give away so generously could be paid beyond the first.","May 20","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Your goal is to defend vs the enemys, get enough resources to upgrade your goblin fortress and the troll.\nThe troll can learn new attacks, become faster, have more health, hit harder and get more awesomeness.\nThe goblin fortress can get better trained workers, better trained tower guards, hired orcs, upgraded your 4 side's towers, the wall, new resources places, tavren, barracks, store and town hall.\nThere are 3 story missions. Strawburg, Timberpost and Stonehold, after the toturial/story missions you can go into surviver that is an everlasting one.\nThis game looks good and plays ok, the troll is alittle cluncky, but it has fair enough skills that is intressting to use. The enemys will become better as soon as the fortress becomes better, the store has a trading mechanics that allows you to chess the game out by harvesting the most expensive thing, make it into gold and then make it into what you need. This game NEEDS a hardcord setting cause you can not lose. I had it on hard and it was too easy anyways. The rts element is just to use money on the things you wanna upgrade, releasing the hired orcs and using the trolls skills. If this sounds like a good deal then give this free game with steam achievments a go. It looks really good for a free to play game and its kinda fun. Have fun and enjoy smashing pigmen. ;)","May 22","true","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is one of those easy to learn and hard to master. The campaign mode has 3 missions which are basically a tutorial and then comes the survival mode which is like an endless game. it has 3 dificulty levels so it has a lot of for casuals and hard core alike.. If you you like the game and want to support the devs, buy the costume pach and hopefully they will release expansions for it becasue it is a pretty cool simple game","May 22","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But as it stands I can not get past the point where the mission is "build Strawburg". Apparently building all towers and buildings is not sufficient. A riddle too complex for me.\n\nEditing: I found the bug. First time around I was not allowed to upgrade the walls. Button was not clickable. I restarted the mission a few times -> same effect.\nTrying again a day later (rebooted PC) I can build the walls. This finished the mission.\nHopefully this will help other users.\n\nSo I'll change the review status to positive as it seems fun so far.","May 21","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"
