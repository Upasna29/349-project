"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/recommended/385590/","pepsimanvsjoe","pepsimanvsjoe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/","1281 products in account","It seems that lately I've become more of a casual JRPG* fan than I care to admit. Just to give an example: While my The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky installation gathers cobwebs and silently weeps, I've played through three Compile Heart games. Now when I use the word "casual", I don't mean it in the sense of "Those filthy casuals are killing my hardcore games!" A casual game is something I play when I want to relax. Lethal RPG: War isn't much to look at, but it's a perfectly safe product for casual consumption.\n\nThe undead menace must be stopped! The main character is named Lethal and...oh...really? Lethal?! The only way this clown could be any edgier, is if he had spikey hair and an oversized sword. *ahem* Anyway, you're tasked with leading Lethal and his party on a world-saving adventure. On your journey you'll complete several quests, fight vicious monsters, upgrade gear, and challenge dangerous bosses. The storyline is serviceable, and the few instances of personality in the cast are welcome. However, this game can be beaten in less than 10 hours, so don't expect much in the way of extensive character arcs. The guy who tells dumb jokes? He's staying that way. Don't expect him to stop joking and then tell everyone about his troubled past as a bandit.\n\nPart of what makes Lethal RPG a casual JRPG experience is the lack of what we're accustomed to. There is an overworld, but there aren't any random encounters. There are several fixed fights all over the map, and you can even choose to fight whenever you want. Grinding isn't particularly necessary, because you get more than enough experience and materials, from fixed-fights and solving quests. The more startling omission is the complete lack of dungeons. There are numerous locations in this game, they all have dungeonesque names, but there's nothing to explore. What usually happens is that you'll fight a battle or two, and then move on. Aside from the arena, there aren't any situations where you have to carefully manage your resources. Oddly enough, I consider this a positive element. This game is very stream-lined, which makes the idea of dungeons, sound like needless padding.\n\nThe battle-system in this game is fairly solid. There are a remarkable number of characters to use, and they're mostly well-balanced. Much of my strategy for the boss-fights revolves around status effects. Yep, this is one of those rare JRPGs, where debilitating effects actually work. Bosses afflicted by poison, burns, and bleeding can lose large chunks of HP every round. You might find it more effective to use tomes to exploit weaknesses. This can include casting spells the enemy is weak against, as well as enchanting weapons with particular elements. Every party member has their own set of skills, and a touch of variety is always nice. Unfortunately, characters - depending on when they're introduced - can fall behind in experience. On the other hand, a couple levels usually won't make a difference. I also appreciate that even the regular encounters can be dangerous. Losing a party-member during a fight with a "trash-mob" is not uncommon.\n\nUpon completion of Lethal RPG: War, you're allowed to access New Game+ mode. As per genre standards, this mode lets you play through the story again while carrying over all levels, characters, and equipment upgrades. This also raises the monster's experience level, because it'd be too easy otherwise. It's a nice gesture, but it's like prestiging in a Multiplayer FPS. All you really have is an excuse to jump back on the hamster wheel, and dirty newspapers don't even get replaced. You're liable to use the same strategies for every encounter. Sure, you'll have a few more options to play around with, but all that's really changed, is that the numbers are much higher.\n\nAnother complaint that I have is the music. There really aren't enough tracks to go around. Actually, I guess I could consider this a positive. Since the soundtrack isn't all that great, it's a perfect excuse to catch up on other music or a few podcasts. Also the writing is a little too dry. Some of the NPCs will mention dramatic events, but they will be stated in such a matter-of-fact manner that your only response is "Oh okay". I would have preferred a little drama, give these traumatic moments time to sink in, instead things just tend to happen.\n\nAwhile back I reviewed another JRPG by the name of Crystal Story II. I stated that it had a certain nebulous charm. I think the same can be said for Lethal RPG: War. The protagonist is a dork, the writing is bland, and there isn't really much to do aside from fight monsters, upgrade equipment, and view story scenes. However, everything in this game is endearing in its own twisted way. It's a good palette cleanser when other games get so wrapped up in themselves, you forget which way is up. Maybe this also says something about my tastes. When it comes to reviewing 2D shooters and beatemups, I can be very strict. With JRPGs, even if they don't do much to stand out, I tend to be pretty lenient. Perhaps there is a certain joy exclusive to the genre. Adventuring, obtaining treasure, or raising stats, just feels good to me. Whatever the case, I think this game is okay.\n\n*While not made in Japan, Lethal RPG does have the attributes of a common JRPG.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","November 14, 2015","true","12.7"," 41 of 47 people (87%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","87","41","47","4","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Imban/recommended/385590/","Imban","Imban","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Imban/","1581 products in account","Lethal RPG: War may well be quite competitive as compared to free flash games in terms of its story, graphics, and gameplay, but there's just not enough there to make this a game I would recommend.\n\nFirst up, the story is stupid, and not even in a "so bad it's good" way, most of the time. It takes itself quite seriously, despite having a main character named Lethal, but the plot is incredibly generic "save the kingdom from the creepy crawlies," so there's very little there to really either catch a player's interest or amuse a player who's playing it for laughs.\n\nThe main issue is the gameplay, though. The game is very, very grindy insofar as you will be repeating more or less similar strategies dozens of times, given that even generic enemies are tough enough that essentially all fights will take 4+ rounds to resolve, even those you're sure you'll win from the start.  (Actually, as a sidenote, generic enemies encountered in random battles seemed stronger than generic enemies encountered in story battles. This is probably an artifact of the level scaling, but it still contributed to the grindy feeling.) This is compounded by a system where enemies scale to Lethal's level (to a minimum and maximum based on the map area you're in) but your characters don't gain full XP unless they're in the active party, meaning that not picking two companions - and on a first run, almost certainly the two you start with - and sticking with them through the entire game is a recipe for a needlessly difficult time.\n\nAs upsides, the graphics are actually pretty well done and the actual combat mechanics are fairly interesting for important fights - each character has a basic attack, a defensive move, up to five special attacks unlocked as they level up, and a wide selection of spells and consumable items acquired during the course of the game. Just... there's not much other than those boss fights, which can vary wildly in difficulty, to really act as a draw for this RPG.\n\nSo yeah, no. Lethal RPG: War's solidly mediocre in a way that makes it not a game I'd recommend to anyone in particular.","November 18, 2015","false","10.8"," 26 of 32 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","26","32","2","2"

It's a good game to play while listening to a podcast or something, as it doesn't require too much focused attention. I will say, it feels like certain abilities may not be working properly; for example, using the "taunt" command had no appreciable effect on who enemies targeted, with 5 or more attacks still bypassing their allegedly "priority" target, and occasionally my mouse indicator just seemed to disappear, making map navigation impossible. But all in all, as I said, a solid, acceptable little title, perfect for jumping into a turn-based experience without any muss or fuss.\n\nNote: Titular character "Lethal" is not cool in any way. He's a total goober and his character design looks like a dishrag.","July 19, 2015","true","17.9"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","9","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/matseb2611/recommended/385590/","matseb2611","White Shadow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/matseb2611/","317 products in account","I've thoroughly enjoyed this game. As a fan of RPGs with turn-based combat, I can certainly recommend it. The fighting was very strategic and for the most part I found it balanced well enough to stay challenging but not impossible. You acquire several party members throughout the game and can change them in and out of the active party any time between battles. There is a great variety of allies, though I personally found all of the mage types to be too mushy and die too easily to enemy attacks, so I ended up using mostly the fighter types throughout most of the game.\n\nThe combat in general was great, but there were a few things that annoyed me. One aspect in particular was that enemies virtually always had better agility than my team, so they always took their actions first every turn, which meant that if any of your allies got low on health, they'd be finished off the next turn before you get a chance to heal them. The only times the enemy agility was equal to agility of my allies was when I was overlevelled for the area. Even the assassin (the fastest party member) wouldn't always go before the enemy.\n\nAnother annoyance mostly came in late stages of the game. A lot of the enemies and bosses later on just started having way too many resistances, so you'd often end up dealing very little damage to them if only 1 party member had the means to strike their weakness, and hence the battles were dragging out. Without giving any spoilers, I found the final boss to be very uninteresting, due to that same fact. He was only weak to one element, which only the main character could use, what meant that your 2 other allies in the party were only useful for serving potions and dealing an occasional debuff on the boss.\n\nThe first half of the game was really great. It only started to get a bit repetitive later on, and I feel it could've easily been 2-3 areas shorter. Just feels that it overstayed its welcome a bit.\n\nI imagine the art style won't be to everyone's liking, but I personally thought it was nice-looking and thought it gave a nice flare to the tone of the game. Since the game was rather light-hearted and even cheesy, the visuals fit it fine. The music was also great. Even though there were only about half a dozen of tunes in the entire game, I never really got bored of hearing them, since they were pleasing to the ear.\n\nThere wasn't much else happening aside from battles, although I did enjoy the crafting mechanic. Each character had 4 possible armours and 4 possible weapons to craft throughout the game, and each one could be upgraded. In addition to weapons and armour, you can also find a variety of animals to serve as the main character's pet. Each animal had different strengths and weaknesses, so some degree of micro-management was needed to make them useful in battles.\n\nThe story is pretty much your cheesy light-hearted epic fantasy. It doesn't do anything extraordinary, but it's there to make the game a bit more fun.\n\nOverall it's a fun game and I enjoyed it.","August 7, 2015","true","19.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

It's a great game, really worth it's price. I spent 15 hours just to play it once, and I plan to start it over, to finish everything in the game. The story is interesting (not unique), there are lot of clichés, but it doesn't spoil the fun. The classes are fun to play with, interesting companions, with different playstyles, and a GREAT TWIST at the end, I must say I was shocked :)\n\nI can only recommend this game, to every player who wants to have some casual RPG with good atmosphere, and doesn't mind the lots of clichés.","October 31, 2015","true","15.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I more than got my monies worth out of it.\n\nGraphically, its very flash level. Not amazing, but decent enough for what it needed to do. The fights get old, and once you have a plan for the area you are in - you pretty much do the same thing until you leave - 15 fights or so. So its less about all the choices you have and more about not using things you currently shouldn't. There is enough in the way of tomes and skills to experiment and I think its complete and balanced enough. Mid-game I did stop changing my party around tho, which always makes me wish for larger parties... but 3v3 was the concept.\n\nThe story had me laugh a few times but overall its typical of the flash rpg genre. Not overly amazing and using the skip (which I didn't) wouldn't change much. The conversations were not always that good.\n\nI would have liked more achievements, but they were paced out very well such that there was always one in sight. For that reason I was encouraged to complete the game in a steady swoop, which is always a sign of decent achievement design.\n\nTechnically, the game played flawlessly even over many hours. I did not experience any issues of any kind, which has not been the case with many other titles lately, so that was refreshing.\n\nTLDR: Its a nice simple RPG thats forgiving and playable. I would like to see more achievements but will be watching the dev page for more like this in the future.","January 19","true","15.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

However, only a small number of combinations are actually worthwhile.  For instance, having the mage in your team is absolutely essential.  I found the solider, berzerker, and assassin to be of far less utility.\n\nThere's a nifty crafting system that's driven by loot from tons of optional bosses and sidequests.  Upgrading your equipment visually changes your characters, which is a nice touch on a game at this price point.  Yet, the distrubtion of crafting items is frustrating.  The game desperately needs some manner of exchanging crafting supplies, especially since the money you earn by completing battles is nearly useless.  For instance, by the end of the game I had several hundred leathers but had to spend significant time grinding for linen and silk for the necromancer and mage.\n\nThe random encounters are too difficult and the bosses are (for the most part) too easy.  It shouldn't take 8-10 rounds to decide the outcome of a random encounter.  One the up side, the encounters are placed on the map so you get to decide when and where you fight.   The boss encounters are much easier and generally follow the same formula: stack DoTs, heal and regen mana.  The bosses telegraph big attacks a turn or two in advance, so throw in a well-time defend command now and then.  The multitude of bosses look cool and are animated well but don't differ significantly in strategy.\n\nIt sounds like I'm being harsh on the game but I really did enjoy it a great deal.  It was a nice break from the generic RPG Maker games that litter Steam.  If you're looking for a low-priced RPG to kill a weekend on, this is it.","February 28","true","15.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you want to pay 10x that at normal  price. That's your choice.\n\nPros\n-It's a standard  JRPG game. If you've played any of that type of game before it'll be easy to play with little to no problem.\n-There isn't flash, flare and other such gimmics in the game. No slot machine large numbers that are used  to make it seem like you're doing big damage when you really aren't.\n-Decent music and sound efects.\n-I didn't notice any problems running the game.\n\nCons\n-As with most games of this type there's no options to speak of. Volume, fullscreen and dif is all. Well, music slider too.\n-The curser is decktop and the names for items aren't outline in a bold boarder. This could be a problem for those of you (like me) who have eye disorders.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=693243074\n\n\n","May 29","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After you beat it you can start again but it is much, much more difficult.","May 27","true","28.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
