My favorite shop is now the Sushi one, some crazy anime cat girl comes in.  Watch out for Superman and the Vampires, they aren't very nice to the other customers.   This is much better than just Cake Mania.","November 29, 2015","true","13.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Which is like, hello, isn't this CAKE Mania? I'm sitting here making burgers? Which is actually pretty fun though, so that's not a big deal.\n\nCheesy dialogue like all the other cake mania games. If you can ignore the cringe, this game is fun and entertaining.","September 4, 2015","true","16.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
