Literally ♥♥♥♥ this game.\n\nWhy? Because it is actually really REALLY FUN. And THAT is exactly the Problem!\n\nHow so you ask? Simple! Because it is yet another free-to-play, pay-to-win game. It is a good game disguising a hideous marketing strategy. It is absolutely repulsive.\n\nBecause you're gonna start playing this game and go "Oh man! This game is really fun! I want to keep playing it!" but then slowly the realization starts to seep in... YOU CAN'T. Why not? Well, lets see here... did you lose that last round? Bit of random bad luck and didn't quite make it? Want to try the round again? WELL TOO BAD!! Your heros are out of health now and won't be full again until THREE HOURS FROM NOW. Hey, did the game just give you a sweet new character as a reward for beating a stage? Great! Too bad you're out of spaces for new characters in your hero roster that you can only expand using the game's premium currency! Oh and by the way, your reward expires in five days and then you'll lose it forever, good luck trying to farm premium currency through the stages in game! Oh, I'm sure it won't take you very long if you've got a strong team of heros to keep plowing through with... Oh, what's that? They're all out of health again? Guess you're ♥♥♥♥ed! LOLS!! Seriously, this is the only game I've ever played that gives you rewards that you're never able to actually use.\n\nAnd it all just spirals on downhill from there. You want to get anywhere in this game? "Give us your money!" And not just some of your money... ALL OF YOUR MONEY! Because lets face it, it would be EASY to release a normal, playable version of this game for say $15... but they don't want just a little of your money. They want ALL OF YOUR MONEY. There is a never ending supply of money that this game can drain away from you. Because that's how it was designed. And it is a damned crying shame!\n\nAvoid this piece of garbage like the Plague. Or Ebola. Whatever horrifying desease floats your boat. XP\n\n-------------------\n\n[Revised Review, dated 3/24/2016]\n\nI'm not sure what drew me back to this game, other than that I still see a few people on my friends list playing it and that annoyed me... aaaand I was just bored enough one day to take a second look. So consider this an "update" on the previous review, because I decided to legitimately give the game a second chance and see how it has evolved since last I touched it and if it has improved it's terrible performance.\n\nTo my surprise... it has.\n\nA lot of the inherient flaws I found in the game persist. You still need to pay for roster slots and you never quite seem to have enough for the number of "cover" rewards you're given. And as a player starting out (because the game did reset me to scratch for whatever reason, but all the better to review the updates), you will likely feel constantly overwhelmed in most challenges and leaderboards because a signficant portion of the playerbase is already way ahead of you.\n\nHowever, with a bit of proper management, selling off hero/covers you don't really want to use and spending your hero tokens entirely on roster slots, you can make it through the early stages fairly easier than I remembered them being. Additionally, the amount of time you have to claim your rewards has clearly been extended by a wide margin(my original review claims 5 days, the current build gives you 14 days), allowing you much more time to earn hero points through gameplay to unlock the roster slots you need to claim them. And those Hero Points seem to be a lot easier to come by than they were previously. Also, the very welcome addition of a set of 10 Full Heal items (that also restore back up to ten over time like hp bars do) makes grinding various activities a lot easier. Lastly, the removal of "Environment Tiles" and addition of "Team-Up Tiles" is an great update. You're able to earn Team Up cards through gameplay and from your "Alliance"/clan, which are powerful one use hero powers that can completely turn the tides of a battle from "I'm going to lose!" to "Holy crap, I just wasted those guys!"\n\nOverall, the experience is much improved. With a bit of dedication and smart team building... and, you know, LUCK... you can probably have a fun time with this game and not run into the massive frustrations I encountered in my original review. In a little over two weeks, I've built up a roster of 22 Heroes (from Star Rank 1 to 4), easily twice what I was originally able to obtain, without paying a cent and the next cover I care about making sure I get has 8 entire days left to go before I'd need to start worrying about whether I'd earn enough Hero Points to claim it or not. Unlike the first time I played, I actually feel like that's a goal I can achieve now. So... I have to give credit where credit is due. I've had fun with this, I think you could too.\n\nI do not retract my previous review statements. They are a reflection of the time and at that time things were much worse than they are now. And the inherient problems of a game built around microtransactions still exist, even if they have softened the impact they made at launch. Nonetheless, the game has proved itself to me enough that I am now willing to recommend it, so I will begrudingly perform that courtesy.","October 17, 2014","false","470.0"," 236 of 292 people (81%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","81","236","292","27","11"

But then they did a few changes which made it so that if you wanted to progress you had to do whats called grinding (for those that don't know, thats when you have to spend 5 or 6 hours playing just to keep up with others playing).  This made things less fun.\n\nNow for the biggest change, if you have any characters that can heal the team during combat its called false healing.  Basically what happens is that while in a round, they will heal your characters, but soon as its done, any and all damage that was done to your character during a round gets applied to your characters, which means they will more then likely be instantly down and you have to wait somewhere between 3 and 14 hours for them to heal.\n\nSo now instead of being able to play for a couple of hours, you're lucky if you get in a couple of rounds that can last about 5 to 10 minutes at most and then you need to wait till the next day (least for those of us with families, work and who require sleep) to play for another 10 minutes and then wait.\n\nThey wanted to stop people from using their healing characters in story mode to heal their wounded characters and instead buy heath packs, which cost Hero Points which while they do come in game, they are very rare in game and they expect more people to buy Hero Points so they can buy health pack.  This has basically turned the game into pay 2 win game, well it was before but now its much worse.\n\nThe majority of people who play F2P games will never actually put money into free 2 play games.  Once it gets to the point where they are spending more then a few hours playing and not being able to keep up with their friends, they loose interest and leave, and start bad mouthing the game, which causes people not to go play that game, which means the game looses lots of money.\n\n\nSo for now I can not recommend this game.  Maybe if the devs wise up and actually listen to the community and things go back to how they were a couple of months ago, may I will start playing again and maybe even recommend this game, but lots of things have to change.","June 25, 2014","false","067.6"," 139 of 160 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","139","160","0","2"

I play just for the sake of it, but it's starting to feel extremely grindy and pay2win-ish.\n\nThey keep adding more paid or extremely expensive features (started with Shields, now with Alliances spots - 600 Hero Points for a new spot!!), don't care about balance, our ISO-8 pool is suffering a big hit (they reduced several rewards, now it's really hard to get a good ISO flow).\n\nI think the final nail in the coffin was that very lame Modern Thor. It's just too much. I don't know if they're lacking resources or whatever, but making a character completely obsolete, and giving more health to the most annoying character in tournaments... lame.\nAlso, the "Funbalance" patch went to the crapper with that. Now they just have to add a Gold Wolverine and that will be it.\n\nI think nowadays, this game isn't worth any kind of money. Maybe in the coming months it will be fine.\n\n=== Initial impression ===\n\nAfter spending quite some time with the game, I can say that I really like it. I've been playing a bit everyday since almost launch day.\nThe game is 100% free if you're willing to spend time on it. Most people burn away quickly because they can't game the game. It's quite easy if you think a bit about it, it's about maximizing profits and economy. Now I have 14 places in my Roster, without spending a dime.\n\nI think the whole design of the game itself is very, very nice, since it hits the right spot - you can play for a couple hours, then you get tired. And then (and this is very important) you need to get back to check for your placement on events and do an extra hour to the reward that you want. Because getting the #1 spot isn't the best thing that you can do all the time. Sometimes I get #45-99 (example) because that rewards are much more convenient.","December 28, 2013","false","438.5"," 85 of 111 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","85","111","0","6"

Heck, when it first came out, I DID like it.  I'm going to go straight to my pros and cons.\n\nPROS:\n1) Classic Puzzle Quest gameplay - If you have enjoyed any of the other PQ games, the gameplay is back.  You get 3 characters on your team, who provide 1-3 abilities each.  It's still fun and addicting.  This is not my problem with the game at all.\n2) Big cast - There are 33 characters and counting in this game.  Each brings something new to the table.  Sure, several of the characters are different versions of the another character (there are 3 different Wolverines), but they usually play differently enough that you won't mind.\n\nCONS:\n1) Poorly timed updates - In a game like this, nerfs are a fact of life.  But nerfing a character in the middle of an event that focuses on that character is a jerk move.  Especially now that they are introducing...\n2) Tournaments with entrance fees - This might not be so bad if it had been there from the start, but as a new feature, it feels like the wrong direction for the game.  To make matters worse, you can't find out the available characters for use in the  tournament until AFTER paying the costs.\n3) Rising costs - There are several neat features that were introduced as crutches to help players with weaker rosters, like Shields to protect against attacks in PVP and Boosts (extra starting energy or damage) to give yourself an extra edge.  These started off being available at a decent price, but then skyrocketed without warning after everyone came to depend on them.\n4) Speed-run - I don't know about you, but I like to play games at my own pace, and you can in this game... for the Prologue.  After that, each chapter is available for a limited time and disappears at the end of that time.  I completely missed Chapter 1 because of this and if you are starting now, it might be too late for you to see Chapter 2 as well.  This is made worse by the fact that some of the fights in these chapters have opponents with levels over 200 (your characters are capped at 141 until you manage to level the very rarest characters) and the fact that some levels are UNPLAYABLE unless you have a specific character in your roster!  Missing part of the story because you couldn't get a 4* Invisible Woman (the rarest character) is unacceptable.\n5) Slow leveling - When I started playing, this was my biggest complaint, but I adapted to it.  I would have still recommended this if it were the only problem.  However, it is still a problem you should be aware of.  Characters require THREE forms of leveling.  First, you need covers acquire or level up your skills.  Second, there is a very rare form of currency called Hero Points that can replace the need for covers, but you will likely need it for other purposes, because it is very rare unless you pay to buy more of it with real currency.  Third, you need ISO, which is the experience of the game.  At first, you'll think you are getting a ton of it, because low level characters can get a level after a fight or two.  Once your characters start to get mid-level, you will need to win ~20 fights to level a single character by one level.  With 30+ characters that have a max level anywhere from 50 to 230, you will need a LOT of ISO and even buying it with cash won't help because it is crazy expensive.\n\nSUMMARY\nI love the gameplay and being able to play with Marvel superheroes.  I was willing to cope with the slow leveling until the developers started making a ton of poor decisions that favored those who are insanely high-leveled or spending cash.  I want to love this game, and if it had been released as a Single-Player game like all of the others, I probably would.  But the way it is, I just can't.","January 29, 2014","false","187.7"," 54 of 66 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","54","66","0","0"

So when you've spent between $30 and $60 dollars, you've basically paid for a full priced new game. That's fine, just don't mark the game as free to play when it can only be properly enjoyed if you buy things. It's the exact same formula that 99.99% of "free to play" cell phone games use which makes cell phone gaming horrible. Long story short, this really isn't free to play, it's "free to play" with quotes. Another game I can think of that's the same way is Warframe: grind the same levels for dozens upon dozens of hours, or spend a minimum of $20 and well over that for what you want/need. But if you like Marvel and jewel match games which are addictive, and are willing to pay to enjoy the game properly, this would be fun I would safely assume. Free to play is, for some games, including this one, a crappy cash-grab money sink that unfortunately may never go away.\nThere are thankfully a few exceptions.

But at the very least I should be able to give people a very thorough review of the game.\n\nAt 280 hours played, the game can't be that bad, right? So why stop now?\n\nThe core of the game is still really cool. You build up a roster of Marvel heroes and villians and level them up to build a stronger and stronger team. And the devs support the game relatively well with new events and new heroes so there is always something to do.\n\nStill, they just pushed it too far. This game isn't really a game, it's a second job. I see no way to play this game casually, either you are all in or you are out. Every two weeks there is a new hero, accompanied by a 10 day long PvE event that's a pure battle of attrition to defend a placement in the leaderboards high enough to get the new hero. If you don't? Without the new hero you'll have already lost in the next tournament. The new always gives a insurmountable advantage for the next. There is no way to escape this sweatshop.\n\nAnd the PvE events are less fun with each iteration. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ rubber banding and level scaling makes PvE tournaments an exercise in frustration and disappointment. Have a maxed out Lv141 roster? Enjoy being beaten in placement by Level 50 teams, because their enemies get scaled to level 20 and take 1 minute each while you slog it out against Lv300 enemies with 10k HP each.\n\nAnd then the PvP tournaments... They used to be great. But then they changed the match making algorithm so that now every fight is a tired slog. And since there is now always an Alliance season running, you HAVE to do well in every single PvP tournament non stop or you are letting down your alliance.\n\nAlliances are another thing... they are great socially. But the pressure they put you under is enourmous. And again, it's all in or all out. Without being in a good alliance, you'll miss 30% of each tournament's reward! You might as well not bother if you aren't in an alliance.\n\nAnd the time commitment required to stay in the game is 2 hours EVERY SINGLE DAY. And even that is sometimes not enough, with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ending times in the middle of the night for EU players which means all your effort is wasted thanks to rubber banding of US players near the end of the tournament while you are sleeping.\n\nJust do yourself a favor and don't get involved in this game. It's a bottomless black hole that you can't escape from.\n\nWhy I quit now and not weeks ago? Season 1 just ended and I could finally leave without ♥♥♥♥ing over my alliance. They are great people and they didn't deserve being abandoned halfway through the season.","May 21, 2014","false","282.1"," 45 of 54 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","45","54","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Soif/recommended/234330/","Soif","Soif","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Soif/","506 products in account","I really wanted to like this game, but the path chosen by the developers makes this one of the most frustrating experiences with a game I have ever had. The hours I have listed on this game are not technically accurate as I had it running in the background for days/weeks at a time. However I have easily put in 100's of hours into trying to like this game, hoping that the devs would fix the issues and it would improve. Ultimately I finally realized that there was near zero chance that would happen because the devs want the game to be this way.\n\nFirst the lets talk about the good - If you enjoy PuzzleQuest you will like the mechanics, the incorporation of the Marvel license is topnotch both with writing and character design. If you can be content with just playing the story missions and only a small subset of the available champions then go ahead.\n\nHowever if you are like me and want to play with the new champions when they are released and play the special events then you will pay. And if you pay realize that it is only a matter of time before that which you paid for is nerfed or sidelined or otherwise invalidated by whatever the newest cash grab from D3 is.\n\nHere is how it works, lets say you have a set of beginning characters (called 2 star for their rarity) and are having fun. You see that a new character is being released (omg Nick Furry?! I want to play that one too!). In order to get covers for that character you have to buy them with real money, oh except you can't really buy them straight you have to buy a "pack" and hope you get the covers you want (along with a bunch of stuff you don't want). If you aren't willing to go that route then you will have to jump through some very specific hoops, namely you will be "competing" with other players for a chance to win the cover. You do this by direct competition (through a very very broken PvP style contest that I am not even going to get into its so bad) or by grinding away at special missions, missions that are designed to be overpowering and that will wound or kill your characters (requiring you to "rest" or buy medpacks with money). I don't know if I can stress how grindy these missions will be if you actually want a shot at the new cover, we are talking hours of playtime, but what is even worse is D3 picks the times you need to play. This is ultimately why I had to stop, in order to be successful with the rubber-banding and the like you had to be playing near the finish of each sub-event and each main event. That means you can't even just grind it out on your own time you needed to be hardcore during specific hours (forgot real life commitments). What I finally realized was there is no end game. That process described above is it. It doesn't get easier just harder, and not from a skill level just from a time commitment and frustration level. D3's entire model is to reward low level players greater then high level players to make them think rewards are quick and easy. Once you are hooked however you will constantly lose you chance at the new covers to the next wave of new players getting their hooks set. No only do I not recommend this to anyone I would be very cautious about ever playing anything from D3.\n","October 13, 2014","false","070.4"," 63 of 84 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","63","84","3","5"

Just ignore the micro-transactions. Honestly, you can get unlimited Iso-8/Hero Points/whatever in-game currencies using Cheat Engine to make yourself happy. Collecting the awesome characters is fun, but the user experience is bad. High CPU usage, laggy during loading, and not-user-friendly UI. You can only draw one card at a time and cannot sell them all at once. You have to move and click your mouse frequently to get things done. And it's difficult to get a Legendary character (Invisible Woman), the possibility is about 1% I think. It's difficult to earn Hero Points as well. Versus system doesn't make any sense, you're still playing with AI. And the most important thing is, if you try to level up some of your favorite characters, it will cost you more than 100k of Iso-8 to the cap. I tried so hard to enjoy this Marvel-flavored Puzzle Quest, but I failed. This game shouldn't be called Puzzle Quest IMO.","December 5, 2013","false","5.6"," 74 of 105 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","74","105","0","0"

I'm in too deep but it may not be too late for you.\n\nI've been playing the version on iOS since October last year and a lot has changed. The game deals in ISO and Hero Points. ISO is common but you'll need lots and Hero Points are uncommon but both are required. How much you'll enjoy this game will depend on how much money and time you'll be OK with sinking into this hole.\nYou collect covers of characters. Each cover is arranged in a 1-4 star configuration. 1* = common, 4* = super rare. How you can get covers is by either winning tournaments or by earning standard or heroic tokens and lucking in to a cover you require. A standard token would typically give you 1* cover with a sprinking of 2* cover and the day you get a 3* cover go get a lotto ticket. Heroic tokens are hard to come across but you can get anywhere up to 19 Heroic Tokens (personal experience) before you get a 3* cover. Why covers of characters and not the characters themselves? Because you can have more than one cover of the same character! Yes! Lazy! For instance, there are 3 covers of Storm - a 1*, 2* and 3* cover. Wolverine has 3 covers - a 2*, 3* and 4*. Thor has 3 covers - 2*, 3* and 4*, etc.\nOn top of that, most covers have 3 coloured moves and a maximum of 12 covers per chracter. Eg. Iron Man Model 40 (3*) - Unibeam (red), Ballistic Salvo (blue) and Recharge (yellow) (minus Bullseye (2*), Dr Doom (3*), Ragnarok (3*), Loki (3*) who all have 2 moves and a maximum of 10 covers). Meaning in order to max out your character, you need 12 covers and A LOT of ISO to level it up to full level. 1* covers level up to level 40, 2* = level 94, 3* = level 166 and 4* = level 270. Also, each cover takes up 1 roster slot. You can buy more with hero points!\nYou can buy cover packs with hero points/real money. They come in 1, 10, 42 packs. The amount of REAL money for hero points in this game is highway robbery. There is 0 value. If you were to spend money on this game, it would be in hero points but the little hero points you get for your hard earnt money is not even close to worth it. When you purchase a pack (because the only other time you can earn a 10 pack is through the season rewards), it USED TO guarantee at least one 3* cover. But they took that away because screw consumers. They don't want people having all the good covers by simply getting a "cheap" (it's not cheap) 10 pack with at least one guaranteed 3* cover in it. No no, we want you to jump through hoops to earn that 3* cover! What it DOES guarantee is a higher chance of getting a particular cover! So instead of of chance being 0.8%, it's 5.6%! They are REAL stats pulled right from the game! So if you get a 10 pack, you still have a VERY HIGH CHANCE of getting NO 3* covers! And this game uses them as the highest currency! From the 7 seasons so far, I have had 3 x 10 packs with 0 x 3* covers. This is what we're all aiming for! 3 and 4* covers! You think your hero points cost you a lot? Yes sure, but what are they REALLY worth?!? They can only buy you CHANCES of getting covers! If you already have one colour and you want another, you CAN SPEND 1250 Hero Points per 3* cover.\nYou have two types of game: PvE (Story) and PvP (tournaments). When you start the game, you can go through the prolog (PvE) which is one of the worst stories ever told. You know that episode of the Simpsons where Burns pulls out the piece of paper from the monkeys typewriter and he reads out, "It was the best of times, it was the BLURST of times?!?" well, that monkey seems more capable of writing a better story than what is present here. Quite honestly, I've stop reading all the "story" in this game months ago as it's merely a flimsy glue that holds this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game together.\nIt's not really pay to win because you can win tournaments (PvP) with a bad roster. The only difference is how active you are in playing. It's a game that masquerades as a casual puzzle game in the vein of bejeweled but make no mistake - they is no puzzle aspect and it's purely a numbers game that forces you to grind and pray that you finish first. All it takes to win is enough time to persist. You can have a strong team and if the computer feels like you're winning too often, it can decide to drop matching gems in favour of the enemy team. I've lost to a team half my level because the tiles dropped in the enemies favour. If you're up against someone who is too hard, you can skip them until you get someone easy. When you lose a round, it really hurts you because you get 5 health packs on a timer - 36 minutes for each health pack. And if you have a limited roster, it shortens the amount of covers you can use in a tournament. Once you've used up all health packs and your covers, you have to wait OR you can buy more health packs. One method of winning is purchasing health packs with real money/hero points and just continue playing until you've earned a score which is hard to beat. Then spend MORE real money/hero points to secure your position with a sheild. You don't really face people in PvP. You face their roster and the computer uses their roster. So how does the computer know which covers to use from other people's roster? Dunno. You would think it would pull their strongest characters but it doesn't always. If you find yourself towards the top of the tournament, you become enemy #1 and your team has a high chance of ending up in other people's list to face. If you don't have a sheild, you can lose points when your team is defeated by others. The only benefit in having the 3 star characters is more people to use in the roster. When your team gets naturally stronger with more 3* characters, you face stronger enemies so your weaker 2* becomes more useless.\nAlso, it is worth noting that some characters are USELESS such as Bagman Spiderman and Bullseye. Bagman Spiderman has 3 useless moves, each more usless than the next and Bullseye is a 2* with 2 moves which means his max level is 78. And while he can lay down defense tiles like crazy, he can't take a hit which makes him pretty useless. All your 1* covers are useless 99% of the time once you develop an even remotely strong team.\nWhy it's not really pay to win as well is because this game has no end to it. The end is you have all the covers. And they continually release new characters so the end to this game is when they shut down the servers or stop releasing new characters. It also feels like they do very little testing with the new characters/covers they release. We see it often when a new character comes out. It's hard to get excited about it when we know the second a bunch of people flock to the new character, it means its overpowered and will be nerfed.\nAlso, saving is a little ♥♥♥♥. If you want to save your progress, it is only possible through Facebook connect on iOS. I didn't see any feature on PC and I don't know what Android saving is like.\n\nIf you hate your life and after reading what I've had to say still want to go through with your  cult suicide decision to play the game, go join an alliance. They now cost nothing and the benefits are huge. Although you need to accept that your alliance will never be in the top 10 unless you have contacts and join one of the already established X-Men groups who are always in the top 10. Hell, it's hard to even place top 100 alliance without all 20 players being dedicated to winning.\n\nIn over a year, I've had to step back from the game 3 times because it has made me that angry and upset. I now play on a very casual basis and I can only ever treat it like that otherwise you burn out. I loved Puzzle Quest 1, 2 and to a degree, galactrix. But this is just dead ♥♥♥♥.","November 19, 2014","false","81.1"," 63 of 87 people (72%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","72","63","87","5","0"

It could be a really awesome game......  I said COULD be.  But the DLC and the mecanics of the game that make it nearly a must buy totally ruin it.\n\nI was in the top 50 in the opening competition and I have the Black Widow character to prove it.  I have not spent any money in DLC yet but I see the mechanics of the game that make it nearly impossible to play long term without doing so.  This is coming from someone who has spent a good deal of time playing this game.  I've also played previous games in the series like original Puzzle Quest and Puzzle Quest: Galactrix.\n\nIn order to increase your roster size you have to pay coins, which are nearly impossible to get without paying real money.  If you don't add a character to your roster within 7 days the character goes bye bye.  That means you have to either delete a character that you've probably built up or spend real money.\n\nIf you want to continue to play you have to keep your characters healed.  However, there's no way to get healing other than wait forever, which stops you from playing, or buy them, which requires real money again.  If you want to build your characters up any faster than a snails pace you have to spend real money again.  Around every corner of this game is a need to spend real money.\n\nFolks, there is a good way to do DLC and there is a bad way to do DLC.  This game is a shining example of the bad way to do DLC.  I would have much rather paid $20.00 for a great game then had options to buy non-gameplay breaking DLC such as special skins for the hero's, backgrounds, or gem skins.

Personaly, I do not recommend that anyone put money into this game because a lot of people have already done that, so the outcome would be rather disapointing, but that is left to your discretion.\n\nThis game has very interesting machanics for a puzzle game and the fact that it is Marvel is very cool. I also enjoy the animations for the character abilities. Additionally, the story content is usually humorous and fun to follow.\n\nThe game has changed in a few ways over the last year.\n\nFirst, when I started playing this game it was almost imposible to win in PvP or random events because people that put lots of money into the game had better characters at much higher levels. However, I continued to play and found ways to deal with it. But there is better news for new players. The game has been switched so that players are paired with other players around thier average level. So basically add all your character levels and divide by the number of characters. This machanic also tries to push people away from the idea of getting one high level character because it would offset your team average and put you at a disadvantage in a higher tier.\n\nOriginally, there were certain lower level characters with overpowered abilities, which have since been nerfed or changed to even out lower tiers because earning certain characters is a chance of luck and not everyone is lucky enough to get those characters early on.\n\nI think the game has overall changed for the better, eventhough there were a few changes I didn't like.\n\nAs a new player it would be much advised to play through most of the STORY content in order to build a decent team and obtain COIN to purchase more character slots (I would advise that you use COIN ONLY to purchase character slots because you dont get a lot and it costs more and more for ever 3rd or 4th slot obtained).\n\nI hope this was insightful.

You get to see opponents based on the points you have earned. The old system is really harsh for new players to handle at first but you will be able to handle it without no trouble later. Before the recent health changes and the nerf to mulitple heroes, most of the new released heroes (Starting from Iron Fist onwards) are completely broken to the point that destroys the fun out of the entire game.\n\nAfter the Matchmaking changes, only new players can find easy and fair fights while transitioners and most of the players without full level roster could no longer climb up the rank. Some heroes were nerfed to a point which are uplayable. The developer promised a buff for Inivisible Woman a year ago and ended up nerfing her even harder.\n\nWith all the recent disappointment, many veteran players are leaving MPQ. So if you are a new player and finding this game extremely easy, good luck, because you will find the game so hard to play with once you decide to level up your heroes. So, make sure when you play as a new player, keep all your hero unlevel for the rest of your life. I promise you, it will make your game, very enjoyable indeed.\n\nThis review shall be my parting gift to the developer and ♥♥♥♥ YOU VERY MUCH!\n(never in my life have I written a game review with a foul word, this time, I use it glady in your face)","April 22, 2015","false","1.1"," 24 of 32 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","24","32","0","2"

I'd love to tell you how the PC version is different, but it keeps crashing every time I try and launch it! I understand the pictures are bigger. Game is the same, though\n\nLet's start with the problems:\n\n- Characters are deliberately unbalanced with a star system where more *** means more powerful.\n- Higher-star characters are very difficult to unlock without spending money. Leveling them requires you to obtain them several times, so even if you get a rare character, good luck leveling it.\n- Even if you spend money, you don't get a choice of your characters. They're randomized packs. However, spending money gives you a shot at more powerful characters.\n- Even within a given star-rating balance is godawful. For example, Hawkeye and Black Widow are both 1-star characters. Hawkeye can do added damage, while Black Widow can stun an opposing character for 5 turns. I'll let you guess which regularly shows up on teams.\n- Leveling up a character's powers fully requires you to basically unlock that character 11 to 16 times. This is in addition to grinding to level. You don't even get the choice of what powers you're leveling. It's random. If you get a power you've already maxed out, ha ha, ♥♥♥♥ you, so it can take a lot more than 11-16 unlocks.\n- The single player campaign features huge jumps so that you have to grind in multiplayer to level up enough to progress, or... spend money. The grinding is not fun.\n- Regularly the game has "tournaments". Your competency in these tournaments will be determined by: character level, character star rating, luck, then skill, in about that order. You can earn characters ahead of other people if you're willing to be an obsessive grinding machine; only about the top 10 players actually get the new characters out of, well, thousands.\n- "Multiplayer" is basically just facing other people's characters controlled by the AI. There's no actual multiplayer. You can't pick which of your characters other folks face, either.\n- The AI is absymal and frequently makes terrible decisions for you to exploit (or for people to exploit against you). It can't even parse making certain advantageous matches (like on the corner of a column / row match).\n- Your characters heal on a cooldown. You can spend money to overcome this. You can get powerups that give you an advantage in matches, some of which are given free, but you can always spend money for power. You only have so many slots for characters, which you can unlock... slower than you earn characters... or spend money to gain them.\n- The graphics are sharp but the animations are terrible and barely worth noting. For example, Iron Man has three attacks and two animations.\n- The "writing" is done by noted comics hack Frank Tieri, and it's abysmal. Shut up about your stolen cars, Tony. It wasn't funny the first time. After the sixth time I believe a black hole of humor has been achieved. I liked the Dark Reign event, but this isn't quite that, and has characters nattering on about the terrible "isotope" concept used in the FTP Marvel games.\n\nOn the upside!\n- Some of the match-3 superpowers are rather clever and thoughtful (if not at all balanced).\n- You can unlock Spider-Man with a bag on his head.\n\nIn general: go up, scroll through the sample pics until you get to the secondmost pic from the right, the one that displays a roster. You will never see a screen like that. That screen represents perhaps over $120,000 dollars of investment in the game. That's the level of thought that went into this: showing a sample screenshot that no player will be insane enough to achieve.\n\nUnless of course, you have a hacked copy of the game. Did I mention people have already hacked it to have unlimited goodies and cheat their way to victory?\n\nOh, and it doesn't say in the store, but it's a beta / development version of the game!\n\n♥♥♥♥in' avoid.","December 19, 2013","false","2.0"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","19","24","0","0"

You'll start with 3 (Iron Man, Storm and Black Widow) and you'll have one empty slot for a hero. After that you'll need to scronge up their pay currency to add an empty space to recruit any heros (including ones you earn that will expire and disappear if you don't get an empty space! Not to mention you'll earn recruit tokens which allow you to get characters for free, but not the empty space for free. If you don't have an empty space, they are WORTHLESS.\n- Abilities and level ups. Character abilties are unlocked and leveled up after randomly earning comic book covers after missions. If you don't get the cover you need from a mission, you'll have to replay the SAME CONTENT to hope you earn it next time. And if you get 2 Hawkeye comics, but one is Classic Hawkeye and the other is Dark Avenger Hawkeye, those are two different characters and don't level up aside each other (not to mention they'll take up two character slots, which remember you're paying for!).\n\nFrom what I saw, you'll grind up the pay currency by playing the semi-PVP battles. Much like the Marvel Facebook game, you'll fight AI-controlled player teams to place on a leaderboard for the shot at rewards. This isn't as much PVP as it is PVE where someone in the world happened to choose that team. Since this game allows people to gain a lot of power by paying money, the top spaces in the leaderboards (read: where you need to be for prizes) will be filled with 'wallet warriors': people who have amazing teams simply because they paid money. If you want to play this game and fork out minimal to zero cash, expect frustration. There ARE prizes for simply playing the "PVP", but you will need to devote a LOT of time to get the good items.\n\nFor example, winning a PVP match earns about 20-30 'Shield Points'. To get the pay currency for free, to unlock all the good stuff in the game without paying real money, you'll need to rack up ~1000 Shield Points. Enjoy the grind!\n\nAll in all, the Puzzle Quest mechanics are still solid and the Marvel theme never disappoints, but it is a pay-to-win cashgrab unless you are a superfan of Puzzle Quest and don't mind the grind. In tempting players to fork out cash at every turn, Marvel Puzzle Quest undermines the fantasy of having a league of powerful superheros, which is really the core of the game. I don't recommend this game, but play the game for yourself if you are still curious after my review. It is free-to-play, afterall.","December 14, 2013","false","1.7"," 20 of 26 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","20","26","0","1"

I have played Puzzle Quest 1, own it on 360, steam, ds, and the iOS. I own Puzzle Quest 2, and Galactrix for the DS. And now I have played this game, on steam. So I know what the games are like, and what they have done.\n\nI have also played Geomancer, the match-3 game from Square-Enix, but I have not touched Candy crush, because that game has no depth beyond "HEY LOOK AT ME I GOT THIS SCORE AND MY E-PEEN IS HUGE", much like bejeweled. I like my RPG's, thanks.\n\nI don't mind the direction they took this game in, where they add in an active attack each match. Previously, you would only attack the enemy when you would match attack gems. Otherwise, the other gems were resources to power your abilites.\n\nBut where this gets confusing is when they do not make clear various aspects of the game, such as when the opponent goes. If you're attacking all the time, will your opponent just not get an attack, and just fill up their resource gems like in Geomancer? And what about attacking the enemy who has the strongest weapon? Will his ability get taken out, so that they can't use it? These are gameplay issues that should be addressed. When your user is CONFUSED on different aspects of your CORE gameplay in the beginning of the game, that doesn't bode well for them continuing to play it and 'experiment' to find out all the rules to the game.\n\nMicro-transactions are an okay model. I mean, after all, this IS a free game. I have not tested the viability of different heroes, nor the abilities that come with them, so I can't comment on how balanced it is. But based on what I have read in the other reviews, it seems that it's not looking too good. I would recommend doing research on it yourself.\n\nAll in all, I expected the game to be way better, but it's medocore at best. A new direction for Puzzle Quest, not necessarily good, but not really bad either. This game didn't catch my interest beyond the novel idea that Marvel and PQ came together, so I got bored of it quickly, once that novelty wore off.\n\nIn terms of Quality, I would rate the games like so:\n1) Puzzle Quest.\n2) Puzzle Quest 2.\n3) Geomancer / this game.\n4) Galactrix.","December 5, 2013","false","0.5"," 25 of 36 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","25","36","0","0"

Since I've been playing, they have done nothing but made it worse. Characters that were depended on to heal (and therefor increase your playtime) had that ability taken away. Other characters were weakened as well - beware if you depend on anyone to long, that person will be nerfed without warning! Additions such as "team ups" were added with obviously no testing put into them - everyone I read online and in my alliance pointed out horrible problems with them day one. This was yet another addition that removes health from your characters, in a blatent attempt to extort more money out of their userbase.\n\nDO NOT think this is a "free to play" game. It is not a "pay to win" game, it is a "pay to play" game. The developers have ignored user feedback and implemented changes that constantly make it more difficult to play any session longer than half an hour. God help you if you are in Europe (with horrible ending times) or here on Steam (where you can't play when the developers want you to).\n\nTo keep their older userbase they add the rarer characters every other week, but this means for the new user you'll have to pay cash up front for roster spots to have any chance to collect these.

PC gaming, while having microtransactions, has never really been a thing of concern, with a large amount of game options, many costing as much as some microtransactions, PC users have just been able to ignore them. Games which do promote microtransactions on PC have been either hit or miss, this does not exist on the Mobile Market.\n\nIn the mobile market it's more likely to find a game with microtransactions over non-microtransactions and this is mainly because of the target audience. People on mobile devices usually come from a lower common denominator, and as such their standards are as low my pants while sitting on the toilet. They're casual gamers who don't want to spend the time to play the games they play, and rather skip through them to get "the full experience". This allows for ludicrous microtransactions.\n\nOver here at the PC Master Race, we don't accept content that was designed to be played while you're trying to get clingers to fall into your toilet. The PC market has matured enough to know when we see exploitation, especially in the F2P space, and as such the flaws in this game become instantly realised as soon as the tutorial begins.\n\nIf for some reason you have a craving for some Marvel, I would actually still look elsewhere. The story is mediocre at best, lacks voice acting and there is no mention or Dormammu from what I can see.\n\nFun Fact – The word “microtransaction” was used 7 times in this mini review.","December 10, 2013","false","1.9"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","17","22","0","0"

It takes the formula of Puzzle Quest and improves on the combat and adds a lot of personality through the Marvel liscense!\nThat being said, what it comes down to ultimately, is a very cynical cash-grab.\nThe moneytization is tailor made to abuse the player in every way.\nLet me explain:\nThere are two kinds of currency:\nViolet Iso (regular)\nGold (premium)\nBoth can be bought with real cash.\nNow, both drop after successful missions. But only once! Every reward is locked after one drow. Afterwards, doing missions (which can take up to half an hour) only reward 20 Iso (to give a comparison: a booster pack costs 500 Iso). So, you have to do a mission 25 times to get enough Iso to buy a booster.\nNow, why not stick with the heroes you get and level them up?\nBecause the only way to level up heroes is by either spending premium currency directly OR getting more copies of the comics, the heroes originate from. And the latter can only be achieved by buying booster packs. Which only give a chance to obtain the right comic.\nFurthermore, there is only one rarity category that can be bought with Iso-currency. The lowest, of course. And while you do have a chance to get a rare card from this category, the game is very honest about the fact that your chance is slim.\nAnd don't forget that you need several copies of one comic to level your hero up.\nThis is a very blatant cash grab, made worse by the artwork. Yes, sadly, the artwork is very lackluster. The artist went for a semi-realistic style with dynamic posing. Sadly, the borders of different colours are very visible, which makes characters look unclean and bloaty and he had issues with contrasts and forshortening, making people look very strange and their clothes feel dodgy.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MaraKalat/recommended/234330/","MaraKalat","Mara","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MaraKalat/","1228 products in account","This should have been good.\nPuzzle Quest is a solid concept, Marvel has a huge stable of interesting characters spanning decades of comics.\nBut... this fails on both sides.\n\nMarvel side\nThe game is divided into chapters, each of them involves chasing after a new random villain. There is an overarching story about the Green Goblin being the leader of a new organization that replaces Shield which COULD have been interesting... but several chapters in that still hasn't gone anywhere and is more a convenient framing device to wheel various heroes and villains on and off stage.\nIn levels you're either picking your set of 3 heroes from your own stable or get backup from the fitting hero (e.g. Spiderman coming to your aid against Venom), but the selection of available heroes is limited in two ways.\nFirstly, you can have a total of FOUR heroes to start out and the only way to increase this limit is to spend premium premium hero tokens which are hard to acquire without paying money. It's reasonable that within a chapter or two you're up to six hero slots, maybe eight if you only buy the slots. This means you have a very limited roster of heroes at the ready to develop and to be called into action if you need to change up your tactics.\nThe other problem is that the character roster seems very limited. You get the obvious main characters from recent Marvel films , the big-name mutants, the fantastic four and some random villains from what seems to be mostly the Dark Avengers. Ooh, Squirrel Girl too, which gives it some bonus points. However, there are plenty of characters that did not make the cut. I haven't seen Rogue or Phoenix yet, for example. Did we really need five different Storm, Black Widow, Iron Man and Thor variants instead of a more diverse roster? Don't get me wrong, I LIKE that I can pick which Storm I like best (both her look and skillset, though it would have been even better to pick these separately...), I'd just wished that there had been a few more lesser known characters.\nCombined with the absolutely secondary and forgettable story it's just a total waste of the Marvel license.\n\nPuzzle Quest side\nAt least this side should be easy to get right, right? Puzzle Quest 'inspired' games are plentiful and it's clear by now what works in free to play titles and what doesn't... turns out it apparently wasn't that easy.\nThe very core of the Puzzle Quest gameplay is still there. You take turns manipulating a match-3 square board in an attempt to gather resources and defeat the enemy. Puzzle Quest was strictly a one versus one system, but in this game each side can consist of up to 3 characters.\nEach character has up to three skills, each tied to a colour on the board, and an attack value for each colour that determines the damage it does to the targeted enemy when making a match with it. Fortunately there is no need to switch an 'active character' or anything to maximize your damage. So if you brought Lady Thor and Gamora and match yellow tiles then the game just looks up which character would deal the most damage (in this case Thor) and have that character attack. Which character attacks based on the various colours is also indicated on the stones in case this is relevant for any of the active skills in the battle (which rarely happens).\nThis bit is solid. It suffers from some of the same randomness that plagues this type of game in almost every iteration, where the enemy just happens to luck into a huge combo that drops into place from the top of the screen as tiles get destroyed, but it's hard to fault this particular game for that.\nWhat it DOES do wrong is that there are way too many different colours on the board. There are SIX different colours of mana to gather and use for skills and a seventh block type with the team up tokens (that allow for one-shot special attacks that aren't as impressive as they sound). The original puzzle quest had 4 mana colours, damage tiles, experience tiles and coin tiles for a total of seven as well, so you'd think that'd be okay but it tends to fall flat. Going back to the Thor example (she was the rarest character I managed to get and is awesome), she has a cool skill that deals damage to the entire enemy team but it needs 12 yellow mana (or AP as the game calls it). The problem is that there are so many different colours that it's hard to specifically try to gather a single colour (or even two colours to focus on...). It seems more about just making matches than gathering specific mana types.\n\nThe above would be an okay if imperfect implementation of the puzzle quest side of things... but of course we have to remember that this is a free to play game, so there have to be things in place to limit what you can do so that you either grind for it cough up some money.\nProspective players will be happy to hear that there is no energy mechanic in this game... then immediately disappointed again when I explain that damage the heroes receive in a game is persistent and then needs time to heal (my Thor needed several hours after being knocked out). You can start games with injured heroes, but it obviously sets you at a disadvantage. Medkits can be used to instantly heal a hero (outside of battle), but they are in short supply. Beyond the 10 you start the game with I've found ONE from a one-time mission reward. Of course a solution is to just switch to other heroes until your preferred ones are healed, but as I mentioned above, you have very limited roster space available so the game really wants you to focus on single heroes.\n\nWhich brings me to the next big point, which is hero progression. Remember how in Puzzle Quest you got experience points from fights like in an RPG? Well, this isn't like that at all. Winning a game gets your heroes nothing, but you as the player receive some ISO-8, a mutation drug that might have a justification for being there in the later part of the plot, it's just sort of explained and then dropped entirely at the start. The idea is that you spend this ISO-8 to power up your heroes, and it's easy to see this as a communal experience point pool... except that it doesn't get filled very often.\nEvery mission you play gives you a few hundred ISO-8 for the first time you complete it and might also have another batch in its drop table of random one-time rewards, which means that the total amount of ISO-8 is LIMITED. Sure, you can buy more with real money or by selling off some of your spare heroes, but that kind of goes against the point.\n\nUsing ISO-8 to level up your hero increases its life and the damage dealt by matching specific tiles, but only up to the hero's current level cap. This limit can be extended 12 times by sacrificing a duplicate card, or almost duplicate anyway. You see, each of the heroes you receive or buy will only have one of its three skills randomly assigned to it. So Thor can either hit the enemy with his hammer, gather a storm cloud (spawning a bunch of yellow tiles on the field) or call the lightning down (using up that yellow AP the previous skill got you), but only ONE of those things until you find another copy of that hero.\nAnd before you get your hopes up, there are no places to farm this stuff. You'll be stuck spending ISO-8 or hero tokens (you know, those hard-limited currencies I was complaining about earlier?) to get a random hero. A duplicate hero that has a skill you already have unlocked can be used to develop that skill, making it more effective and sometimes making it do slightly more things (e.g. more tiles when gathering storm clouds). Upgrading skills can also be done directly with hero tokens, getting new skills can not. To have a 'perfect' character you'll need 3 cards with 3 different skill slots and a ton of money OR 13 cards, divided in groups of 3-5 over the 3 skills.\nWhich means that even if you pay, you'll need a ton of luck to get what you want which is just frustrating.\n\nBad mechanics, poor story.

Easily-accessible PvP and tournaments seemed like a nice idea, but you are expected to grind a lot of levels for your super heroes team before you can be competitive, instead of just trying and enjoying it.\n\nAlmost every additional feature requires you to pay money. Need more slots for heroes? Buy them. Need healing items? Better spend some money. Need to level up and get new skills? The fees are due! All of this can be paid with gold, which is the in-game currency, but you're gonna need a lot of it.\n\nCurrently the game is a glorified shadow of Puzzle Quest with some Marvel heroes and a rather silly plot.","December 5, 2013","false","0.6"," 19 of 28 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","19","28","0","0"

It proved to be very friendly to new players and experienced players alike. They added new stuff along the way with loads of events to keep ya in the game including ones for the newbies so they can have a chance to win big as well. It was once a most brilliant game which encouraged you to play more and also gave ya plenty room to encourage you to purchase some roster slots aside from getting plenty of free ones through missions or getting lucky at that gold draw or even towards your allliance slots for new members untill they started changing things...alot of things. first started with just a no health gain which started quite a bit of commotion and also drastically decreased the amount of time people put into the game from hours to mere minutes decreasing its overall popularity. It seemed like a small thing being nothing big was changed after that cept new heroes with downgraded abilities of their older selves that were far weaker. Apparently they didn't stop there to roll in the cash and decrease amount of players and customers to their list. They took it much farther and it gets worse with each update they make. They then started taking away heroes abilities then went along to replacing them with weaker and less effective abilities including replacing alot of other heroes abilities that did quite well, but not over powered, to something entirely new that did little to nothing now. After all the excessive deep changes were made they caused alot of players to play less or even quit. They then decided in order to hopefully lure more people back or new ones into the game they released Deadpool and a huge event that gave ya a chance to enjoy Deadpool and get one of your own which kinda worked for a time but didn't last for long. They downgraded alot of abilities some more on some heroes especially focusing on the starter ones which were strong enough to help new players along the way towards better ones. They keep compensating it with more chances at new heroes that they release from time to time but was it enough? Apparently not being now its hardly worth working towards when most can't afford to keep in the game long enough to get them unless you pay your heart out for the luck at the draw which is rare you get anything different or better unless its towards the better draws which cost round $40-$50+ to get a slightly better chance which has proven to make little difference which even the normal draws are quite pricey if you don't get free ones from every day rewards. Sadly the game was reduced to nothing but rubble and another facebook game as most referr to it now as and even now stands little to impress new and old players to try or continue playing much or at all. If your looking for a good experience look the other way cuz this game has long lost it and the magic it brought to games that made it wildly popular when it started making itself more at home. The game no longer revolves around skill but more along of power, money, and luck and has no tactics that works like it used to so sad to say I conclude this thorough review saying that I would no longer reccomend this game to anyone unless they insisted on something to kill just a little of their time.","September 17, 2014","false","601.0"," 16 of 24 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","16","24","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Minaro/recommended/234330/","Minaro","Minaro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Minaro/","280 products in account","A lot of people say this game is Pay to Win, but it's a bit misleading. Sure, if you're willing to drop trucktons of money into the game, you'll get access to stuff a lot faster than you would normally, but that holds true for nearly every single free to play game. I personally don't consider this a Pay to Win game.\nI'm writing this review to shed some light on this. To do so, I'll go into some further depth of how the resources and the game works. Beware, as there will be a lot of things I touch upon here. I'll leave a short summary at the bottom.\n\nYou have two main resources in this game - ISO-8 and Hero Points.\nISO-8 is primarily used to level up your characters and can be obtained easily and reguilarily, sometimes in very large quantities. Think of it as your common resource, you'll always need more and it is also the most available.\n\nHero Points are much less common. Hero Points are used for a number of things, and could be compared to a premium resource, if you will. It is used to increase the maximum amount of characters you can have at any given time aswell as purchasing new characters and their powers. Hero Points can also be used to purchase additional Health Packs and to Shield yourself in PvP Events (more on both later).\nIt is available in limited supply from story missions - often enough to get you started - but the main source of Hero Points tend to be from the events that happen regularily. Events work similiar to the main storyline missions and the main PvP, except they have a set time limit. After the time is up for any event, you will receive rewards based on your placements in the rankings - Rewards consist of a combination of specific Covers (unlocks characters or upgrades their powers), Booster packs (contains random Covers), Hero Points and ISO-8. Apart from the rewards you get for your ranking, there are also progression rewards in most events that reward you at set intervals with ISO-8, Hero Points, Covers or Boosters.\n\nNext I'll go into health packs. Normally as your characters take damage in battle, they will slowly regenerate that health back (real-time) when they are not in battle. If a character is downed (in-game definition of a character running out of health) in battle, they also need a certain amount of time to recover from that on top of the time to regenerate their health. However, you can use Health Packs to instantly revive and fully heal any character. Health Packs naturally regenerate up to a stock of 5, but you can purchase additional health packs for Hero Points. You are also relatively regularily awarded Health Packs from missions, daily rewards and progression rewards.\n\nNext up we have Shields. Normally in PvP Events, you lose/gain points in the event whenever you are attacked by another player. Shields can be purchased with Hero Points to protect you from point loss due to other players attacking you for a limited time - I do not know if it also disables points gains from defensive victories. Attacking any player while a shield is active will prematurely end the effect.\n\nLast but not least are combat boosts. These are regularily and randomly dropped after any kind of combat, as mission drops aswell as progression rewards and come in different flavors. They are generally simple, providing small bonuses to specific areas - more damage or starting AP for powers (AP is generated by matching colored tiles), though there are much larger bonuses available that are far more rare (+150% damage vs specific kinds of enemies). You can purchase more of these bonuses for ISO-8 (and possibly Hero Points, I do not know since I haven't used any rare boosts).\nPersonally I very rarely use boosts, I have only been using a few in some of the more difficult PvE battles, and they are by no means necessary to stay competetive.\n\nCovers are generally what you are ultimately after. They unlock the character in question when you obtain your first one and either unlocks or increases levels of their powers with further ones. They come in four rarities shown by stars, from 1-star covers to 4-star covers. They are obtained regularily, most commonly from Boosters which in turned are awarded as mission rewards, progress rewards, event prizes and a few other sources. Your covers determine the strength of your characters' powers, but most importantly determine the maximum level you can level your character up to. The maximum level possible for a character is based on their rarity and actually leveling up characters uses ISO-8.\nBoosters will give you a random cover, with a minimum rarity based on what kind of booster it is. There are two generic boosters that can give you pretty much any character in the game, but there are regularily "specialized" boosters available during events that contain one cover randomly chosen from a specific poll of characters, usually characters involved or powered up during the event. You can also purchase additional boosters in the in-game store for ISO-8 (only the basic booster) or Hero Points.\nEvents prizes and progress rewards will often grant you specific character covers. Event prizes tend to be covers ranging from 2- to 4-star covers, depending on your final rank (along with Hero Points and ISO-8), while progress rewards can reward you with anything from 1- to 4-star covers  (though 4-star cover progression rewards are usually practically impossible to reach within the timeframe of an event).\n\n\nIn short, these resources are all either awarded regularily no matter what area of the game you play (Health Packs, Boosts and ISO-8) or regularily as rewards in event prizes and progression (Hero Points, ISO-8, Covers, Boosts and Boosters). The only exceptions are Shields, but they are not much of a resource to begin with.\n\nI have spent a lot of time on this game, and while I have paid some money to get more Hero Points (I regularily support Free to Play games that I like), I spent most of it up until now playing for free. From my own experience I can honestly tell you that you can easily stay competetive in the event rankings as a free player, provided you know what you're doing and are willing to sink some time into that particular event. Even with little effort you can generally get a decent ranking (enough for a 2-star cover, a 2-star booster) aswell as a reasonable amount of progression rewards. You never *need* Shields in PvP events to get a good placement, it just makes it easier.\nYou'll gradually get stronger as you play. At first you'll be using mainly 1-star covers, and as you gradually unlock 2-star covers you'll be switching over to mainly using them. In time you'll have enough 3-star covers to get them up to the level they need to be in order to be useful. 4-star covers are far more rare and are generally reserved as first place prizes for events and can also very rarely be obtained from boosters (I have one cover for each of the two existing 4-star characters, both obtained through boosters), but they shouldn't be your immediate goal to begin with.\n\n\nSummary\nIn short, the bottom line is that this is a progression game where you'll gradually unlock new characters and level them up to be even stronger. Nothing a paying player can accomplish is unaccomplishable by any free player, a paying player can just get there faster and/or easier, which from my experience describes nearly all free to play games currently out there. I can say this though, it is a LONG progression you walk. You cannot expect to take the top spots in event rankings when you're fresh into the game, but eventually you'll be competing with the best.\n\nFinally, I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone. There is no doubt in my mind that this game will not appeal to most people, but if you seem to enjoy the premise of this game after giving it a try and can imagine spending a lot of time in it, it can be very enjoyable. Simply, I would very much recommend this game to the right people.","February 15, 2014","false","902.9"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","2"

Microtransactions.\n\nThe game's mechanics of a match-3 to initiate fights is far from new anymore - but its complicated by the need to "heal" injured combatants either by waiting or buying health packs.\n\nThat's the first clue.\n\nThe next is leveling up the characters. You do gain some of the upgrade materials and items from missions, certain ones earned at certain stages - but to make your team strong you need to further upgrade the skills, then upgrade the character, and repeat. There is a relative cap, but the distance from what the free to play model gives you and the time it would take to get there is absurd compared to just paying for it. It scales up the higher you go. Pay for more to get less and so on.\n\nHence the microtransactions. Lots and lots of microtransactions.\n\nI wouldn't have an issue if it was possible to gain a decent team of your favorite heroes easily, just to enjoy the story, or possible to upgrade them relatively well without spending a fortune... but this game takes it to a whole new level.\n\nBe wary, this is a Pay to Win game, and boy you could pay in spades with the level of microtransactions here.\n\nPlayers beware. The lure to pay to win here is way too much for it to be worth it.\n\nOther than that, its a standard Marvel-oriented game following the mainstream stories on their own minor twist with the ISO-8 junk I first saw years ago with the Facebook varaint. The story is alright, the game itself is okay. The over-abundance of microtransactions to make you pay a fortune is not really making this game worth it.","August 18, 2015","false","1.7"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

(read near the bottom of the review for info on them)\n\nIf you have been reading negative reviews in regards to P2W (pay 2 win) then they are biased. This game is free but real fans will spend money on it because they want to collect as many characters as they can and level them up fully. If you don't put effort into this game then you won't get too far and you will be discouraged. It takes patience and time to get anywhere. For fans and people who enjoy this type of build up with RPG elements this game is great! It gives you something to check everyday and play for a short while.\n\nAny fan of the Marvel Universe should get this game, especially since it is free. Players who pay will have an advantage in the sense that they can level up their character cards faster and buy more slots to recruit new characters, but once you get a bit further you can compete in daily competitions/leaderboards to win new characters and powers, crystals for levelling and gold coins for buying new character cards and extra slots.\n\npros - A good chillin game, just need a mouse\n- Made for fans of Marvel (obviously) and matching puzzle games with RPG elements\n- Lots of super heroes and villians to collect ranging from one star* to four stars**** and now      with the new update new five star***** characters are available that can be levelled up to 450!\n- A lot of strategy is required if you want to win difficult matches against higher level enemies.\n- Collectable/usable power-ups and character power cards (usable once in a battle)!\n- You can join or create an alliance and there are competition and leaderboards for your crew to compete in for prizes like new character cards, coins, crystal and 2-3 star cards from either the vault which is a random card generator that you stop yourself or a hero card that gives u a random 2-4 star character.\n- Light on the PC\n- Developers are active always updating the game, adding new characters periodically and creating new competitions and battles daily.\n\ncons - Addictive\n- If you are color blind you might want to avoid this game\n- Random character card received when purchasing new cards\n- You will get many doubles which you can sell...but it can get annoying.\n\nBack to pros\n- UPDATE! - You can now max out your character level and pay an extra amount of crystal to make the maxed out character a legend. This allows you to use extra cards (that before would be useless and sold for crystal) to continue leveling up your character. One level per character card. Every level gives you a reward as well. like Command points, crystals, other character cards and coins.\n- Command points are used to obtain **** 4 and ***** 5 star character cards. 20 for classic and 25 for modern. These command points are also used for upgrading characters if one can never find the one card they need for one of their characters.\n\nOverall score: 8.0/10\nChance of becoming an addict (playing it daily) score: 7.0/10","July 8, 2015","true","455.2"," 20 of 32 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","20","32","3","0"

I wanted to try and fix this. If you look at the reviews for this game you will see hundreds of people saying "pay to win; don't play." This is what angers me, the game is actually pretty generous to free players. These bogus reviews are from people who launch the game, see the possibility for microtransactions, and post a bad review purely on that.\n\nI've been playing this game since its steam release and have never spent a cent. My first two days playing I was able to place in the top ten of a pvp event. Since then I've competed in many events and have never come away without atleast one 3-star or better.\n\nI was also able to complete the story within 2 week of downloading the game. It is true that the story rewards and pvp rewards are rather limited, but the amazing rewards for events make up for them.\n\nAlso for those who thought about the "pay to win strategy," you are wasting your money. It's HARD to get a significant advantage from paying! The amount of money each upgrade costs would require hundreds of dollars to be spent to make a significant difference. About $10 to level up a skill even though you can get the cover to do so by doing events for free.\n\nIn summary the microtransaction option makes the game daunting to free to play people but if you are willing to put just a little time into the game(2-4 hours a day), you can do better than most paying players within a week. So please take it from someone who plays a lot of free to play games and has never spent a cent on any of them, this is one of the most generous free games you will ever find. Try it before you complain about microtransactions.\n\n\nUpdate: Marvel Puzzle Quest has changed a lot since I wrote this review. Mostly for the worse. While I do still enjoy playing the game it is largely because I already had a decent force before a lot of the changes were made. The company repeatedly ignores their fan base and makes changes that make the game increasingly hard to play without paying and really expensive if you do pay. I'm going to list the notable changes since this review was originally posted.\n\nThe Good:\n1. The ever increasing roster size keeps collecting covers interesting and gives reason to come back to the game.\n2. PvP seasons: The company recently introduced PvP seasons. These are month long event that keep track of players as they partake in PvP events. The top rated players get fantastic rewards.\n\nThe Bad:\n1. Shields: In Marvel Puzzle Quest PvP events run on a points system. At first glance it is simple and  fair. In fact it used to be fair but shields have all but ruined the accessability. For every round you win you gain points. If you lose a round you lose points. This is fine. Being that PvP is actually Player vs. AI player people must be able to challenge computer versions of other players. When a computer version of yourself wins or loses you also gain/lose points according. This has always been annoying but for the most part fair. However, shields allow a player to spend a decent sum of money in order to protect themselves from point loss. In otherwords free players quickly lose points from their AI losing but they can't make those who pay lose any points. This makes it very hard for free players especially when first starting off.\n2.Gold Characters: Gold characters are enhanced versions of other characters. This essentially means the developers got lazy and wanted to release a new character but didn't feel like designing new character powers. While that alone is annoying it is tolerable. What isn't tolerable is taking a character and nerfing him because he is "overpowered" and then release a stronger version of the character right after. For anyone who joined late and doesn't know this is exactly what they did with Thor.\n3. Boost Changes: Boosts were an easy way to allow free players to stand a fighting chance. A player could buy boosts with Iso(in game currency) in order to assist a strategy using what are otherwise weak characters. However, boosts have changed so that in order to buy the useful ones you must spend hero points(premium currency).\n4. Healing Changes: In Marvel Puzzle Quest you have always needed to wait for your characters to heal after battle. How long you have to wait varies depending on character level. You have also always been able to pay in order to heal instantly. While this has always given paying members an advantage, it wasn't outrageous because within a couple hours your characters would heal. However, the company has recently made it take longer for heroes to heal making the game even harder to play for free.\n\nThe Ugly:\n1. Pay to Enter Tournaments: These are occasional tournaments that have an entry fee. The prizes to be won in said tournaments are outstanding. The winner gets one of every cover in the game. While I like the idea of large tournaments that have a little risk to them I don't like how these particular tournaments are set up. I'm fine with an entry fee but the fee should be in iso. I personally think there should be an entry fee somewhere along the lines of 5000-10000 iso. This is a decent amount of currency so there is a big risk for the players but it is entirely in-game currency so it is accessable to everyone if they are willing to save up for a while. Unfortunately the tournament entry fee is in hero points, so it once again favors those who pay fairly significantly.\n2. Alliances: Alliances, are this games version of a clan. All events have alliance rankings in addition to individual rankings. All members of the top ranked alliances get prizes. Alliances had the potential to be a great addition to the game. having a community to play with and talk to as well as getting additional prizes for doing so is fantastic. Where the game went wrong is in Alliance sizes. An Alliance starts with 5 player slots. However, the alliance leader has the option to buy additional slots up to 20. Of course to buy these slots you have to spend Hero points. So only the alliances who pay ever win events because they have a larger player base. Adding an additional slot to a guild isn't cheap either; additional slot cost as much expanding you roster size post 20 heroes.\n\nSo would I recommend this game now? Maybe, it is really hard to say at this moment due to the fact that I started out so early. I do believe it is possible to do decently well while being a free player but I am rather biased because I already had a large army. Furthermore, at the rate which D3/Demiurge are ruining the game within a month it will likely be totally inaccessable to any new free players and possibly even veteran free players.","December 30, 2013","true","217.1"," 66 of 119 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","66","119","0","12"

I'd say 500 hours is much closer to reality.\n\nHere is what you need to know about the game. It is a 3vs3 match where you bring a team of heroes/villains and try to win by making use of their abilities. You use them by spending the required resources (AP) which you get when you match tiles. The characters are divided in 4 tiers (1* - 4*) with only the 3* and very few of the 2* being useful at the moment. Most characters have 3 abilities, but there are some with only 2 because the developers have left them incomplete for months. The abilities can gain levels by buying or winning covers. The stats of the characters and the effectiveness of their abilities are increased as you level them with the use of ISO-8, an in-game currency used solely for leveling characters and buying boosts you can use in matches. The second currency is called HP (Hero Points) and is used to increase the size of your roster and to level abilities without the use of covers.\n\nThe good: Fast game / doesn't require too much thinking which makes it ideal for short gaming bursts / you get to use your favorite heroes / very simple rules.\n\nThe bad: Several incomplete characters with no plan to finish them in the near future / a turn from F2P to P2P since March 2014 / Inconvenient event end times for Europeans / success depends heavily on playing close the end of an event / several exploits are reported which allow cheaters to roam free in the game / market prices for in-game currency are the worst I have seen in a game.\n\nAdvices:\n1. Use HP only to buy roster slots. At least until you have 30-35 slots. Never buy tokens (they give random covers). The % to get a specific 3* hero is less than 1% in most cases. You have better results if you level the abilities directly with HP.\n2. Never use ISO-8 to buy 1* tokens. You will need it to level your heroes and it will always, ALWAYS be in short supply.\n3. Always take part in Lightning Rounds since they are the most efficient source of ISO. Try to get to 100 points.\n4. Don't max a 3* hero unless you have a diverse roster with at least 3-4 more heroes with levels 85+. When you do, the levels of the teams you fight will also increase a lot.\n\nEpilogue: I will not tell how to spend your money, but you have to know that the game has made a turn into a more P2P model after March 2014. The changes in late June change how healing works in the game and restricts your ability to play since there is practically no way to heal heroes unless they have an innate regeneration ability. Heroes heal over time, but with most of them taking 2-4 hours to fully heal. healing packs are your only alternative and they cost HP which is relatively rare. The market prices are ridiculously unreasonable. To fully level a 3* hero you will need ~170k ISO which costs ~$300. The game is quite addictive so be warned. I would advice against letting young children play with it. I bet they can find better things to do and you should encourage them to spend their time doing something more creative. So do I recommend this game? After the changes in the last 2-3 months, I do not.","June 25, 2014","false","320.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Hero points are the real money to game currency that is required for everything from character space, leveling up your powers, entry into some game events, character boosts for individual battles, and having a better chance at new characters above a one star rating.\n\nCore game is great if you enjoyed Puzzle Quests games in the past. Enjoyment of the core game, however, will not overcome how terrible the dev team is for this game. In addition to microtransaction hell, content is frequently untested/broken. Characters are nerfed without warning and are almost never buffed. No refunds are given to your Hero Points/Iso-8 costs. You must sell them at a 50% loss or deal with it.   New content buffs NPCs to over level 200 which makes taking them down near impossible without purchasing major boosts to up your team's damage and action points.  I will also note that most of your team fully maxed out will have a level cap significantly under 200 unless you're willing to splurge tons of real cash on acquiring four star characters.\n\nTheir dev teams also publically taunt their players and customers in their forums.

Content, in the form of characters to burn resources chasing, is continually expanding, while new story content or gameplay expansion remian few and far between. It's extremely repetitive and grindy.\n\nThis game launched in an anemic and hilariously unbalanced form, and has come a long way in 2 years. It's growing and being proted to consoles. Great.\n\nIt does still have a fun tightknit community that can be accessed via the dev's forum. That's the best thing about the game, the other people playing it, not the game itself. Hmmm.\n\nIt is probably the prettiest match-3 game around .... that isn't saying much. The game mechanics, after 2 years of bolt-ons, are held together by baling wire. Unintended results abound and are discovered the hard way by players.\n\nPlay it casually for awhile and then move on. God help you if you allow it to become a habit. (See those hours logged? There but for the grace of the gods go you.)\n\nThe worst is the dev's inept attempts at communication. Spectacularly bad. Here is a great example ...\n\nThis week is the game's 2-year anniversary. It centers on a new event, a battle against Galactus. The blance of the event is laughably out of whack; the ONLY way to win is to make use of exploits (which the inept developer failed to catch ...). Other events running concurrently are suffering from various bugs, and the anniversary rewards have been found to be WORSE than the normal in-game rewards (Happy anniversary!)\n\nAfter the event runs for a day, and the online community is thoroughly hacked off, the producer posts the below. Judge it for yourself.\n_____________________\nHey all,\n\nWanted to share a few things about how Galactus works and what we're expecting versus what we're seeing.\n\nTo start, it seems like a lot of people are on a basic disconnect here, looking at the boss battle similar to how Ultron ran in terms of how things work. Meaning that Ultron should be going down pretty regularly. He's powerful, but his real power lies in the fact that killing his body doesn't stop him. You need to crush every one of his drones and main bodies to win. So winning rounds is a pretty regular occurrence. Game-wise, what this means is that players won fairly easily against Ultron and took their lumps against the drones. The stopping timer there was health packs based on when the drones finally wore you down. What this also meant is that the higher end Alliances would chew through the entire Event in about 12 hours and let it kinda sit for 3 days.\n\nGalactus is different. The "minion" fights against the villains are relatively simple. They're there as minor hazards but relatively easily winnable. Galactus on the other hand is a massive threat. He's not going to be stopped by gnats. Iron Fist punching him in the toe isn't very painful. So he gets bored and swats them away. In game terms, this means that players are going to be beaten. Winning a round against Galactus is an achievement. You're supposed to lose. Every time you do, you're still chipping away at his life. It's an exercise in damage in aggregate. Over the 3.5 days, hitting him over and over to finally bring down the big bad is somewhat slow, but certainly effective.\n\nOverall, most of the higher end Alliances are in Round 6 or knocking on the door to Round 7. Which is actually slightly faster than we were expecting people to get just based on the math. So everyone's doing pretty darned well in terms of progression. There are some teams rockin' the Winfinite, other teams that are pushing through with some interesting strategies (who woulda thought OBW would be a rock star against Galactus?). Not many Alliances are getting anywhere near full clears. Which is actually intended. You're supposed to lose your Health Packs on Galactus, rather than against the minions like on Ultron. It's also why we changed up the play method for this round too so that it's not just a flip flop between Ultron and minions till you win. There's a set number of times you can hit Galactus before you need to take a break to let minions refresh. That break means that you have plenty of times for Galactus drained Packs to refresh while you can go in and get some Black Vortex in. Or play Simulator (up soon). Or get your Devil Dino on when that starts up. It's a different design than the rush of Ultron where that was pretty much all players did while it was open.\n\nLong story short, you all are doing really well against Galactus. Yes, the gameplay is different. I'm sure most of you aren't used to going into a battle with the idea that you may well lose. But given that you're still pulling out wins with pretty strong regularity, I don't see any reason this wouldn't continue into Rounds 7 and 8, and on to Cyclops awesomeness.\n\nAt the outset, going into the boss battle, you're looking at winning like normal. After all, it works elsewhere in the game, and it worked against Ultron. So suddenly getting rocked by Galactus is a shock. Keep at it. If things are really going to go poorly, we'll look at doing refresh timer changes and the like that we can do server-side as a quicker band aid style fix for run 1. After that, we'll figure out what we want to do for difficulty on run 2 (and any other runs that we do in the future, of course).","October 10, 2015","false","282.4"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","64","14","22","5","1"

Before people who didn't spent any or just some money for slots etc. had a fighting chance. And even more importantly, they had some time to enjoy the game. Now they nerfed healing, so most Characters with healing skills get their healing only temporarily. Before, you could play 1-2 hours w/o a problem w/o having to use so called health packs.\n\nNow, w/o proper healing, after you used your 5 free healthpacks per day, which can easily happen after 2-3 games, as EACH hero (you can use 3 heroes at a time) needs to get healed with one pack. So after 3 games (maybe 10 minutes) you can easily run out of health packs and that was it for the day as it takes hours for the healthpacks to replenish. Most people won't have the time play for 10-20 minutes every 5 or so hours, because they work and basically have a life.\n\nIf you wanted, like I did before, enjoy an hour or the occasional 2 hours on the couch, playing Dark Reign, you are now out of luck. After 30 minutes tops you run out of health packs and heroes to play. And guess how you only (reliably) get them back? Right, by purchasing them with real money. You can't even use the "normal" in-game currency.\n\nTo level one hero to 50ish (of over 200 levels) costs about 90 € (NINETY), if you do this with currency from the real-money in-game shop.\n\nThe most infuriating part is, that the devs think us stupid and lie to people, claiming the new system would save them time, because playing a 5 Minute game every few games to heal your heroes to full is much longer than waiting 5+ hours .\n\nTL;DR, it's a predatory business model aimed at addicted players who need to continue playing after they ran out of health packs.

Don't look at "free to play". You MUST buy health packs with real money to stay online and score any meaningful rank now. What was advertised as "roster diversty" actually shrinked diverse combination of teams to pretty much two choices: two tanks that everybody would ignore because they take too much time or two heavy-hitters that will either destroy or severely damage your team, so you'll be afraid because you can no longer heal. Healers simply disappeared from any team serious about winning.\n\nAuthors also enjoy political censure. Colossus initially had hammer and sickle as his symbol - in line with his lore, art and pretty much every other Marvel game, including desktop games. Yet it was quickly removed as some nazi-pride clown complained about it.\n\nIf you're interested in lore, you also forced to play obsessively or pay up, because that's the only way you will have "essential" character - i.e. character required to even start some battles and witness their dialogue. Those are usually top tier prizes from previous event. If you missed your first chance - too bad to be you. Next time this event is run, nodes will probably will have another requirement and original character dialogue will be completely removed, which happened on 2nd Sentry event run, where all the dialogue showing Daken as obidient Osborn's guard dog in charge of internal security was edited out.

The fact that it takes over 1 hour to heal over 1000hp is garbage, though.

So you can pay to heal.  You can pay to level up.  You can pay to level your skills up.  You have to pay to expand your roster.  You [essentially] have to pay if you don't want to run the Venom level after every game.  You have to pay if you want to level up.

The algorithm they use not only identifies the chosen characters in order to set tiles on the board but also identifies how many of which tiles are on the board before selecting which tiles to drop after a match. Watching which tiles drop a few times lets you quickly begin to predict which tiles are likely to drop next. Being able to predict should help your strategies but, as you quickly learn, it does not.\n\nEquivalently to this problem, you are forced to play on the developers terms:\n\nYou must endlessly grind the same match to get 1/4 rewards.\n\nYou must begin a fight just to view inventory of boosts AND you must manually de-select the boosts from a previous fight.\n\nWhen you gain hero tokens you must decide whether to open the token (for an incredibly rare chance to gain something you actually want) or keep the unopened token indefinitely. Once you open the token you must then choose whether to sell the hero for ISO, swap the hero for another hero already on your roster (if you don't have enough Hero Points to open a slot for them), or let the hero expire and receive nothing.\n\nOn mobile devices, you're forced to endure 100+MB updates every other week. Which brings up another crucial point: almost every update adds a new character. Pretty cool, right? Keeps things dynamic by adding fresh meat. Well, aside from EVERY update causing new bugs (oh, crashes cause an infuriating problem I'll get to next), at the beginning, the first 4 slots to add new characters to your roster are free. However, as you keep adding characters, the cost of the slots keep going up. Here's what they cost after the first 4:\n\nRoster Slot        Hero Pts                5        25                10        200                24        300                29        400                37        500                45        600                53        700                61        800                69        900                77+        1000\nIt's like the devs punish you for collecting a full roster. How does this make any sense? Meanwhile, if you're enough of a sucker to throw hundreds of dollars at these developers, you must still be able to work ... uhh play(?) on the game's schedule just to compete with anyone for the rewards you want... but if you've got that kind of time & money to throw at one single fremium game, what rewards do you need that you couldn't buy outright? Oh, that's right--you can't. There are only 2 things you can definitively buy (which are both outrageously priced): ISO and Hero Points.\n\nGame Crashes: Many poorly programmed games are prone to crashes and this one is no exception but D3 adds some twists to this back-alley gut-stabbing. The game may randomly crash while you are in the middle of a match and that's not the worst part. When the crash occurs, the game treats your sudden exit as if you have chosen to retreat which damages your team! Forget that retreat damage is asinine to begin with but now devs add 'injury' to insult by doing nothing about game crash damage. Want to re-initiate the game and try to replay the match with your ideally chosen team? Tough luck! They're either dead or half dead!\n\nThere is a whole other side of this 'game' which allows players to 'fight' each other (you only play against A.I. on any part of the game) that I won't go into. I've played it only enough to realize how utterly futile it is.

If you want to reliably upgrade the abilities of characters you do have, you have to purchase the upgrades. If you want to level up those characters without a crazy grind, you have to pay. If you want more character slots, you have to pay. If your characters take too much damage and you want to keep on playing, you have to pay for a heal. If you want to compete in PVP you have to pay for boosts.\n\nSure, *some* of those things you can grind for, but the results are often unpredictable. For example instead of an upgrade to an existing character you might get a new character cover. But if you don't have enough character slots you have to buy more. You can try to grind for enough currency to unlock more slots (prices for new slots increase depending on how many you already have), but you have a time limit on your covers, so if you can't unlock a new slot fast enough, the new character you earned just disappears. This is a deliberate time pressure to try to get you to just buy the slot.\n\nYou spend a bunch of time and currency investing in a character just to find out he has a level cap because he is a lower-tier character, and if you actually want to progress in the game you need higher tier characters. You can try and grind for the (exceedingly rare) chance to get a rare cover to drop, or you can spend money to get one as a sure thing. Again, the game is trying to pressure you into buying ♥♥♥♥.\n\nYou can try to unlock more rewards by competing in PVP and PVE events, but as soon as you get anywhere near the top bracket you'll find it is impossible to progress and get the real rewards without paying money because the other people at the top are paying for heals and boosts so if you aren't doing the same you can't possibly compete with them, so even the "free" rewards are effectively locked behind a paywall.\n\nThere is absolutely no skill involved in this game, it's all about how much money you are willing to spend. It's probably the most disgusting example of pay to win mechanics and "gambling" hooks in something purporting to be a video game I have ever seen.","April 11","false","357.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

That is not correct at all, it helps of course to buy some coins in the start, but you don`t have to since you will win ingame money by playing the game so you can open more slots for more heroes/villains. I have played this game for over 1 year now, almost every day, and I have used money on it as well, but I think it is worth to spend some money on a free game since that also encourage the developer to work more on the game, so I don`t have a problem spending money on a "free" game. As one other reviewer wrote, if you let the game make you become addicted, you will become addicted. This is so true, I really can`t go one day without playing it, but that is what makes a great game I think.\n\nBut I also understand that this is not a game for everyone, you have to like these kind of puzzle games and you probably should also be a comic/marvel geek. Its great to learn a lot about the characters and you know who will be the new hero when a new hero film is in the horizon.

I know that eventually I will come to point in the game where the progress slows down and I have to decide whether to commit my time or my money. I do not expect every f2p game to be PoE or DOTA2. But the thing that disappointed me with this game was how soon I got to that point.\n\nIn my experience these sorts of free to play games, the good ones, tend to be pretty fast paced at first to get you hooked and learn the ropes. Then as the pace of progression gradually slows down you can start to really appreciate and understand what you can accomplish long term, either through play or through paying. But Marvel Puzzle quest sort of just gives you one semi-fast prologue chapter and then says "now we grind".\n\nI haven't even beaten the second prologue chapter yet and my best character (Iron-man) takes over an hour in real time to heal up to full health if he’s downed. The battles even against normal goons take a long time now. Even if the battle isn't hard they usually damage my heroes so much that I can't use them for a good while. And the reward for beating them are sometimes just these consumable boosts that do not progress your characters in any way which makes it feel like you won nothing for such a long battle.\n\nMy most dominating thought is "if it's this grindy in the prologue how bad will it be when I actually get to play the main PVE/PVP modes?" I don't know, maybe it's admirable how upfront this game is about what it is (i.e. a typical f2p game) but it's a huge turnoff for me and I guess for others as well.\nI see the potential in this game, it has some pretty cool ideas and the Puzzle Quest match 3 battles are fun, but it got grindy way to fast. I enjoyed the previous puzzle quest games and hoped this could become my new "play a quick session every once in a while game". But it gives such a bad early impression that I’m pretty much done with the game, which is a shame honestly.","March 13","false","9.6"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","1"

But I've spent money because I wanted to support it, I absolutely love match-3 puzzle games, and MPQ began very strong. I expected to get more out of my real money and time invested. But in the end, the microtransactions carry some of the most ludicrous price tags I've ever seen. Especially once you realize how shafted you are. If you max out a hero's level capacity (Each hero has a maximum level directly proportional to its rarity) you can spend ISO (a f2p resource earned from playing) to level them once the right number of 'covers' (item drops that level up 1 of 3 abilities a hero has) has been obtained.\n\nThe developers are just NOT providing the level of return investment quality in their microtransactions. And they know it. You have to spend a STAGGERING amount of money or a nigh-impossible amount of game time to acquire competitive max-level high rarity heroes. Look at my total time played. I legitimately have 3 maxed out uncommon heroes and a handful of level 15-50 uncommon and rares. When I look at the amount of hours invested, I'm not upset. It's a great distraction at my relatively low-demanding job, but at the same time, I don't feel the devs have spent nearly as much time developing meaningful addons, GRAPHICAL IMPROVEMENTS (ffs this game is a goldmine) or a truly diverse lineup of Marvel originals.\n\nAll in all, give it a try if you like puzzle games, but honestly, there are more rewarding ones out there.

Not for the Marvel part, but instead due to the deserved respect and love that Puzzle Quest received for successfully creating a hybrid RPG/Bejeweled-style match-three game. Marvel Puzzle Quest has taken the idea of a puzzle game with with a strategic/role-playing element overlay, and turned it into an intricately crafted, remarkably deep experience.\n\nIn Marvel Puzzle Quest, you control three superheroes who fight against up to three other supervillains/heroes (or goons, in some of the plot missions). When matched, the six colors of gems on the board grant energy that can be used for special moves, like purple matches helping Hawkeye use “Take Aim,” a skill that ensures a critical hit. Every match also serves as an attack, but the amount of damage depends on individual characters' affinity with the color – which also gives combo attacks a nice superhero fight feel to them, where Iron Man lands a punch and then Black Widow jumps in. Meanwhile, skills that offer buffs to defense/strength, or do damage over time, manifest as changes to tiles on the board, which can be matched and eliminated. Thus, the board becomes amazingly tactical – there are up to half a dozen potential considerations beyond “best match” at any given point.\n\nUnfortunately the game ended up being a pay to win game with overpriced micro-transactions.\n","July 19, 2014","false","20.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/infindima/recommended/234330/","infindima","A. Yeager","http://steamcommunity.com/id/infindima/","680 products in account","Three months ago when I started this game, I loved playing it. I truly enjoy three-match puzzles and this also introduced me better to the Marvel universe. There are regular events with witty dialogue and the more I played, the more I felt rewarded.\n\nThen I had two characters leveled to 85 (the current max level at the time for Thor and Storm) and that's when hell was unleashed. Oh dear.\n\nEven though there is PVP in the game, you never play against an actual person. Instead their three characters are controlled by the computer. And since the computer is dreadful at this game, the only way the computer can win is by having victory magically handed to them. Every single day I see the exact same cheating tactics and that is what makes me angry about the gameplay. The opponents gets everything they need for their abilities magically apearing on the top row, they get deadly cascades of nodes dropping endlessly and I have seen them clear one row only to have it replaced completely with nodes of a color they need.\n\nI finally had enough of this game. I don't enjoy playing a game where victory is handed to the opponent, when there obviously was no nodes to ensure their victory when I ended my turn.\n\n2015 update\nOne year after writing the review originally, I decided to see if things have changed for the better. Some things are better, while others have the exact problems as last year.\n\nImprovements- Many new heroes. Easier to collect some heroes that were concidered "rare" last time I was playing.\n- Updated abilities for older characters, making some of them better to use.\n- City nodes are replaced with team-up nodes. You have three team up cards (which can be given to you by your alliance and found randomly) that can be used with team up points. These are far better than the city nodes and have actually helped me win some games.\n- A daily quest which gives you a chance to get rare heroes or plenty of resources.\n\nThings that still are flawed\nOpponents still cheats horribly. Anytime I try to play anything that isn't 50 levels below me, the cheating AI will kill my team with no effort. They get cascades (nodes endlessly falling and matching), you move one node and they get a perfect 4 or 5 on their next turn and they color starve you, to force you to play "bad" while they get what they need through the toprow.\nAnytime you loose, the game gives you horrible advice how to win. Let's analyze why this doesn't work anymore:\n\nPut down protection nodes to decrease incoming damage.\nReality: The AI's will clear your nodes within a few turns. The first time I put down Invisible Womans bubble that shields a character from all damage, it was cleared instantly by the computer getting a cascade.\n\nKeep your weakest characters in the back to shield them from damage.\nReality: The game deliberately forces you to only move certain nodes, which forces your weakest characters to the front.\n\nKill the strongest opponent first\nReality: You have to kill whichever character has a cascading ability or the least amount of point to charge their ability. One of the most difficult opponents in the game is Juggernaut, because he combines both of these. His 2 abilities cost very little (6 points). One cascades, the other deals a little damage to himself and a lot to you. So he cascades, deals damage to you, cascades, deal damage to you. The sad thing is? Juggernaut is one of the weakest characters you can recruit on your team, being only a 1 star character. But for AI events, he is buffed up and kills you easily.\n\nPrevent the enemy from collecting colors their need.\nReality: Either the AI are teamed up with another AI that gives them free points or they simply cascades and get the points they need from the toprow.\n\nCollect colors you need for your strongest abilities\nReality: The game forces you to only move certain nodes. Whenever 2-star Storm is on my team, I only need 11 blue nodes to charge her ability. There is very rarely a single blue node when she is on my team. Most of the time, you are only allowed to collect pink nodes, which is one of the weakest colors in the game. And then watch the AI get the colors they needed through the toprow.\n\nOther problems with gameplay\n- Enemy AI usually have few colors to collect, which makes it easy for them to make a lot of damage in little time. Ninjas and thugs usually have abilities that cost 4 mana, they get free mana because they aren't allowed to move nodes and the countdowns are just 2-3 times long. Unless you are really lucky, it's very difficult to clear those nodes in time. Because you rarely have anything to match them with.\n- The "match node helper" will regularly point out a bad move while ignoring a 4-5 match.\n- Because cascades happen so regularly, you need to waste health packs often. You never know if your character will survive with only half of their life.\n\nConclusionThere's no strategy in this game. You win if you are lucky. Even though technically my characters are 50 levels above the other team and should massacre them.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pogobeta/recommended/234330/","pogobeta","Pogo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pogobeta/","467 products in account","A beautifully-crafted example of how to ruin a promising game with F2P baggage.\n\n[review rewritten to explain more features instead of focusing solely on IAP complaints]\n\nHere's the thing: MPQ is one of the (if not THE) best/most interesting match-3 games around. I've been a big fan of Puzzle Quest since the first game. The novelty of taking match-3 and building a battle system around it has never lost its appeal to me. MPQ takes that formula and makes it team-based, adding considerably more depth than the classic 1v1. If you happen to be interested in the Marvel universe, then there's some bonus appeal.\n\nPuzzle Quest (and by extension MPQ) is different from the majority of the other match-3 games on the market. In a lot of other games, you're tasked with reaching point quotas or "painting" every tile of the board with a match, etc. before you lock the board or run out of pre-budgeted moves or something. In Puzzle Quest, your goal is to deplete your enemies' health points, in classic turn-based RPG fashion.\n\nIn MPQ, you build up a roster of Marvel heroes (and villains) and pick a team of 3 to take into each battle. This edition has 6 mana colors, and each character has 3 preferred colors and up to 3 special abilities to spend your mana on. There are about a hundred characters available as of this writing, so there are lots of combinations available. In addition to building a team with good color distribution, you must also weigh the characters' max health and what types of powers they have (raw damage, board effects, support abilities).\n\nUnfortunately, the microeconomy severely limits your roster. Characters are unlocked via comic book Covers. Receiving your first Cover for a given character will make that character playable (if you have room to keep them), but in an extrememly weak and limited capacity. In order to get the most out of a character, you have to collect at least 13 separate instances of that characer's Covers. The majority of your character Covers are acquired through blind-box pulls. You can also spend rare currency (about $3-4 worth per attempt) for a blind pull from any category that doesn't include any of the weakest characters. Even if you're willing to spend the money, there's absolutely no way to directly buy a character that you want. The best you can do is to buy microcurrency and keep spending it on blind boxes.\n\nA character's strength & utility are determined by two factors: experience level & stacks of Covers. Rarer characters have higher starting levels and higher level caps. You can increase a character's level by spending the common currency (ISO crystals). It makes no difference how much you use the character. It's technically possible to completely max out a character without ever using them in a mission.\n\nA new character can't level up without acquiring more Covers. Covers are the only way to raise the level cap. Not only that, but you have to find 3 different version of a Cover to get access to all of the character's powers.\n\nI'll use classic Storm as an example, because she's useful and popular and she has uncomplicated powers.\n(When you make a match, every tile you break goes into your mana pool so that you can spend it to cast your powers)\nStorm's Green power breaks a bunch of random tiles around the board. Each tile deals damage & gives you mana.\nHer Blue power will stun the target enemy for a set number of turns and also deal damage to the entire enemy team.\nHer Yellow power doesn't cost anything, but is an automatic counterattack whenever somebody on your team takes a certain amount of damage.\nSay you just got your first Storm Cover, and it's Green. Now you can add Storm to your team, but you can ONLY use her Green power. You won't be able to use her Blue or Yellow powers until you happen to receive those Covers. If you get ANOTHER Green Cover, you can stack it. This increases the effectiveness of the power (in this case, she breaks even more random tiles when you cast it, resulting in higher damage and more mana gained) and also increases that character's level cap. Each color can be stacked to a total of five, and you have to have 13 total applied to bring a character to maximum level.\n\nBecause of how Covers & levels are so closely intertwined, you reach a point where newly-acquired characters are straight-up useless. If a lot of your roster is around, say, level 100, and you get a new "Rare" character who begins at level 40, you'll need to accumulate at least 5 or 6 extra covers (and spend currency to level up) before that character is strong enough (both in base stats and effectiveness of powers) to contribute to the fight. This is a real shame, because it takes away the possibility of experimenting with combinations and turns it into a meta-game of trying to decide who to pour your resources into until they're viable.\n\nThe game's difficulty scales up based on the highest-level characters in your roster, so if you luck out and win somebody much stronger than your existing team, you will be punished for it with a difficulty increase even though that high-level character you just won is basically useless (due to not having any useable powers). You may end up having to sell the powerful new character just to make the game playable again.\n\nYou begin the game with enough space to keep 4 characters. You'll need to spend rare currency to unlock additional slots, and the price goes up with every new slot. The price eventually caps out at roughly $10 per slot. It is possible to get rare currency without spending money.\n\nUnlike previous Puzzle Quest games, your team isn't healed after a battle. Damage heals over time, or it can be healed instantly using consumable Health Pack items. Health Packs can be bought (1 for 50 cents worth, or 5 for $2). They can also be handed out as mission rewards. In the original release, several characters were able to partially heal the entire team. These abilities were reworked so that this health  would wear off after the battle and you would still have to either wait or pay to heal back up. Characters like Wolverine who have self-only healing abilities get to keep their health after a fight.\n\nThe "Versus" mode is not live head-to-head PVP. Instead, the game copies a ghost of your team and you battle AI-controlled versions of other players' ghost-teams. You gain points every time you defeat an enemy team, but you lose some points every time your own ghost team is defeated. This is a pretty reasonable premise, except that point losses don't just affect your leaderboard standing, but also your ability to earn milestone rewards. It's incredibly frustrating to be one battle away from earning some rare currency or a weighted recruitment token, only to find out after winning that you've been attacked by twelve other people during your battle and you've lost ten times the points that you just earned. The rub here is that you can spend rare currency (starting at 75 cents) to buy temporary immunity to point loss.\n\nIf this game wasn't built around a pay-for-a-chance-to-win microeconomy, I would recommend it. Because so many decisions revolve around the microeconomy, the game suffers and the players suffer. It's very easy to complain about the pay models in F2P games, but the exchange rates are particularly disgusting here. It's easy to say "well, if you normally pay $20-30 for a decent game, then just buy $20-30 worth of currency and call it fair" except that much currency won't go very far.\n\nI love the Puzzle Quest series, and I wish that I could play this game without constantly feeling somebody's hand grasping for my wallet. If there was a version of this game that wasn't built around IAP & only required a one-time purchase, I would absolutely buy it. For now, they'll have to be content with not getting my money, and I hope they don't get yours either.","May 28","false","987.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Energy, timers, grinding leveling, this game has it all. It's basic concept is really fun, but overshadowed by what I just mentioned. It's basically a match 3 game mixed with a RPG type battles. This part of the game is actually really fun. I would give this game 10/10 had it been done outside of the f2p model and had instead charged like $20-30. You really can't play this game for more than 20 minutes as once all you're heroes are defeated you must wait for them to "regain" health. Which simply means waiting an hour or paying money to heal. Also leveling up on your own is ridiculously grinding. You will often find yourself stuck with no way to progress until you very slowly finally get enough points to finally level up enough to take on an enemy. Most insultingly sometimes you wont even get promised rewards for a victory, the game is just like f*ck you and moves on.\n\nHOW DOES ANY COMPANY THINK STEAM USERS ARE STUPID ENOUGH TO PAY FOR A $100 MICROTRANSACTION!!!!!!","March 18, 2014","false","788.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It gives off the impression that it's a basic match 3 game but NOPE it's not, it's got various mechanics that might have actually been cool. However they don't bother explaining these until you have already figured them out, with the exception of the powers they do tell you about those.   Speaking about the powers, the ones they start you off with at first seem cool with Iron Man's repulsor blast dealing like solid 63 damage but later on the enemies have so much health it begins to suck. Also the story, I can't say I payed much attention to it because it was dumb but the writing was horrible it was cheesy and boring, not even cheesy and funny just boring and and the beginning they start off with Iron Man, yeah fine whatever but then they throw in Storm, for no reason at all just because why not, lets throw in a completely unrelated character to team up with Iron Man to take down some lame ♥♥♥ bad guys and the enemies have unoriginal names, like soldier and sniper. There is probably a pay to win aspect but I couldn't play it long enough to notice, oh wait yes I could in the first 5 minutes they tried to force me to use some healing thing to heal my hero which wasn't even badly damaged, if you don't heal your heroes they can't fight no matter how much health they have, they could be only 5 hp short and you'd just have to wait for them to heal or use up one health pack if your lazy and eventually enemies deal enough damage to prevent you from playing for a minimum if 4 minutes if you don't use the health pack, how do you get more health packs? You either play missions which you can't do because your hero is injured or you buy them. Don't waste your time with this go play Bejeweled on your phone or something instead.","December 9, 2013","false","1.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I was 'lucky' to recieve a legendary level 70 hero early in the game - he really made things extremely easy for me. Leveling up my other heroes I stumbled into the upcoming payment wall (cash grab). To level from level 20 to the next stage (it hops with quite a number of levels - around 4 or 5 at this point) I need over 3K Iso-8. That's either playing a lot (you get an average of 50 Iso-8 a game) or play with your creditcard and buy the 3K Iso-8 for around $5. And that's only at level 20.

I have to say, it's worth avoiding so-called "Free to Play" games, as they intentionally abuse game design and put it not in the service of telling a story or making a compelling experience or whatever, but rather in the service of getting microtransactions out of the player.  It don't think it's possible to avoid that, save for doing a shareware model where you're playing an extended demo for free.\n\nI assumed the above before playing any "free to play" games, and I'm more certain of it after sinking time in to quite a few over the past year or two.\n\nAll that said, Marvel Puzzle Quest is the best of them I've yet seen, and there's a lot of fun to be had from it...but at the same time, it would be a better game were it designed like the mainline Puzzle Quest games that you just purchase and play.  There doesn't appear to ever be an endgame here...it's basically just repeating story elements that ultimately are trying to get you to pay money, but never really lead anywhere.  I've seen stories in this repeated a half dozen times now, sometimes slightly mixed up, sometimes the same storyline/quest has repeated literally twice in a row.\n\nAnd it's a shame, because a lot of what's here is actually great.  I played Puzzle Quest 2 while playing this, and I actually like the basic "puzzle combat" gameplay here better.  The art is generally fantastic too (and looks better and the screen layout is much better on PC than on iOS/Android).  This is the most fun I've ever had with the basic mechanics of a single screen action puzzle game.\n\nThe adaptation of characters' powers to the gameplay is well thought out-they're clearly trying and mostly succeeding in making it work.\n\nI won't lie, it's a lot of fun to collect and power up your favorite characters and have them beat down your opponent.  But it gets frustrating when you realize it’s really towards no end…there’s no endpoint, just that endless repetition of mostly identical story elements recycled again and again.\n\nThe most egregious way they try to get you to spend (a lot) of money on it is for slots to hold characters.  They give you a very small number at the start, and since both for gameplay reasons and because it’s cool to have them, you’ll quickly want/need vastly more slots than they give you.  You technically earn the resources to buy slots within the game, but that’s a VERY slow process that’s not very practical-I think since I started playing they’ve made that worse too.  You’re pretty much forced into paying real-world money to be able to have the slots you’d want and need to actually continue playing.\n\nSo would I recommend this?  There’s so much fun in it, and it’s so well done in many ways…and yet at the same time, there’s no ending.  There’s no resolution to the story.  It’s just a fancy treadmill to get you to pay more, and it’s a shame that this same effort wasn’t put towards making this a “real” game.  Even an MMO model might make more sense for it (as it is actually an MMO in many respects).\n\nI'm putting thumbs down because Steam forces me to thumb it up or down.

The puzzle element is really solid and damn addictive, I will go more in to the flaws at the end of the review,but if you want to enjoy it(without spending money) there are some tips.\n1. Use most of the iso you get for training your heroes instead of buying covers, at least in the beginning, it is slow to grind with low level heroes on missions that you have already gathered all the iso from. Also focus on three heroes at the start, so you have at least one team that can defeat more difficult opponents.\n2. Use the hero points for roster upgrades, the game limits how many heroes you can have and you very quickly fill all your slots.\n3. You can't really reset your progress, so a bad start can really destroy enjoyment.\n4. Start slow, you get some reward daily and they help you progress\n5. Take part in events, they are really difficult at the very beginning and often require heroes you might not have. but they offer nice rewards and are generally entertaining. More so when you've played the game for a little longer.\n\nWhat I hate about the game.\n1.\nMonetization, while not bad as a concept, this game has ridiculous prizes for it's currency, and as usual the more valuable resource is very limited ingame without paying. Events feature heroes that are powered up in them, and if you want to buy them quaranteed, it costs about 20 euros, hero slots start at about 1€ a spot but quickly double that. You get heroes at random, and if you want a copy of specific cover to level up power and also the level cap of the hero, you can spend money for that, 1 star hero is about 1€ per cover, 2 star is about 5€, 3 star cover is closer to 10€ and 4-star cover is about 25€.\n\nYou also can't buy new select covers for heroes, the powers have to be unlocked via randomly acquired cover or event prize. And after the power is unlocked the power could be upgraded by paying.\n\n2.\nDifficulty on campaign ramps up pretty fast, creating a paywall of some level that feels that appears very early, more so if you had a bad start.\n\n3.\nCampaign length. You start with a tab Prologue, that has 5 maps, each with about 15 battles. the difficulty really ramps up at the 4th one. Then when you finally clear the prologue, the campaign at least so far is over. After that there are only the events and pvp against other player teams that are controlled by AI. so the game becames more of a gotta catch them all, with no other real goal and that is handicapped by monetization.\n\n4.Leveling\nThe whole leveling up system seems to have been designed with monetization in mind. You need iso to level up, the cost get higher and the rate at which you get it becomes slower when there are no new missions to play and old missions give almost negligible amounts. You hero's maximum level is capped by how many covers for him/her you have, and how rare the hero is\n\nSome random numbers\nGraphics 7. They are nice, not groundbreaking, but feel very fitting for this game\nGameplay 9. Very addicting once you get the hang of it, AI is kind of stupid at times which i guess just happens\nWriting and sounds are decent but i mainly play on the background while doing something else so can't really rate them.\nMonetization 2. everything feels like it has very bad value and not much incentive to use the option. And it really hurts the game\nOverall 4. The actual gameplay is great, but is dragged down by lack of content, goals after the short campaign and monetization centric design.","March 8, 2014","false","242.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is free to play, so the game steers you toward spending money in order to compete without spending hours on end grinding through the game, This game, overall, is bad.\n\nThis is a puzzle quest game.  You start off with a few 1 star characters and either earn others by playing the game or buying a chance to get certain characters. Characters range from 1 to 4 stars. Simply match gems to attack, no skill involved. Matchs drag on and useless animations, that you cannot disable, draws out these matches needlessly.\n\nMPQ can get frustrating, and is very repetitive. When it is time for you to lose;  you will lose. The computer will cascade massive amounts of gem matches, continue to find extra turns, and color starve you until you lose. This happens often, how else would they get you to spend money to buy heals, a chance for characters, and levels.

While being free-to-play makes it harmless enough to check out, it is not one of the better games of this model out there. Tribes Ascend and Path of Exile are just a few examples of how this model can be applied to a game with great success. Marvel Puzzle Quest: Dark Reign gets 2 out of 5 stars.

It is free to play, so the game steers you toward spending money in order to compete without spending hours on end grinding through the game, This game, overall, is bad.\n\nThis is a puzzle quest game.  You start off with a few 1 star characters and either earn others by playing the game or buying a chance to get certain characters. Characters range from 1 to 4 stars. Simply match gems to attack, no skill involved. Matchs drag on and useless animations, that you cannot disable, draws out these matches needlessly.\n\nMPQ can get frustrating, and is very repetitive. When it is time for you to lose;  you will lose. The computer will cascade massive amounts of gem matches, continue to find extra turns, and color starve you until you lose. This happens often, how else would they get you to spend money to buy heals, a chance for characters, and levels.

Which means - Punisher, Hulk, Magnetos, Captain America, Spiderman, Ragnarok and many more(some of them maxed or half trained). As you can see on screens on my steam I was top player, have also played for more than 60 days in a row(know from daily shield rewards - which are bunch of crap tbh).\n\nWhen I have played this game 3 months ago - it was fun on a break. Since then they've changed so many things on minus. It's free to play, but more pay(and play for whole day) to win. Tough enemies, weak player heroes making this game a real challenge, especially on a combo streak from enemy. I was maxing 2 stars Storm for last week - every fckin level needs about 1000 or later 1500 Iso-8, until 85 lvl. But still, after maxing you have to play against enemies - 140lvl, 240lvl - no problem with that, if you're lucky and know how to build your team for a battle. For beginners this game is now unplayable, because of level of the challenge. One of most unbalanced games I ever played.\n\nAlso develepers still pushing you to pay. You have lost a battle? You need recharge( so wait hours or pay). You want to level up? you need Iso-8. You want to win anything? Just pay!\nYou can say you get Iso from battles - yes, but how much? 100Iso as a reward of won match against deadly 240lvl enemies is piece of crap, not a reward.\n\nAlso, even if you buy gold, you want to have THIS character.. no no no! That's not that easy. Still you can't buy character you want, just test your luck. You probably get a character you have maxed, and it's useless until then.\n\n\nTL:Dr - don't play, it's crap, pay to (maybe)win.","February 27, 2014","false","198.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Meaning you have to stop playing after a few battles. Seriously, who in their right mind thought that limiting play time would be a good thing!\n\nTrying to level up the powers of rarer characters is pretty much out of the question if you're avoiding spending money on them, which is ridiculous...\n\nThe story plummets after the first chapter (not that it was particularly interesting to begin with) and becomes a series of pointless fights with goons and soldiers.\n\nDownloading this game as a Puzzle Quest installment or a Marvel game will only lead to disappointment.

With cash roadblocks at new characters, new skills, skill level ups, and healing, expect to find yourself grinding the same missions over and over hoping to make enough funny money to have a chance at earning a character that is strong enough to beat the next stage and having to wait up to a hour(at least for 30 and under) real time for your characters to heal back to full health. Since you can't level up without having more skill levels, and leveling up lower level characters is pointless anyways since their skills do not scale with the levels of HP, you're forced into this loop until you get a lvl 30 character that breaks the game for a few hours, until they are too weak as well.

Got every single reward from the tutorials, placed well in a few Story events (which are an interesting system of different timed thematical storyline events that spit out rewards every day or three) because I have pockets of time through the day which this fills nicely. Even dabbled a bit into the Versus system, where you fight other players' teams for rank and rewards, but the AI controls the opponent teams since Match-3 gameplay doesn't lend itself well to a realtime PvP system at all.\n\nMy roster's not as developed as long-time players yet, I have a bunch of 2-star heroes, a number of 3-stars with 1 or 2 powers, and a couple 4-stars from event rewards that I lean heavily on. (Star basically = rarity/power rating, with 1 stars being the lowest and 4 being the highest with a 5 now just released in an update). Enemies in story fights seems to scale according to your overall roster level, which is neat, because it allowed even my newer PC account to jump right in to a story event and place high enough to get top tier rewards.\n\nThe game is F2P with microtransactions, but the MT's are so RNG based that you don't really get to P2W very effectively unless you spend a ton, I think, and even then you can win loads of the same MT items just from several hours put into the story events, or by focusing your free time into an event that you think you can do well in.\n\nYet I hesitate to give this game a positive recommendation. I like it, but one thing really irks me. As a microtransaction-based game, it's unforgivable in my eyes that the accounts from different platforms play together but people cannot access their mobile account on PC and vice versa. If you are making a microtransaction game, especially since I noticed the mobile version already has Google+ and Facebook integration, you have to have this basic functionality since the game's pricing model is based on constantly spending money.\n\nSo while I like the game, I will not give it my recommendation until this is implemented as I feel that this is a necessary step for them to earn my thumbs up. They apparently have manually merged some accounts "in the past" but have since stopped doing so for everyone else.","September 24, 2015","false","22.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","2"

If you're not familar with the abusive nature of micro-transaction dependent games, then read some of the more in-depth reviews (like the ones with 4+ paragraphs) to get more details. The only positive thing this game has over the flash games on Facebook is that:\n\n1) the game doesn't lag as much as the ones on FaceBook,\n2) this game won't force you to spam all of your FaceBook friends, &\n3) it has characters from the Marvel franchise.\n\nAs for the puzzle game itself, I find it infuriating! I am not merely saying this because I am a poor loser. I get my ♥♥♥ kicked all the time in MOBA & fighting games, but I can still enjoy those games. When I make a mistake in those games, I can usually see alternative moves that could have been made & understand how the consequences of the mistake could have been avoided.\n\nIn this game, when you destroy blocks, new blocks will fall down to replace the destroyed blocks, sometimes the replacement blocks will just conveniently share the same color & coinciding create a chain reaction, doing massive damage. I am not talking about the pieces that are already on the board & merely fall down. I speaking of the new pieces that weren't on the board previously. Because of this, destroying block on the bottom half of the board is usually more advantageous then destroying the block near the top edge of the board.\n\nUnlike most puzzle games, such as "Tetris", there is no preview of the new incoming blocks that appear from the top of the game board, so there is no way to prepare for them, offensively or defensively.\n\nMany times, chain combos will just happen by accident & sometimes for massive damage; sometimes for you, sometimes against you. This can be a HUGE reward that is being giving out, not for any brilliant strategy or careful planning, but just by sheer randomness. Unless one team is heavily more over-powered than the other, without a preview of the next set of falling blocks, the outcome of the match relies too heavily on luck. You might as well be playing a slot machine.\n\nI'm still gonna play this game though, just because I'm as much of a sucker as those who do play slot machines.","December 30, 2013","false","460.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

While waiting for the download I scrolled down to the reviews and notice not a single recommend. After playing it for more than two minutes it's clear to me why.\n\nHaving played on my Galaxy SIII prior to this, I assumed (incorrectly) that there would be some way to link my accounts and resume play on the desktop version, perhaps Facebook or Google+ or such. But nope. If you played the game on your smart device, you haven't played it on PC. No such option exists, and it sends you straight through the exact same tutorials I went through on the mobile version, albeit with a rather poorly designed interface (if you can really say there's one to speak of).\n\nThe horrible design I can somewhat deal with (I expected a superior version to mobile), but upon learning that there was no way to sync between my smart device and this version, complete dealbreaker. I realize people bash the crap out of D3's decision to make the game pay to win, but I actually have put money into it prior, so seeing the branding not scale whatsoever between versions is a pitiful excuse at best. If they fix this (which is unlikely, given the game seems to think you're playing it on a tablet by design and is literally a direct port of the widescreen tablet version), I would possibly love the desktop version until the end of time. As it is, I'm sure not paying money all over again for the same content.","August 29, 2014","false","0.1"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

The microtransactions are mainly for "hero points," which is a rare currency in the game that is mainly used for increasing your roster size and letting you collect more heroes/villains. I have played for about 30 hours at the time of this review without a single penny spent and I've loved it. Now that we've covered the microtransactions, the real review.\nMarvel Puzzle Quest is a match three game, like Candy Crush Saga or Bejeweled. Each team has three heroes (or villains) per battle, and each match you make gives damage to the enemy team. You can earn more characters for your team by completing battles, winning PvP and campaign events, or buying them using Iso-8 (another currency which is much more common) and Hero Points. PvP Events are released frequently, which let you fight another player's team which is usually paired up with a hero from that event, like Deadpool or Wolverine. There's also a campaign mode where you fight game A.I. for Iso-8 and sometimes Hero Points.\nOverall, I'd say it's a really cool game and despite all the negative reviews, you should download it and check it out.","August 10, 2014","true","31.8"," 13 of 25 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","13","25","0","0"

Complaining that it's freemium is silly, because you already knew that going in. The idea that you can't "win" without paying is also silly. There's no "winning" in an ongoing game. You might win or lose individual battles, but that has nothing to do with spending money. I invest little time in it on my mobile devices, and still manage to get in the top 100 in tournaments fairly regularly. If you want ALL of the covers and ALL of the characters, then yeah, you'll have to spend at some point. But it's perfectly playable with the random drops.\n\nThe one thing that does peeve me a bit is that there's no way to link mobile to PC. If you can link across mobile devices, you should be able to link to the PC version. I suspect that's because it's on Steam, but still frustrating. Though, if you do want to play a "new" game, it's good for that.","February 1, 2015","true","7.2"," 13 of 25 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","13","25","0","0"

There are only familiar PQ battles - no pets, no equip, no locks - only the battles. But they are quite good. And the upgrading Marvel heroes instead equip makes it interesting too. There is one problem though - the new heroes requires a new slots, and without slots you most probably will miss your special rewards. But game was quite generous to give me 7 slots from initial questing money, and later... well, I shell be able to manage it later. But if you want the many different heroes, fast, prepare to pay.\n\nAs it's F2P, payment or grinding for battle wins expected, as usual. All your heroes lose life force during the battles, and it can be gained only with time - or with the health packs->donations. So if you want a long games, prepare to pay. For me and my half-hour sessions it's all right.\n\nThe game have quite a big amount of NPC-grinding locations, but most challenges came from PvP battles in special events. Unfortunately, most of time (but not always) it means losing. For my non-buffed heroes one-two battles per day is manageable, but rarely more. But as rewards are much bigger than loses, nothing to complain for me. If I cannot kill today's enemies, I'll farm NPC instead.\n\nBottom line: good PQ-like game for 20-30 minutes per day. Can be frustrating for longer.","December 20, 2013","true","175.0"," 29 of 57 people (51%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","51","29","57","0","4"

The same old Bejeweled/PQ basic mechanic of 'matching 3 gems or more' is there, a huge appeal for its fanbase.\n\nAlso, with the quests system, there's a sense of progression unlike the old Bejeweled. You actually need to check your opponents level prior to accepting the quest, rearrange your roster, heal your heroes or arming the power ups to make things easier.\n\nIn addition to great quests, we also have very decent graphic and badass OSTs. Granted that it's not AAA's 3D levels, but the detailed chars and charming designs are more than enough. The actual Heads Up Display is clear and concise, allowing players to reach the menu they want to use. There's also a simple descriptions to each of heroes' powers so you can understand what you're going to invoke before deciding (since the point placement is permanent and not respecable).\n\nThe video options are barebones, but really there's no need Anti Aliasing and those fancy Physx Tesselation whatever it's called options. You can use your native resolutions - at least that's commonly used nowadays - to prevent screen tearing. Well, in my case, it autodetected everything so it's click and play.\n\nGame performance overall is silky smooth even on my mid-end rig. Transitions between scenes are quite short, no boring loading screen that takes ages to finish and so far zero crash.\n\nNow after all good stuffs, here comes the problem, microtransactions. In order to upgrade your heroes within reasonable timeframe, you need to either be lucky with rewards rolls, or grind the best rewarding quess repeatedly, or purchasing DLCs. That's where the major problem is. All would have been a little better if the quest rewards can make up for it so free players don't have to bang against the wall out of frustration.\n\nMultiplayer is missing, but I'd imagine it'd be great to have a match up against other people real time matching gems together.\n\nGreat Free to Play game ridden by micro transactions. It's a real shame, the game has a chance to be other FTP killers on Steam, but severely missed it. In the end though, I'd play until I am tired with the brick wall that prevents me from advancing, or bored.","December 11, 2013","true","16.6"," 11 of 22 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","11","22","0","1"

Yes there are lots of people who write reviews saying that "There's not many characters to play with" or "Only the people who want to spend money actually do good". Well they're fairly full of it. Yes, I can agree that there aren't very many heroes to play as but this is because the game isn't fully completed yet, it's still an "Early Access" as Steam would call it, except that every feature is added into the game so Steam doesn't, but the game is constantly being updated with more and more heroes, at the time I'm posting this the game just added the characters Wolverine(Patch) and the God of War, Ares. So people who say there aren't many heroes should just be patient and wait.\n\nTo those of you who wouldn't download this free game because only the pay to play win, don't worry! You start the game with a couple of heroes and it places you into other game matches with players ranked similarly to you so you won't have a level 6 Iron Man character against a level 141 Hulk, (Hulk wins hands down), and you still have a team of 3 heroes to work with so really, the pay to play win better heroes, but the free to play players can slowly fight players like themselves and get stronger starter heroes and eventually stronger better heroes, like the Hulk or Captain America (Personal Favorite). So the pay to play can get better heroes faster, but honestly spending all the money on a CHANCE to get better heroes faster isn't really worth it.\n\nMyself and a couple of friends play this game and we all stronly recommend it, and we all haven't spent a dime and already have powerful heroes and can easily beat the "Pay to play powerhouses". So don't fear and download this game for a wonderful take on the Marvel Universe!","January 15, 2014","true","304.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This series has seen a lot of iterations and copycats over the years, with none being nearly as successful as the original title. This latest is an officially licensed Marvel title with the Puzzle Quest formula. It has the added benefit of being entirely free-to-play. You may of course purchase bonuses like any other free title, but these purchases are not required to play the full game. Is this latest attempt at a Puzzle Quest success worth a look, or should you just let it speed by and fade into the distance? Keep reading, perhaps I can help you decide.\n\nTo begin with, the Marvel universe has been utilized pretty well here. You have a team of three characters, each with three possible powers to be used. Typically you begin with one of these powers and you must find comic covers of the character to unlock or upgrade said powers. This also allows you to level up your character a little bit more each time. It’s a system that constantly keeps you feeling like you’re making some kind of progress and it works very well. Winning battles and missions grants you rewards, randomized from a pool of up to four for each story mission, giving you reasons to play missions again and again until you’ve received every reward available. It’s structured remarkably well for any game, let alone a free-to-play title. It’s a nice change of pace to see a free game with a lot of effort put into it. The content level is more than a lot of full priced games have, and the developers deserve some credit for it.\n\nThe presentation is decent. Each character is represented by a comic book cover from any number of different Marvel universes, and has a full 3D model as well as a 2D comic profile. Everything is vibrant and colorful and stands out very well in a sea of photo-realistic browns and grays of more recent games. The music is a bit generic, but it’s suitable for a superhero game. There are lots of highs and thumping bass tracks to drive the combat forward. It can certainly get repetitive, but that’s what the volume slider in the options menu is for. Overall, it doesn’t detract from the experience any and fits in well enough that some may not really notice it.\n\nOn to the meat of things; the gameplay! I’m pleased to say that the gameplay of Marvel Puzzle Quest is, well, fantastic to be perfectly honest with you. It is a very well implemented use of the Puzzle Quest formula with enough difference and excitement to stand well on its own feet. Each color is representative of one member of your team, and has an icon to indicate which member that is. Wolverine, for example, is represented by scratch marks across the gems, while Storm has lightning bolts. Each icon makes sense and stands out well, making it easy to determine who will be attacking. Collecting gems allows you to use character powers, which can drastically change the way a fight is going. More powerful abilities take more preparation time and cause severe damage, while less powerful abilities can be used more often but do less damage or have fewer utility effects attached. There is a story mode separated into four separate mission groups, which will last you a good number of hours to complete. There are also daily and weekly missions and a PVP mode to keep you playing as long as your interest remains. Each of these modes offers its own rewards and characters, and as a result each also adds a huge amount of content to the game.\n\nAs for the dreaded free-to-play purchased content that inevitably unbalances these games? Well…it is present, but it’s not nearly as bad as other games often are. You can purchase the two currencies present in the game in bulk quantities, and use those currencies to recruit more and rarer characters or power up your existing heroes. It does unbalance the multiplayer somewhat if you let it, but it’s not so bad that it ruins the game entirely in that department. In order to counter the unbalancing, you just have to search a bit harder for an opponent on the same level as you. It can definitely be a pain in the backside from time to time but it isn’t something that ruins the overall experience and shouldn’t keep you from giving the game a shot.\n\nMarvel Puzzle Quest: Dark Reign has far more content and playability than a free game should ever reasonably be expected to contain. If you let it, this game will suck you in and keep you playing into the wee hours of the morning without even realizing it. There are far worse ways you could be spending your free time. Don’t let the price tag fool you; this is one game that doesn’t skimp on the content just because it’s free of charge. Give it a shot and you might be pleasantly surprised.\n","January 29, 2014","true","38.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Its a match 3 game with 3v3 combat. There are 6 colored jewels and environmental tiles. Match 3 of a color to acquire AP of said color. Your Heros use the AP for special abilities. The strategy in this game comes from setting up a team of 3 with synergistic abilities. You want to be able to utilize all 6 colors and you dont want one hero out too long or they will take too much damage.\n\nDIfferent types of challenges require different strategies. Some PC villians use tiles with count down timers. You have to eliminate or delay those tiles with your abilities or take massive cascades of damage. Other times you have to acquire certain colors to keep them away from villians in a turn based game play. You can use AP as you acquire it or save it to combine multiple abilities in board clearing strategies that will allow you to play above your character level.\n\nOverall this game has a depth that is surprising and exceeds its genre. Start free to play and then decide if its worth investing.","February 1, 2014","true","48.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The heroes have special attacks which use differing amounts of the gems you collect from matching them.  This means using more complicated gameplay than just matching tiles until one side emerges the victor.  Environment tiles add an additional layer of gameplay, but this game isn't the type you'll play all night, every night- and shouldn't be judged as such.\n\nAs a lover of marvel, I enjoy the variety of heroes they've incorporated so far and am looking forward to more.  I also think the artwork is nice, but do agree there is little feeling of story progression as you go from battle to battle.\nAll in all, I enjoy this game.  There are various improvements I could suggest, but instead I'll just log on from time to time, have a few fights and enjoy myself, level up my characters a bit with the currency I gain from my wins and then log back off and do something else.\n\nIf you take offence at microtransactions then don't click the page with them on, but if you're a grown up and understand that the option is there but is by no means a neccessity, then by all means, give the game a try- it's worth a look if you're a fan of Marvel and match 3 games.","January 23, 2014","true","276.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Then again, there are those who are playing Hearthstone and buying card packs for that...so no doubt there are some that will buy for this too.\n\nIn any event, right now I couldn't recommend this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/killpoint/recommended/234330/","killpoint","Foo Fighters","http://steamcommunity.com/id/killpoint/","235 products in account","Marvel Puzzle Quest (MPQ), is a mobile device port for steam. Is that necessarily a bad thing? I don't think so, but it is something that you need to keep in mind when looking at the UI and graphics. It also effects the pay system, and since this is a F2P game, that's something people tend to focus on. So let's start there:\n\nCan you play MPQ without spending money? Yes. Will you be competitive... well, mostly. Let's talk about what real money gets used for: You can purchase the two types of in-game currency with real money. ISO and Gold. ISO is used, mainly, to purchase boosts for use during combat and to spend to level up your characters. It is the common currency of the game and is earned pretty easily. Gold can be used for a number of things. You can purchase additional slots to hold more characters (you are limited to 4 characters at the start and the prices for additional slots increases the more you have), you can purchase some "super-boosts", you can purchase health packs, and you can purchase additional covers for your characters. Do you "have" to purchase these things? Nope. You do earn some gold through normal game play, and many people (myself included) have found that if you focuse your purchases you don't really hit a wall for a very long time.\n\nLet's move onto the gameplay itself. MPQ is a tile matching game that is themed around the Marvel Comic Universe. You swap tiles on a grid board to make 3 or longer chains of the same color/shape (think Bejewelled), you then score a hit dealing damage and (in most cases) generated Ability Points (AP) of that color. Each character that you have selected (three) will have different abilities both passive and active. These abilities are often fuelled by the AP you generate from your matches. Pretty simple. There is an entertaining amount of depth in selecting which team you want to bring to an event, and finding good synergy between character abilities is important.\n\nThe characters are leveled up by unlocking their skills. Skills are found by getting random drop "Covers". Each cover has one skill associated with it. Once you have used that cover to train the character in that skill it will increase the "Current Max Level" of the character, you can then use ISO to increase the level of the character. Every level increase raises the max Hit Points of the character, the amount of damage they do and the effectivness of their skills. Once you have unlocked the first level of the skill you can use Gold to increase the skill level (this is the main form of Pay-to-Win that you see in the game, but is limited by the fact that you have to have the base skill first to buy it).\n\nHealth of your characters is the delaying factor in playing. Not only are you doing damage to your enemies, but they are doing damage to your characters as well. Their health will increase back to max over time, but with high level characters this can take several hours. If you take your three best characters into a match that is over their head and get them all killed, this can mean that you don't get to play again for a few hours... unless you use Health Packs. Health packs allow a character to return to full health immediately. You earn health packs over time, one every 30 minutes, but could buy additionals for Gold.\n\nThe game provides some basic "PVE" missions to get a feel for the game and earn some basic covers and boosts, but the main part of the game that allows you to progress is the "PVP" duels and "PVE" events. Events rotate every few days and give opportunities for rare and high end rewards, but competition can be tough and some events require having certain characters to participate. Duels are a staple way to put your team against another player. The duels aren't really PVP though, because the same AI that runs the normal missions just uses the team, not an actual player.\n\nLong and the short of it: I find MPQ to be very entertaining, something that I have spent many an hour with and am perfectly happy to keep playing. There are issues, some bugs that break events and some exploits that people have found that can let them rank up super fast, and there are concerns about Pay-To-Win, but overall I can say that if you are looking for a casual time waster, this does the job rather well.","December 26, 2013","true","182.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I'm aware of the fact that I own a lot of games and they've cost me tons of money but one thing I will rarely do (never say never) is pay for in-game content. And yes, DLC is a whole different story.

Nearly every change since I started playing has been for the worse.\n\nIt lulls you into thinking that it might be easy or playable when you first start because the matchmaking and enemy difficulty seems to understand how to scale with you at that point but the longer you play the more all of that goes out the window. It becomes this banal uphill struggle for any foothold to just get a measly amount of ISO to level up. And that doesn't matter anyway, the better you do the harder they make they game so you'll do worse the next week until it evens out to just doing boringly.\n\nI did spend money on this game, not a lot but that's not the point. This isn't a pay to win game, I mean it could be but only if you put in hundreds of dollars but before an input of that size you're really not getting that much, if anything, out of putting money into this game, Maybe I'm wrong and all the people that seem to win every tournament or even any PvE event are putting money into the game but I don't think so, I just think they started earlier when there was less competition.\n\nThat's all this game is, an endless and fruitless competition. I've gotten close to even winning a few tournaments but it was a really hollow thing to do that. You have to throw all your time and effort to come away with anything at all and if you play casually you'll get next to nothing because there is nothing outside of the prologue that isn't played against other people and unless you can throw hours and hours and hours a day into this game then past the prologue you'll just founder and flail.\n\nIt might seem appealing now but don't bother. It will suck the marrow from your bones and leave you wishing you never started. Just go play some old Puzzle Quest games and look up some Marvel Trading cards online to look at, it won't be as enticing but at least it won't leave as bitter as I am at this mess of a game.","February 25, 2014","false","9.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

That´s how i stumbled upon this seemingly innocent little puzzle game. I always liked superheroes and so i decided to give it a shot. But what was in store for me was actually just a really mean ways of grabbing money. Don´t get me wrong im more than willing to spend a few bucks on a f2p game if i get the feeling it´s a fun game and some real effort went into it. That´s also the reason i own some skins in League of Legends for example.\nBut this here is just a tired puzzle game programmed to bring frustration. It´s hard to explain without having played it, but imagined that you feel cheated in many of the stages. Since there is no time limit you can and have to plan your moves and the basic concept of lining up 3 pieces of the same color can be expanded by planning where the remaining pieces will drop once you remove 3 of them. In some of the stages you are the only one directly moving pieces while the computer just adds pieces with certain effects that harm you, while in others the computer tries to remove pieces aswell. Now i put some planning into my moves trying to maximize the outcome and even chaining pieces and so on, but no matter what sometimes the computer just decides to drop the right pieces for your opponent deliberately. I know this might sound a little like a sore loser, but imagine you spend a few minutes thinking and you make a move that removes a lot of pieces via chains and then the computer just drops 5 pieces of the same color in his turn, dealing even more damage than you did.\nOk, ok you might say this is where the difficulty comes from, but it´s just my subjective point of view that it feels incredibly cheap. Also this isn´t the real problem of the game, remember i said somthing about greed and pay to win. When you loose in a stage your heroes faint and will need time to recover after the battle. How long you might ask? How about 2 FU***** hours? Go do your laundry, plant a tree or beat up a hobo, because you will wait or pay. As you level up your heroes they gain more hitpoints but also if they die/faint in a battle it takes forever until you can use them again, unless you pay money... Wow this is farmville standard bulls*** and pretty much what totally kills the game for me.\nOf course you can own more heroes in case your team gets defeated but the number of heroes you can own/use is limited, how can you own more heroes? Find ingame currency after certain bossbattles or pay money. This ain´t so bad right? After i acquire a hero i´m all set, right? Nope. All the heroes need to level up before they are actually useful in a stage, they all start with low hitpoints and just 1 skill. Furthermore they have a maxlevel capacity of 6 out of let´s say 85, which means you can´t progress until you unlock their higher levels. They can gain maxlevels and skills by finding comicbookcovers after stages, or by buying them. More rare heroes are more powerful and more expensive and can be leveled up beyond the level of your weak starting heroes. Now lets calculate how much 1 hero costs. Assuming you are lucky and get a 3 star hero after buying a random cover for 2 Euros, let´s say Loki for example. Each of his 9 remaing skill points comes at a whooping 12 Euros, which means you would in theory spend 110 Euros on one playable character... wow just wow. For 110 Euros you can buy the lengendary edition of Skyrim... 3 times. Also don´t forget your stronger heroes still need to gain levels until they reach their unlocked maxlevel via Iso-8 but i spare you from calculating that aswell.\nI have no idea how IGN.com and the other fu**-ups that call themselves reviewers can find this scam of a game even playable, but i assume they haven´t even played it and just wrote whatever the developing company paid them to do.\nIn my opionion you should stay as far away from this piece of sh** as possible.","February 21, 2014","false","419.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It's rough at the start because you need to build up your characters, which you do by earning in-game currency.  Each character gets capped at a certain level until you essentially win another copy of that character.  You use those extra copies to boost their skills, which raises the level cap.  Once you get going, you can take part in global events that constantly pop in and drop out.  That's where you really earn some good loot.  It's a fun time-killer when you have five minutes to spare.

Recent patches made it a disaster. When earlier it could be both casual and competitive at the same time, now its gone worse than pay2win, it made a severe turn for pay2play. In tournaments the rich get richer and new players get f***** up real good. Earlier the developers were co-operative with the community and the game was fun and even a newcomer could make a significant impact on the tournament standings and get some awesome rewards.\n\nDon't you worry! the game has microtransactions and you will NEED to spend money on this monstrosity in order to progress or get any rankings in the tournaments.\n\nBalancing has gone a rough way, the first big changes to characters came up from nowhere dimilishing their potential entirely. Once a overused always seen char went to plain common or even bad, changes just were too radical and unexpected. The most balancing issue was doubling the common booster prices and making the best boosts costing in-game currency which is nearly impossible to get without spending real money, so... want to fight with the best ways? Okay, go ahead and pay 50cents for each fight, doesnt sound bad? Yeah for the most part you will need at least 40 matches in a tournament to get to the good positions, thats like 20 bucks for simply trying to play the game! Character's skills can also be boosted! only 3-20$ for each cover which you need 15 in order to make one of your characters most useful, not mentioning the huge money drop (a ridicilous amount needed) for boosting it's levels.\n\nTL;DR Once a fun and an exciting game 5/5 went to greedy as ♥♥♥♥ microtransactions simply for playing the game, dont even consider supporting the developers.

That´s also the reason i own some skins in League of Legends for example.\nBut this here is just a tired puzzle game programmed to bring frustration. It´s hard to explain without having played it, but imagined that you feel cheated in many of the stages. Since there is no time limit you can and have to plan your moves and the basic concept of lining up 3 pieces of the same color can be expanded by planning where the remaining pieces will drop once you remove 3 of them. In some of the stages you are the only one directly moving pieces while the computer just adds pieces with certain effects that harm you, while in others the computer tries to remove pieces aswell. Now i put some planning into my moves trying to maximize the outcome and even chaining pieces and so on, but no matter what sometimes the computer just decides to drop the right pieces for your opponent deliberately. I know this might sound a little like a sore loser, but imagine you spend a few minutes thinking and you make a move that removes a lot of pieces via chains and then the computer just drops 5 pieces of the same color in his turn, dealing even more damage than you did.\nOk, ok you might say this is where the difficulty comes from, but it´s just my subjective point of view that it feels incredibly cheap. Also this isn´t the real problem of the game, remember i said somthing about greed and pay to win. When you loose in a stage your heroes faint and will need time to recover after the battle. How long you might ask? How about 2 FU***** hours? Go do your laundry, plant a tree or beat up a hobo, because you will wait or pay. As you level up your heroes they gain more hitpoints but also if they die/faint in a battle it takes forever until you can use them again, unless you pay money... Wow this is farmville standard bulls*** and pretty much what totally kills the game for me.\nOf course you can own more heroes in case your team gets defeated but the number of heroes you can own/use is limited, how can you own more heroes? Find ingame currency after certain bossbattles or pay money. This ain´t so bad right? After i acquire a hero i´m all set, right? Nope. All the heroes need to level up before they are actually useful in a stage, they all start with low hitpoints and just 1 skill. Furthermore they have a maxlevel capacity of 6 out of let´s say 85, which means you can´t progress until you unlock their higher levels. They can gain maxlevels and skills by finding comicbookcovers after stages, or by buying them. More rare heroes are more powerful and more expensive and can be leveled up beyond the level of your weak starting heroes. Now lets calculate how much 1 hero costs. Assuming you are lucky and get a 3 star hero after buying a random cover for 2 Euros, let´s say Loki for example. Each of his 9 remaing skill points comes at a whooping 12 Euros, which means you would in theory spend 110 Euros on one playable character... wow just wow. For 110 Euros you can buy the lengendary edition of Skyrim... 3 times. Also don´t forget your stronger heroes still need to gain levels until they reach their unlocked maxlevel via Iso-8 but i spare you from calculating that aswell.\nI have no idea how IGN.com and the other fu**-ups that call themselves reviewers can find this scam of a game even playable, but i assume they haven´t even played it and just wrote whatever the developing company paid them to do.\nIn my opionion you should stay as far away from this piece of sh** as possible.","February 21, 2014","false","419.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

So naturally I also loved this new entry based on the Marvel comics. And in a way I do. But it just feels so cheap, and all because it's free. The character designs are well done and if you've played one of the previous PQ games you most definitely know how they play and this one is no different. It's once again all about matching gems. Which is fun obviously.\n\nBut unlocking new characters, powers and upgrades take a lot of time and you'll be replaying a lot of battles to earn these rewards... or you can use real life currency to save time, which is ridiculous if you ask me. I'm aware of the fact that I own a lot of games and they've cost me tons of money but one thing I will rarely do (never say never) is pay for in-game content. And yes, DLC is a whole different story. But less of a scam because some of it can be truly impressive. But I'm losing focus here.\n\nThe text in the text bubbles is gigantic which annoyed me. Replaying the levels many times over to get the proper rewards annoyed me. The fact that you can skip through these steps as long as you are willing to spend money on it annoyed me. And it's such a shame, because it can really be a fun game once you're playing a battle.\n\nIt's free so it's hard to not recommend this game, right ? But I just can't. I can't. Buy PQ2 instead and witness a truly magnificent game. You won't be disappointed.\n\n[Rating: 76/100]","December 26, 2013","false","2.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Recent patches made it a disaster. When earlier it could be both casual and competitive at the same time, now its gone worse than pay2win, it made a severe turn for pay2play. In tournaments the rich get richer and new players get f***** up real good. Earlier the developers were co-operative with the community and the game was fun and even a newcomer could make a significant impact on the tournament standings and get some awesome rewards.\n\nDon't you worry! the game has microtransactions and you will NEED to spend money on this monstrosity in order to progress or get any rankings in the tournaments.\n\nBalancing has gone a rough way, the first big changes to characters came up from nowhere dimilishing their potential entirely. Once a overused always seen char went to plain common or even bad, changes just were too radical and unexpected. The most balancing issue was doubling the common booster prices and making the best boosts costing in-game currency which is nearly impossible to get without spending real money, so... want to fight with the best ways? Okay, go ahead and pay 50cents for each fight, doesnt sound bad? Yeah for the most part you will need at least 40 matches in a tournament to get to the good positions, thats like 20 bucks for simply trying to play the game! Character's skills can also be boosted! only 3-20$ for each cover which you need 15 in order to make one of your characters most useful, not mentioning the huge money drop (a ridicilous amount needed) for boosting it's levels.\n\nTL;DR Once a fun and an exciting game 5/5 went to greedy as ♥♥♥♥ microtransactions simply for playing the game, dont even consider supporting the developers.

But when you dig deeper you find that the game is designed to squeeze you for money every chance it gets. Your heroes' levels are capped by comic covers. The covers are mostly random, or hard to obtain. Plus, despite there being several different covers available, your slots to place them in are extremely limited. The Single-Player game will thus become overywhemling quickly, and stop providing you with any resources, forcing you into the special quests (which likewise dry up fast) or pvp. Those have exploitable methods to try to get more resources, but it becomes a frustrating game of retrying until you get a suitable opponent and then attacking. Not a lot of balance, difficult to advance, very hard on the wallet for a "freemium" game, just add up to a product that's best left avoided.\n\nThis review is a repost of one I had made several months before, which appears to have been deleted in that when I visit the store page, it asks me to submit a review.  Though my old review was still listed in my profile.  Since the time of writing this, the developers implimented a change to the way healing was done in-game.  In order to play, you nead heroes who are healthy.  You can get health packs in game, that regenerate in time, or you can pay for them with the paid currency.  This is a tactic used in many Facebook games.  Simply put, it's a way to force you to constantly pay to keep playing.  And if you want to be "competetive", you must keep playing.  Limited time events, both PvE and PvP, require a lot of attention.  That you can't give them if you can't play.  Thus you can't earn the rewards from them.  And thus you fall further and further behind.  The change was that some characters had healing abilities in the game.  This effect let you continue to play, grind for what you needed in story mode etc.  The developers made the change that this in-game healing is temporary.  Once the battle was over, all the damage you received would be reapplied, sometimes killing your character.  Which meant, if you wanted to that character again, you needed to use a health pack.  Otherwise, you would rapidly run out of playable characters.\n\nTo not believe the "free to play" tag on this game.  This game features the worst in the "freemium" market practices.  There are far, far better options out there, in both the "match 3" gameplay style, and in the Marvel theme.","September 1, 2014","false","45.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

People who played from day one got to cruise to a cushy position for free and they are inoculated to the countless nerfs and adjustments that hurt new to mid range players in a petty attempt to force them to pay money for what others got for free just months before. Some fall into the trap and pay while others just tell everyone they know at how (supposedly) great the game is to flood the leaderboards with noobs so that they will be elevated into the top 10% more easily. Everything about the game is catered towards paying to overcome those who had it easier than you because they started at a higher tier in the pyramid scheme.\n\nThe steam version has several advantages over the mobile version, but with a single colossal flaw. By virtue of having more space the in game interface is vastly superior to the hyper-compact view on mobile. The perpetual link to the server forces the battery to drain 8-12X regular drain rate on mobile, which is not a problem on Steam given that we have that constant connection anyway and we are generally plugged in to a power source that will charge faster than it will drain. The problem is that Facebook cannot be synced, so you cannot carry over your mobile save data to your Steam version.

It almost consumes my game playing life now. I have gotten friends into the game and they love it as well. We talk about what characters we have, which ones we wish we had, and strategies for fights.  This game is free to play but you can pay for a few things. I DO NOT recommend paying for ISO-8, it can be easily farmed from "The battle of the Baxter building". This is what I do for ISO when I am not getting it through normal fights. I do quite well with this method and can get 2,000 to 3,000 ISO in an hour this way.  If you play a lot you might want to consider spending a little money on Hero Points to get more roster slots. I have spent $40 on this game and I feel that is a fair amount for how much time I have spent and how much enjoyment I get out of the game. However it's not necessary to spend money at all as you will win HP fairly often and you can always switch out who you have in your roster if you get a character you like better. It's just personal preference. I have friends who have spent money and friends who have not and our enjoyment of the game is the same.\n\nOverall if you like games like bejewled you will like this game.

I enjoy it quite a bit, but I've always been a fan of puzzle games, not excluding the 'match 3' genre. This one isn't as in-depth as say... Puzzle Quest 2 which is made by a totally different company, but I think there's still enough there if you want something more than Bejewelled. I think the best part is figuring out which heroes/villains work the best together and trying to build up their combos and such.\n\nAs far as downsides go, I really don't like the weak AI, the randomness of drops and the money for power aspect. I'll go into each point by point here.\n\nThe only real challenge comes from the level of your opponent, which determines how much HP they have and damage they do. When it comes to the actual gameplay, you can easily predict what they're going to do as they have certain priorities. They definitely play worse than a thinking person would. I would like it more if they made better decisions, as frustrating as that could be.\n\nAs far as getting loot goes, you have very little control over what you get. Essentially you do different missions, most of which have four rewards. The first time you beat a mission, you're guaranteed one of them. Typically, you'll get ISO (the game's main currency) Hero Coins (the game's premium currency), heroes or random hero tokens, or boosts. Each time you repeat the mission, you'll have a chance to get a reward that you haven't already received or 20 ISO (which is a tiny tiny amount) This does get frustrating after a while, especially if you're trying to get a specific reward. Now, in order to get more characters, you need to either complete certain missions, trade in recruit tokens of varying quality or progress/place well enough in events (there's usually something going on every day). The problem here is with the tokens. Some guarantee a certain quality of hero, but it's still random since if there's a character you want, there's next to no guarantee you'll get them. They break down the odds on their website, but it doesn't really help. But that's not the worst thing.\n\nThe worst thing is of course the bane of most free-to-play games. Paying for power. You can buy two things: ISO and Hero coins, the two currencies of the game. ISO is used to level up your characters and buy more low-quality ones. Coins allow you to buy more recruit tokens of higher quality, level up hero powers, (which aside from their actual effects, allow you to raise the character level higher) protect your characters in PvP mode (>:| ) but most importantly, buy more slots for characters. That last one is really frustrating, because you can only increase your character slots with coins, and if you don't want to spend money, you're going to have to inevitably pass up on recruiting certain characters, or get rid of ones you've progressed on in order to get new ones simply because if you don't buy coins, it's a hell of a grind to get more. The worst of the worst is that the coins/ISO are really expensive for your dollar, and I think don't really give you proper value. If you want to make this one of the only games you play it might be acceptable, but if you want to just play casually, I highly recommend not spending the money on it.\n\nMyself, I've put in a fair amount of time, so I begrudgingly purchased some coins to help open up some space for more characters on both my steam account and my iPad. ~sigh~\n\nAnyways, if you can overlook all the shortcomings, it's still a fun puzzle game, and you CAN get by without dropping any of your hard-earned cash on it. I recommend giving it a try if you're into the genre at all, especially considering it IS free.","June 24, 2014","true","155.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I don't like the new healing mechanic that limits your healing to in-battle only regeneration, but, it's not as much of a game breaker as I had expected.  But again, that might be due to the depth of my roster and having multiple options to choose from in order to play-on while out of lives/regens.  Give it a whirl though, it is addictive.\n\n\nAs you can see I have been intensely addicted to this game for months now.  And the game WAS fantastic.  However, in what I still cannot comprehend, the dev's at D3 have decided that they no longer want people to become addicted to their game.  They no longer want us telling our friends how fun it is, how they should give it a go and become MPQ addicts like we are.  No... now they have taken any sense of allowing their players the freedom to play when they want, how they want, w/ whatever characters they CHOOSE to play and have thrown it all in the garbage.\n\nI am an AVID supporter of games and developers who show that they care for, listen to, and support the player community which gives them a job, a fan base, and a slew of addicts who advertise this game as a wonderful time-sink to all their friends/family/co-workers for free.  But apparently, FREE advertising doesn't figure into their bottom line and they would rather lose 1000's of loyal players if it means that 1-2 people w/ the fortune and freedom to invest money at will into buying extra lives every time the RNG unluckily kills off all their characters.  Loyal players who will NEVER pay for, what would be, an endless need for health-packs to keep playing at the times these players have allotted themselves to play... are GONE.  The only competition new players, or even players looking to experiment and try different character/team set-ups, will face are going to be these whales that invest so much money into the game that they are UNBEATABLE.  NO NEW PLAYER WILL STAND A CHANCE when the only competition left are those with pockets deep enough to make it utterly unfair.\n\nI will continue to log on 1x -2x a day, in hopes that the dev's will realize, acknowledge, and correct this unfathomably inept decision to cut the legs out from any player who is new, growing, learning, or trying to figure out if the game is WORTH spending real money on.  It makes 0 sense.  NONE.  AT ALL.\n\nIf this isn't fixed in a week, I will uninstall this game and move on w/ my life.  And, if you check the hours I have put into playing, I thoroughly understand the mechanics behind the game as well as the MASSIVE hindrance this change would put into my own ability to play.  And I'm not someone w/ a poor roster just wanting to get a feel for it and decide if it's worth my time and money.\n\nBy refusing to let players develop their own style, experiment w/ different characters w/o the feeling that, if they lose, they'll have to wait 2-6 hours before they can play again, this product is going to plunge into the depths of being another 'free-to-play' game which is in NO WAY competitive, fair, enjoyable, or worth our time and money.\n\nPeople who love this game and play it daily are already dropping out, along w/ their free advertising... New players will be faced w/ unbeatable teams funded by players w/ pockets deep enough to not care, and this MASSIVELY UNAPPEALING wall of dead-time where they can do NOTHING but sit and wait for the game to slowly heal them over a 2-6 hour period.  IT IS PURELY BAFFLING TO NOT BE ABLE TO COMPREHEND HOW AWFUL THIS WILL BE TO ANYONE WHO WANTS TO FALL IN LOVE WITH A GAME.  How do you hope to attract, entertain, and KEEP players playing when you DON'T let them play for hours on end?  NO ONE is going to pay money, to a game, that they have 0 chance of being able to jump in, experiment, and get their feet wet in competition that is so far skewed towards players who buy the best characters and level them up w/o any work cause they can afford it.  Those players, like myself, who have put in HOURS AND HOURS of time learning the game, developing strategies to be able to out-last, out play, and still remain highly competitive with those players who cheat their way up using cash are going to be GONE.\n\nI sincerely hoped this is fixed in the next 7 days, or I will feel so dumb for having invested so much time and energy into a game which doesn't consider 90% of their fan-base when making decisions about how to move their product forward.\n\nSincerely,\n\nA once loyal and dedicated, and HOPEFULLY FUTURE loyal and dedicated, fan and player.","June 26, 2014","true","444.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","5"

The problem is, as others are saying, it is a microtransaction heavy game. It could be so much better, if they toned down that aspect of it and made the rewards better.\n\nI have some high level "covers" thanks to the DLC sale and getting a little lucky with recruit gambles.\n\nI would really like to see fair rewards, and the microtransactions turned down a bit. The music is very repetative, so that needs to be improved. You can always just turn the sound off and rock out to your own tracks via windowed mode.\n\nMuch of this game is a combination of luck and patience, or if you are willing to shed some $$$ it can get good. Many FreetoPlay games have this same mentality, i have also seen many fail because of this.\n\nD3 - if you want your game to be a success, take my advice and tone down the money-aspect of the game. If you set it all on making a profit, this game will be short lived. However, if you show that you are willing to ease up power up costs and give better story mode/tournament rewards, people may be more willing to support you and it will work out in your favor. I know i would buy more if you did this.\n\nI recommend this game for puzzle quest fans, but, remember that unless your willing to shell out some cash, you are better off playing vanilla PQ 1, 2, and Challenge of the Warlords.","January 26, 2014","true","6.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Each character gets capped at a certain level until you essentially win another copy of that character.  You use those extra copies to boost their skills, which raises the level cap.  Once you get going, you can take part in global events that constantly pop in and drop out.  That's where you really earn some good loot.  It's a fun time-killer when you have five minutes to spare.

It is designed for bite-size chunks, and offers a lot of progression both in building up individual characters and in building up your roster giving you new options and new combinations to try out.\n\nThere is a lot of noise and anger within the community here on Steam involving a recent change to healing characters that now keeps people from endlessly grinding out events.  I am adding this review primarily to wholeheartedly disagree with their viewpoint.  Before the healing change, I was about ready to give up on the game.  I have played for a while, and my roster was filled out and developed pretty nicely for a mostly-free player (I have spent some real money to expand my roster size faster, but never to get new characters or develop them -- the characters and XP equivalent come pretty quickly as you play so I never felt the need to spend money to accelerate that).  Unfortunately, I could never devote 8 or more hours a day to an event, so I never had a chance to win.  Players would grind out an event with their #1 best team of 3 characters until their health was low, then grind out a PvE level to heal those characters back to max, and then go back to grinding out the event again.  The enemy teams were almost always the three same characters, the winners' total scores were ridiculously high, and I was about done with the game.\n\nEnter the healing change -- any healing during a battle is now temporary to that battle (with a couple of exceptions that can only heal a character back to about 50% of his health).  Now, event winners must play with various combinations of characters and be better at the game (take less damage) than others, rather than simply spend more time than others on the game.  In my mind, this is a significant improvement to the game's health and will make things work much better in the long run.\n\nA final word about a game being 'pay2win' -- For most people, when you think of pay2win games, this references some item that gives a player an advantage that can only be bought with real money, not earned by playing the game.  This game includes NOTHING that fits that category.  There is absolutely nothing in the game that you cannot earn directly by playing the game.  The only reason I spent money on it at all was to support the developers for my time spent and because as a collector I wanted to hold on to all the characters I earned in game (they put a 7-day limit on adding a character to your roster to push for money to be spent there, but even the couple of times I lost a character by not adding them during this limit I have always gotten that character again down the road).  In any event, I only play at most about 10 characters, and I have been placing near the top more and more since this healing change occurred.  For reference, you can get 10 character slots with the free real-money currency you earn within the first month or so of playing.\n\ntl;dr -- This is a fun, well designed game, and the developers are thinking about the long-term health of the game with their decisions.  As in many free-to-play games, you must spend either money or time to advance and succeed, but both are viable options.  Additionally, you will need to play well and be smart with both your match-3 tactics and your roster decision strategies to have the best chance to succeed in the game and its events.  Thanks to the recent controversial change that many others complain about, you no longer need to devote 8+ hours a day during an event to have a chance to succeed.","August 5, 2014","true","361.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

(Matches aren't timed, but opponents take alternating turns against you, with possibilities for long strings of watching the computer play when it gets a lucky combo.) The game makes full use of 4- and 5-matches, giving each a different bonus, and recognizing T-shaped and L-shaped 5-matches. (Games that don't do this drive me crazy.)\n\nAs a free-to-play game, I like that everything in-game is still accessible without purchase. Progression is a bit slower, of course, but it is possible to win "hero points" (in-game gold) and expand the slots available for heroes.\n\nThe unique elements of this game are two-fold:\n1) A collectable card-game like element of choosing which heroes to keep and level up, and which combinations to use in each battle.\n2) A chance for gamers not already steeped in superhero lore to get to know Marvel characters and interactions a bit better. It's quickly turning me into a fan!\n\nThere are two modes of play: "story mode" and "versus".\n* Story mode has in-character intro and outro dialog, pulling you into a comic storyline. It's a fun way to immerse yourself in the lore of the Marvel universe.\n* Versus mode pits your selection of heroes against heroes from another player's roster. It is worth noting that you are not actually playing the other person, but rather the AI using their heroes and abilities. This is a huge positive for me, because I don't have to deal with connection lags, people who afk for long periods, or trolling in a chat window. But if you're looking to match wits against a human opponent, this might leaving you wanting for more.\n\nOver 40 hours in, this continues to be a deeply engaging game!","January 15, 2015","true","183.2"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

As detailed in reviews below, the mechanic for health is an issue, and then there is the AI, which is designed to cheat. It will be able to use abilities it does not have the points for, and Team Ups are messed up in the AI's favour.\n\nThe final thing which makes me uninstall the game less than half an hour into playing, is that you cannot link your mobile and Steam accounts together, despite the quote from the developer that "The PC version runs off the same code and servers as the mobile versions. Battle against anyone, regardless of what device they're using", that couldn't be any further from the truth.\nSo, they hope you will double dip, spending money in both versions. Well, not this guy, and hopefully you won't either :) If you're thinking about installing this version and you're already invested in the mobile version, change your mind.","October 6, 2014","false","0.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","1"

The game is currently running during the Dark Reign period Marvel had. From what I gather, it's following that storyline pretty good. As for the game, there is a good source of strategy to matching your colors, gaining AP (attack points) to get your heroes to use their special abilities. There are anywhere from 2-3 abilities for each hero and some of them 0-2 of them could be passive based on the hero/villian you get. Each hero also gains their powers through "covers" and each of these can be strengthend to a power of 5. As you gain more covers, you can then increase your heroes level as well.

As a fun of puzzle quest, I got hook to this game early on.\n\nHowever, the pay-to-enjoy aspect kills it for me. The game encourages players to have a large roster of heroes in order to enjoy a specific mission for the week. In order to increase your roster, you need to gain a currency which is acquired through drops from prologue battles, finishing a mission with a high ranking score than other players or purchase it with real money.\n\nObtaining a hero you want or levelling a hero you have also requires too much time and money. Gaining a 1 or 2 star hero is not a problem. Getting a 3 to 4 star though is a different story. You either have to be lucky at getting a 3 star hero from the standard cover drop, finish a mission with a high ranking score, or use gold to get draw a cover from the mission drop.\n","April 30","false","282.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Spending real money is by no means necessary, and although it speeds up your progress it does not make you more powerful than equal leveled players who have not spent money. The primary use for real money is to buy extra character slots, but you can earn the necessary currency by playing in the campaign or the semi-PvP daily and weekly events. Although a number of other reviewers have voiced dislike for the time based healing system, I actually really like it. Taking damage to your Heroes is bad, and the game is more enjoyable because of this difficulty backed up with a real penalty!

I would think that if you were a fan of the first couple of Puzzle Quest games then you might enjoy this game as it scratches that same itch.  Most of the adjustments to the gameplay are interesting takes on the old formula, which I think are pleasant.\n\nHowever, recently the publisher has made the game more of a chore to play than anything.  They are employing several different tactics to try to squeeze more money out of the players, to the point where it has become a hindrance to my enjoyment of the game.  By aggressively trying to find ways to get money by adding new 'features' that limit the playerbase unless you are willing to pay more (and more and more) they have completely destroyed my enjoyment of this game.

It combines match-3 with cardfight (not sure what they are called) games where you level up your cards. Here you level up your (Marvel) heroes by earning Iso-8 and by earning their skills.\nThere are events that give you big prices (lots of Iso-8 or recruit tokens for more heroes).\n\nMore heroes. That's why I wouldn't recomment this game. You start with roster of 4 heroes. For every extra hero you need to buy an extra slot for Gold. You guessed it, gold is real money.\nFour hero slots is nothing. I played less than a day and already had 10 heroes (5 rostered and 5 waiting to be recruited).\n\nIf that part of the game was any different or if buying with real money doesn't bother you: play this game. It's nice. Good graphics, nice sound effects, good skills and there's even a storyline.\nFor me however that's a dealbreaker.

Classic use of a popular license to get people hooked in and then letting them pay in order to advance in the game. Basically just a retheme with some minor twists to the gameplay, but without any kind of real innovation. And in case you actually like it, you're forced to grind the levels over and over again or pay up to get your loot and levels faster.

You don't really have to pay if you don't mind moving along in a snail's pace, but you'll get there, eventually. They started requiring that you use certain characters to be able to progress through certain events in order to finish in a good place (good place has better rewards etc etc) , so you either won that specificy character last event, or you purchased it, or you are pretty much destined to finish in a place other than first throughout the event.\nYou can also link up the mobile version with this one so you can play the same account on both devices, takes a few days to get them synced, however, it took them 8 days to sync mine.\nIt's a nice game, though, hopefully they balance it out between F2P and P2W.","December 20, 2013","true","69.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Spending real money is by no means necessary, and although it speeds up your progress it does not make you more powerful than equal leveled players who have not spent money. The primary use for real money is to buy extra character slots, but you can earn the necessary currency by playing in the campaign or the semi-PvP daily and weekly events. Although a number of other reviewers have voiced dislike for the time based healing system, I actually really like it. Taking damage to your Heroes is bad, and the game is more enjoyable because of this difficulty backed up with a real penalty!

A lot if issues that other people are having can be lessen by playing in short sessions, such at 10 to 30 minutes at a time, especially with free heroes that the game will give you every few days, as well as cash shop currancy. With this game being on PC, we're acustomed to playing an hour or more, and this game penalizes that without using cash.\n\nOne new game mechanic added to the Puzzle Quest system are abilities that effect tiles on the board. Such as Iron Man placing Protect Tiles, that turn the normal gems in to shielded gems to reduce damage to your heroes, or Storm's Attack Tiles that damage your opponent. They still behave like normal gems, in that you can match them to other colors and they'll go away. Some of your enemies also place gems that have a count down timer, and will activate after a number of turns have pasted. Like HAMMER Assassins that will place Sniper Tiles on the board, and will deal heavy damage to your heros after a few turns have passed. This helps you as a player, since you can prevent the enemies abilities by matching those countdown tiles, and removing the ability before it has a chance to go off.\n\nThe worst part about this game, is that when your heroes are damaged or knocked out in a game, they will have to recover and this can take up to an hour or more without using heal packs. You start out with a dozen or so, but once you run out, you'll have to pay cash for more. Also, improving your hero is terrible. Instead of earning experience in battles, you earn this ISO-8 currancy, and you spend that on heroes to improve their base health and a few other stats. To improve their abilities, you have to either spend a ton of the premium currancy or hope that you get another copy of that hero. Say you have Captain America, and he only has one ability. To unlock his other 2 abilities, you'll need another Captain America, with that ability, and add his to your hero. It requires too much luck to improve just one hero, and Puzzle Quest's bosses are betting that will pay tons of money to do so.\n\nYes, this game has a lot of options to get ahead with cash purchases, and these purchases won't go very far, since most of them are completely random. Say you really want Spider-man on your team, then you have to option of fighting Venom to win a Spider-man with a Fantastic Four suit or throw a few dollars at random hero packs and pray he turns up.\n\nI do recommend this game for tablets, since it's best suit to short play sessions.","December 21, 2013","true","10.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yayforbeers/recommended/234330/","yayforbeers","YayForBeers","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yayforbeers/","186 products in account","This game gets a bad rep.. and mostly because people are cheap.  Here's my take on it:\n\nI know my "time played" only says a little over an hour.  But I've easily put 10+ hours into the iPhone version.  And I've never had to spend a dime.  It's a game you can EASILY play for 30 minutes, then come back to, rinse and repeat.  And you would never need to spend money.  I've done very well in the iPhone version and never bought anything from the store.\n\nFor the PC players.. the game is free.  FREE.  What do you expect for Free?  Have you ever worked at a software company?  Probably not.  Any developer of software would be out of business in a month if they just gave you free games that never asked for micro-transactions.  All you have to do is click the X and move on.\n\nPersonally, when I tried the PC version, I enjoyed it.  It's pretty much the exact same game, but without the limiting frames of the smart phone versions.  Very big and bright.  But otherwise identical.  It's Bejeweled, and every once in a while a Marvel Hero artwork jumps out and throws some particle effects around.\n\nCons?  Yeah, there are definitely some.  This is a VERY cash shop oriented game that will remind you at every turn that you can buy tokens, iso-8, characters, covers, etc etc etc.  But like most games of this ilk, you can get around that if you don't suck at it, and use your resources wisely.  Sure, there's a bit of luck involved.. and God forbid you would have to spend $5-10 to support the developer of a game you got FOR FREE.  My only other gripe is that the smart phone version of it doesn't sync with the steam version.. it really sucks having to start over when playing it on PC, when I have a bad ♥♥♥ team on my phone.\n\nIn the end, I give this a 8/10.  It's no Puzzle Quest 2 (but what is) and all I can say is that if money is that big of a problem for you, then video games shouldn't be your hobby.  Maybe get a better job.  :)\n\n","December 28, 2013","true","183.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

He is opposed by Iron Man, Black Widow, Storm, Hawkeye, Wolverine, and Thor. It ends with a fairly high level boss fight, which can be easily beaten with stuns or heal abuse because it's a three-on-one curbstomp.\n\nAfter that, you can go through weekly events against other players to earn more ISO-8, which is your experience, or Hero Points, which can get you more slots for more characters. Most of these events have restrictions or characters that get bonuses in stats, encouraging you to use them in your team and keep the characters you're not as interested in.\n\nI haven't seen the pay-to-win much in my time of playing. Even if you buy ISO-8 and Hero Points, you're still going to have to keep up against people who have more experience with their characters than you and can set up teams with better gem coverage. And even if you get a full party of rare characters, they don't all work together as well as the lower level characters, and many of the three star characters have weaknesses to their powers, such as Iron Man Model 40's Recharge, which provides gems to use on other attacks, but stuns Iron Man for two turns.\n\nOverall, I enjoy this a good bit, and recommend it to others.","March 8, 2014","true","136.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I would think that if you were a fan of the first couple of Puzzle Quest games then you might enjoy this game as it scratches that same itch.  Most of the adjustments to the gameplay are interesting takes on the old formula, which I think are pleasant.\n\nHowever, recently the publisher has made the game more of a chore to play than anything.  They are employing several different tactics to try to squeeze more money out of the players, to the point where it has become a hindrance to my enjoyment of the game.  By aggressively trying to find ways to get money by adding new 'features' that limit the playerbase unless you are willing to pay more (and more and more) they have completely destroyed my enjoyment of this game.

You can try to grind it out but you won't really make much progress.  This is a game that is sort of fun to play when you first get it, but then it starts throwing tougher enemies at your low level team.  They get knocked out, you have to wait, you play again, eventually you win and get a reward and then...you can't really use the reward since you only get a few free character slots.  You have to buy more.  Yeah...and you have to pretty much buy anything else to make the game playable beyond the initial starting misssions.  The freebies were fun, but the cost to keep playing is not my idea of money well spent.  You have $10 sitting around?  Wait for a sale and get a good game you can keep playing over and over.  On the other hand, if this your thing, spending money and more money to play a "free game" so you can keep up, then go right ahead.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MasterOfLazyness/recommended/234330/","MasterOfLazyness","MasterOfLazyness","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MasterOfLazyness/","270 products in account","Okay, so this clearly isn't a Triple A title but it can still be good right? Right?\n\nThe answer is no. It isn't. It has good elements of fun. It's fairly entertaining as you gather new heroes, upgrade the ones you like, have cool and sometimes very useful special attacks. So what's the issue then? It's boring and poorly made.\n\nWell first off, the game is basically a Mobile Game ported to PC without ANY of the things a PC port should have. It doesn't have a resolution that would be fitting for a PC and instead looks like you're playing a Tablet game on your monitor. While that may not sound that bad, I've noticed even some of the UI choices are still touch screen like. It overall feels down right aweful to look at for extended periods of time.\n\nNext is the gameplay itself, it's very barebones as the best animations you will see is the little Gems going POOF from chain completions. The special attacks consit of your character of choice flying into the center of the screen and waggling a bit with some flashing lights and sounds.\n\nOnce you figure out if you can enjoy the gameplay or not comes the ways you upgrade your heroes. It's basically random lottery as you have to get another copy of your hero to upgrade their skills, after which you then need to use ISO-8 the magical nonsense item to then increase their level. You also can only have so many heroes before you need to purchase more slots. Now that isn't too bad as it's normal, the problem is you can only use what is basically a "Money" currency which is limited as you only get some per day unless you wish to pay for it. The same currency is used for pretty much everything and they will try their damnedest to get you to waste it on heroes, upgrades, level increases, etc. Then they shoehorn in some Healing character nonsense that basically ripped off from Facebook games.\n\nThe story missions try ever so hard to entertain and keep you interested but the lack of voices, new images and basically an interesting story that hasn't been heard over and over again, brings it down on its knees. The more interesting and rewarding stories are locked out until you play and gather Strong/OP heroes. It's not even recommended that you try them WHATSOEVER until you're very well off into the game as they will not only stomp you out but cause you to need "Health packs" just to recover and continue playing the game. The next part of story missions is that they often can be replayed for different loot, the problem is even though it says 1/4 things to be looted you can still gain something that ISN'T an option as loot. I've gotten ISO-20 which wasn't an option instead of ISO-100 or another Iron Man. When all you do is want to have 4/4 in loot and you have to replay the same, easy, boring level repeatedly just to make sure you have everything useful from that mission, it gets very boring.\n\nThe art direction is okay at best; you have art work that doesn't look the best on these big screens as it's made for much smaller ones. The characters don't have the best animations as they seem more and more like paper cutouts than they do powerful superheroes. It's pretty underwhelming watching them play out an unskippable animation.\n\nThe sound is basically the same as the art direction, bland, boring and not that interesting. I was really hoping for some good Marvel action tunes.\n\nIn short, the game starts off okay but slowly turns into a long road through Pay to Play. Not too bad if played in short, short bursts but very boring if you're going to play for hours at a time.\n\n3 Broken Gems out of 10.","October 3, 2014","false","18.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Most of the criticism of this game revolves around the 'pay to win' accusations, and in a sense they're true, you're unlikely to win most of the main events if you don't sink some money into buying new heroes, health packs or slots for new heroes, so if you're the kind of person who wants to open it up and play for hours non-stop without paying a thing this game will likely frustrate you.\n\nFor me I didn't want to spend much on this game, I've spent a total of £6 after 100 hours playing and I don't intend to spend anymore. When I play I'm not in a rush and am happy to slowly build up my heroes over time, I play in shorter bursts to do certain events and can play in windowed mode to rotate it around with other things. Some people get annoyed because if you lose and have run out of health packs the only way to get more is to buy them or wait to win more in certain events.\n\nAs for the actual gameplay, there's not much to say. You pick three of your heroes against opposition and match the colours up to best suit the abilities of your selected heroes. It's puzzlequest and free to try out if you're unsure. Also note that for the multiplayer you are not actually playing against other people, it is against three of their heroes that the ai controls.","March 3, 2014","true","225.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I downloaded it the day it came out on iOS and I have played the PC Version since beta.  I have been a fan of Puzzle Quest since playing the original on my PSP, and well that plus Marvel really got me interested.  The gameplay is fun, really dig the UI (especially on PC), and there's a fun variety of characters and abilities.  That said, I feel since launch the developers have put in a lot of walls that were not previously there for the sake of them making more money.  I understand that game development is a business and making money is good, but the game was much more fun in previous versions.  That doesn't stop me from playing it like a no good junkie, though.","January 3, 2014","true","98.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

You start with 3 basic heroes after doing the tutorial and you have to manage to lvl up using the ISO points you obtain by winning battles. Some battles on the campaign gives you extra heroes or hero points (hero points are the ones you need to have extra slots for more heroes).\n\nIts a bit slow at the beginning because every time a hero takes damages, it needs time to restore his hp, so whe you have only 3 heroes it can be a bit slow to advance. But as soon as you have 5+ heroes and reach lvl 10+ with some of them, you can keep playing almost indefinitly without having to spend real money on the game. Paying real money on this game only gives you a faster progression, but you can manage to do everything just by playing the game.\n\nIf you like puzzle games its worth to try this one, just have in mind the first few hours are a bit slow if you dont invest real money.\n\n","December 18, 2013","true","343.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

In the beginning I found Thor, Wolverine and Juggernaut to be especially useful in various teams, all 3 are extremely resilient and in the earlier stages of the game Juggernaut's red ability can usually one shot any enemy.

He is opposed by Iron Man, Black Widow, Storm, Hawkeye, Wolverine, and Thor. It ends with a fairly high level boss fight, which can be easily beaten with stuns or heal abuse because it's a three-on-one curbstomp.\n\nAfter that, you can go through weekly events against other players to earn more ISO-8, which is your experience, or Hero Points, which can get you more slots for more characters. Most of these events have restrictions or characters that get bonuses in stats, encouraging you to use them in your team and keep the characters you're not as interested in.\n\nI haven't seen the pay-to-win much in my time of playing. Even if you buy ISO-8 and Hero Points, you're still going to have to keep up against people who have more experience with their characters than you and can set up teams with better gem coverage. And even if you get a full party of rare characters, they don't all work together as well as the lower level characters, and many of the three star characters have weaknesses to their powers, such as Iron Man Model 40's Recharge, which provides gems to use on other attacks, but stuns Iron Man for two turns.\n\nOverall, I enjoy this a good bit, and recommend it to others.","March 8, 2014","true","136.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Don't heed people who say it's micro transactions galore. You can play without paying. Everyday there are several multiplayer events in which you can participate for free and win lots of Iso-8 and HP (game's more valuable other currency) if you are successful enough. There is also a huge single player campaign with lots of rewards. I don't know what people are complaining about. There is one thing though. If you are very competitive then you might feel you need to pay to get ahead of others. It will only save you game play time. Others will catch up to you if you pay, but it will take a while. Since I enjoy the game as it is and I'm a casual gamer at heart, I enjoy it a lot.\n\nThe game is addictive. I also played old Puzzle Quest: Challenge of the Warlords. I had enjoyed that one though I didn't finish it. This is a bit different from that one in how leveling works and the fact that you don't have a single character to play with.

Will you need to spend money? A little at the start to get yourself some more room for new heroes. Will you have to continue spending money and be slowly drained to death by mobile gaming business practices?  No. I spent $30 in total.. have 65 roster slots out of the 91. There are lots of ways to earn the currency over time. Patience is your friend. The first month or two will be a little stressful because of the roster situation, if you like their twist on match 3 and enjoy match 3 games.. then it is worth $20 to get those roster slots and free up some pressure.\n\nThe only real complaint with the game is that you can NOT expect to play it whenever you feel like it. It is a mobile game after all, meant to occupy 30mins to an hour of your day every like 8-12 hours. There is a few missions that you can play just for laughs, but once you get all the rewards out of them the only things left to do are competitive PVE and PVP event, and the Deadpool Daily (which is all I really do anymore) which doesn't force you to compete for points against other players.

At first, I played a few times, and then stopped playing for a few months as I wasn't sure if it was really my thing or not. I'm not sure what made me decide to try it again one day, but as you can no doubt tell from the hours I've got recorded playing this game, I kinda liked it... just a little ;) It's likely that it was the whole 'feemium' thing that turned me off to start, but this game is generous enough to make you want to keep playing without NEEDING to spend money.\n\nI've never been a comic fanatic or anything, but I've always enjoyed the characters from the Marvel universe, and loved watching the old cartoons like X-Men.\nOver the years I've been playing this game, I have spent the odd bit of cash here and there, but I don't think the amount I've spent would only come to around $30 I'd say.\n\nThe team at D3 are continually adding new features and characters which keep my interest, and I am a member of an alliance with a group of firends who play, which makes it a little more fun, being able to discuss things with the group. It also allows you to get extra bonuses, as when your alliance members do well in events, the whole alliance will get rewards.\n\nThis is a great game to play while having my morning coffee, as it's quick, yet rewarding, but at times during certain events, can be brutally difficult (Damn ninjas!! *shakes fist*). It wouldn't be much fun if it was a walk in the park though!\nIt's also great that they have daily events, which keeps me coming back to see what's new and what else I can get! (This unlocks after you've played through a certain amount of the single player, so don't give up too soon!)\n\nIf you've ever played match 3 games, and enjoyed them, I can't recommend this one highly enough. Building up an ever expanding roster of characters as fun as the game itself!\nIn my opinion, it's by far the best of all the Puzzle Quest games that have been released, and I even though I have spent many years playing this game, I can't see myself stopping any time soon!","January 28","true","993.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's awesome.\nI can't say how long the fun will last, but I do love the whole setup of the game.\nYou collect comic book covers and currency to unlock characters and abilities, you can join your friends in a team online and everyone apparently gets bonuses for members of the team playing the game.\n\nMy only frustration (as with most mobile-related games nowadays) is the time-based restriction of progress and unlockables (I haven't gotten far enough in the game to be sure about this, but I think this is seems like the only easy way to consistently get coins/tokens to unlock slots in your roster. You need this to add new members to your team.). Naturally, you're able to get past these restrictions with microtransactions.\nFair enough, if these restrictions weren't in place, every dedicated player would have the strongest possible team in no time. I just wish there was a way to constantly progress without thinking about using real-world money.\n\nAaaanyway, overall, this game is really fun and I'm enjoying it so far.\nLet's go with 8/10.\n-1 for the crappy mobile port that still says "tap" instead of "click"\nand -1 because of the constant need for patience and/or microtransactions if you wanna get everything in the game.","January 13","true","19.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It is kind of hard to rate, though; it's fun enough to play casually, but it makes casual play difficult with its problematic scaling that so often doesn't work and a level system that is completely dysfunctional.\n\nIt really tries super-hard for microtransactions, which I understand are helpful to the developers, but good grief. When the game itself is made less fun and, more importantly, less functional for the sake of encouraging pay-to-win (or at least, pay to have more of a fun game), I feel there has been a fundamental failure.\n\nIf a game, in and of itself, is fun, microtransactions can enhance that. But the most crucial part where Marvel Puzzle Quest falls short is that the game so often isn't fun, with a frequently cheap AI, problematic scaling algorithm, and restrictions and level-locking everywhere you look.\n\nThere are many characters to choose from, which is very appealing, and the art and animations are great for what they are. Unfortunately this also is a double-edged sword, since you'll unquestionably find yourself up against the old and familiar obstacle of never really getting characters you want -- and being unable to just buy the specific character you do, even with real money -- and instead getting no end of characters you really don't.\n\nI really wish Marvel Puzzle Quest had a more casual play option, but everything is geared to "encourage" you to spend real money on making the game a more fun experience, which it should have been from the start. I know it's a free game, but it would be a lot more enjoyable, and I think more people would be more willing to give it a better score and recommendation, if it were a game priced reasonably and given a limited cash shop, but crafted better and more enjoyably. It's just a plain fact that they couldn't find a way to monetize a more casual play option, so it's not there. As a result, playing the game often ends up a frustrating reminder that if you'd just pony up the cash, you could probably have more fun.\n\nMeanwhile, Juggernaut's getting his fist ready. Better bend over. Some of the characters are plainly broken outright, and Juggernaut? He's one of them. Not only does he have massive health, but all of his moves are devastating. And you guessed it: he will always -- always -- get the combos he needs.","May 21","false","6.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

There are many different metrics by which you can make easy, regular progress.  Acquiring new characters, levelling them up, progressing through story missions, and reaching new reward tiers during the events all make it feel like your are gaining something.  Ultimately, though, it feels like a continuous grind with no real end goal.  Like many micro-transaction based games, it is more interesting to see how far you can progress without making a purchase than to buy either of their in-game currencies, so this may truely be a free-to-play game for you.","September 22, 2014","true","416.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I want to like it so much. And there are times I do. This is a rant, pure and simple.\n\nAnd then the overhwleming amount of the time I see it for the money grab it is. One battle where the underpowered AI pulls off a random cascade of combos puts my strongest characters out for three hours and there is nothing I can do.\n\nI can't wain tournaments to get 2 star, 3 star or 4 star characters because I'm put in tournaments with people who have strong characters. Even if I do manage to win one, I then have to wait for my heroes to heal. And in that time I'm attacked so many times I'm back to no points in the tournament.\n\nI'll admit I have no life recently, so I've spent a whole day trying to get to the top in an event. And it just isn't possible. While I can devote every hour, I will always lose to someone with a few high level 3 stars who is put in the same event as me.\n\nIt must be really fun for someone who has a lot of money, because as soon as you have good characters, the game rewards you with more through the tournaments and events. I'm beginning to see that no matter how long I play, I will always be behind because the devs give no chance for me to catch up. Those who already have 3 star characters are pulling away and getting more. By the time I have one, who I can decently level with covers, they will have 20.\n\nAnd why can't we turn covers into a free level for our character, rather than have to sell them? I'm sick of getting the same 1 star cover for characters with maxed powers. The only rewards I can get are standard tokens, so at least make them useful in some way.","December 24, 2013","false","237.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The core gameplay is fun, but the pvp events seem to favor those who choose to drop large amounts of money, or have devoted an insane amount of time. Levelling the characters can be frustrating because of how little iso8, akak xp, you get after completing past levels and even new levels. The event PVE's do off good rewards though. Allowing you to get recruit tokens of varying types somewhat easily. There seems to be a decent amount of hackers though. Players who have thousands of points in the event with low level characters pop up fairly often and it can be frustrating.\n\nGameplay wise: It is fun to play in quick bursts, but the leveling and hero acquisition can be frustrating.

Eventually, the problems started like being a free to play game, it's built around the concept of spending money now or wait a while. Early on, you can get through the levels and it's fun, but as you get into the game, you'll notice that your heroes take damage in the puzzle battles, so you can wait like 15 minutes for one guy to heal, so ok go and use your other Avengers. The further you get, the more the waiting times add up, and the game wants you to buy health packs with real money. It also doesn't carry over from version to version so if you did spend money on microtransactions on Steam, it wouldn't show up on a mobile version that you own. It's a big waste of time, and potentially money if you go that route. It doesn't offer a great deal of free content before it tries every last resort to bleed you for money.","April 18, 2014","false","0.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It seemed that the items were very overpriced (and they are), and that I couldn't get anything I wanted.  However, If you are smart at how you spend your money, use your items, and which characters you play, you can do very well in this game with little or no cash.  The real game is in the PvP, which isn't PvP at all really.  The Prologue, is just that, a starting to the real game.  Once you get 3 characters around 25-30 you can actually start playing the game which is all in building various teams who's abilities compliment each other.  I started out with Iron Man Model 35, Storm Modern, and Black Widow Modern.  This team will take you very far.  Now the anchor of my team is Black Widow Original.  She can heal and steal AP so I almost always end a fight with full health.  She does very well with Wolverine or Thor.  As you can see I've spent many hours playing this game on my PC (although half or more was probably AFK time.)  I've spent $10 on this game and I've felt it was a good choice.  My husband also plays and he spent $5.  We both spent the money to buy hero coins which we used to open slots for more characters. You will need at least 12 to get started and I currently have 18. 18 slots is enough to keep my favorites.  I never felt the need or pressure to buy for anything else.\n\nA note on the PvP, you get to choose who you play.  If you don't like the team, press skip, and you will be presented with another choice.  You can find teams you can beat at any level and since the very dumb AI is controlling the opposing team you can generally beat teams much higher level with smart play.  You get either 70 or 140 ISO-8 for every match you win, and you should be winning nearly all of them since you get to choose who you fight.  With an average of 105 ISO-8  per match and matches lasting about 3 minutes  you can level up characters very quickly in RPG terms.  However it probably seems slow for a casual mobile app.  You get points in tournaments based on the ranking of the team you fight, not their level, so with smart picks and persistence you can rank well and get good rewards early on, but if you have to come in first, you're going to have to work hard and wait a long time.  In addition to the end of tournament rewards, there are frequently progression rewards which you get regardless of your final ranking.  As there are frequently multiple tournaments hapening simultaneously and shield trainer always available, even after you've exhauseted the story line rewards there is always plenty to do and more characters to collect.\n\nI find Marvel Puzzle Quest fun and surprisingly addictive, yet not at all pay to win.  In fact, the items are so expensive that several hundred dollars wouldn't get you very far. So those who do spend mony don't have any real advantage beyond saving a few minutes.  In summary, if you can get over the slow grind to level 30, this game really takes off and becomes much more fun.  Don't spend hero coins or money on anything other than opening up more roster slots until you fully understand what you are getting in return (i.e. hardly anthing). Participate in the tournaments early and often as this is where the ISO-8 you need to level your characters comes from even if you don't place well.  I'm not surprised that the people who only played an hour don't like it, though.  It's not really a play for a few minutes kinda game.  It's much better suited to long sessions on the PC.  It's the most fun I've had for $10 in a while.","January 13, 2014","true","200.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You get either 70 or 140 ISO-8 for every match you win, and you should be winning nearly all of them since you get to choose who you fight.  With an average of 105 ISO-8  per match and matches lasting about 3 minutes  you can level up characters very quickly in RPG terms.  However it probably seems slow for a casual mobile app.  You get points in tournaments based on the ranking of the team you fight, not their level, so with smart picks and persistence you can rank well and get good rewards early on, but if you have to come in first, you're going to have to work hard and wait a long time.  In addition to the end of tournament rewards, there are frequently progression rewards which you get regardless of your final ranking.  As there are frequently multiple tournaments hapening simultaneously and shield trainer always available, even after you've exhauseted the story line rewards there is always plenty to do and more characters to collect.\n\nI find Marvel Puzzle Quest fun and surprisingly addictive, yet not at all pay to win.  In fact, the items are so expensive that several hundred dollars wouldn't get you very far. So those who do spend mony don't have any real advantage beyond saving a few minutes.  In summary, if you can get over the slow grind to level 30, this game really takes off and becomes much more fun.  Don't spend hero coins or money on anything other than opening up more roster slots until you fully understand what you are getting in return (i.e. hardly anthing). Participate in the tournaments early and often as this is where the ISO-8 you need to level your characters comes from even if you don't place well.  I'm not surprised that the people who only played an hour don't like it, though.  It's not really a play for a few minutes kinda game.  It's much better suited to long sessions on the PC.  It's the most fun I've had for $10 in a while.","January 13, 2014","true","200.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The in game economy was always horribly broken. The 100 to 1 Hero Point ratio was not bad, but what it bought you was ridiculous. For an example unlocking one level of a skill in a three star(Rare) character is 1250 HP. Or $12.50. They want $12.50 to unlock one level of one skill of which there are 13 per character. Or around $150 if you want to completely unlock one character.\n\nFine, I was happy to play alound with the covers I could get through tournament rewards and the daily drops. Then came along the latest patch. Instead of fixing the rampant cheating or other various broken portions of the game, they decide to nerf some of the better characters that are relatively easy for the free players to get. No Devs, they weren't overpowered, they were accessible and most of the other accessible characters suck. Again, nerfing happens, most devs have still yet to realize it's better to balance up than down, but any relatively experienced gamer is used to that. But they also decided to start charging HP for the +3AP to all boost. They're now charging the equivalent of $1 for a stack of three boosts that will last maybe 10 to 15 minutes of game time and is very necessary for the casual players. The devs basically too a look at the game stats, saw what the casual players used most, and either made them less effective or started charging for them.\n\nI had intended on buying $15 or so worth of HP to support the game and buy some roster slots, but I am definitely glad I waited and they will now never see a dime from me.","January 30, 2014","false","102.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Also, choosing which ally is in front isn't very obvious either, even tho it's critical sometimes to know exactly who's in the front line and who will get the hit.\n\nThis game, being free to play, has a leveling system that requires coins, which you can buy in the in-game store or otherwise purchase with real money. I'm not a big fan of free to play games for this reason, so it took away from my enjoyment of the game.\n\nThe art and animations are pretty good, and the "storyline" is ok for a Marvel storyline. It's mostly just a big excuse to put all the Marvel characters together, but it does enough to provide a background for the game.\n\nOnly not recommending this game because I dislike free to play.

You are able to win some of the precious purchasable tokens as rewards, but nowhere near enough to keep up with the characters you receive.\n\n2) While the game lets you play on a variety of places, and in fact makes you sign up with a random external system... there are no in game links to the external system, and they seem to have removed the ability for this Steam version to properly synch with the other devices. I believe some people can and have done this, but either it's been removed from this version, or if you didn't immediately agree then your one opportuniy to do this is never repeated.\n\n3) Lack of in-game support.  Sure - everyone who has played PQ or even anything like it knows the basics.  And there is a tutorial mode which is ridiculously hand-holding, but... later when you want to look up stupid technical things, it is quite difficult to navigate.\n\n4) Everything suddenly gets tied to PvP, which causes everything to be heavily Pay to Win.  There's not enough story of appropriate level to keep people playing on a PvE level... so you either fork out cash to level, or you ... stop playing?\n\nProblem: I love superheroes.  I love Puzzle Quest.  This... is... almost? ish? what people should expect from a free-to-play game that works on phones and tablets (at least these days) but I have objections to games that make you stop playing them as a game mechanic... especially on a PC.

Eventually, the problems started like being a free to play game, it's built around the concept of spending money now or wait a while. Early on, you can get through the levels and it's fun, but as you get into the game, you'll notice that your heroes take damage in the puzzle battles, so you can wait like 15 minutes for one guy to heal, so ok go and use your other Avengers. The further you get, the more the waiting times add up, and the game wants you to buy health packs with real money. It also doesn't carry over from version to version so if you did spend money on microtransactions on Steam, it wouldn't show up on a mobile version that you own. It's a big waste of time, and potentially money if you go that route. It doesn't offer a great deal of free content before it tries every last resort to bleed you for money.","April 18, 2014","false","0.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It was possible to beat almost anyone at the same level as you with even the basic three characters of Storm, Black Widow, and Iron Man. Even tougher enemies were no problem if you had boosts. Boosts were availavble for cheap in game currency of ISO-8 which you easily can get playing any level.  Only two of them required the premium currency of coins.  Now boosts have doubled in Iso-8 price and even more of them require coins to purchase.  The developers have totally changed it to pay to win.

The core gameplay is fun, but the pvp events seem to favor those who choose to drop large amounts of money, or have devoted an insane amount of time. Levelling the characters can be frustrating because of how little iso8, akak xp, you get after completing past levels and even new levels. The event PVE's do off good rewards though. Allowing you to get recruit tokens of varying types somewhat easily. There seems to be a decent amount of hackers though. Players who have thousands of points in the event with low level characters pop up fairly often and it can be frustrating.\n\nGameplay wise: It is fun to play in quick bursts, but the leveling and hero acquisition can be frustrating. Pay to win is a little too obvious. Otherwise, I find it fun to play, but I try and take breaks otherwise I get frustrated.","February 9, 2014","true","137.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It can be daunting at first to jump into a F2P game, there is always that flashing notification to encourage you to spend money.\n\nHowever, Marvel Puzzle Quest is balanced well that if you choose to spend time over money you will find a good amount of success.","January 26","true","768.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I find it to be a somewhat repetitive but still enjoyable game.  Mechanically the battles are done using a match-3 mechanic, like a bejeweled game.  It's not hard, but I'd say it's more challenging than Candy Crush or other similar games.  The tricky part is that there's a paper-rock-sissors element to the characters, and you need to match enough a certain color gem to enable a hero's power to be used.  Like many other free-to-play games, there are two currencies, one common and another rare.  (plus a third, command points, which was recently introduced and can unlock much stronger four or five star characters).\n\nThe real key to success in this game is patience and persistance.  It's somewhat pay to win, but the truth is that I'd say it's pay-regularly-to-frequently-win, or play-frequently-and-do-ok. If you just keep plugging away, your characters will continue to improve, and you'll stay reasonably competitive for a long time.  It's fairly easy to play entirely for free, though I'll admit I found there was a point somewhere around the mid-two-star level where I coughed up some actual money in order to not lose characters. In retrospect, this was unnecesary, but I didn't realize it at the time. I'd recommend reading through some of the great guides on the marvel puzzle quest forum for advice on which characters to keep and which to get rid of.\n\nI think the most fun part of this game, over time, is that the developers truly seem interested in keeping it alive and interesting. I like how they keep introducing new mechanics.  I feel like sometimes they don't entirely think through the result of their actions on the way that people play the game.  For example, right now with new command points, rewards for people like myself working on their four-stars is definitely skewed to PvE rather than PvP.  I don't know if the developers did this intentionally, or just don't realize it.  But whatever. It's still fun, and somehow it's more fun for the fact that they're not entirely polished and thoughtful in their actions.   Some people get bent out of shape about this, but I actually think the chaos that comes with each new game mechanic or meta-change keeps things fresh.\n\nI'd recommend it for the tablet or phone.  It's the perfect game to play once or twice a day over lunch break.","December 14, 2015","true","0.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This Steam launch version is the exact same model as the current (updated yesterday) version on iOS, on which I have spent ZERO real money, and my characters are level capped and I am enjoying the game quite a bit.  TLDR: give it time, don't spend real money, missions are the way to go!","December 5, 2013","true","11.5"," 21 of 44 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","21","44","0","0"

Don't put this game down for microtransactions since you don't need to spend a dollar with all the rewards the tournametns and the PvE gives you.\n\n-Update-\n\nI still see people are complaining about the Microtransactions.\n\n1) If you play the game daily roughly 2 hours a day and do all the missions in the PVE events and PVP a couple times a day you should get roughly 3,000-5,000 Iso-8, the tool to level up your characters. It costs roughly 20k Iso-8 to max out any 1* Hero and roughly 80k to max out a 2* hero. You will be able to max out any 1* or 2* character within weeks of just playing a couple hours a day.\n\n2. You will also roughly get a few hundred Hero Points in the process, if you are starting out the game. Use them on the 100 Daily Deal Heroic pack. That is how you max out your 2*s. If you have played the game for a while, save the Hero Points for Alliance slots, or join an open alliance. I created a 20 person alliance and only spent twenty bucks on it, I could have waited a month for the same ammount of Hero Points. ((Some people spent a hundred))\n\n3. Now for the 3* covers, playing a lot in any tournament or event will nail you 1-3 3* covers of one hero. You will also get covers through the Heroic Packs and any other special pack that you spend your free hero points on. They require alot of Iso-8 to max out. 170k for a rough estimate. HOWEVER the final level still requires only 2500 iso-8, which is something you can easily get within an hour.\n\n4. Guys this isn't a game that you get Lv100 of all the strongest characters within hours of playing. This game is set up more of an MMO where you have to do the slow grind to get to that point. I don't mind it. I currently have 5 maxed out 2* Characters at Lv85, 3 maxed out 1* characters and I have a handful of other 2 and 3* characters over lv50 with two that I just need to grind all the way to max level. I've only spent fifty bucks on this game because I actually felt like it. I didn't feel like I needed to in order to continue this game. To compare with other games I've played, I put almost a thousand bucks in to League of Legends and I had put six hundred bucks into Dungeon Fighter Online before that got shut down. I probably could spend more money into this game, but I don't.","December 5, 2013","true","0.6"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","8","18","0","0"

I personally have not paid one dime to the devs. And I have a full roster of rare, legendary, and gold characters. If you choose not to pay as I chose NOT to pay, then you must have patience. I only played when I wanted. I didn't get obssessed with the events. I simply played casually. And it all fell into place. I started with Ironman, Black Widow, and Juggernaut. Kept winning with that combination and started collecting several other characters. My favorite line up right now is Thor, Black Widow (rare), and Juggernaut (or Storm..again, rare one).\n\nIf you have patience and are not going to get swept up in having to win every event, not have to win every cover, not force yourself to play 3 or 4 hours a day then this game will be fine for you.\n\nThe game concept is simple: match tiles/blocks to destroy segments but with the Puzzle Quest twist of having special powers to activate once you collect certain colored tiles (AP).\n\nI can confidently recommend this game. But you have to know what kind of player you are. If you need instant gratification and know you'll get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ if you can't unlock all covers quickly or win every single event to get more covers, then don't play this game. If you feel you will reach into your pocket and throw all your money at this game to get a pay to win advantage and that is what is going to ♥♥♥♥ you off, then don't play this game.\n\nBut if you can enjoy the game casually it can be very rewarding.\n\nAnd hey if you DO want to throw your money at it, then go ahead.\n\nEither way the game actually is fun. I just have to tell myself not to get wrapped up in the treasures that always seem to be outside my grasp. I kept my money in my pocket and played casually (10 hours a week or less). And when I figured that out, treasures started falling in my lap.","October 29, 2014","true","252.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

That's right, folks...it's completely free to play unless you choose to pay anything. Of course there are microtransactions involved to help get through the game faster. People actually worked on this game and want to get paid somehow. How many players whining about microtransactions will go to work tomorrow and tell their boss, "I'll do these tasks for free.

Brass Tax this is a fun game, if you keep your head where it belongs (between your shoulders not in your backside), and your pride out of the equation and just have fun... If you go into this game and you are a person with a pride problem who gets his feelings hurt and throw tantrums everytime you lose, knowing this is a potential "Pay to Win" environment with no money to make yourself cpompetitive then that is your fault, not a flaw in game design nor concept.\n\nThe storyline is humorous and moves swiftly from battle to battle, the transitions and animations are top notch so far, and the over all design makes me want to play all  the time and start collecting comics again.\n\nFrom what I have seen, having so far finished the first story and half of the second... You DO NOT have to pay for, nor buy anything to have a good time.\n\nTip: If you run out of heals and you have to wait for your heroes to regen health or revive, go make a sandwich, or grab a drink, and when you finish you will be ready to play again. (You don't just have to buy a health kit right then and there... if you do that is your fault not a flaw in the game... Personally I go play the android version of the game on my phone while I wait for the heroes on my desktop to recover, that way I can play as long as I want to with no real interruptions .\n\n-Peace-","December 7, 2013","true","108.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

As a long term puzzle quest lover I found myself drawn into the universe that is Marvel Puzzle Quest. Instead of having one character, you have up to 3 that switch in mid battle (each character is strongest with a particular tileset). As you match tiles, you gain the amount destroyed as power which you can then use as abilities.\n\nThis opened up some room for strategy, in which I would try to think 2-3 steps ahead and plan my attacks according to my characters strengths. The campaign is somewhat lackluster in the script department, with the cutscenes just being the same portraits as the ingame characters. However as you progress through the prologue, you are faced with goons that deploy timed tiles that explode after the timer expires. In certain situations you can be unlucky and not have any tiles nearby, but with careful planning, most tiles can be destroyed before their time expires. Going further into the campaign, these encounters just repeated, with very little varience.\n\nHowever, there is plenty of varience in the somewhat multiplayer aspect of the game. Instead of fighting other players in realtime, the opponent's party is controlled by the AI, which is rather predictable (always uses abilites when they get appropriate power), but because you are fighting someone else's roster, you think about what strategy they were thinking about with their particular roster. This is somewhat compelling, but the real fun comes in the weekly events. Every week there is a particular event in which you compete with up to 1000 players for a chance to win rare covers. This brings me to my next point: the levelling system.\n\nInstead of levelling like a normal rpg through experience points, you level by collecting the same cover with that particular ability and since heroes are level capped by the amount of covers they have, the more covers you have for a particular character, the higher you can level that character.This hampers progression and you will find that you will level the characters with the most covers instead of thinking about some strategy.  This is where the transactions come into play.\n\nThere are two types of currency: Iso-8, which is very common and can be generated by winning each game and awarded by winning particular events for the first time; and Hero points, which can be found in only a handful of stages in the PvE campaign. Conversely you can place in the top 25 in events and earn hero points, but to be able to do this, you need a good hero roster, which in turn requires hero points. Therefore every player will either have to wait 1 week for 50 hero points (hero points are awarded for logging in once per week) or they can choose to pay $1 for 100. At first this doesnt seem like a big issue. only $1 and you can have 100 hero points. However, the more roster slots you have, the more hero points it costs to upgrade. This is one area where the developers aimed their micro transactions at. I am guilty of spending $5 for 600 hero points to unlock a few more slots. I am currently up to 20 slots and have only paid $5 which I believe is reasonable. The other area where microtransactions seem tempting is the recovery time for your heroes.\n\nAs you battle, your heroes will get damaged. They will recover when they are not in use, but as you gain higher levels, the characters take longer to recover. For example, a level 1 Iron Man takes only about 10 minutes to fully recover, as apposed to a level 50 Iron Man, which takes 4 hours to recover. The whole aspect of waiting for characters to recover interrupts the flow of the game, which seems like a good idea when you're on the move/on a mobile device. However, this should have been removed with the PC version as most people can just play a few rounds, then they have to wait 2-3 hours to recover. You can instantly recover by using medkits which are somewhat rare, or can be purchased for 50 cents each. This price of 50 cents doesnt seem high, but when you have to do it almost every battle, you start to feel a pinch on your wallet.\n\nOne strategy that I believe newbies should employ (and this is only to help progression and to enjoy the game as it should be: uninterrupted) is to set your system clock forward. This tricks the game into thinking that time has passed and your characters will recover the amount of time you put the clock forward. Ignore the events, just focus on the prologue, get through it and level up your characters. Once you have finished the campaign, set your clock back to normal time and use 1 medkit on each character.\n\nThis "trick" should not have to be used and it's bad gameplay design to have to resort to such things. However, with all this said, I have put about 100 hours into this game over the last 2 weeks, so they must be doing something right. Think of this game as a CCG with puzzle quest elements. Overall I would recommened this because it is free and you can still get a lot of enjoyment for free.\n\n____Pros____\n\n+Classic match 3 with marvel heroes\n+Weekly events and login rewards\n+Randomised PvP battles keep it fresh\n\n____Cons____\n\n-Progression hampered by random levelling system\n-Cant battle steam friends in realtime\n-Unable to sync IOS version with steam\n-Predictable and repetitive AI","December 17, 2013","true","540.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Based on the difficulty, I can't imagine it would be fun even if I paid them money. And I even got lucky and "found" a level 35 Wolverine when all of my other heroes were Level ~6. Even with that, so many of the missions are ridiculously hard. (Ones labeled as Trivial are medium-hard, and those rated as Normal are hard to impossible.\nI'd rather they just make a good game for a flat $4.99 (as a ported phone game, or else $19.99 for a "real" game) than make a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game that I can make slightly less ♥♥♥♥♥♥ by giving them money via extortion.\n\nMy advice is BUY AND PLAY PUZZLE QUEST 2. That game is amazing and makes this game looks like a preschool game. Optionally, you can play Puzzle Quest 1. It's good but slightly annoying in the way the campaign is laid out (TONS of random encounters). It's a fun game, but can't hold a candle to the perfection that is Puzzle Quest 2. The only problem with Puzzle Quest 2 is it's too easy, but that's okay, it's still fun. There's a difficulty setting, I'd recommend turning it up and if you can't beat a boss villain twice then turn it down. Otherwise most of the peon challenges are on the easy side.

To this day, I have spent a wopping $5 on it, and that was more than enough for me. I got lucky and recieved a level 70 character.\n\nAt any rate, to the heart of the game:\n\nIt's a puzzle game. Your characters (3 per group) have skills that are powered by having so many of a specific color gem(s). So, you want to mix and match characters that will compliment the others. An example of this would be that some characters power is to change the colors of the gems. So if you have someone who changes gem colors to yellow and you have another character who does a power attack after getting so many yellow gems, have them on the same team.\n\nIn the game, there is a single story line you can go through and collect items: money for more character slots, tokens to get characters/skills, characters/skills, crystals to level your characters after equipping said skills, etc. The story mode does jump in difficulty, don't expect to sit down and hammer through it in an hour or two; it takes days, if not weeks (still not through them all).\n\nIn the meantime, there are daily events that link into I believe an almost two week long (if not longer -I came in to a season in progress so I'm not sure about the length) that you can do as well. The main seaon lasts a while, but there are dailies or longer events that come up.\n\nThe thing I lika about them, is they are not all versus other players (though those are available as well), some of them are solo events, and have a mix of using your current characters, or having some of your characters beefed up (some have your levels jump into the 100s), or even characters you don't have but are pretty beefed up that you can use as well.\n\nI do need to point out though, that when your character runs out of health, you will either have to use a helath pack (one  returns in 35 minutes if you used them all) or just wait for them to heal over time.  As I have stated (and noticed from a lot of the negative comments), you really don't lose much over this if you aren't playing to be the best.\n\nPatience, tactics, with a bit of luck, and you'll be fine.","March 22, 2015","true","170.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

If you get into this game, you will want to pay.  There is something about it that hooks into your hoarding instinct if you keep playing.   It is under constant development and the new characters keep it fresh.  That's worth paying something.\n\nI played this on my phone for six months and then decided to start playing on the PC so that I have a better (bigger) interface.\n\nMy ground rules WERE:  No buying ISO-8 (experience points).  No paying for 10 packs or abilities.   Freely spend to buy slots when I win a new hero.   If you keep those rules, they payout is much like a subscription:   You win a couple of new characters every month and you pay a little to expand your roster.  Very reasonable.\n\nThen they introduce a rare character like Professor X.   He's really good (4-star).  If you buy a 42 pack which features him (3.2% chance per card draw of getting one of his three abilities) then there is about a 25% chance you don't get him in the draw of 42 cards.  ((1.0-0.032)^42)   What's the chance of getting all three abilities in a 42 pack?  Haven't done the math, but it must be around 5% or worse.\n\nSo how much is a 42 pack?  15800 gold points.  You buy gold points for about 20000 for $100.   Therefore if you want a solid chance at getting all three abilities, you might pay about $400-$500.   You could get luckier.\n\nKnowing all this, I still bought a 42 pack this week and got two of the three abilities.   I was very lucky and I can barely resist buying another 42 pack.  That is the hook.\n\nPlaying with the low level characters is very fun, there'se nothing wrong with it.  It's the desire and excitment about playing with a new one which makes you break your rules.\n\nBTW, the endpoint for cost of a slot for a character seems to be about 850 gold per slot.  That's about $4.25 per character once you have a fullish roster.   If you win a character, you pay $4.25 to keep it.  Fine.   But then you want the other 2 abilities that you didn't win.   Keep that under control and you will find this game reasonably priced.\n\nOh, BTW, you do get all of the 1 and 2 star characters essentially for free over time and the cost of the extra slots is cheap at first.  It's the 3 and 4 stars that tempt you into paying.   You'll be happy in the moment and kind of sick in the long run.\n\nI saw a comment on a review which pointed out that any free to play game that you play for more than a couple of hours should have a massive thumbs-up.  OK, so thumbs up for that.  You'll love it for 5 or 10 hours, then you have to start resisting the temptation to pay.\n\nHaving said all this, I can't argue with the thumbs-down reviews.  They're not bull####.  Watch your wallet if you start playing this, especially if you love it.\n\n","March 23, 2015","true","397.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I've been told it's like puzzle quest, only you have multiple people on your team so you can choose who to take hits from and there are more tactics to it.\n\nThere is a pay-to-win strategy in that you can spend all your money to get tokens to buy powerful heroes (or villains) and have them on your team. The most powerful ones are the most expensive ones, obviously, with the biggest level cap. You can sell old cards you don't want as you have a limited roster of heroes to have and a limit of 3 in each battle.\n\nBeyond that, if you've played puzzle quest or any matching game you've got the idea of the game play to get at least 3 in a row, but here different characters deal different damage. For example, my group has Storm, Hawkeye and Iron Man. Iron Man deals the most damage with red so when they're matched he attacks and is open to attacks. Black ones Storm is most powerful at so she ends up in the firing line. they all have abilities based on colours you collect so there's also the tactic of wanting a really powerful ability to activate, but you can't use it unless you have X amount of this coloured jewel. For example, Iron Man's best power is Ultra Feron Beam which, at the moment, requires 19 Blue. 19 is a huge number, but with it he deals a huge amount of damage (which one-shots most villains by the time I get the amount) and even if it doesn't defeat them, it stuns them for 1 turn. Some abilities are direct attacks, stuns, destroys tiles, transforms tiles so depending on who's in your group, you can string together a large amount of abilities and combos to win the game.\n\nI only play this at a time sink for when I want to hear background commentary on a game or movie and it works well for that. Also every day if you win a combat you get given a special daily reward which can be anything from hero points (also attained in game) to hero cards. You also  will want to re-play many battles as there are alternate rewards where you can have the chance to win 1 out of 4 choices, but only a chance which forces a grind, but a enjoyable grind.","January 27, 2014","true","22.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Since you play 3 characters with up to 3 powers each (and there are a lot of characters) you'll have plenty of choice and it's fun to maximize the efficiency of your team.\n\nIt does have a rather peculiar monetization system (it's free-to-play), which I have read nothing but negative comments about, but I honestly do not mind it at all, which is really weird since typically I wouldn't touch game like this with a 5 feet pole.\n\nI watched TotalBiscuits WTF is.. of this game and so didn't expect much of it. Thought I'd deinstall in 5 mins. Instead I have been playing a lot. On and off while doing other stuff, just taking the time to let the heroes heal back up. Played this way, in between multitasking, I really like this game. I recommend you watch TotalBiscuits (or another) review though.

I really do. Unfortunately greedy developers have taken what should be a great casual gaming experience and turned it into a pay to win hell.\nWe'll start with the obvious-you get characters thrown at you so often and so fast that you're limited to giving up those characters when you run out of space or buying hero points to open up new slots. Strike 1.\nMoving on: all those awesome characters you paid out to add to your roster? Yeah, you're gonna need a massive amount of ISO to level them. We're talking...2,000 matches worth of rewards to max level a single middle of the road 3* character. Of course you could always purchase more ISO with real money. No, really, its not insanely overpriced at all. I'm going to Hell for that particular lie. Strike 2.\nShall we try for the next point? Okay. Advancing your roster serves no purpose. None at all. The enemies scale up with you and quite often the devs mess up the scaling so badly that you're facing a team that can take out your best characters with absolutely no problem. I guarantee that at some point you will sit there, watching the screen while the AI systematically destroys those characters you worked so hard to level up. The only escape is to shut down the game as once the AI has started that turn that will end your team you wont be able to leave the match until every single animation has played out. And there's a lot of animations. Each clocking in at maybe 2-3 seconds and getting very annoying, very quickly. But that's alright. Once your team is destroyed you can fully heal your characters and give it another shot! Until you run out of health packs and have to pay to get extra of those as well. Strike 3.\nTL; DR? Game will drain your wallet, crush your spirit and destroy your love of puzzle games. But you'll keep going back, not cos its fun but cos you've already invested so much effort into it.","May 9","false","614.1"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"
