Oh God. OH GOD. SAVE ME. They remastered it.\n\nThis may be the best game I've played in years. Strike that, this is the best game I've played in years. My background picture comes from this game. My facebook background picture comes from this game. I damaged my social relationships to a frankly alarming point by talking about this game to everyone I knew. I've skipped entire nights of sleep, just because I was too fascinated (my hands were literally shaking) by the approaching climax. I've let my beard grow wild and my eyes became those of a haunted doctor struggling against an invisible, inexorable enemy, just like the character I was playing. For weeks after completing it for the first time, I dreamt of mad bulls, of crows, of tunnels full of whispers in an alien tongue, of dark wells, of lies and treasons. Oh, the lies, the lies this game tells you.\n\nBut we'll get to that a bit later. First things first.\n\n\n\nPathologic is a 2006 russian game about an early XXth century small fictional town located in the middle of the russian steppe. A few days after the beginning of the game, the unnamed town is beset by a mysterious plague and everything starts falling into utter chaos. You are a healer and your goal is to discover the source of the plague and put an end to it.\n\nYou are given a choice between three characters : the Bachelor, man of logic and reason and professional doctor by trade ; the Haruspex, both learned in classical medicine and in the ancient local traditions of shamanism ; and the Changeling, a mysterious young vagrant girl who claims she can perform miracles. You have to complete the game as either the Haruspex or the Bachelor to be able to play as the Changeling (Devotress in the original version).\n\n\nWhat you are reading is a review of the remastered version that came out on Steam on 29/10/2015, not to be confused with the remake of Pathologic, scheduled for November 2016. Aside from polished graphics, the main point of the remastered version is a way better english translation and a better voice acting. The original made quite some waves in Russia when it originally came out, but due to a very bad english translation and poor voice acting, wasn't very well-received abroad, and since it was the first game of the studio, they had very little at their disposal in terms of advertising. In any case, those problems are over now, thank Zeus, and Pathologic Classic HD is perfectly understandable and "enjoyable", so to those of you who played the original and think : "All well and good, Zyphilis, but I already bought and played this game a while ago, could you please get to the point and tell me if I should buy it again ?", I say yes. Do help yourselves to another slice of trauma.\n\n\n\nNow that all that tedious stuff is said, let's get to the interesting part. Why is Pathologic unique ? What makes it so good ? What makes it "the best game you've never played" (quoted from a massive, outstanding review made by an RPS journalist named Quintin Smith, review that you should absolutely read, but only after completing the game because it's so full of spoilers) ?\n\n\n\nPathologic is ambitious. Impossibly ambitious. Its main theme is sickness and everything in the game revolves around it. If you've played The Void, another masterpiece by Ice-Pick Lodge, you know that the studio has a knack for deep links between gameplay and story (as root1902 and pointed out in his excellent review), and this is where I think Pathologic borders on pure genius : little by little, you will realise that what you initially thought to be a clunky gameplay design is actually a deeply thought-out device to make you feel uncomfortable, unwell - in a word, sick. Sick, exactly like the town you must save at all costs.\n\nThis is what the bleak colour palette, growing ever more sinister as the end nears, will make you feel. This is what the tough, unforgiving, clunky combats will make you feel : that you are a sick, desperate man/woman forced to fight for survival. Which you are. This is what I meant when I said before that while playing it I felt the same way my character did. This is why the first thing you see when starting a new game are the three main actors on a stage. This is why the very first people you talk to are two grim masked figures, more or less telling you this : "Welcome, delicious friend ! You will have a great role to play in this tragedy".\n\nDo you see it ? Do you see how this is genius ?\n\nPathologic irresistibly draws you into its world and makes you a part of it. Little by little, perhaps without you even noticing, like a gentle cough in winter that just doesn't seem to go away, you'll start to have the diffuse but distinct, terrifying feeling that you must save this town not only to beat the game, but because by doing so, you'll save yourself somehow.\n\n\n_________________________________________\n(Work in progress)\n\n\nSo far I've played 2 of the 3 characters the game lets you play, the Bachelor and the Changeling. I'm planning of playing it (at least) one more time with the Haruspex, and then complete this review.\n_________________________________________\n\n\nIn the meantime, do yourself some good (in a terrible, terrible way). Buy Pathologic and step into the storm.","October 29, 2015","true","32.6"," 292 of 312 people (94%) found this review helpful 46 people found this review funny","94","292","312","46","12"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/root1902/recommended/384110/","root1902","root1902","http://steamcommunity.com/id/root1902/","259 products in account","Hands down, the best game I have ever played!\n\nPathologic is a very ambitious, very unique, genre-bending, medium-defining video game which does things no other game has done before or since. It is also devilishly vague, extremely difficult, incredibly slow and takes place entirely within one small greyish town over a period of about 30 hours.  But as you go on you realise its incredibly slow pacing, its single greyish location, its trudging from one place to another are all essential to creating such an incredible atmosphere and game.\n\nIt tells the story of a small Russian town in the early 20th century steeped in tradition and built on the back of its meat industry. As you arrive in town, the leader of the town, who had spread propaganda of his own immortality is found dead from a disease known as "the sand plague". News of this plague then begins to spread throughout town and the game's excellent cast of characters all react in differing ways. The interaction with the characters is one of the game's greatest strengths, with every character acting in their own interests as the paranoia of the plague and the loss of the town's steady leadership begin to spread. The characters are generally really well written and easy to empathise with, which makes the political conflict in between them really intriguing and often you will be torn between different characters as you learn to understand their motivations and traits throughout the game. The story itself is also really rich and has some of the greatest twists and most intriguing characters in all of gaming.\n\nBut it's not the narrative which makes Pathologic great, so much as they way the narrative is implemented into the game. Never have I played a game which blends story and gameplay so well. This is for a couple of reasons: Firstly, as the story is told over a perpetual timeframe of 12 days, different characters will live or die depending on whether you complete the main quest on each day and your interaction with the characters may change their personality and how they try to react or reason with themselves over the inevitable demise of the town. This gives a sense of panic to your own actions as you know if you don't complete them in time certain important characters may die and you'll never find the end of the story. The player also has the choice of controlling one of three characters at the beginning of this game - all these characters have their own perspective of the disease and interact with the characters and narrative in an entirely different way. The other two characters who you didn't chose still take part in the narrative anyway and even more interestingly - you may come in conflict with them but never realise their motivation unless you play as the other character.\n\nBut more importantly than that is the survival gameplay and Pathologic has by far and away the best survival system of any game I've ever played. It features 6 main survival mechanics - reputation, health, immunity, hunger, exhaustion and infection and these survival mechanics are all balanced heavily against each other. By this I mean, if you are feeling hungry you might find a lemon or raw meat, these quench your hunger but may weaken your immune system. You may feel exhausted and need sleep but while sleeping you cannot eat or take medication so your hunger will rise and your immunity levels will drop. You may be out of food and need to attack innocent people to get some simply to stop yourself starving to death, thus causing your reputation to diminish etc. Trying to increase one of your survival mechanics may cause another one to decrease and so on, so there is this constant balancing act going on and make no mistake, balancing these survival mechanics is hard. But that is exactly what makes the survival system so great - it's always nagging away at you, never giving you a moment's rest as the time ticks on and it creates this incredibly stressful and emotionally dejected feeling which really allows you to experience the situation and unrest the plague has caused and allows you to understand the rationale behind the characters.\n\nThough there are two other things which add to the brutal survival system which heighten this inescapable sense of tension even more: 1. the economy and 2. the changing nature of the town day by day. The economy was apparently based on the World War I economy of eastern europe to represent the panic of a disease ridden town and it is merciless. Money is scarce so trading is the general way you are going to get things, the only problem is that shop keepers have all the power and so basic amenities such as bread, milk and medicine all become ridiculously overpriced. At times you will have to hand over weapons, bullets and protective clothing all for a lemon just to stop yourself dying of hunger. The economy only gets worse as the days go on too and shortages of different things (food, medicine, clothing etc.) means they fluctuate day to day making it unpredictable as to what you need to hoard adding to the tension even more. There are other ways to find resources though - scavenging bins around town to find trinkets and bottles will allow you to help trade with the townsfolk. Sharp things can be traded with children  (and that was one thing which made me feel guilty) for ammo and sometimes food and bottles can be filled up with water at the well in town and traded with drunks for medicine and health items. Thieves and murderers who come out at night and start you can also be killed and then robbed of money, lockpicks and resources and finally, you can break into people's houses and steal their final resources from their own home. However, it's incredibly disconcerting when you start robbing people's homes and the men of the house start trying to attack you to defend their home and it's amazing how much this got to me. That was perhaps the greatest and most creative aspect of the of the economy - the way it made me feel guilty. At the beginning of the game, I wanted to be as nice as I could, but survival is so difficult I was forced to break into people's homes and steal their things, even kill a couple of innocent men simply trying to defend their homes and it surprised me how genuinely bad this made me feel, but it's testament to just how immersive and beautifully designed Pathologic truly is.\n\nThe town's ever changing nature is also another factor which make Pathologic so immersive and so emotionally draining. It's a cliché of Pathologic reviews to use this sentence, but: much is talked about in open world games in trying to create a "living world", whereas Pathologic does the opposite: it creates a "dying world" and by doing so creates this incredibly lively and riveting environment. Day by day, different areas become infected - different characters are introduced and react through different events. Riots begin to happen, military men with flamethrowers come in to stop the infection spreading. The sand plague becomes more and more potent as the days tick by and the town, its economy and its people begin to become more infected and more panicked as a result.\n\nAnd this unyielding tension is only added to fantastic ambient soundtrack and the drab but fitting art design which all creates this amazing and utterly unique atmosphere.\n\nPathologic isn't just about building atmosphere therefore by reaching a certain point in the narrative and then a cut scene happens. Pathologic isn't an interactive film, or an interactive tv show, it's interactive theatre - it's about watching a slowly decaying town in front of your eyes and trying to survive yourself within that! For every minute I spent with this game I felt the muscles in the pit of my stomach tighten - it made me feel extremely tense, guilty and dejected at just trying to survive. It is one of the most emotionally draining experiences I've ever had in just about any art/entertainment medium.","October 29, 2015","true","86.3"," 108 of 114 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","108","114","3","1"

First, let me tell you how I came across this game. In 2005 I was at the market in Minsk, and while passing by the video game kiosk i was stopped in tracks as my eye caught a glimpse of the original Mor Utiopia (Pathologic) CD design. I approached it and ask the salesman what the game was about. The way the two men who worked there described me left it zing in my head.. so I bought the game. i did not own a PC because I was poor. But.. I bough tthe game anyway, because then th enext goal was to find somewhere to play it. I was obsessed with the idea of this world, I memorized every word on the cover. Still, I was only able to launch it when I moved to Canada in 2006. Launch would be a stretch because the second CD did not work... Lets fast forward to 2007. I managed to get a hold of a new copy (relative brought over). It FINALLY launched! I loved every second of it, the story was rich...then PC got upgraded to Windows 7, which was not supported by the security verification system that came on the CD (support up to Vista)...So I couldn't play anymore. :/ A year after that I re-bought it again on Gamers Gate because I still didnt play as the girl and I felt like I missed out. (played for her, it was amazing, obviously. *tears of joy*). Then a few years later a remake was announced and I was SO. STOKED. (still am.) Then last week i was checking the upcoming games and saw this Classic HD edition... SO I said "well ♥♥♥♥, am I not going to support my favourite developers because I already bought this game so many times? Hell no". SO, after buying Pathologic 4 times... maybe I can now finally complete the third and last character! :) I also bought this game for 2 other people because everyone deserves to know how great this game is.  ANyway, I am really happy with this release. I will keep buying Ice Pick Lodge games, even if I have to do it over and over again.","October 31, 2015","true","1.6"," 100 of 114 people (88%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","88","100","114","9","4"

It was a personal favorite game of mine.)\n\nOverview:\n\nPathologic's effectiveness as a survivial-horror game relies on the passage of time; gathering enough food and supplies for yourself is trying to begin with, and as the plague takes hold in the town, the price of food and medicine skyrockets as districts fill with plague vapors, rats, and the shambling sick. It's impossible not to feel the invisible noose of desperation tightening around your chosen character's neck.\n\nAs for the game's story, if you manage to keep yourself alive, you're going to uncover some wild stuff. The town this game is set in is steeped in cults, competing factions, and world-changing magic, but none of it is spelled out for you at the start. Magical Realism is a good way to describe it, which just can't be said about many games out there.\n\nEach of the three player characters can learn things the other two can't. There are many unique NPC's to interact with and learn about the world from, and all of them treat each player character very differently. Many will tell half-truths and try and manipulate you to suit their ends.  There is branching dialogue and quests may resolve differently based on your actions.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nReasons you might love this game:\n\n- A wonderfully original setting with interesting characters and lore.\n\n- A sense of slow, creeping decay that many horror games aren't patient enough to pull off.\n\n-A barter economy born of desperation: rummage through trash cans for baubles to trade children for, swap your only weapon for a loaf of bread, loot the houses of infected districts for items at the risk of contracting the Plague...you'll be making hard decisions constantly under time pressure.\n\n- A strange but very well excecuted soundtrack.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nReasons you might not like this game:\n\n-Combat is very clunky.\n\n-You'll be doing a lot of walking from place to place with not much happening between besides trading with people or visiting a store. (Unless its a plague district or nighttime, when you can run into knife-weilding bandits.) There is no sprint button.\n\n-If you don't like games with a lot of text. Characters have a lot to say.\n\n- If you aren't careful, you can exhaust your supplies and money and be completely ruined well into the game. Keeping rolling saves / quicksaving often is highly reccomended.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nAll in all, if you are looking for an unrelenting, unique experience, this game is truly an unpolished gem that is well worth your time for its story and atmosphere alone.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nGameplay tips from someone who has played through the game:\n\n- 'Q' brings up your quest log.  ' L' brings up letters you've received that will give you hints on what to do. They often show up at the start of a new day.   'P' brings up your status screen.\n\n-If one of your Bound (Also called Adherents) dies at the end of a day, you didn't complete the day's main quest and will be locked out of all but one very grim ending to the game.\n\n-Look through trash cans whenever you can.  Junk can be traded to children for invaluable supplies. Bottles can be filled up with water and traded to drunks for bandages and tornaquets.\n\n-Equip clothing and use drugs that boost your immunity when going into infected districts/houses. It may be the difference between catching the Plague (which can only be cured through two very rare items) and remaining healthy. Take protective clothes off when you leave; they lose durability when being worn.\n\n- Even with your best efforts, you're gonna probably gonna get the plague. The higher your infection bar, the faster your health will drain away.","October 31, 2015","true","35.1"," 75 of 79 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","75","79","0","0"

You play as one of three characters: a charming bachelor doctor, a ritualistic healer, and a mysterious young girl with an unusual set of powers. Your enemy is invisible, but incredibly dangerous - and every day is a fight for survival.\n\nIt's a dark, haunting experience. And I absolutely adore it. Your choices have immediate and often far-reaching consequences. All of the quests are optional. Sometimes you won't even have time to complete quests if you need to find food or rest, but people are likely to die as a result of your decisions - even when you think you're doing the right thing.\n\nThis isn't the prettiest game by any stretch, but the world is fascinating. If you're concerned about the graphics not being up to par, there's not a whole lot to be concerned about. It's a game from 2005, sure, but the art, music, and overall design of this world are still captivating. And luckily all of the murals and posters have had their textures updated in this release. Plus, the added visual effects (depth of field and motion blur) do actually add to the mood considerably.\n\nAnd that mood is phenomenal. Pathologic is a terrifying glimpse into a place that was crafted by a team determined to work towards creating a unified, hollistic vision. I've heard that the concept for this game came from a dream, and in playing this game, I certainly feel like I'm exploring one. It's a sometimes terrifying place, with weird citizens and strange cultures where you're never sure what's real - or who you can trust, for that matter.\n\nI love this game. I love the people who made this game. It's fascinating. I can hardly stop thinking about it. It's like being a stranger in a strange land. I feel like I'm exploring Morrowind for the first time all over again, except it's brutal and tragic and I'm not the hero.\n\nI can't recommend this game enough. It's rough around the edges, but it's fantastic. The new translation is also beyond my expectations. The original, for those who don't know, was often incomprehensible - but with the new one, you don't even need a map. I'm deighted Ice Pick Lodge decided to revisit a ten-year-old game and fix it up. This is the remastering this game deserved.\n\nHowever, all that being said, I still hope that the "Pathologic: Remake" (expected late 2016 or possibly later) makes the experience even better. If you don't feel like diving into this rich, incredibly realized fictional universe now, wait for that release. Ice Pick Lodge seem to be incredibly passionate about their games and I have no doubt in my mind that their latest re-imagining of this title is going to blow away all of my expectations. But if this universe piques your attention, then I can't see any harm in diving in right now. This is the best version of Pathologic to date, and probably one of the most important games I've ever played.","November 3, 2015","true","18.7"," 43 of 46 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","43","46","0","0"

Tense, atmospheric, unforgiving, completely exhilarating. It captured the essence of player choice better than just about anything else - of reward versus cost, the now versus the potential future - in providing a constantly evolving world where everything you did always had to be measured against what you could have done instead.\n\nNone of that has changed in this newly translated version.\n\nWhat has changed is that Pathologic is now also a truly impressive piece of comprehensible fiction. Carrying forth the great Russian literary tradition into a new medium with an intricate web of a story that tackles subjects such as state, religion, addiction, mortality, family, mysticism, ethics, murder, clinical research and individual ideology and ambition. All told through monomaniacal character dialogue and the stark scenery of the world.\n\nIt's a story and world building that works on many simultaneous levels, and the things it has to say about both the human condition and the video game medium itself - and by extension, art in general - is deeper and more poignant than anything I've witnessed before in video games.\n\nIt all adds up to an extraordinary experience, and also one of the very best games I have ever played.","November 11, 2015","true","44.4"," 37 of 38 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","37","38","0","0"

While the vague expressions and broken phrasing of the original translation added somewhat to surreality of the experience, there was oodles lost in translation and a more distinct yet somewhat inaccessible actual mystery. The dated visuals punched well above their weight in creating gloomy town ambience, and mainly came to the fore with globby face models that could frown but otherwise had trouble being expressive; updates here are welcome but uncritical. Stability, bugs and quest flag curios are probably the best cause for a HD revamp, and to my knowledge this area has been improved.\nA dissonant, beautiful game, its premise finds a superstitious, stratified, rural-industrial town experiencing the death of an elder figurehead, inciting suspicion in several parties. Three outsiders will be drawn into this precipice of unfolding events and the possibility of a dangerous disease being responsible, and players take the role of one of these outsiders; 'healers' in the guise of a methodical doctor, a shamanistic surgeon, and a blessed urchin.\nWhile each of these characters will navigate the same town, and meet (predominantly) the same cast of characters, they will be following their own narrative path and will have a different series of objectives and interactions than each other. Its atmospheric qualities lay heavy; bleak, surreal, and insular. The queer provincial locality and absurdities that no one blinks an eye at contribute a Lynchian quality - each of the 'healers' is very much a stranger in a strange land, mistrusted and beguiled by agendas at every turn. A great soundscape with mostly ambient synth variants is a strong point contributing to the overall powerful and memorable experience.\nAt its core it is a first person resource management adventure. To speak first to the mechanics; it's structured as an FPS, and combat, while prevalent, is only the focus of a few notable sequences. In many cases fighting, and weaponry, are a resource related calculable risk, and players find serviceable shooter mechanics that likely still feel awkward and lack punch. The game takes place over twelve days, with each in game day comprising of two real-time hours. Beyond reloading saves and the time-freeze during character dialogue, each playthrough has a fixed playtime.\nOver time, you'll come to know the twists and turns of the town intimately. The shortcuts (which you’ll memorize as time is always ticking), the pub by the water barrel, the left turn at the rickety fence to get to Anna's place from Eve's.  It's a great way to evoke a sense of place, a big factor in the isolated, fictional steppe town. Walking is painfully slow across the large town and a key experience; equal parts introspective, off-puttingly slow, and eventually as the town becomes more dangerous, a prospect of apprehension, your travel across the town between bouts of exposition is pervasive.\nMore commonly in the game you'll be managing several pools of resources; fatigue, health, money, food, level of infection, medicine (for health and infection), reputation, time and later in the game as the stakes get higher, the lives of other significant characters. If that sounds like a hot mess, that’s because it is. These resources are strongly intertwined; sleeping reduces fatigue and increases health (more so with medicine, but that increases fatigue so you'll need to sleep more), but uses time, which increases hunger, infection, and runs out the deadline on tasks. Bandages and tourniquets can heal health instantly, but cost money, which you'll need to spend on food to keep your hunger down, and methods of reducing infection often damage health and cost money. Daily tasked are failed at midnight, and traversing the town is a lengthy amble.\nThis system is fairly punishing, especially when you're walking in blind, and can snowball such that you dig yourself into a situation of guaranteed failure where the last viable save is in the distant past, before the snowball started rolling. Looting and fighting wandering vagrants present a risk/reward scenario that can yield value like money or trade goods at the risk of getting hurt or killed. Robbing and killing citizens, as well as some story decisions, might hit your reputation, which can make it harder for you to shop or navigate town, perhaps necessitating continuing brutality. Notably, the different healers have different levels of ease handling reputation; the closest thing to a difficulty setting available. Other items and trinkets create several sub-economies, such as the nuts-and-razors for medicine of the town’s children, or the water for bandages of the parched drunkards, which can be managed by looting, scavenging and trade as well. It's overall very rich and you'll never find yourself without something to do; quite the reverse.\nBut beyond how punishing and legitimately frustrating it can be, it is perfectly entrenched to cause investment and tension within the player, and eliciting emotional engagement is one of the games strong points. A sense of achievement at having suffered through another day is tempered by the updated body count, the latest development of a town in crisis, and the overall nihilistic Russianness.\nA portion has to be stated about the literary quality of the narrative. High-handed in places, gritty and verisimilitudinous in others, it overall is a little niche, and does not exactly appeal to a broad range of potential users. It cannot woo anyone with accessible gameplay; it melds its play experience between genres and through a commitment to storytelling, so players will have to be open to several classically disparate things. Awaiting though is a text cognizant of Brecht, Camus and Dostoevsky, easy names to sling around but well-earned here. It's also, as a text, very concerned with the player experience and engagement, and the overall conceit here goes to some novel and delightful places, but also hurtles towards a legitimate and intense amalgamation of themes, conceptual content that the player can take out of the satisfying and comprehensive ending; no deflated wrap-ups or truncated copouts.\nPsychological horror, tension, threatening imagery and oppressive bleakness contribute to an intrusive sense of disquiet and disturbance. With some broader exceptions like plague victims and districts, Pathologic rarely employs traditional slash horror content like monsters and jump scares. Artfully setting the tone with a mock funeral intro, genre horror will be endemic to your experience for the rest of the game.\nA certain openness, and sometimes patience, is required, but for those inclined an almost incomparable, human, and weirdly triumphant experience is available. Here's to the rich and morbid treasure that Ice Pick Lodge began with.\n","October 29, 2015","true","35.9"," 46 of 53 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","46","53","3","8"

Horrible not in it's controls, story or graphics. No. The game is horrible because it will constantly taunt you for your every error and misgiving. It's a true survival horror - you're in the middle of a plague trying to survive and your only way of survival is making tough decisions - stealing, looting, trading for outrageous prices. It's all comes down to understanding how desperation can bring a human to the brink of being an animal\n\nBut also you're the key to curing the plague. And the game taunts you for every day you will not do it. Every day starts with a death count that you couldn't prevent. Is it fair since the key lies way outside of your graps? Hell no, but the game isn't fair. It will throw punch after punch to the point you're lying there in the puddle of your own tears asking it to stop.\n\nThe game is a simulator, simulator of how pitiful life can be if faced under extremity. And thus it's probably one of the most important games ever made - it's unique, amazing and terrifying. It's a horrible fever dream on a steppe that wish you never experience IRL.\n\n10/10","February 22","true","6.7"," 35 of 37 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","35","37","3","0"

You can choose between 3 different characters, that all have different stories. No matter which one you pick, you are dropped into the game with very little explanation. You WILL be confused, but slowly as the game progresses you will learn more. The game does a very good job at making you feel disoriented, creeped out, mystified and that's my favourite part. There are some really strange encounters and characters.\nOne thing that I absolutely love, is that time is constantly ticking. Events will occur around the place, whether you are there to see them or not. This gives you a good reason to replay the game again, and gives more of a sense or urgency when doing things.\n\nWhere the game frustrated me, was the slightly sluggish gameplay and slow start. You get the feel for the game a bit more later on, but it does start off a bit too confusing. Perhaps it benefits the game later on, but it is tough to get through. There's a lot of reading. It would have been great if there was voice acting throughout discussions, but all you get are a few spoken lines when you first talk to a character, and a lot of the voice acting isn't that good either.\n\nThe town is relatively hard to survive in. You've got to take care of yourself with things like hunger, infection and so on. You can also build up reputation amongst people by doing things like stealing, killing or helping others in need.\n\nOverall, the gameplay isn't amazing, but the general atmosphere and story is very well done. Enough for me to be able to recommend this game if you're into strange worlds.","October 29, 2015","true","3.4"," 54 of 68 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","54","68","0","1"

It will make your skin crawl, give you nightmares, leave you in awe, and remain in your thoughts for days on end. The music is fantastically creepy and catchy all at once. I found myself grunting along almost immediately, despite not knowing the words (assuming those ARE words…?). The facial expressions of certain characters might make you pee in your pants a little. It’s ok. Just let it happen. Immerse yourself.\n\n*** I cannot recommend Pathologic highly enough, but ONLY to those who would be predisposed to enjoying it. Every negative review I’ve read thus far was written by someone who was doomed not to like the game in the first place. The following are my notes on this phenomenon. It just isn’t a game for everyone. I’ve also included some random thoughts that aren’t super important or thrilling. I just wanted to throw ‘em in there, because it’s 4 AM and I’m the reigning queen of this review. ***\n\nNOTE: THERE IS NOTHING SHAMEFUL ABOUT DISLIKING TEXT-HEAVY GAMES. I've met many avid bookworms who hate reading too much in-game. It’s ok! But don’t flippin' blame the writers/devs when you die at the end of the first day and can’t figure out why. If you hadn’t been skimming, you’d know. Negative reviewers: I’m shaking my head at a handful of you. I'm glad you weren't seeking my approval to begin with, because it would not have been granted. Untz.\n\nPathologic is more eery than scary. There are a few jump-scares, but not many. The majority of what makes this game marinate in your mind for hours after playing is the creepy, indirect way it leads you through its story. Don’t expect an action-packed thriller. The pacing is slow and deliberate, especially when compared to most modern games.\n\nYOU WON’T UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING PEOPLE ARE SAYING FROM THE GET-GO. THAT DOESN’T MEAN THE TRANSLATION IS BAD. Most of the text is brimming with similes and riddles galore. That’s intentional, as shown by the fact that many of your own dialogue options will be variations on the “IDK WTF U SED, M8” theme. After playing for a few days, you’ll start to retroactively de-muddle some of it. From what I’ve heard, those who've played all three characters’ stories enjoyed going back and finally understanding the obscure bits. Don’t stress it! Let the metaphors flow over you. Just don’t forget that within that flow are chunks of important information. It’s not hard to tell the difference – smooth vs. chunky – but some people can’t handle it. Know yourself before agonizing over this.\n\nNipples. The more you notice them, the more you’ll… notice them. Nips on ♥♥♥♥. Giggles and ♥♥♥♥♥. Traffic cones. Party hats. Front-buttons. Nips.\n\nWhomever translated this version deserves a lot of credit. Don't get me wrong, there are quite a few little grammatical issues and misspellings, but the phrasings themselves are absolutely poetic. How about this spoiler-free gem? “There were other signs, too. Frightening scribblings and repulsive oily spots on walls here and there. Raspy breathing that could only belong to giant lungs can be heard by the silent houses. They say the shabnak, the embodiment of the disease, is breathing poisonous air, leaving her fat on the walls as she walks by.” Whaaaaaaaaat? Yes. What? Yessssssss. I love it.\n\nThis game isn’t called Everquest. There is another game that goes by that name.\n\nIn a similar vein, the quests don’t last forever. They also don’t spur multiple additional quests, bleeding out into impossibly huge task trees. Each day is compartmentalized: you get a few quests, try to complete them, and know that they will disappear the next day. Use your best judgment re: route optimization while traipsing around town, and you shouldn’t have much trouble completing everything in time. You’ll usually have an extra hour or two to go rob some innocents, maybe kill a couple of bad guys, and stare at some cool-looking wall paintings, some of which feature the aforementioned prominent nips.\n\nTo echo everyone else: you’ll be rummaging in the trash a lot, hoping to find some sharp, dirty objects. These can be traded to children for drugs and bullets. Kids are the best. Also, don’t waste your water by drinking it. Water and vegetables are worthless for consumption, as in real life. Eat bread and fatty meat; they will keep you going for a long time. Trust me. I’m a bacheloctor. I know things.\nI've still only scratched the surface of this game, but it has left a deep, emotional impact on me that will probably never go away. 9/10.\n\nCan’t wait for the remake. Hoping for a "loot all" key and a slightly more fluid equipment/items system.","January 17","true","54.9"," 33 of 35 people (94%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","94","33","35","6","0"

Probably you already know about Ice-Pick Lodge's plan to release a remake in 2016, but, listen, it's going to differ from the original (and you don't know how much, which is not a bad thing at all, but that's not the point), while this one is the good old Pathologic with minor to zero changes in graphics (such as additional blur) and more friendliness to English public (if a surreal survival horror can be called friendly).\nIn my first playthrough I used to describe this game as "Dostoyevsky on psychodelics". Later on I submerged deeper into the plethora of contexts of this product, but such a dsecription can probably give a hint of what Pathologic is. This is a very Russian product. It means neither that it is of bad quality, like some of Russians themselves think about their countriy's videogame industry, nor that it has scenes of bears playing Prokofiev on balalaikas. Rather than that, it means that the images which this game contains are very close to Russian art in general (mostly this is about literature). The visuals strangely help intensify the feeling. A yellowish gamma, properly selected textures (can't really explain it in details, but they add a lot to the style of the game), overall design (sometimes crude which actually does the game good) - everything works in such a way that you experience the plagued town deeper.\nPlease keep in mind, though, that Pathologic can go hardcore on you - not because of difficulty (it's quite easy once you get the survival basics - especially after the first playthrough, and you need at least three to get the whole picture) or some mistakes in game design (Russian fans usually say that these "features" are a part of the dark atomosphere). The challenges are psychological. Sometimes it almost seems the game doesn't want to be played. But that was the goal of the authors (it's a totally different topic which can be discussed in the community or Ice-Pick Lodge forum). The Plague, the main antagonist in the game, is repulsive. The town is filthy. The dark secrets are dark. The strange things are driving you mad because you don't understand what's happening (especially, once again, in your first playthrough). Everything is against you. But you need to pass this resolve test to get your prize, which is experiencing one of the most unusual and deep videogames.\nSo take some immunity pills and jump in.","November 14, 2015","true","3.3"," 27 of 27 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","27","27","0","0"

It is a critically acclaimed game from Russian Developer Ice Pick Lodge, who also made The Void and Knock Knock. It has absolutely everything I want in a game, it is dark, bleak and violent, but also beautiful and intelligent. The story is mysterious and fascinating, full of twists and turns. It is an open world, survival horror, RPG adventure FPS, set in a strange and wonderful town. The game wants to kill you, not only that, it wants to destroy your save files, make all of them unusable. The game tracks a variety of player data, Reputation, Health, Immunity, Hunger, Exhaustion, and Infection. If your reputation is too low you will be attacked on sight by the townsfolk, you lose reputation by killing innocent people, you gain it by doing good deeds and killing criminals. If your health is too low, you die, obviously, however, gaining health is not always an easy thing, even a small fight can put you in a dangerous situation. The only way to heal is with bandages and tourniquets which you get by trading bottles of water with drunks. You get water by taking bottles out of garbage cans and filling them with water. Immunity determines your ability to fight plague. Hunger is a constant enemy, as the situation deteriorates, the economy changes, a loaf of bread may cost 4 times as much on the second day, and if you run out of food, it begins to eat away at your health until you die. You can buy food at stores or break into people's houses and wreck up the place, stealing all of their food in the process. Exhaustion is your tiredness, like a normal person you need to sleep at night, if your exhaustion is too high, you can die. Maybe you need to sleep, but if you sleep, you'll starve. And infection determines the effects of the virus taking over your body. If you savescum you can avoid getting infected for a while, but certain story segments may force you to. Infection can be treated with medicine, and cured with a children's powder, a rare and important item which can save you in a pinch. At night the knifebums run free, stabbing people to death and rifling through their pockets, and you as well if you're not careful. As the game progresses, the town is slowly devoured by plague, and each day is worse than the last.\n\nBut hiding among all this evil and punishing behavior, is one of the most beautiful and amazing stories ever told in a game. It came to them in a dream. The characters are spectacular, it has branching paths and meaningful dialogue options. It is filled with warring factions and groups, all plotting against each other, your friend today can be your enemy tomorrow. In Russia, this game won awards for it's storytelling, but their earlier release suffered from a terrible translation. I didn't think it was that bad, I felt the translation made the town seem more foreign, it was still an amazing game, but we can finally enjoy the game as it was meant to be played. This is a much better translation that makes a lot more sense. There are 3 playable characters totalling 70+ hours of gameplay. In the earlier version the Devotress's path was unplayable due to the state of it's translation, but this time they used an in house team to make sure they got it right, and now her path is fully playable. You unlock her by completing the path of one of the other players, she's the woman as reward.\n\nThe only caveat I would add is that I actually prefered the opening scene in the theater from the original version. I felt it had more emotion, and better acting, but the new version is defintely clearer, and probably a lot closer to the original Russian.\n\nEach character's path is different. When you choose one character the others plot against you. The bachelor walks into town a celebrated hero and immediately begins mingling with the town's ruling elite. The haruspex shows up and is immediately beaten to a pulp and wanted dead by the entire town, he is starving and tired, and the only mission he can initially find is a hit job against a small child. In the original release this mission was changed to have you murder a dwarf. It made no sense but they did it because they were afraid, but in this release they returned this mission to it's previous condition. And after pulling out a gun and shooting a random child on the street just to see if it was possible, I can assure you that this game has been restored to it's original Russian state. It is actually a pretty damn bold decision in the current climate. I don't know about the devotress's path because I didn't complete the game yet to unlock her, but I suspect it is the most interesting part.\n\nWhen you begin the game you are given a list of adherents, each character has their own adherents. If you fail to complete your missions during the day one of your adherents will get sick, and they will die if you do not provide them with a children's powder. In order to see the ending of the game, at least one of your adherants has to be alive at the end, and you can save before it to see the different endings each adherant has to offer. Some are incompatible, for one to live, the other must die. Although I have not seen the ending yet.\n\nThe graphics are a little nicer, and everything has been polished to perfection. The music, incidentally, is heavenly. Even the console mode is baked into the game and looks a lot prettier. The number one criticism of the previous version was it's translation, well that is gone now. Hopefully people can finally enjoy the game as it was meant to be. It really is one of the hidden gems on Steam, it is probably the most underrated game in all of history. It is so good, it is actually important, it gives us a glimpse of what games could be like some day. It is an artistic masterpiece which I have enjoyed more than any movie, book, tv show or music I have ever encountered. It is glorious, on par with the great works of literature, and you owe it to yourself to try it out. This is by far the best version of this game and a nice warm up to the full on remake in 2016. I'm hyped.","October 29, 2015","true","28.4"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","0"

It is part survival, part exploration, part role-playing, and part first person shooter. The story is confusing, intentionally so, and the game does not hold you by the hand. You are expected to pay attention, learn the lore and story behind the events taking place, and generally invest into the experience. If you do that, you will find no other experience like it. Your choices will matter. If you just want a casual learning curve, skip right on to something else because Pathologic is not for you.\n\nThe gameplay is clunky, old school, and the graphics are very basic for a game re-released in 2015. But as you play Pathologic, you will figure out the inner workings of the game just as you explore the innards of the town, quickly find what best to do and not to do, and generally get over the mechanical hurdles. If you want a quick start tip: buy food on day 1, stock up as much as you can, because prices skyrocket on day 2. Check the trash bins and learn to trade. Trading with the townsfolk is probably the best way to acquire wealth in items, especially bullets.\n\nYou will be walking from place to place a lot, and it is important to learn the layout of the town and how to best hit your objectives. This is something you will do over the course of the game, so it's entirely okay to look at your map to find proper placement. Do note that time does not pass while you are looking at the map, letters, or quests. But time does pass otherwise, and any quests not finished by midnight are dropped.\n\nIf you are still curious just what is going on in that town by the river, give it a shot. Play the Bachelor first, as it's a good introduction to the game. The first few days are slow, but once you are past that things quickly pick up. If you want hard mode, where you are dropped from orbit, battered, and then left unconscious in hostile territory, play Haruspex. Do note that Haruspex basically assumes you are familiar with most of the mechanics, people, and methods of survival. I highly recommend doing a Bachelor run first, and that should be anywhere from 20 to 30+ hours.\n\nNote: There is a re-release of Pathologic on the way; if you enjoyed the HD release, throw them some cash for those stretch goals. Or just wait for that game to hit instead of playing the HD release.","November 7, 2015","true","42.9"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

Pathologic is a game about making hard decisions both in the short and long term whilst coping with a constantly ticking timer of 13 days.\n\nReleased in 2005, winning Russian Game Of The Year and getting a poor english localization the game was fated to never succeed. It had lots of bugs and an awful translation that often left players completely unaware as to what to do. This new HD release doesn't fix all the problems the original had but it does smooth out the bugs as well as completely retranslating the game into something far more sensible.\n\nAt it's core, Pathologic is very much like any other first person western role playing game but leans towards a survival horror take on the usual genre.\n\nThe game is extremely difficult, dying is common, sometimes you can die in your sleep and the game won't help you, it'll just give you a big fat GAME OVER. The game requires quite a few hours of experimentation which can be easy if you quick save and quick load often; just be ready to sacrifice your sanity as you attempt to balance drug taking with disease, starvation and exhaustion all while selling your gun to get a can of peas so you can live another day. If you are unable to spend the time to learn the game and it's strange and nerve wrecking mechanics you might want to skip it altogether, but you're not a coward are you?\n\nBy far the most unique and avant garde video game you'll ever play.

Like a dream, it is difficult to describe, and to tell you truly I have significant difficulty recounting the events of the game's story: I can describe them adequately at an entirely superficial level, but bereft of their context their precise meaning is impossible to communicate plainly. In that sense, Pathologic is what I always point to when the question arises of whether video games can be considered art - it bears little similarity in terms of its structure to a film or novel, but instead makes innovative use of the unique characteristic of the medium to tell a story that cannot really exist in any other format.\n\nOn the basic level, Pathologic is a game where you amble about at a leisurely pace between various buildings. Sometimes you shoot and cut people, and you'll likely spend a lot of time scrounging for garbage to barter with and the necessities of life. It is slow, sometimes to the point of tedium, sometimes ugly, and curiously uninviting, even foreboding. It is also an incredibly atmospheric, richly layered narrative experience - something that exists not by itself but rather in the process of interaction between the game and the player.\n\nI'd say it's like nothing else in the world - a one-of-a-kind journey.

It's one of the best survival-focused games I've ever seen, and after all these years nothing comes to mind that has surpassed it. Time flows in real time in the game, important characters can live or die based on how you spend that time, and events happen whether you're there to see them or not. On the first day you may casually introduce yourself to the important members of the city, only to find yourself trading your gun to a child for a loaf of bread or some pills within a few days because of the rising prices of the shops. Pathologic is an extremely dreary game, and it's that dreariness that made it so famous.\n\nThe other thing that made the game famous, or rather infamous, was its translation, which was fairly bad, particularly in the third storyline that you unlock by playing at least one of the others. But now, at long last, we have a new fully retranslated version of the story, complete with newly recorded audio. Some of the new voice acting is still pretty bad, but it's not like it could really get much worse from the original, and most of the dialogue is text-based anyways.\n\nOther than that, not much has changed. The graphics have been touched up, but it's mostly just an addition of bloom and SSAO to give the buildings a slightly different look. The big difference is just the widescreen support, really. The gameplay is the same Pathologic as ever, and I'm perfectly okay with that.\n\nOverall, for $13 I'd highly recommend trying Pathologic at some point. It's a very strange game and it's easy to get turned off within the first few minutes by the strange opening scenes, but once you get into it it's hard to get out of it. It may not be the fully remade edition that's releasing next year (and you might even want to wait for that instead, if a true remake feels more like something you'd rather wait on), but I'm just happy to finally own Pathologic on Steam in a form that I can actually read.","October 29, 2015","true","78.2"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","14","18","0","1"

Although most of the gameplay (at least in the bachelor campaign) is somewhat of a walking simulator it fits with the games themes very well. Each day you have to complete a series of tasks to try to find a cure to the plauge, but each task is seemingly all the way across the city so each day becomes a frantic and tiring race to each location with the knowledge that you probably don't have enough time or food to complete everything by that day. By day 9 you will be physically worn out and tired of this but so will your character; although that is certainly not fun it fits perfectly in what the game is trying to say in the same way that a horror movie may not be fun but the dread may fit with the themes of the movie.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gintian/recommended/384110/","Gintian","Killua","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gintian/","14 products in account","Сама игра это большое театраное представление и на сцене — три фигуры. Жертвы обстоятельств, как часто бывает. Судьба приготовила им нелегкое испытание: ближайшие 12 дней будут настоящим кошмаром, своеобразной борьбой за жизнь, в заражонном городе. Спастись самим, а так же вытащить из капкана добрую половину населения, заодно навсегда поставив крест на заразе, охватившей город.\nЗахватывающая история — ценнейший компонент «Мора». Ложь, предательство, интриги, неожиданные доброжелатели… Витки событий следуют один за другим. Так, крупные правящие семейства — Каины, Ольгимские и Сабуровы, растащившие во владение отдельные участки города, — все время пытаются подмять нас под себя. «Не верьте соседям» — напутствует отпрыск погибшего властителя. Странно, но «соседи» столь же убедительно твердят о его нечистоплотности. А с приездом Инквизитора накопленные сведения вообще отправляются на свалку. Здесь никому нельзя верить!\nДиалоги потрясают насыщенностью. В меру литературный текст иногда достигает огромных размеров, превращая приключение в некий аналог интерактивной книги. «Интерактивной» — потому что для большинства реплик предусмотрено несколько ответов, причем разные варианты зачастую по-разному влияют на дальнейший ход дискуссии, а то и всей игры. Ну, а «книги» — в силу отсутствия озвучки.\nИ да чуть не забыл! Давящая, депрессивная обстановка сразу   приходит от прогулки по зараженному кварталу, мимо покрытых плесенью «плачущих» домов, ядовитых испарений и зомби, закутанных в грязные простыни, становится не по себе.\nНесмотря на то, что развернуться здесь почти негде, побегать предстоит от души. Без карты и навыков владения ею соваться в жуткий лабиринт из петляющих улочек, ветхих построек и непреодолимых препятствий (заборы, ограды и всякий мусор) опасно. А чтобы игрок не заплутал в хитросплетениях сюжета, авторы выдали ему специальный блокнотик, где отмечаются основные и дополнительные задачи (подобных квестов редко бывает более трех штук, их скрупулезное выполнение не входит в раздел обязательств, но попотеть, тем не менее, придется). Имейте в виду: не успеете до полуночи проставить галочки рядом со всеми пунктами — ровно в двенадцать страницы дневника опустеют, незаконченные дела так ими и останутся.\nВсем приятной игры, выбирайте правельные решения.","February 14","true","40.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

One of the most important titles of all time and one of the biggest achievements done through the video game. But this HD remix is the first occasion to play it with an accurate translation of the original script, and it's simply a pure happiness. If the original translation from 2006 had this really weird charm that gived to the game a very special mystic feeling growing through the journey to the steppe, this re-translation extremly respectful of the original writing of Ice-Pick Lodge is truly incredible of pertinency, and manage to make you understand even more than the old version why the game winned several prices back in the days of his Russian publication.\nSo this new edition and occasion to play the game, for which i have a very special affection given the fact that it's easily one of my favorite ones, really makes me very happy by finally giving to Pathologic a great translation and a boost to the fan community, a steam version, allows the game to get a bit more out the shadows and also making me even more impatient than i already was to play the remake next year.

The reason why I couldn't see it through to the end......or even to the second virtual day, is because as said before: it's VERY dialogue based, and anything important in the game is in text dialogue. Not audio. The text is always in the mideval accent, as well. This made most important messages a tad more difficult to decipher.\n\nThe combat in this game is perhaps it's lowest point. The combat (from what I have expirienced) is very tedious, because there is no running or blocking mechanic. If you ever get into a strife with a foe, you literally have to hurt this person, take a hit, then hurt this person again. If you lose enough health, you might wanna take a potion, but other than that: there's nothing I can say.\n\n\nIn conclusion: If you want to read a novel and enjoy large open-world maps but do not enjoy action games, then I'd recommend this for you. If however, you are looking for an expirience with good combat mechanics, an easy to follow plot, clearly laid out decisions (with clear consequences), then I'm afraid you've come to the wrong game.","April 8","false","1.2"," 21 of 42 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","21","42","3","12"

I think the thing Pathologic captured without flaw was its natural feeling, yes you could try finish the plot or you could simply look out for yourself, maybe you will stab kids, maybe you will break into houses or maybe even save the city and you feel like you are in a dying place.\n\nAnd the city street isnt so bad....its a shame they used it 100 times. I kid you not its like these people made a total of 5 streets then just copy and pasted it to create a fairly large (which works against the game) world.\n\nThe rest of the game its nothing but a repetitive clunky mess, which is a shame because the story was fairly interesting but wasnt worth it under repetitive missions which consist of "go here, talk to this guy" at least 7 times a day. The combat is somewhat simmilar to having your arms stapled to planks of wood going from your shoulder to your wrist and being told "fight" its clunky, slow and generally is just a piece of ♥♥♥♥. And I could get on with that, Thief had terrible combat but thief had a good stealth system, this however does not.\n\nAnd look I get the game is supposed to be difficult, but its difficult without reason, its difficult not because the game is well made, but its because it is unfair. Food is expensive, as any game like this should have it but if you dont eat at least 7 loafs of bread a day you will starve to death.....what the actual ♥♥♥♥ that is worse than dayZ:Standalone ♥♥♥♥♥ing for not getting food every 3 minutes.\n\nI really wanted to enjoy this game, I really did but its clunky unfair balance, artifical difficulty and copy-paste enviroments ruin it for me. Here is hoping the full remake coming out this year fixes the issues Pathologic left and creates a game of amazing quality.","March 21","false","17.0"," 5 of 23 people (22%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","22","5","23","0","6"

I really tried to enjoy this game, I really wanted to. But the translation, horrible voice acting and lack of direction makes me wish I never paid for this even at 90% off.\n\nThe game is focussed around lots of reading. This would be fine if the translation was decent. The translation is so bad a fan tried to make his own to replace it but since then I heard he gave up. If the games' dialogue wasn't very important to the game I'd keep playing but you have to read to know where to go, what to look for on the map and more.\n\nI do like the reputation system and the general premise and atmosphere in the game. It's like a mix of Majora's Mask and Deus Ex. Perhaps with a later update this will be worth trying out again. But as far as right now, why would I put in hours into this game when there's plenty of others calling for me.\n\nGoogle Translate Simulator / 10","January 2","false","2.4"," 6 of 36 people (17%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","17","6","36","2","8"

I'll start with what it does right, and then spiral decisively into why it's a huge pile of ♥♥♥♥, like a homing bomb careening for a school of orphans.\n\nSo.  Atmosphere is awesome, there's some agency to do stuff.  The world is pretty well thought out, I feel like I'm in some between-world where fantasy and reality are bleeding into one another.\n\nNow for the ♥♥♥♥.\n\nI loaded this up expecting to have a bit of a free roam misadventure that was terrifying and repulsive.  I did not expect that what would terrify and repulse me would be the writing.  It's staggeringly pretentious.  You know who uses big words?  ♥♥♥♥ing rookies.  Real people get their point across with efficient words, and fake people sit around looking up big words because it makes them feel smart.  That's what this writer did, and it frankly detracts from the game when I'm forced to sit there and muddle through language.  God forbid someone hasn't taken a post-secondary english credit because if they haven't, this game is gonna take Google-♥♥♥♥ing-translate.\n\nAnd everyone talks in this alien way.  Don't tell me its a story thing, either; you can easily have people talk like morons for the same reason you make them talk as though they're elitest literature professors.  No, see, what you've done is make it so every character in this ♥♥♥♥ing mess sounds the same.  They all sound aloof, pompous, and boring.  I did not walk through a gigantic ♥♥♥♥ing map to talk to Fancy Mc♥♥♥♥face to solve the mystery of what the ♥♥♥♥ he's saying, I'm fighting the plague.  Or death itself.  Or some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that is never touched upon.\n\nYeah the world map is ♥♥♥♥ing impossibly huge for the amount of effort it takes to travel.  Get used to spending the majority of your time walking down streets that are identical, looking at your map constantly.\n\nSome of you are going to tell me, "CptTrigg, you need to progress further the game opens up later on!"  To you all I say, shut up.  You're the reason people use 'irregardless' as a word.  Games should not 'open up' later.  I should be opening them up at all times.  Your expectation of lazy design is stupid just like you are stupid.\n\nTighten up your game.  Think like Hemingway.

Characters spout cryptic gibberish and direct you around a largely empty town, urging you to speak to various NPCs who can shed light on your predicament.  You play as one of three (only two are available from the beginning) characters whos fates have been somehow entwined in a dusty town on the edge of nowhere.\n\nIf you choose to play as the 'Haruspex" , you have unwittingly opted in to a harsh survival sim, where everyone is out to get you and careful management of health , fatigue, hunger, and reputation is crucial.  If any one of these meters reaches a critical point,  you are unceremoniously greeted with a failure cinematic and dumped back to the main menu.  There is no warning, no second chance, just failure.  And loading a saved game.  Some times it even happens when the HUD says you're ok.  Why not.\n\nProponents of 'old school' games, and masochistic players who enjoy being subjected to obtuse mechanics will probably laud this unforgiving attitude toward progression.  Kill a man so you can loot his organs, and sell them to a weird little guy who lives in a swamp on the far end of the map.  He will give you herbs in exchange.  What can you do with these herbs? Something.  Probably.\n\nOn the plus side, the atmosphere is pretty awesome here,  evoking memories of S.T.A.L.K.E.R, with its hunched characters and ramshackle environments.  The audio is also strong with a disturbing score, that seems to be comprised of a mixture of tribal chanting and hiccups.  Gameplay wise however, there's not much to like.  The world may evoke a powerful atmosphere but it is largely static, with almost zero interactive objects.  Get used to looting the same two garbage bins over and over again ....\n\nIf you are willing to put up with all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t this game throws your way,  and slog through the inane, poorly translated dialogue, I'm sure you would find some kind transcendent experience here.  The city is some kind of metaphorical purgatory where doomed souls go to live out their nightmares.","November 9, 2015","false","1.9"," 42 of 161 people (26%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","26","42","161","6","16"

Wanna visit Russian silent hill? Wanna visit a wonderful town where you can meet ovegrown Tonberry from final fantasy and nobody doesn't care about it? Want to live a life of a homeless man? Well, then this game Is for you!\nIn all seriousness, this game is typically not fun, for me personally. There is a WAY too many aspects of it that you have to care about to survive, and it kills all enjoyment, because instead of exploring a haunted town and talk to characters you have to bother about your survival. Wich would not be a problem if you wouldn't burdened by six life-threatning bars.\nNarrativly It feels more like a novel written by Dostoyevski. Problem is I not a fan of him at all. I know he is terribly popular in foreign countries, but not so much in mine. I have to say that there is a lot of interesting separate storylines... wich are ruined by terribly written characters, who are way too busy to whine about life instaed of helping you to solve THEIR problems.\nSo, yeah.
