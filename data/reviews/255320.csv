And especially when on sale. Point & click fans should not mis this one: it's great fun.\n\nThe tl;dr version: you will want to install the 7u79 Java 7 JRE and will if playing the English language version need to change to German for one of the puzzles (the kitchen menu one) and for the ending credits, but that's it. Steam-achievements worked fine for me with either language.\n\nFor a bit more detail; it is as to the first and foremost technical issue as of 2015-07-14 likely that the game won't run fullscreen for you after initial install, presenting you with a white screen with sound only and no picture. This is a Java version mismatch. The first run of the game installs the very first version of the 32-bit Java 7 JRE (7.0.0), which at the very least on Windows 7 64-bit does not in fact work for this game.\n\nIf you do not need a version 8 JRE installed for other purposes, it's easy to fix. Install the latest and last version of the 32-bit (i.e., "x86") Java 7 JRE manually; version 7u79, released 2015-04-14, at the time of writing available from\n\nhttp://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre7-downloads-1880261.html\n\nIf you allow the installation to remove the 7.0.0 version, running the game will reinstall it alongside again but it seems to in fact still use the new version. It for me runs fine after installing 7u79.\n\nYou do currently need to not let the just installed new JRE7 subsequently update itself to JRE8; this at the moment installs the 8u51 JRE and will see the game return to its original white-screen behavior. This may of course have changed by the time you read this, but if not, I would advice to simply temporarily uninstall JRE8 for the duration of playing the game. Some 20 hours, that is.\n\nNote that if you insist on not even being offered the upgrade to JRE8 by the JRE7 you will find the relevant option in the Java 32-bit control panel to not stick unless you run it as administrator. If the account that you are running Steam and the game under has administrative rights, this consists of right-clicking\n\nC:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre7\bin\javacpl.exe\n\nand choosing "Run as adminstrator". If you run Steam and the game under an unprivileged user account, temporarily give this user administrative rights, only to unselect automatic updates as per the above. And blame Oracle. You may or may not have to repeat this for the old 7.0.0 version as installed by the game and as found at\n\nC:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre1.7.0\bin\javacpl.exe\n\nAt this point you should be able to start enjoying a very good adventure game, fullscreen or windowed, and in either English or German.\n\nUnless you luck through it, it is likely that you will get the game stuck inside the kitchen-menu puzzle if you play the English language version. If so, Alt-Tab to your desktop, end the game by right-clicking it on the taskbar and restart in German. You can quit and restart in English again immediately after solving the puzzle. The English-language version of the ending-credits is also bugged currently; same solution applies.\n\nIf you read to here, you're probably wondering if this game is worth the hassle. Yes, I would say it is. In fact, I consider the game an instant (not-)modern point & click classic. Be sure to check out the sequel, "Edna & Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes" as well; a more modern interface and every bit as entertaining.","July 13, 2015","true","20.3"," 34 of 35 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","34","35","0","0"

It had great voice acting, witty dialogue, and nice music.  Overall I had a lot of fun playing this game, but I can't bring myself to recommend this game to others.  The English version of the game has a couple game breaking bugs that will keep you from not only getting achievements, but, more importantly, also keep you from finishing the game.\n\nThe good news is that within the guide section for this game someone was kind enough to post a patch that fixes both of those bugs.  Bad news is that that link is outdated and doesn't take you to the patch, but thankfully someone else posted a link in the comments which takes you to a different site that contains the necessary download for the patch.  Sadly, the game is still prone to problems even after you go through the trouble of downloading the patch and swapping out the necessary files.  I quickly learned to save after I did anything, because the game often crashes.  The game also has a problem where sometimes it won't start up properly (the music will play, but the window won't pop up or, if it does pop up, will simply show a white screen).\n\nAll of those things can add up to a very frustrating experience when trying to play the game.  The main thing that kept me from simply calling it quits was the fact that the first time I played I was very close to the end before I experienced the first crash (and learned the importance of saving) and I wanted to know how it ended.\n","August 9, 2014","false","25.2"," 52 of 65 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","52","65","0","8"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kickbubblegum/recommended/255320/","kickbubblegum","kick","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kickbubblegum/","1009 products in account","A creepily characterful and impressively detailed comedy asylum escape cartoon point-and-click adventure game from then independent German studio Daedalic, for which many of the reviews in the English-speaking press have been bafflingly low.\n\nFor neophytes to the point-and-click genre, perhaps it will test their patience too far. But for serious adventure fans, an unmissable slice of gaming history, as it started a raft of defiantly different titles from the same studio that maintained its independence from 2007 until May 2014.\n\nEven taking into account that the only official English version has two serious (but fixable*) bugs, several puzzles that ask a little too much of the player's imagination, and that it occasionally lacks clarity in animation, this game deserves more attention.\n\nThose negative aspects certainly prevent this game from approaching the upper echelons of adventure gaming or being recommended to players new to the genre, but its depth, its engaging and original story, and its many challenges will give regular adventure gamers, or simply lovers of a good tale, many moments of satisfaction.\n\nPerhaps it's the unashamedly old-shool approach to puzzle-based gameplay that resulted in those scores, as seems to be the increasing trend in game reviewing. But it's exactly those aspects, the tricky but satisfying puzzles, the taunting clues, the asides and terrible puns that often had me staring blankly as often as chortling away, that give this game character, making it enjoyable and underlining my feeling that a lot of effort went into it.\n\nThis game is fully-voiced, and in this case, that really means something. The sheer number of voice lines included to cover virtually every item interaction is something I've only seen elsewhere in another 2008 game released slightly later, A Vampyre Story, made by ex-Lucasarts members, and featuring a similarly creepy tale and sarcastic female protagonist. Breakout's voice lines gave a real sense of character to Edna, our less than sane avatar, and her soft toy sidekick, Harvey, which is what adventure games are uniquely able to excel at - making you believe the people and situations.\n\nStaying with the Vampyre Story comparison, since both games were heavily influenced by 1990's LucasArts titles: Vampyre is what a team composed of programmers, writers and artists with decades of experience and greater financial backing might produce: polished and slick. On the other hand, for a first attempt at a game made largely by a single student in his spare time, Breakout is impressively close in terms of ambition and detail, if not execution.\n\nIt's all those factors contributing to the game's believability that allows the story to make a pleasing transition in mood towards its latter half, where dialogue clues will increasingly give the player the sense of a shift in the way they think about the main character. Exactly where this happens will vary between players, but it's neatly done.\n\nWhile the characters are colourfully drawn both literally and in terms of character, with a great attention to the details of their likes, dislikes and small personality details, and several characters are "cute", it's worth noting this isn't a game for very young children. It may not be clear from the game's marketing material which shows the potential heroine clutching her toy rabbit, who is her co-star, but certain sections of the game contain some rather gruesome cartoon violence. Nothing that would worry a teen or adult - we're talking Itchy and Scratchy here - but enough that it might frighten someone younger.\n\nFinal thoughts:\n\nAn underrated and creepy game with many laughs, but its oblique clues hidden within obscure item combinations and the leaps of logic required for certain puzzles mean it's probably not for those who are new to point-and-click adventures, especially if they are very young children. It's a three-star game, but it shouldn't be left to languish in the pile of the one or two star games it's often thrown in with.\n\nBug fix Footnote:\n\n*To fix the English version's bugs with the kitchen menu and ending scenes, visit the Breakout section of the Steam Community Guides.","July 15, 2014","true","0.1"," 22 of 26 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","22","26","0","3"

In fact, it is just so good, that something tells me that I have to write a review.\nSo if you like old fashion point and click adventure, you will love this one!\nBut enough of the glorification, here are the facts why it is so superb.\n\nAs everything in the game, the story plot is weird, but in a really lovely way. Basically, you (Edna) and your little pyromaniac stuffed rabbit (Harvey) are trapped in an asylum and you have no clue why. So you have to find a way to break out and get your memories back. On your way you will meet a lot of crazy people, which are helping you out (one more, one less).\n\nThe voice acting (just played the german version) is well and fits perfectly to the witty dialogues and its characters. Sometime you can hear that not all of the voice actors are professionals, but that's no big harm to the game. You can literally talk to everything and you will always get a unique answer. Even if you combine things, you will always get an impertinent comment. All is attended by catchy music. The puzzles are creative, but never unfair. At some parts I had to riddle for a while, but I've never really stuck or was forced to use the internet to get the solution. The game is basically divided into two sections. The first is bright, colorful and the pure joy of life. The second part is dark, morbid and almost serious. Especially the second part shows that the game is not made for young kids! But, no matter which part, both are detailed made with heart and fantasy.\n\nBut, there are some downsides as well...\nThe game crashes a lot. Because it uses Java underneath, it's doomed to perform badly. So the strategy is "save early, save often". The resolution is low and if you play the game in fullscreen mode, everything becomes a little bit blurry. Also the animation and drawings are miles away from being technically perfect. But on the other hand, if you know that the most of the game is made by only one lousy german student (now a cofounder of Daedalic), it starts to feel "authentic" and charming.\n\nConclusion\n\nIf you are able to overlook the few rough edges its a 10/10.\nAnd beside that, if the game is on sale its a must buy for every p-a-c adventure lover.","February 14, 2015","true","17.6"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","13","14","0","2"

The game has a lot of problems: poor resolution; unskippable animations; one game-breaking bug (in English version), and broken ending cutscenes (there are two distinct endings based on your final action). There is an unofficial fix available on the Steam Community that fixes the last two technical errors but, still, they should have official fixes by now and are totally unacceptable. Besides those points, the game is fairly solid considering it had such a tiny team was developed as part of a university thesis. The translation is also very good and I only noticed errors in some of the interface and achievements; the dialogue is flawless. It's a very solid adventure that feels quite similar (and pays homage to) the comical Lucasarts adventure games.  Although Harvey was getting on my nerves by the end, Edna is one of the most of likeable protagonists I've seen in an adventure game in some time. She is adorably bonkers and reminds me of Laverne from Day of the Tentacle. But that being said, and although I look forward to trying the sequel, the quality of the game (game-breaking bugs included) and the $15 price tag do not match up. If you see it on sale, though, for a few dollars (and locate the unoffical fixes before you start) it's probably worth it.","August 22, 2015","false","10.6"," 18 of 30 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","18","30","0","0"

Combinations of objects that don't solve a puzzle each yield their own unique joke responses instead of a rote response like "that won't work". Furthermore, pressing the spacebar displays a list of all objects in the current screen which you can interact with, thus allowing you to spend your time actually solving puzzles instead of just pixel hunting.\n\nOn the downside there are a couple of minor issues with the english translation as well as one major issue. A very small handful of captions and tooltips have been accidentally left untranslated, but this is not a serious problem. What IS a serious problem however is that in English language mode the puzzle where you have to tamper with the cafeteria menu may cause the game to lock up; it can only be reliably solved without problems by switching to German for the duration of that puzzle (which requires exiting and restarting the game)","September 15, 2015","true","12.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Regardless, there are workarounds provided by the community.\n\nThe review: This is the kind of game every P&C adventure gamer will love.  Nearly every item can be combined with nearly every background object and person and situation for a unique comical response, even items that would normally sit in your inventory for a few second before being used.  The voice acting for both Edna and Harvey are great and rarely tiresome.  The comedy is spot on, and the puzzles, while occasionally frustrating, are not impossible.\n\nBut it's not perfect.  The second half of the game is way, way too dark, and the switch is sharp enough to give you whiplish.  It's like watching a children's cartoon and suddenly someone changes the channel to HBO during a slasher movie marathon.  It doesn't feel appropriate at all and almost spoils the entire experience.  There's also the occasional issue where certain combinations of items will crash the game, like Straw + Cans of Paint (or would that be considered a feature?), which, to be fair, you'll only find if you're obsessive on finding every joke.  And there's the one game-breaking bug that you'll need to work around.\n\nThe game is dated, and genre shift is extreme, and it can be frustrating, but I would still recommend this game to any fan of point-and-clickers (especially if you got it in a bundle like I did).  After all, you were going to hunt down a walkthrough anyway, weren't you?","September 5, 2015","true","8.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

Do you remember the absurd situations and crazy humour of Monkey Island? Then you'll love Edna & Harvey The Breakout. As far as graphic adventures go, this one is much closer to the aforementioned masterpieces, and much more enjoyable than other, fancier but also clunkier graphic adventures, such as the secret files series.\nBe careful though, it isn't all laughters and nonsense... Edna & Harvey's story is much darker than it would seem at a first glance. As you go on, you'll discover more and more about the reasons that brought Edna inside the asylum, and you'll definitely want to keep playing for one more reason - not only to complete the game and have a good laugh at all the crazy situations and colorful characters, but also to discover the truth: how will it end?\nThe game was created by just a handful of people, as a project for a thesis: every now and then there are some little graphic bugs and occasional crashes to desktop, but it's nothing gamebreaking and, if you remember to save often, it's nothing more than a small nuisance. The game is very enjoyable even with those small bugs, so dive in and play it to your heart's content!\nRetrogamers and old SCUMM graphic adventures fans will just love this game, but I recommend it to every fan of the genre, really.\n","August 14, 2014","true","21.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Once you adjust to it, the writing takes over and you get sucked into the world.\n\nThe thing about a lot of puzzle games is that there's this stereotype that you throw a cat, a garbage can, and some string together, and you get the catapult needed to get past that pesky castle gate. Most times, game creators fail to find the balance for these puzzles, either making them too easy or so non-sensical that it would take a severly autistic child for it to make any sense. This game treads that line well.\n\nIf you want a great story, logical puzzles, and good laughs, check this game out.","April 15, 2014","true","2.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

So I went into this game strongly predisposed to like it.\n\n...but this game was actually kind of disappointing from the very beginning. I was expecting a followup to one of my favorite adventure games of all time (Edna & Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes). But this is actually a much older game with an older engine, and it doesn't even feature Lilli, the main character from that game.\n\nIt also doesn't feature the endlessly apologetic narrator, whose epic dry humor was more or less the entire point of Harvey's New Eyes. It does still have classic Daedalic puzzle solving gameplay, once you get past the uber archaic interface (I have to click "look" and "pick up" and all that? Wow did we ever get past those buttons years and years ago.) Dialog and voice acting are good, too, although it doesn't quite have the bite that the newer Daedalic games have.\n\nThe art is reasonable for an older game, but, much like everything else about it, it doesn't have that level of majestic polish that stuff like Night of the Rabbit or the Deponia series have.\n\nBasically, it feels exactly like what it is: an older game from the company before their age of greatness truly began. It's not bad per se, just ... ah, wow. I wanted a sequel. I really did.\n\nThere's also the problem where this game has bugs. Massive amounts of bugs. Crash to desktop bugs. "Go download an updated script file to properly solve this problem" bugs. "You can't win the game if you make this mistake" bugs. Unacceptable and amaturish; I've come to expect more from Daedalic and not getting it is quite disappointing.\n\nStill, I enjoyed the game when it wasn't crashing, and played it through to the end without complaints. I probably wouldn't buy it again with full knowledge of what I was getting, but neither am I sorry I played it. It's on the razor's edge between recommended and not, but I think it's just barely on the good side of that edge.\n\nOverall rating, 3/5 (competent one-time experience but nothing exceptional).\n","April 20, 2014","true","10.5"," 13 of 24 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","13","24","0","2"

It's not just bugs that give trouble though; the game is lacking from a user friendliness standpoint. Navigating the general area you spend most of your time in gets tedious where it really didn't need to, and some really nice features to have such as dialogue skip (!) and windowed mode exist but you would never know without Google.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/talgaby/recommended/255320/","talgaby","talgaby","http://steamcommunity.com/id/talgaby/","334 products in account","Short version: 77%Edna & Harvey is your typical indie point ‘n’ click adventure game with awkward controls and user interface, choppy animation, and of course a plethora of great ideas. Ideas including a thought-provoking yet still cartoonish story about mental health, and puzzles so complex that even veteran adventure gamers can enjoy it.\n\nLong version:Edna & Harvey: The Breakout is one of, if not the very first game made by Daedelic Entertainment. Since it was originally a university project, don’t expect the usual quality; be ready instead for some choppy animations and game controls that are more reminiscent of the early 90s SCUMM games than 2011. It is also evident that voice acting was added in much later.\n\nAll these excusable rookie designer mistakes hide a really unique gem under the clunky exterior, starting with the core of an adventure game, the story itself. It follows the titular Edna, one of many patients in an insane asylum, who constantly tries to escape with the help of her stuffed rabbit, Harvey. Along the way she meets a plethora of colourful people– mostly other inmates– who all give a distinct and strong character to the game.\nThe serious subject of mental disorders and the sometimes disturbingly dark elements– which include torture and murder– are in a strange contrast with the cartoonish art style. This conflict is not just an allegory for Edna’s split personality, but it is also used to induce discomfort in the player in the right way, just like a black comedy.\n\nMost starting adventure game developers tend to crank up the difficulty to create something that may surpass the legendary LucasArts/Sierra games. Edna & Harvey is no exception. The amount of sheer trial and error to find the underlying crazy logic of the puzzles is insane. This way you will barely realise that most of the story is limited to a single building, because the game will still take quite long to beat.","August 12, 2015","true","10.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The story is pretty good, but due to the nature of the game it is impossible to really enjoy it to its fullest.\n\nThe game, in many places, is broken. From missing/untranslated tooltips to animation bugs, achievements don't trigger on the english version, and even the final chapter of the game is impossible to access without a user-made patch. This level of problems is quite frankly unacceptable from a game. The performance isn't great either. You would expect from an old game that it would run fine on newer systems, but no. I'm not sure what the game is loading but moving to new areas in the game causes the program to hang for inordinately long time.\n\nThe gameplay itself is not great. While the game starts out good it devolves into some really obscure puzzles that need to be figured out, and that need to be done in an exact order. If you get ahead of yourself things stop triggering properly, which is very annoying.\n\nThe voice acting and animation (when it does work) are pretty good. The characters in the game are also very funny and could really tell a good story, if in the right sort of game. It's just a pity this game is so bad.\n\nSave yourself some trouble, and stay well away from this game.","May 2, 2015","false","10.9"," 16 of 33 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","16","33","0","1"

Sadly, I feel like E&H:TB pales slightly in comparison to HNY and the major bug I encountered in this game just made me unable to give this game my recommendation.\n\nMy review of the game so far though, is that you are stuck in one (uninteresting) venue for far too long. I missed the thrill for adventure that I felt in HNY where I got to explore different and interesting places. I also felt like there is a lack of humour in this game compared to HNY, and the jokes that are there are quite dry. The puzzles are still relatively enjoyable, but there are definitely other areas that this game can improve on.\n\nLastly, I don't usually complain about small bugs within a game here and there, but I've had COUNTLESS crashes midgame before finally encountering a major bug where I simply cannot continue the game. For a game that I would rate as mediocre, this flaw simply ruined any enjoyment I had with this game.\n\nAs much as I would like to recommend this, I'd have to say The Breakout has been quite a disappointing experience compared to the developers' other works like Deponia. Check it out if you got this game for cheap but otherwise would not suggest buying it at retail price.\n\nP.s. if you're curious about where I left the game, it was at the guard monitor puzzle in which you have to spell WC on the screen.

The game was conceived as a Masters Degree project for the lead developer and has since been distributed as an official release.\n\nThe game tries hard to be developed in the style of an older Adventure Game from the 90's.  The interface is just as clunky and uncooperative, the inventory is just as much a pain to open and close, and it is just as hard to interact with objects as it was for one of those games from the early 90's.  There are multiple ways to interact with objects and there is no easy way to pick and choose which one to use other than go through a clunky menu to find the interaction method or the object to use and then click on the object.  It does discourage mouse-searching or throwing objects at each other until it works because you don't want to have to work the interface, but alas - this is one thing adopted from the early era of the genre which Daedalic did not yet smother in bed.  I do appreciate how breaking down early adventure games with this release managed to give Daedalic the tools it needed to put together it's later games, but the mess you have to deal with in this game is just a pain.\n\nThe story follows Edna who begins the game in a padded cell because she is obviously crazy and her only companion is her stuffed rabbit who speaks to her.  Her first task is to escape from the cell and go on to find out why you were locked up inside it in the first place.  The story is well written, and I was interested in finding out what happened to Edna, what's going on at the asylum and meeting the other inmates.  The dialogue is well written if a bit repetitive, especially if you are trying to find the answer to a dialogue puzzle, you may hear the same thing over and over again.  The translation is quality work, with only a little germenglish disrupting things.  I honestly didn't think too much of it and thought it a part of the asylum setting.\n\nI have no complaint about the puzzles other than the repetitive dialogue I spoke of above.  The difficulty ramps up gradually getting harder toward the end.  You do have all the tools at your disposal but finding the solution or making attempts is hampered by the clunky and annoying to use interface.\n\nAt its core, this is a good game.  It is held back by how far it tries to emulate early adventure games from the 90's.  There is such a thing as being too retro where you not only duplicate what made these games successful and fun to play, but also annoying and difficult to use.","February 13","false","7.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

At first glance it seems to be a call back to the old style point-and-click adventure games; the sort of stories that used nonsensical "Nintendo logic" to solve the puzzles, while reveling in their own ridiculousness.  I admit, I totally bought into that.  I had so much fun with the carefree tone and witty dialogue that I would often forget the serious nature of the setting.  Everything from the wonky art style, to the jazzy music, to the over-the-top character personalities is initially played for laughs, and it's all so well done that you may forget you're playing as a mental patient surrounded by crazy people.  This is done towards a very deliberately effect, but the result so crafty that you may end up playing through the entire game without ever consciously realizing what hit you.  For the sake of spoilers, I will say no more, because this is a game that should be experienced by lovers of the genre.\n\nAs a wonderful bonus, this game is fully voice acted, with the acting varying in quality.  However, since 80% of the characters are insane, even the most hammy and ridiculous of performances feels appropriate in context.","February 10, 2015","true","12.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I loved most of the wacky characters you meet in the asylum and most of all loved the main character Edna. It was so much fun running amok – there was a peculiar guilty pleasure in leaving cheeky scribbles around the place. However, some character dialogues were boring, too long, or annoying, especially Harvey. I found some of the puzzles so challenging that I had to resort to a walkthrough. However I felt that some of the solutions didn’t seem very intuitive, but then again this game IS based in an insane asylum. The art was simple, but had its charms. The music was simple, and sometimes bordered on annoying. Both endings also left a stale taste in my mouth. Overall, though, it was a decently entertaining experience. The game starts off really well but then struggles towards the end and then flops.

On top that it has the key thing for an enjoyable point and click game; a good story. It has loads of witty dialogue and good voice acting. You can talk to pretty much all of the inanimate objects round the asylum. It makes good use of the achievements as they get you to go back and explore more of the silly things you can do that were not necessary to progress the plot. Other people talk about bugs but I only encountered one bug which was the ending credits failed to load correctly, but by that point I had already seen the epilogue for that ending so it didn't matter. I don't know if this means I got lucky or the bugs have been fixed. Another thing this game has in its favour is it is quite long for a point and click game. I have 2 complains about this game though. Firstly you cannot change the screen resolution. And secondly this game is crying out for some kind of hints mechanism.

At first glance it seems to be a call back to the old style point-and-click adventure games; the sort of stories that used nonsensical "Nintendo logic" to solve the puzzles, while reveling in their own ridiculousness.  I admit, I totally bought into that.  I had so much fun with the carefree tone and witty dialogue that I would often forget the serious nature of the setting.  Everything from the wonky art style, to the jazzy music, to the over-the-top character personalities is initially played for laughs, and it's all so well done that you may forget you're playing as a mental patient surrounded by crazy people.  This is done towards a very deliberately effect, but the result so crafty that you may end up playing through the entire game without ever consciously realizing what hit you.  For the sake of spoilers, I will say no more, because this is a game that should be experienced by lovers of the genre.\n\nAs a wonderful bonus, this game is fully voice acted, with the acting varying in quality.  However, since 80% of the characters are insane, even the most hammy and ridiculous of performances feels appropriate in context.","February 10, 2015","true","12.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When describing it, the word ''unique'' comes to mind, but definitely in a positive way.\nYou start the game being locked up in an insane asylum as Edna, who talks to her 'quite evil' imaginary bunny Harvey all day.. (yet doesn't seem to get why she is locked up).  And your goal is simple: to escape!\n\nThe characters in the game are really weird, which makes the game and your interaction with them much more interesting. I recommend talking to them as much as you can, the dialogue options are hilarious and you completely get why they are in an insane asylum. And Edna is quite the loveable troublemaker, it isn't hard to picture yourself in her shoes.\n\nThe game is challenging, I had a lot of': ''I have no idea what i have to do..'' moments. Though when you know where to start, the story makes a lot more sense. Even though i really like these type of games, i actually needed a walkthrough at some point.\nWhat bothered me is that you are mostly in the same rooms, which is really obvious seeing you are stuck in one building. But yet i was hoping for more and got bored when you have to keep taking the same path through the same rooms over and over during most of the game.\nAbout the story,  it has a lot of dark humour, which i happen to love. And it has a rather big twist at the end, which you will either love or hate. To be honest, i just didn't know what to do with it..\n\nIn short: Edna and Harvey the Breakout is a challenging game which is a lot of fun if you can appreciate the humour in it, it is really unique and kept me interested from beginning to end. I strongly recommend it!\n\n","May 9, 2015","true","10.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The easter eggs strewn throughout (like Captain Useless) are hidden just enough without diminishing returns. Another point worth praising is the voice acting; Edna in particular is fantastic with some of the best emotional voice acting I've ever heard.\n\nAs you might see from screenshots, the art is clearly home-drawn (they even make very self-referential humour about it in one scene), but as this was the studio's first game I feel this can be forgiven. Considering the artwork they go on to get in future games - with Deponia's art still being my favourite of any game, period - this is a solid first step.\n\nOne of the downsides of this game is the bugs. It is new to Steam (at time of writing) and there were two points when I had to change the language to German in order to progress; once with a menu puzzle and the other for the credits to roll. These events, though pretty bad that they exist at all, are brief and few.\n\nI cannot talk about the story without giving spoilers, but I will say that it isn't as good as Deponia's. While I could replay Deponia tomorrow and enjoy it as much as the first time, I am unlikely to replay E&H: The Breakout for a very long time. The story isn't bad, as such...it's just not as good. The puzzles are much more obtuse and navigating the world is slow and arduous. Deponia's double-tap to warp mechanic overcomes this second issue.\nI do have the sequel (which is also pre-Deponia), so I look forward to playing that. Just not the "I need to get play the sequel right now" way I did with Deponia.\n\nOverall, it's a brilliant adventure game with fantastic dark humour and a compelling, well-voiced protagonist.

Even when (not if but when) one has to do it at a certain point due to a game-breaking bug in the English version, I heavily recommend opening the web page in a browser... and then going to windowed mode and dragging the window to the right so that you do not see the scrolling bar. Knowing at which point you are in the game is a major spoiler and should be avoided at all costs. A little tip for you, fellows. Let the insanity fully embrace you.\nThe very game touches your heart in many ways through forcing you to make the decisions you normally tend to avoid. However, this psychological burden is remedied by hundreds of possible jokes whenever you try to combine (or freaking talk to!) different items of inventory. The developer has truly thought of everything. Very few games have such meticulous attention to detail. This game seems less polished in terms of look than the sequel, but the sequel feels... just like a sequel. This game might look sloppier but feels more affectionate.\nP.S. The final chapter had such a lasting impression on me so much that I wrote a polyphonic musical piece for a choir describing the events in a paraphrased way but later scrapped the lyrics and left it a standalone choral piece.","January 6","true","10.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is not even close to Harvey's new eyes.\n\nTo make a long story short, I think there are only a few things that makes me go thumb down instead of up: Graphically it looks much cheaper than the other game, which is weird because it came out AFTER the first game. It doesn't even have any way of changing the resolution. Keep in mind that this is not something I would give thumb down for. I often play old games, and it's never really a problem as long as I have fun....\n\nAnd fun is the next problem. I like to complete games without a walkthrough, and sometimes it can be really timeconsuming, and requires a lot of patient. This game seems to be really confusing sometimes and very messy. I have played without walkthrough all the way, and it seems like I have unlocked most of the areas in the game at this point.

It has been so far for me, but I'll give it a few more tries before using a walkthrough. And well that's one thing about this game. Search and you will find.

I like the story a lot and the characters are unique, but many of the puzzles need explaining. When playing this game, it's almost required that you have a walkthrough close by. You need to do certain combinations of actions in specific orders for some of the puzzles, and they're not always things that seem like the logical solution.\n\nOne example is near the beginning when you've broken out of the cell and you're trying to evade the guard, there is a small column kind of furniture piece next to the door the guard is behind. You think you just need to push the column in front of it to buy you some time to run away right? Nope, just the column in front of the door isn't enough. You gotta search your inventory and choose specific objects to construct a contraption with the column that also immobilizes the door knob. You also have to do all this before the guard opens the door and catches you, which gives you very little time. Without a walkthrough, you could play this puzzle for hours, getting caught and restarting, to try to find this by trial and error. So sometimes the puzzles detract from the game.\n\nHowever, with today's technology and the ability to look up walktrhoughs, we have the means to move along. Now if it were a different game, I would probably take the constant use of a guide as a reason to forget the game and never look at it again. But the story is so interesting that I care more about what will happen next in the story than the puzzles. The voice acting is also something that adds interest to the game. I don't want to say the voice acting is good, though some of it is. But some character's voices are bad enough to be funny (like the voice of the aforementioned guard) and the conversations themselves are clever and humorous. This game has an irresistable charm and if the puzzles were more logical or if the game gave some sort of hint or guidance for the really odd ones, this game would be perfect.\n\nSo do I recommend this game? I don't really know. I'm just going to leave my review positive because I still like this game despite its flaws. I bought the game on sale, so I'd recommend if you do get the game, you should wait until it's on sale as well.","November 4, 2015","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Graphics-wise, there's not much to expect. This game was a college project after all. And the art style goes along really well with the humor and theme of the game.\n\nSound, nothing remarkable. For me, at least. The music from Deponia series still gets the trophies.\n\nGameplay, here's there's something wrong, for me, again, at least. There's so much to do. I mean, you really have a lot of options and if you're not willing to see a walkthrough and you played a lot of point and click games, it's only natural that you'd think that each and any of the options could lead or link you to a solution. You can look, talk, pick up and use items. You can do that to so much sprites in the game and to each of the items in your inventory.\n\nIf you're in for funny lines, this may be good for you 'cause even if you don't get anything from talking to a trophy or a water cup, you may laugh, if you're really into it. But it gets kinda tiring.\n\nStill a great game. And really worth the price when on sale.\n\nAnd darn, the story. Never expected it to give me the feels.\n\nThere goes my random, quick and lazy review.","January 25","true","11.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even when (not if but when) one has to do it at a certain point due to a game-breaking bug in the English version, I heavily recommend opening the web page in a browser... and then going to windowed mode and dragging the window to the right so that you do not see the scrolling bar. Knowing at which point you are in the game is a major spoiler and should be avoided at all costs. A little tip for you, fellows. Let the insanity fully embrace you.\nThe very game touches your heart in many ways through forcing you to make the decisions you normally tend to avoid. However, this psychological burden is remedied by hundreds of possible jokes whenever you try to combine (or freaking talk to!) different items of inventory. The developer has truly thought of everything. Very few games have such meticulous attention to detail. This game seems less polished in terms of look than the sequel, but the sequel feels... just like a sequel. This game might look sloppier but feels more affectionate.\nP.S. The final chapter had such a lasting impression on me so much that I wrote a polyphonic musical piece for a choir describing the events in a paraphrased way but later scrapped the lyrics and left it a standalone choral piece.","January 6","true","10.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is not even close to Harvey's new eyes.\n\nTo make a long story short, I think there are only a few things that makes me go thumb down instead of up: Graphically it looks much cheaper than the other game, which is weird because it came out AFTER the first game. It doesn't even have any way of changing the resolution. Keep in mind that this is not something I would give thumb down for. I often play old games, and it's never really a problem as long as I have fun....\n\nAnd fun is the next problem. I like to complete games without a walkthrough, and sometimes it can be really timeconsuming, and requires a lot of patient. This game seems to be really confusing sometimes and very messy.
