Racing is easy, enjoyable, the maps are big and there are really only minor flaws which shouldn't break your gameplay experience.\nEnough talk, let's get to the pros and cons:\n\nPros:    A nice cartoonish art style\nA lot of game modes and areas\nMany different vehicles with different advantages and disadvantages\nRandom events occur in mid-game that encourage players to compete\nLevels are huge and even include secret areas!\nSystem requirements are low. No more problems with friends with bad computers!\nThis game also supports Linux and MacOS, which is a huge plus for some people\nFull controller support\nTrading Cards, achievements and even leaderboards!\nIt's cheap + you get an extra copy when you buy the game!\nCons:    You can fall off the map. They tried to make it fun with an achievement, but this is still not a nice bug. It's not a big deal, though.\nThe graphic menu is really hard to reach. At first, I didn't think there even are any options for graphics. Then I found that there are written instructions on how to change the resolution and quality. After you press "Play" on Steam, you have to hold the Shift button until the menu appears. It is a classic Unity graphics menu, which is fine.\nThere is only one option to upgrade the car: to the highest level. There are literally two options: normal and maximally upgraded. However, upgrading cars is not the point of the game. No biggie.\nCamera angles can sometimes be a bit funny as you can't control your point of view with your mouse. But only happens when you are making sudden 180° turns.\nThe final verdict:The point of this game is not to be mentally fulfilled and inspired, but to have fun. And this is really well done. The only thing I missed is easy access to the graphic menu, but you really only need to do that once. Once I have set things up properly, there were no game-breaking bugs or anything illogical happening. I can see myself playing this for a lot of hours. The community is active right now and I hope it doesn't start to lose players.\n\nGreetings,\nBirdCute\n\nNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes.

I have had fun for the short time I've put in today. I don't think I'd sit around playing it for hours on end, but I'll definitely load it up when I just want to race around hitting jumps, collecting coins, and playing tag with people online.\n\nConsidering the low asking price for this game, I think this is worth checking out if you are looking for a fun diversion for a few minutes of racing here and there. The free gift copy included with every purchase is a brilliant strategy, and will hopefully pay off by keeping the seamlessly automated online matches happening for a long time to come.","May 28, 2015","true","3.2"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","21","24","2","0"

Basically drive around, go through rings and do stunts, and every once in a while a challenge happens where you can earn money to buy more cars. However, the twist is that everything is online and you are competing with other players in the open world. It is very addicting. My only complaint is that the controls with a controller could be better (such as being able to use buttons/triggers to accelerate instead of the control pad/stick), but I wouldn't be surprised if that is patched soon. Overall, an excellent buy for 5 bucks (the current non-sale price).","May 28, 2015","true","2.8"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","17","21","2","0"

A MP game like this could benefit so much from this, would make it's stay a lot more welcome, something I'd come back to if it had this.\n• There are a few glitches - getting stuck in certain places, points sometimes mess-up in the tag matches, and sometimes you lose connection to the server (that last one doesn't affect your progress, so don't freak out) - but I was able to overlook this as didn't have high expectations of a game that's only like $5\n\nI really enjoyed this game, and if things like chat/interaction with players was added, more levels, and some of the glitches were fixed (points-glitch in particular), this would be something I'd see people stick around to play longer. Recommended game - 2-pack for $5 is a no-brainer - dive in with a mate, and get playing!","November 22, 2015","true","15.1"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

There are 4 places, and 1 tank battle place. Oh, and to unlock tank mode I belive you need to beat the first map, just collect the rings, win a few events, and thats about all to unlock tank mode! This game always makes me come back for more!\nA hint\nIf you can't reach a ring try again using boost a second before you hit the ramp. Also a maxed out car might be needed, just use your boost and drift to upgrade your car faster!\nThe bad (Not much at all) -0.5 points\nOnly down side you can't directly join a friend with "join game" You need to be in the right map their in, and spell their in-game name in, no *Friends list* as of right now.\nMy rating\n9.5/10 Highly recomend!","August 27, 2015","true","13.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

How many other games do you know of that let you do backflips in a schoolbus?\n\nIt may look and feel like a mobile game, but don't be fooled. There's plenty of content here to keep you occupied for hours. There's around 30 different vehicles, all of which fit within three different classes and can be maxed out in terms of stats (speed, handling, boost, etc). The core game itself spans across four very different and unique levels, all of which are played online with others in lobbies supporting up to 10 players (roughly) each. The gameplay consists of freeroam mixed with about four or five quick events that are constantly playing on rotation during gameplay that anybody else in the same lobby / map  can participate in. Each event is unique in its own way, and are a complete blast to play.\n\nOh yeah. There's also a bonus unlockable tank battle gamemode which by itself is almost a completely different game that is quite honestly insanely addictive and fun. I really don't think I've ever had so much fun with a mobile port before.\n\nI almost feel bad for having purchased this on sale!","June 15, 2015","true","12.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Everything about this game is very shallow.\n\nThere are 4 worlds(maps), but they aren't very big at all, they are actually rather small and the first world(Canyon) is actually rather tiny.\nThere are 30 cars, but they are all pretty much the same with next to NO diffrence in stats (There are no stats, all of the cars control the same except the later cars are sligtly faster then the beggining cars).\nThe only car stats is that the cars are devided in three categories: Light, Medium, Heavy. The problem is that they all control the same with the only difference being that the Light cars are a slightly faster, the Heavy cars are a slightly better at stunting and the Medium ones are somewhere in the middle(aleast from what i have seen, this is never explained in-game).\nThe mechanics are shallow. You can only do backflips, frontflips and move the car left or right doing 180, 360, 720 and 1080 turns midair(sorry, i don't know whats the real name of that trick if it even has one). The cars fly around on even the slightest bump and that can get annoying.\nThere are 6 minigames(events) that happen randomly in the game but most are very shallow. Here is why:\n\n1. Find the ring event: There are always a few rings in every world, and when this event starts one of those rings turns blue and you have to get to it first in order to win.\nThe problem is that the player who is closest to the ring will probably win (unless the closest player makes some stupid mistake) so its completly luck based.\n\n2. Racing event: All you have to do is go thru all of the checkpoints to win.\nThe problem is that ALL of these races take place on the flat terrain on the maps instead of useing any of the many props in the worlds so they are rather boring.\nBut the BIGGEST problem is that ALL of these races are very short, they last around 30 to 40 seconds. That happens because, again, the worlds are rather small.\n\n3. Tag event: You have to stunt on as many of the props(and thus ''tag'' them) and you have to have the most props tagged before time runs out in order to win.\nThis event isn't actually all that bad. It makes sense that such an event exists since this game has alot of focus on stunting.\nThe only problem is that 2/4 worlds have specific places that you kinda have to go to in order to win cause they are filled with props.\n\n4. Stunt event: Get the most amount of points by stunting before time ends.\nThis isn't HORRIBLE, but its shallow because you can easily win most of the matches by just doing the same stunt over and over again.\n\n5. King of the crown: A random player gets the crown and has to keep it for 60 seconds to win, and the other players can win by hitting the player with the crown so they can take it.\nIt sounds good on paper but because of the mechanics and the fact that on even the slightest bump your car flyes around, it can be a pain sometimes to hit the guy with the crown, and 50% of the time the guy who randomly gets the crown at the start is the one who wins.\n\n6. Coin collect event: Collect the most amount of coins before the time ends to win.\nThis one is completly fine, no real problems with it.\n\nThere are some bugs, most aren't all that annoying except the bug where you clip thru a prop and usually you are stuck there then you have to re-enter the world, thus you lose the event.\n\nThere is usually more then enough players in the game playing so don't ever enter an empty server(but sometimes when you are not playing at peak hours there won't be more then 6 players on any server).\n\nThere is no way to comunicate with other players.\n\nThe graphics are mobile tier(thats because this is a port of the mobile version of the game), but thats not important. What IS important is the sound, and the sounds are OK, but the music gets repetitive.\n\nThere is also a seprate Tank Battle mode, but its nohing special.\nYou start with the regular tank, you can buy 4 diffrent tank that all have diffrent stats(Yes, the tanks have actual stats).\nYou have around 5 VERY tiny areas that are in the sky, and the way you win is by shooting another player so that he flys out of the area and then that gets counted as a kill (yes, you just push them, they don't actually explode).\nAs you may see, the Tank Battle mode isn't all that great and there are other games (and mods for other games) that do a better job, but its not bad. Its OK.\n\nBut do you want to know the BIGGEST problem with the game? The game can be played for FREE on Android/Iphone AND it can be played for free on the web browser! So this game, even with the free copy, isn't worth 1 euro, let alone 5 ♥♥♥♥ING EUROS.","January 27","false","15.2"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","4"

I'm not really concerned with leveling or money, i like to spend my time smashing into the other players that are trying to make that money, smashing into them while they race, or do stunts. It's to easy, they need a challenge, lol. This game is so much fun !\nThere are tons of cars, and i like the leveling system, it's fast to level up your cars once purchased, but getting the money to purchase the cars can get a bit boring after while with only 4 worlds and each having the same thing...stunt mode, crown, tag, etc. But the maps are fairly large and easily playable by many other players at the same time. I also don't get road rage in this one because you don't die, or have to repair your car, you just take a hit, bounce around a bit, honk your horn and chase the person down, lol. For a driving game it's a real pleasure to play.\nYou can really make some good money in the game to purchase more cars if you enter all the events and do well, and the more cars you buy the faster you level up and unlock more cars, once the cars are unlocked you just need to earn the cash to buy them.\n\nThe only downside to the game is there are only 4 worlds, plus the battle tank level...now there's some fun too. And the repeating events tends to get boring after while, but that's when i just relax and smash the other players, or chase them with the police car, lol.\n\nJust buy the game, it's cheap, and you get a free copy to give a friend...awesome !","January 13","true","29.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Sometimes I just pick a random one, run it, and expect nothing. Optimism was never my strong suit after all. So, I run Crash Drive 2. Expecting the worst.\n\nI entered the menu of the game, exhaled with irritation. Everything looked unpolished to the point that I felt like pressing quit instantly.\n\nI am glad and lucky I did not. You see, yeah there are all kinds of problems here, interface wise. But, buuuuut, and that is a big but (I like that point in every review I write. I like it, and I cannot lie). The core gameplay mechanics are pure bliss, fun, or any other similar word you could put there to simulate a happy warm fuzzy feeling in your gut.\n\nThere is the stage, open not linear, and the players with their cars in it. Driving around, roaming freely. Then the events start to come, one after the other. King, with a crown and all, every other car chasing you to get it from you. The winner will be the one left wearing it proudly on his/her hood.\n\nStunt contest? Sure, there is that as well. Racing? Yeap, this is a random event that just may happen. Also it is the one event you can opt out for the round, if you wish.\n\nPlay play play this game, if you love fun racing titles. Do not let the sloppy interface put you off. The heart of Crash Drive 2 is golden.\n\nOne last thing. The in game invite friend system does not seem to work. You have to invite your friends via steam, in order to play with them. In fact the best way is to start a game and then the rest of the group join that game you created, via Steam not inside the Crash Drive 2 menu. Cumbersome? Yeap. Sloppy? Sure sure. But if you have friends who own the game you have to play it with them. If you do not have friends who own the game gift it to them. If you don't have friends, go make some.

Some company I've never heard of before presents: Tomy Hicks: Pro DUI 2\n\nHOLD SHIFT WHEN LAUNCHING THE GAME FOR VIDEO SETTINGS\n\nNow that I've finally managed to 100% the game I might as well write a review.\nThis is a game with one goal: fun.\nThere are some competitive moments when it comes to events but it's not even frustrating when people pull a fast one on you. This game is like the classic Tony Hawk games but with cars, and it's great. At first, 4 maps doesn't sounds like a lot, but once you get into it. It's more than enough. There's also a seperate mode called Tank Battle or something where you try to shoot eachother off the map and rank up, also fun.\nThere are of course a few cons and things that could be improved upon such as no way to talk to other players besides crashing into them multiple times or honking your horn. (which the game is multi-platform so I don't even know if they could implement that) REGARDLESS, there's almost no need to speak to other players because nothing is more satisfying than stealing a cash crate right before they get it.\n\nI'd give this game a 9/10 literally. I don't see many games now-a-days that are 100% fun.\nMy advice: buy this game. It's a steal at $5 and you even get a free copy for a friend so that's incredibly nice.\n\n-----------------\nSuggestion for devs: Try adding minimaps you can toggle. When I was first learning the maps I kept getting disoriented with all the hills.","July 1, 2015","true","16.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

Look no further!\n\nProsThe big one for me: It feels like they bothered playtesting the physics and levels enough to keep it fun.Other bargain-bin driving games often fall apart on me gameplay-wise due to a lack thereof.\nSimplistic to the point of fun. If you completed the Skyfall tutorial in Blast Corps, you already know how this game handles. The goals differ, though.\nI find the clunkiness charming.\nIf you're indecisive, the automatic random events that make up the core of this game will take care of that.\nCons Reeks of a mobile game designed with P2W in mind. This is toned down enough (at least for now) that fighting the urge to automax will avoid the problems this presents\nIt's been said by other reviewers, but you have to hold down shift during game launch to get to any meaningful options screen.\nSome events have luck as a large factor.\nGlitches are mostly minor (eg. getting stuck in walls for a few seconds), but some are major. Got stuck on a server with an integer-overflow delay until the next event.\nMisc If you use the "dollar per hour of fun" metric, this game is worth it (or at least half, but you get an extra copy.)\nYou can fall off the edge.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!\n\nIt's the first driving game I've found that has a nice feel to the vehicle handling for keyboard input (I have no controller, keyboard only :)\n\nI'm a big (HUGE!) fan of the old classic arcade sit-down driver RUSH The Rock - Alcatraz edition and this game sucked me in just like they did back then. - Nice job Devs! -\n\nNow, lets nit-pick a little...\n\nThe red banner that appears for events should be semi-transparent, it blocks too much of your view. This wouldn't be bad but since game play continues as the banner is displayed it is disruptive of game play. The text should be solid and the banner transparent.\n\nNot sure how the 'points' are added up for when you can or can't 'steal' a tagged item, but it seems unfair at times.\n\nNeeds some more things to buy or spend your $ on after you've maxed all your vehicles, I have nothing to do with my $10M - Some vehicle skins to buy, Extra Boost time or faster Boost regeneration, I'm sure there's lots more that could be done to use up some $.\n\nSome events glitch once in a while, but perfectly acceptable if they don't cause the game to stop events all together, which does happen once in a blue moon. As I said though it's not a big problem, simply exit and rejoin hopefully getting into a new group of players.\n\n'King of the Crown' events, YES! Love it! There are times when another driver doesn't even get close to you (or it appears) but they still get the crown from you. Not a biggie here either, just go get it back! :) Other times you can hear another vehicle hit you but they don't get the Crown, so I guess it's a fair trade.\n\nCash Boxes land in some very hard to get at places sometimes and I'm sure in a few places that are impossible to get at, but it's fun trying to get them!\n\nSo, overall I'd have to give it a 10/10, If a driving game can capture the heart of an old RTR fan you know it's gotta be good!","June 1","true","164.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

But is it worth your time?  Let's find out in this review on Crash Drive 2.\n\nCrash Drive 2 is a pretty simple game.  You pick your car, get out on a multiplayer course with other drivers, and complete objective based events.  The different events include setting a high score, tagging various objects, and being the first to reach a certain ring.  The game is pure mayhem and silly fun as you bump into other players and there's no consequence.  Cars take no damage and most of the time you will land on your wheels.  Even if you don't land upright, chances are you'll easily flip over.  There are five different levels and you must complete a few tasks in order to advance.  You'll have to set a high score, drive through all of the rings one time, and complete a number of events to unlock the next level.\n\nSo multiplayer is crucial and it's the point of the game.  Whenever you join a level you're instantly matchmade with other players so you never know who you'll end up with.  Am I really playing with PewDiePie? Probably not, but that's funny.\n\nThere's also a ton of different cars to unlock.  There's lightweight and fast sports cars, then there are big monster trucks and fire trucks.  The trucks are fun for crashing into your opponents, but the sports cars will let you get tons of air.  Oh Yeah!\n\nThere's also a crazy tank battle mode that you get to unlock later.  The tanks can shoot and you can blow your opponents away.  Tank battle mode is probably the craziest because you are on a floating platform and you get points by knocking other people off.  It's total mayhem. Tank battle mode is like a different game, but it's also fun to play.\n\nThe graphics are probably the weakest part of the game.  Since it's a mobile port, it doesn't take advantage of PC power and there are no advanced graphics settings.  Some of the texture are pretty bad, especially in the first level.  The barriers that surround the level are just like warped end points.  They could have done a better job with this.  The plus side is that it does run very well, I maxed out at 144 frames per second and didn't really experience any lag.\n\nThere were also a few bugs, I got stuck on a tree once or twice but I was able to reset my position by hitting start even though the game doesn't indicate this.  I also had some disconnects during multiplayer sessions.\n\nCrash Drive 2 is only $5 on Steam so it may be fun to mess around and drive like a maniac for a bit.  If you like silly games and want to relax from a grueling shooter session, Crash Drive 2 can be a fun distraction.

I think he must have been looking at an early copy of this game.\n\nI had no idea what to expect when I threw this in my cart just to raise my order level a couple of bucks. I love racing games; and the description sounded good. The idea of it being multi-player with random events almost turned me off; mostly because I think online multi-player does nothing but bring up the worst possible players in games...not to mention I wasn't worried about doing anything but driving cars.\n\nWell, let me just say my mind was changed as soon as I started playing the game. The levels are in fact open, just not quite as large as you might be made to think. Still, there are tons of physics and gravity defying stuff you can do. Sure, events pop up randomly and you're automatically put in competition...but you're not forced to actually do anything. You can keep driving around doing your own thing, completely ignoring the fact there's an event going on. But the events are somewhat fun and sometimes trying to complete and win those involves a lot of driving around. You aren't forced to join actual races though; just events that continue to work in sandbox mode.\n\nThere are a lot of various cars, and you do have to level them up. You have the option of buying a max level; but I wouldn't do it. Leveling the cars up to max doesn't take very long; I was able to level several cars to max in less than the 3 hours I first played; for the most part driving the car around will help you boost it's four areas. Drifting maxes your handling ability, using nitro obviously boosts your nitro ability, actual acceleration increases your acceleration rating, and driving at top speed maxes out your top-speed rating. Just driving around doing drifts for 20 or 30 minutes in a car will get it's level quite high. Save your money for buying cars as you unlock them.\n\nI still can't get over how addictively fun this game is. The controls of the car are quite simple...and in a way remind me of a lot of the other simple racers. You don't have 4000 controls you need to memorize to drive the thing, just a few basic commands and a lot of fun arcade-type handling. There seems to be plenty of stuff to do; although if the events aren't your deal...the levels may get boring after a while.\n\nStill, for even the non-sale price; it's worth picking up a copy.\n\nI love it.  I just bought Stranded Deep and thought I was going to be playing that for the next 6 months; but this one might give it a run for it's money.\n\nYou should be warned though; you appear to be playing with users of the mobile version as well; which has several hacks and cheats available for it; so I highly suspect some users aren't playing honestly.","June 2, 2015","true","22.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

When I got this game, I didn't really know what to expect; all I know is that it came with a free copy which I immediately unloaded onto my friend who told me "This game is lame" and so I shrugged and said to myself the next day "how lame can it be?" . ..\nNOT AT ALL :O\nIdk why but this game is like the funnest thing ever, you can race people IN A TANK! All the cars are kick ♥♥♥ and fun to drive/play as and the maps are fun and littered with nice little challenges and whatnot here and there. Did I mention almost everything is a ramp?! You can launch yourself like DAM SON WHERE'D YOU FIND THESE?! off of everything and do flips and ♥♥♥♥. There are also 6 different public events that happen all the time through out the map and you can either participate or just keep zippin and zoomin about, it's up to you~!\nGood:\n+Good time killer.\n+Great mood booster.\n+Fun alone or with friends, it doesn't matter.\n+Kick ♥♥♥ Vroom vroom noises\n+relaxing\n+Controller support\n+Price! When it goes on sale, BOY DOES IT GO ON SALE so keep an eye out and get it while it's hot so you can drop it like it is!!\nBad:\n-Graphics(?) they could be better, but this is also a phone game TAKE IT ON THE GO GO AND VROOM VROOM 24/7! so graphics I couldn't care less about\n-Failure is an option, no one likes loosing and so sometimes when the goal is THERE but you're NOT THERE it kinda sucks, but then go vroom elsewhere and have a fun time bruh, so really there aren't negatives about this game so get it. like. it's fun.

Its a multiplayer throwback to the stunt half of "Hot Wheels Velocity X" What prevents it from getting onto that level of greatness revolves around the disspointing Tank mini-game, offline options, broken "join friend" system and a couple of missing features that every multiplayer game should be having. Its really depressing because I had fun with the general gameplay of Crash Drive 2, but that's because its Hot Wheels Velocity X without the guns and variety of modes...still a pretty good game for just $3.99, but will you enjoy it as much as I have with the previously listed issues?

But because of certain attributes about this game, I just cannot recommend this. The game starts off with you getting your first car. There are four different worlds, and a tank battle arena that is separate. The object is to level up and get better cars and unlock new worlds. Now mind you, these "worlds" are just moderately sized maps. You have to do stunts through all the rings and win a certain number of events before the next world is unlocked. This game is completely open world, even while there is an event going on. So participating in any of these events is completely optional. But as you level up, you'll notice that none of the later vehicles are really faster than the previous ones, sometimes actually being worse. The handling mechanics are also slightly sketchy, but that is not really a problem. The graphics are a bit outdated, making things like grass and water look bad. I believe the game is on the unity engine, and it shows when you fall out of the level or your suspension pokes through your tire. This game is also normally $5, overpriced given that this game is completely free on mobile devices.\n\nPros:\n-open world\n-ok multiplayer\n-good leveling system\n-good game layout and concept\n-good controls, can be customized\n\nCons:\n-bad textures\n-weird vehicles forms like the tires floating underneath your car\n-free on mobile\n-none of the vehicles are different from each other\n-no vehicle customization\n-slightly weird driving mechanics, no big deal","December 25, 2015","false","18.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You've seen pretty much all the game has to offer after 30 mins or so of playing. While the question of whether or not this game is worth your time is totally subjective, I would recommend you not buy it even with the "Buy 1 get 1 free" deal going on atm. Why? Because this game is FREE on Apple and Android and you can play it for free through your browser as long as you have the Unity plugin installed (also free). You think you're getting a deal, but in reality, you aren't. If you have a younger kid who likes racing games, direct him to a website he can play this on. If you're looking for some indepth racing experience or good arcade racing fun, there are better options ON STEAM.

First and foremost - definitely not PC/Laptop friendly. Perhaps the devs could have played a couple of (PC) driving games before they invented their own unique control scheme - which doesn't match any driving game I've seen.  Failing that, perhaps they could have arranged for control settings to be SAVED FOR THE NEXT SESSION. It's annoying enough to have to reconfigure the controls, worse when you have to do it every time you want to play. Makes me really not want to.\nWould also be nice if there was a 'look around' functionality not tied to your steering.

And I really want to thumbs up it but it has so many fun modes but they are all killed by the bland stunt system.  All you seem to be able to do when coming off a ramp is spin in a circle. Forget corkscrewing stuff like that it does not happen and for some reason unless its a physical object impact that causes you to do so you cannot even front flip. Its almost like the stunt names exist but the method of execution is not.\n\nWhats more is even the race falls into blandness. On the first map does not even use at all the awesome ramps it avoids every single bit of prop there is and makes you drive essentially in a dirt flat circle. Devs why not use that giant ramp or even some of those loopy loops as checkpoints? You must have worked hard to design that stuff and yet its wasted.","June 22, 2015","false","1.3"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","30","3","10","0","0"

why why put a very strong car in the begging in the game that can ruin alllot of expernis for new players alhtou you need other cars to get level ups and get new cars in the shop it still hard to get a race win while some one is in a shady car moving on to the shady cars you have a tank a jeep an awsome black mans doge car and a snow car or what ever its called i dont know and they are very very strong and good but you have a choice of 26 cars why not play the others atleast you have to race the shady car dealer to get the car its hard but it can be very easy when you max your car\n\nwhen it comes to getting money thares 4 ways 1getting some boxes that come from the sky  2doing the events and even if you dont win if you did something youl still get money 3playing the tanks mode witch ill explain latter and 4 DOING TRICKS doing stunts can be the easy way you can do a small stunt by an acsadintly curve or drift for sake DRIFT its like a way of saying hey you bored of 30 secconds waiting for nearly nothing  welp do some stunts and get dat money\n\nthe tank battle  witch you need the tank that you get from the shady car dealer at the desert the thing is the tank can shoot but not horn its funny to lunch a car flying but when you get the tank you can play tank battle witch you are a tank... and fight other tanks... its onther way to enjoy the game and you have more tanks that you cant play in the.. normale game? why may i ask what ever you have the normale tank the small tank the fast fire small tank the heavy tank and the smasher tank  the smasher tank the fast fire small tank and the smasher tank are my favroit smasher tank can well bash the other tank by speeding to them the small fire tank can shoot like a mechine gun and the heavy tank sends the other tank flying and its the only time you can change the color of your car i gues its cuse well.. ammm... ahh i dont know why but i dont mind soo yeah a onther game in the game\n\nwell i dont know what to say more then the game is good i rate it 8.5%10","June 30, 2015","true","27.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has very smooth controls and is easy for even young kids to be competitive due to the ability to manuever vehicle in air (which also allows for tricks which is a fun part of the game).\nThe graphics and models all fit the theme and even though they and the particle effects are store bought "packs" you don't mind because the maps are well crafted and the vehicles are very pleasing to look at.\nEach vehicle handles differently and each is fun to play but none seem to be over powered and even the lower vehicles easily compete with the higher level.\n\nUnlike most racing theme games where the lobby sits empty due to poor multiplayer session design; Crash Drive 2 allows players to drive around in a open world map levelling, gaing cash, and stunt driving until the racing, collecting, stunting, etc matches begin. This keep players in the servers between "matches" and helps with the empty sever problem of other games. You can also join servers where your friends are at using the box on the Play screen!\n\nDon't be put off about the poor reviews of input controls, the game uses the arrow keys for driving and ctl and space for nitros and brake.. drop the mouse (it does nothing in game) and use your right hand on the arrow keys and left for nitros/brake.. it is very intuitive and feels quite natural and arcade like.\n\nThe cash gathering, vehicle levelling, player levelling, and map levelling all make for a good balance of stuff to do that keeps you occupied between events and the progression seems about right imho.\n\nThere is no chat so you can safely let your kids play without worry about filters, you will also have a more pleasant time not getting into trash talking matches (which could also be a con...)\n\nNow for the CONS:\nCheating happens in this type of game. In about 1 out of 5 play sessions you will run into a cheater who uses some hack to beat an event. In the Capture the Crown event there is a hack that allows the crown wearer to instantly end the event and win or using map glitches to hide under ground. In the Stunt Point event and Stunt Tag event several map hacks allow for assinine scores at times. I have never been affected by cheating in the racing events, Ring Grab,  or Coin collection events that I noticed. However, except in the case of the hacks that prematurely end the event you can usually  get a coin earning place since there is usually only one player cheating and sometimes their hack kicks them and you get first if you didn't give up. The free flowing point/cash earning design of the game keeps these POS hackers from ruining the game but they are aggravating and need to be addressed. You can also simply quit and rejoin and get a new server away from the hacker. But like most hackers.. most of them bore easily and few stay long.\n\nThere are some menu problems, you have to QUIT the garage to change maps/servers join friends server... this feels very counter intuitive to pretty much all other racing games where you go to the map FROM the garage!\n\nYour mouse cursor will occassionally disappear for no reason in menus and you will have to swing mouse around till you get lucky and get over button... sometimes you can hit escape to back to prior menu where cursor exists.\n\n\nFinal thought: Buy it, get your free gift game, and get playing!\n","August 16, 2015","true","21.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Combine this with the fact that purchase includes a giftable copy of the game to give to a friend, and multiplayer capability spans platforms, and CD2 is one of the better deals on Steam right now - if you're a fan of casual, fast-paced, online racing pick this title up.\n\nRead the full review of this title and more at Budget Gaming Review!\nhttp://budgetgaming.blogspot.ca/2015/06/crash-drive-2.html","June 26, 2015","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

why why put a very strong car in the begging in the game that can ruin alllot of expernis for new players alhtou you need other cars to get level ups and get new cars in the shop it still hard to get a race win while some one is in a shady car moving on to the shady cars you have a tank a jeep an awsome black mans doge car and a snow car or what ever its called i dont know and they are very very strong and good but you have a choice of 26 cars why not play the others atleast you have to race the shady car dealer to get the car its hard but it can be very easy when you max your car\n\nwhen it comes to getting money thares 4 ways 1getting some boxes that come from the sky  2doing the events and even if you dont win if you did something youl still get money 3playing the tanks mode witch ill explain latter and 4 DOING TRICKS doing stunts can be the easy way you can do a small stunt by an acsadintly curve or drift for sake DRIFT its like a way of saying hey you bored of 30 secconds waiting for nearly nothing  welp do some stunts and get dat money\n\nthe tank battle  witch you need the tank that you get from the shady car dealer at the desert the thing is the tank can shoot but not horn its funny to lunch a car flying but when you get the tank you can play tank battle witch you are a tank... and fight other tanks... its onther way to enjoy the game and you have more tanks that you cant play in the.. normale game? why may i ask what ever you have the normale tank the small tank the fast fire small tank the heavy tank and the smasher tank  the smasher tank the fast fire small tank and the smasher tank are my favroit smasher tank can well bash the other tank by speeding to them the small fire tank can shoot like a mechine gun and the heavy tank sends the other tank flying and its the only time you can change the color of your car i gues its cuse well.. ammm... ahh i dont know why but i dont mind soo yeah a onther game in the game\n\nwell i dont know what to say more then the game is good i rate it 8.5%10","June 30, 2015","true","27.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yes, but before you say "Lyra, this has nothing to do with a review of such a game!!!", yes it does. And why you ask?\n\nThis PC port of this Massively Multiplayer Online racing game is another good example of a game that's much better on PC than on mobile.\n\nSuuuuuuuuuure, the mobile game is free, and I played it myself too. Just because its free doesnt mean it's a mobile game with good framerate and easy to play on the touch screen. And it does not mean there's no ads.\n\nY'see, this PC version is extrememly fast and much easier to play. And its very compatible too. I recently played this game on a very old 2006 Windows XP computer. Here's the specs: 1GB Ram, (idk about the processor but its an old one I tell ya), NVIDIA GeForce 7300LE. For today's standards, this is a not-very-powerful-little-PC-thats-almost-10-years-old.   And guess what? My computer ran the game in 100% FPS. No lag or crap like that, on a computer that's almost 10 years old!!! On my phone, which is.... let me see... I know its taking me a while... just you wait... stupid phone... wait... oops wrong menu,,, dang it... here... "About Phone"... hmmm.... 2011. Thats right. I tried the game on my 2011 Phone, and there was lots of lag. Very annoying.... but my old PC which is less powerful than my phone, can run it better!!! That being said, the gameplay on the PC will be much more enjoyable.\n\nAnd when I mean "much more enjoyable", that's saying a lot, so listen! First, there's that great frame rate, I dont think I need to talk more about it. Then, there's the graphics; they're obviously better, and obvously this has nothing to do with how much you enjoy the gameplay. But seriously, the game is much easier to control because its not a touch screen where you have to worry about having big, massive and giantic fingers. Y'just use the arrows keys! And it controls the cars perfectly with not any problem. If you plug a controller, the game will automatically recognize your controller and make the game playable with it. The game plays EXTREMEMLY well with a controller, and I strongly recommend you, as much as I recommend to not play the mobile game that is 7.8 too much lag, that you use a controller. There's a thing I would like to say about the controller mode though. It does play excellent, but there is a more or less big problem. It doesnt ruin the gameplay, but it makes it slightly less fun, but dont you worry, it's an issue they'll fix in no doubt: In mid-air with a controller, you can only steer your car to the left and right. I cant steer the car fowards or backwards so that I can make a flip. This issue MUST be fixed as soon as possible. If the gas button on the controller wont steer the car in mid-air (up arrow is the gas on the keyboard, and it also steers the car fowards in mid-air), then you can program it so that if I push the analog stick up and down it'll make me steer fowards and backwards in mid-air.\n\nThe in-game events are very addictive. As addictive as buying games on Steam: You dont wanna stop doing it. There is an event in which you have to collect more coins than your opponents (which are real people, remember its a MMO), another where someone has a crown and you must steal it from the current person who has it, and you gotta have the crown on you for 60 seconds.... there's a checkpoint-based (what? That's how we say it, no?) race game, a stunt contest in which you must do more points than your opponents by doing stunt, and a couple of more events. These event are, surprisingly, very competitive, believe it or not. This makes the game much more fun to play for long periods of time. Altough, you shoudln't play for so long without breaks.\n\nThere are LOTS of cars to unlock and to upgrade. You upgrade the car by simply playing (Not kidding!), or you pay to upgrade it at maximum. You expect me to say more? I dont have anything else to say, its just that great.\n\nThe maps are well made and very large. And you wont get bored in them, as there is lots of things to do in them. Loops, jumps, objects, rings, ramps....anything you want! I do think a level editor would be an AMAZING idea.\n\nThe sound is good, nothing much to say about it.\n\nThe physics arent very realistic. But, hey, who the heck cares for physics in a racing game like that? The physics are fun and well made, and that's what counts really. Realistic physics in this game would be a disaster, trust me.\n\nTo conclude, you shut up and you give them your money. Its that much worth it. Happy gaming!","January 1","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has very smooth controls and is easy for even young kids to be competitive due to the ability to manuever vehicle in air (which also allows for tricks which is a fun part of the game).\nThe graphics and models all fit the theme and even though they and the particle effects are store bought "packs" you don't mind because the maps are well crafted and the vehicles are very pleasing to look at.\nEach vehicle handles differently and each is fun to play but none seem to be over powered and even the lower vehicles easily compete with the higher level.\n\nUnlike most racing theme games where the lobby sits empty due to poor multiplayer session design; Crash Drive 2 allows players to drive around in a open world map levelling, gaing cash, and stunt driving until the racing, collecting, stunting, etc matches begin. This keep players in the servers between "matches" and helps with the empty sever problem of other games. You can also join servers where your friends are at using the box on the Play screen!\n\nDon't be put off about the poor reviews of input controls, the game uses the arrow keys for driving and ctl and space for nitros and brake.. drop the mouse (it does nothing in game) and use your right hand on the arrow keys and left for nitros/brake.. it is very intuitive and feels quite natural and arcade like.\n\nThe cash gathering, vehicle levelling, player levelling, and map levelling all make for a good balance of stuff to do that keeps you occupied between events and the progression seems about right imho.\n\nThere is no chat so you can safely let your kids play without worry about filters, you will also have a more pleasant time not getting into trash talking matches (which could also be a con...)\n\nNow for the CONS:\nCheating happens in this type of game. In about 1 out of 5 play sessions you will run into a cheater who uses some hack to beat an event. In the Capture the Crown event there is a hack that allows the crown wearer to instantly end the event and win or using map glitches to hide under ground. In the Stunt Point event and Stunt Tag event several map hacks allow for assinine scores at times. I have never been affected by cheating in the racing events, Ring Grab,  or Coin collection events that I noticed. However, except in the case of the hacks that prematurely end the event you can usually  get a coin earning place since there is usually only one player cheating and sometimes their hack kicks them and you get first if you didn't give up. The free flowing point/cash earning design of the game keeps these POS hackers from ruining the game but they are aggravating and need to be addressed. You can also simply quit and rejoin and get a new server away from the hacker. But like most hackers.. most of them bore easily and few stay long.\n\nThere are some menu problems, you have to QUIT the garage to change maps/servers join friends server... this feels very counter intuitive to pretty much all other racing games where you go to the map FROM the garage!\n\nYour mouse cursor will occassionally disappear for no reason in menus and you will have to swing mouse around till you get lucky and get over button... sometimes you can hit escape to back to prior menu where cursor exists.\n\n\nFinal thought: Buy it, get your free gift game, and get playing!\n","August 16, 2015","true","21.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The points don't matter!\n\nPro's:\nEasy to jump into\nLots of fun cars\nNO text or voice chat.  This may seem like a con, but keep in mind this is a driving sim where everyone drives completely recklessly.  You don't want to hear what they are saying.

why why put a very strong car in the begging in the game that can ruin alllot of expernis for new players alhtou you need other cars to get level ups and get new cars in the shop it still hard to get a race win while some one is in a shady car moving on to the shady cars you have a tank a jeep an awsome black mans doge car and a snow car or what ever its called i dont know and they are very very strong and good but you have a choice of 26 cars why not play the others atleast you have to race the shady car dealer to get the car its hard but it can be very easy when you max your car\n\nwhen it comes to getting money thares 4 ways 1getting some boxes that come from the sky  2doing the events and even if you dont win if you did something youl still get money 3playing the tanks mode witch ill explain latter and 4 DOING TRICKS doing stunts can be the easy way you can do a small stunt by an acsadintly curve or drift for sake DRIFT its like a way of saying hey you bored of 30 secconds waiting for nearly nothing  welp do some stunts and get dat money\n\nthe tank battle  witch you need the tank that you get from the shady car dealer at the desert the thing is the tank can shoot but not horn its funny to lunch a car flying but when you get the tank you can play tank battle witch you are a tank... and fight other tanks... its onther way to enjoy the game and you have more tanks that you cant play in the.. normale game? why may i ask what ever you have the normale tank the small tank the fast fire small tank the heavy tank and the smasher tank  the smasher tank the fast fire small tank and the smasher tank are my favroit smasher tank can well bash the other tank by speeding to them the small fire tank can shoot like a mechine gun and the heavy tank sends the other tank flying and its the only time you can change the color of your car i gues its cuse well.. ammm... ahh i dont know why but i dont mind soo yeah a onther game in the game\n\nwell i dont know what to say more then the game is good i rate it 8.5%10","June 30, 2015","true","27.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The last game (crash drive 3D) was horrible, but i was happy they made a 2nd game. the 2nd game has 30 cars in total, for you to stunt, crash and shoot (yep there is a tank in this game), the game is very easy but however there needs to be more bugs to be fixed, over all it is a good game.","June 29, 2015","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Combine this with the fact that purchase includes a giftable copy of the game to give to a friend, and multiplayer capability spans platforms, and CD2 is one of the better deals on Steam right now - if you're a fan of casual, fast-paced, online racing pick this title up.\n\nRead the full review of this title and more at Budget Gaming Review!\nhttp://budgetgaming.blogspot.ca/2015/06/crash-drive-2.html","June 26, 2015","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It also comes with 2 copies so you can play with a friend.  It seems to play like Tony Hawk with cars.  Every 30 seconds, a new challenge starts which vary between racing, king of the hill, tagging, and competing for the highest score.  In the mean time, you have to drive through rings that are scattered all over the maps, and npc's that you cxan challenge to unlock their cars.  You also level up your cars as you use them, and unlock more just from playing.  The controls are a bit wonky, which just adds to the flavor, and I would recommend this game to anyone looking for a fun casual game to play.","May 30","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
