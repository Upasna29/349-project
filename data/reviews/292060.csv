After unckecking "Add desktop icon" and "start after install is finished", it installed successfully after the second attempt.\n\nFrom there I went back to my library to run the program, a prompt from Adobe Air showed up, asking if I wanted to uninstall or run, so I chose to run the program.\n\nFrom there going through the application is easy and simple - use the arrow keys or mouse to navigate, and close the window like you would any other window.\n\nObviously the people that would be interested in this would be those that would like to know more behind the history of Respawn and Titanfall, as well as getting a glimpse of some of what goes into making these kind of games. If you're into that stuff, I'd recommend it.\n\nHOWEVER, if you're running a Windows 8 computer, I'd recommend using Microsoft's Bing Rewards program to get a $3 gift card for the Windows Store, and purchase it through there without having to worry about having to wait through the install process of Adobe Air.","June 22, 2014","true","0.2"," 95 of 173 people (55%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","55","95","173","9","0"

The story not only focuses on the developers but on the reporter himself. Seen as biased by his peers after the Dorito scandal of 1996, Geoff Keighley fights to overcome his alcoholism and shed some light on the new indie darlings at Respawn Entertainment.\n\nABOUT:\nA sexual harassment scandal soon hits Respawn Entertainment/EA, and it's up to Geoff to put his journalism magic powers to the test to figure out what REALLY happened. Sex, drugs, murder, concept art...The world of video game development is a dangerous and erotic place.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nFor only $2 you can't say no to this masterpiece. Heck, you've probably spent more on joke gifts to give your friends during steam sales. Treat yourself.

Doritos Pope is surprisingly informative in the Final Hours and while an ad in the sense that it tells you that Titanfall is a thing, in the sense of being a fully supportive "rag" as some knee jerkers on the Steam forums have put it, the Final Hours doesn't really do that.
