I recommend it to gamers who love hidden object games. I run a high end system and was still able to play it will no problems except a little bit of graphic pixels at full window but no too bad.","April 15, 2015","true","3.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Story is ok.\nYou can find yourself stuck from time to time. The help doesn't help in that cases.","November 21, 2015","true","4.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The puzzles are for the most part original and quite fun!\n\nThough low resolution, the graphics are gorgeous and meticulously drawn, conjuring up a vivid fantasy world. Animations have a nice slow pace to them that keeps the game feeling alive.\n\nThe weak points are the story, which lacks any element of surprise, and the voice acting, which is itself OK but doesn't match the rest of the design at all.","May 26","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
