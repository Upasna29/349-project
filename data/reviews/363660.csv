It is a good thing because the controls are not overwhelming like DCS World and it is very forgiving if one were to make a mistake, which promotes the mellow feel to the game.\nFun arcade feel - This game is by no means a Flight Simulator, X-Plane, or DCS World, and it clearly plays like a casual game. I do enjoy the realistic flight simulation games, but it is nice to play a mellow flying game.\nRelaxing atmosphere - Do you remember Microsoft Flight? If not, it was a based in Hawaii and had a relaxing atmosphere. This game has a similar feel, in that it is more tropical and worry free.\nWalk around - You can actually get out of your plane and walk around the airfields in this game, which is a nice addition. It is not much, but it certainly alleviates the cramped feeling as if you can never leave the plane.\nA lot of missions - The game has many missions, but they all have the same premise: go to this island, pick up a product, and deliver it to this island. This game spices it up with the ability to transport legal and illegal products; for the latter, you could risk getting caught by the police or getting cheated by the seller and not getting paid.\nThe fart sound - I seriously think that the player's character walks around naked (or maybe flies naked) because when you get in and out of the plane, there is a sound of a flight suit being zipped which sounds strangely like a fart.\nWhat I Do Not LikeEasy to play - This is a good thing and a bad thing. It is a bad thing because the game feels too easy when flying. For example, you can hit the runway pretty hard and not suffer the consequences.\nBugs - In the version that I am reviewing this game for, which is likely 1.0, there are many bugs. The bugs are not very game breaking (or at least I have not come across any), but they are noticeable and could be annoying to some players.\nNo joystick ability - When I first bought this game, I immediately took out my flight joystick (Logitech Extreme 3D Pro), but I was severly disappointed to find that there is only keyboard and mouse controls. You cannot use game controllers or flight joysticks in this version. I hope they add it later.\nLack of controls Similar to the first point, this game is too easy. There are very little controls, so do not expect to have flap adjustments, air drag compensation, or anything like that. There is a landing gear button, however.\nOverall, the game is certainly fun, but it has several bugs and lacks features. (No joystick support!) You can probably squeeze a good ten hours out of this game before shelving it, so it is somewhat justifiable at $20. I do admire the team's ambition in creating this game, and I wish them the best of luck in this game and their future titles. I love the first mention in the "special thanks" ;)\n\nRating: 6.5/10","April 17, 2015","true","1.9"," 74 of 87 people (85%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","85","74","87","10","0"

I can forgive a flying game for having loose flying mechanics but this one is pretty much as arcadey as they come. In first person none of the instruments work, they are all just a static image, the game does not support joystick or controller. Keyboard and mouse controls are simple enough but the stock plane handles like a stunt plane, climbs to 29,000 feet, does not exceed 210mph even in a dive. The in game menu refers to the controls as accelerate and "breaks," mind you not even brakes. There are some pretty graphics, but the runways are all short, the islands hardly habitable.  I have not seen this game dip low enough in price to even be worth it on sale.","January 4","false","0.4"," 19 of 19 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","19","19","0","0"

No content whatsoever. No Career feel, lame plane upgrades, bugs and more. Stay away from this unless you like arcade feel and simple missions of pick up, fly to and deliver. Maybe worth 3$ because their are aps on my phone better then this.","December 9, 2015","false","2.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The controls are rather annoying; yoke "self-centres" so to keep a steady descent, you have to continually move the mouse forward, i.e. keeping moving it forward, not just keep in a fixed position.\n\nOnce you learn to fly, missions are to fly from one place to another and report in.  Nothing of any interest.  There is nothing risky about the missions, that I can see.  Each one seems identical to the others.  No complexity, nothing of interest.\n\nEven if free, the half hour of time to see how little there is to the game is a half hour of your life you won't get back.\n","December 29, 2015","false","3.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"
