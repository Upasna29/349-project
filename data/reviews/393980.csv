To be honest it isnt too bad of a solitire game. But after a while it just got really repetitive. As for the nudity that everyone was expecting... Well I found none.\n\nGranted i didnt go through all the girls, but I finished about 20% of the game without anything that was over PG 13 tops.\nThe most I got was a swimsuit... so pretty much any slice of life anime cliche out there.\n\nFinal thoughts:\nIs it a good game? Not for that price. God not for that price.\nIs it using that nudity tag to bait buys? Hell yes.\n\n[Update]\n\nAfter reading the replies to this, I've got to say that:\n1. I am aware that full hentai is not allowed on steam, but there are some games out there with partial nudity. That is what I was refering to with the "nudity" tag. And yes, I see that it was removed now. Some people like ecchi in their games, and that tag is misleading.\n2. Although the tags on the games are placed by the comunity, they are still misleading at times and can get people into wasting money. I guess I should have rephrased how I talked about the tag. I'll keep that in mind next time I review a game.\n3. A few people are laughing, trolling IDK about spending a significant amount of money on this game. There is a return policy on steam. I used it and got my money back. However, steam reviews exist in order for people to know more about the game before buying and saving them the time it takes to explore the game themselves and (if they end up disliking the game) the time it takes for the return to go through.","August 24, 2015","false","0.9"," 355 of 403 people (88%) found this review helpful 60 people found this review funny","88","355","403","60","23"

Have I got the mild edition? Or the most shameless?\nAnyway, this Mahjong Solitaire is a short - and rather un-optimised in terms of gameplay - version of Mahjong, with typical Japanese pop-culture stuff such as gals with big eyes and enormously big breasts... As a way to somehow reward player for his effort to beat that quite generic solitaire game.\n\nIn truth, I haven't felt all enjoyed, as I'm quite tired of those specific J-features, when they are not followed by something really inspiring. Gals in the swimsuits? C'mon, it is summertime, I can get to the beach and see much more explicit goodliness - and even touch some... So, as a game of "guilty pleasure" - the one you wouldn't play in front of your Ma/wife/kids - "Pretty Girls Mahjong Solitaire" fails miserable. As I was really ashamed only with constant "ouh" from the girl picture on left part of the screen, when I'm moving tiles... maybe she thinks I'm tickling her? I muted those looped sounds quite fast, playing with my own music to "smooth the corners"...\n\nAs of mahjong - it is not fun as well, being heavily luck-based... your skill and your quick eye usually will be of no use there... And no, you can't choose/change the tables, there are just the "story" mode - without any story, where you play only those tables as developers supposed you to... I have about dozen of much better free-play Mahjong games in mind, and to pay the full price for this - I'd considered a rip-off!\n\nDo I Recommend the game? Not really, even with the thumbs up. Buy it only on the lowest price possible, or in some bundle, farm and sell the cards... And maybe you'll want to play some almost brain-dead solitaire to get one more "perfect" game to your score on Steam? Otherwise, in general fun out of the game, and in its cultural value, this one is really low. My mark is 5/10.","May 29","true","12.5"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","92","23","25","5","0"

The boards are layed out very good and are pseudo-randomized on each start, but never in such a way that they are unsolveable.\nThe game loses points because of how the boards are stacked combined with the top-down view: sometimes tiles that are adjacent and appear to be on the same level are actually on different levels and therefore both selectable. If there are no other tiles next to it this can be very easy to overlook.\n\nThe gimmick of the game is that you have an anime chick next to the boards who is moaning and saying Japanese things as you progress. After clearing three boards you get to a clothing change level where her moans become sexier and a slider goes down her body which reveals a skimpier outfit. There is no nudity.\nIf you mess up the girls yell some kind of insult that sounds like 'F Off!' but I'm probably mishearing that...\n\nAt it's current price with a huge discount, I can recommend it for the solitaire as it's done very well and the gimmick is amusing. Don't pay full price for it though.","November 1, 2015","true","5.1"," 31 of 39 people (79%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","79","31","39","5","0"

This game... is terrible.\nNote: Yeah this is a hate review. To get my frustration off my chest. Having a problem with that?\n\nGameplay:First of, I am having so many hours in this game due to achievement hunting, but that does not change anything that this game is just garbish. But let's start with the positive things this game has. Well, it managed to explain Mahjong to me which I guess is something good. The soundtrack is ok and the graphics are alright. I'd say the girls in this game look awful, but meh I guess this is just my personal taste. But well, why do I dislike this game so much? The stages in this game are randomly generated. ... You might say, random generated Levels? Sounds like infinite Levels. That sure must be alot of fun! NO! Hell NO! Shame on you! Get in the corner and think about what you have just said! Only because it is randomly generated does not mean it is good! Many of those generated Levels are simply NOT beat-able. Well, and how do I know that? Simple: If there are 2 white stones in the whole stage and those stones are stacked on top of each other. How do you think you can erase them? ... That's right! You CAN'T! The further you progress in the game, the higher is the possibility that you get a stage that you CAN'T complete. I am now at the final girl while I am writing this review and it happened plenty often that I just cannot beat the stage. I HAVE to hope on my luck to get finally a generated level that is actually beat-able. ... That is TERRIBLE! That is AWFUL game-design! And EVERY developer should be ashamed of that!\n\nConclusion: Even the 3€ I spent on this game are wasted. Don't bother playing this game. It will annoy you and it will make you rage because of an unfair game-design.\n\nRating: 3/10","November 14, 2015","false","9.9"," 37 of 54 people (69%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","69","37","54","3","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/niefart/recommended/393980/","niefart","ep!c™","http://steamcommunity.com/id/niefart/","438 products in account","#1 It's my very first negative review... didn't expect that comming when I started the game (still did 100% achievements).\n\nSo at the beginning I really need to underline that I really really wanted to like this game and I tried to skip all neglects... till chapter with Kanon, as the seiyuu was soo freaking annoying that I had to turn the voice off. Her "mero mero" & "hayako" made me look more and notice much more negative aspects of this game.\n\nIt's anime themed mahjong... 2 things I really enjoy in almost every possible way (that's why I tried so hard to like it), I mean... common... it's mahjong and anime what can possibly go wrong? Well, I didn't know back then that so many things can go wrong...\n\nPros (+):\nMusic, pretty nice, relaxing = suitable for this kind of game (got boring though after some hours)\nNice anime looking girls in different clothes (A LOT OF B00BS, as someone mentioned: day without boobs is wasted day)\nNot hard achievements, as they just come with progress (I like some harder ones, but it's not bad as well).\nCheap (wait on sale, I bought it for 0,99$)\nCons (-):\nThis game doesn't have contrast colors! I mean you are solving this mahjong and the colors of 'plates' is so pale that it's harder and harder too see pairs with game progression and harder stages. After playing some hours you are just tired of even looking at it. This was the biggest disadvantage for me.\nOnly "HARD MODE"... generally you can't choose, just play it. Not everyone is playing mahjongs for achievements or just to finish it once and never play again... it should have the option to 1) show available 'plates' to use; 2) hints; 3) possibility to undo the move (one time back); 4) Not everyone likes to be limited by time...\nGame for one time to play. You finish it, make all achievements and you will never want to play it again as there are a lot of better mahjongs that are fun to play and you can play the whole hours at once and you won't get tired but have fun.\nVoice that is used for girls and every 4 (?) pairs you get is turned on. I can't explain too well what I mean here. But in the nutshell, if you get the pairs very fast as me and the voice starts every 4 pairs you get it's getting so freaking annoying (repeating all the time without break) that it forced me to turn off the voice and turn on Morrowing theme in the background. You need to play it with Kanon character to fully understand me and get the pairs fast.\n\nConclusion:\nI got some free app (Mahjong Legends) on my cell phone and it's much more well build. It has highest scores when you got a good time, dozens of different boards that sometimes are extraordinary fun to do, etc...","November 18, 2015","false","8.5"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","14","17","0","3"

But it's a simple game of Mahjong Solitaire. I love this type of game, since I played a version of it on Game Boy. So, yeah, every type of it is interesting me. Even if it means girls in different clothes and states of undress. Anyway, let's focus.\n\nI was afraid that because of the fan service theme, the game will be easy. But I found it pretty hard by moments. Some levels required more than 10 tries before finally getting around. Each restart is a different challenge, as it's not the same dispostion of the tiles. I really appreciate it.\n\nEach stage has three rounds: two normal rounds and the final one, where the girl's clothes are being revealed by removing the tiles. Some of the clothes are "normal" if you're expecting exciting disguises. Sometimes, it's bikinis. And sometimes, it's... well, aimed for fantasms. While I don't mind the erotica, I don't like when bodies are exaggerated. You're under the impression that the more you advance, the bigger the breasts are. And that's not my stuff. If I have to look to erotic representations, I prefer something close to reality - when I have OTP, I'm not attracted to some of the erotica because of the exaggeration. Thanks god, the last character was normal - it was my favorite one, along with the first.\n\nThe game is very colorful as it's in an anime-style. As for the soundtrack, it was enjoyable, though the girls speaking Japanese or making weird noises annoyed me as I couldn't understand them or that I don't need to know that they're clearly embarrassed to reveal themselves in the finale round. I should really acquire the reflex to check audio options in that kind of case.\n\nThe game is also having a dressing room, where unlocked clothes can be viewed with the girls. It's just a nice feature for those that love looking at them, otherwise, it's not really adding any interactivity.\n\nAnyway, the game is a good moment if you enjoy mahjong solitaire. However, at full price, it's a waste, so, wait for a discount. Oh and if you're here because you love hentai, you should pass the game, there is no full nudity or any sexual scenes, even if the representation is clearly aimed to excite the players in a sensual and sexual sense.\n\nAnd if you're asking yourself if a girl can enjoy it, yeah. You can enjoy it. You don't need to be a boy to appreciate some of the erotica presented here if you're focused on this side of the game. If you're here for the mahjong, anybody can enjoy, whether you're a girl or a boy. Myself, I've focused on the mahjong, not on the girls, even if I did pay attention as you can't totally ignore that part of the screen.\n\nAnyway, like I've said, if you want this game, buy it when there is a good sale.","January 31","true","5.2"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

It's the more, in the west, common match-the-tiles-game, and start off fairly easy, but once the difficulty starts rising, by god is it rising. Beyond the obvious failstate that is "no more tiles to match", you also have a timer ticking down. In addition to this, when the tiles get randomly placed there's a major risk that you'll get a setup that you cannot win, no matter skill, and in my playthrough half my losses was due to this. That said, the game evoke the same feeling where every loss makes you more determined that many find in games like Dark Souls after enough losses. In fact, I for one forgot the whole "Pretty Girls" part of the game until victory was mine. Be warned though, you who are here primarily for the anime images, there's no gallery for the various outifts after you beat the required stages, which is a bit of a let down.\n\nSo all in all, it's flawed, but I recomend it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chairmankao/recommended/393980/","chairmankao","chairmankao","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chairmankao/","1195 products in account","I'm going to actually try to tackle this seriously. Not sure I would have bought it, but since it was gifted, I was happy to give it a spin.\n\nSerious stuff (with pros and cons):\n+ Gameplay is standard for this genre. Nothing out of the ordinary for a Mahjong Solitaire game. Definitely benefits from simple, quick games, which lead you just play one more time. You'll need to beat a girl three times to obtain her costume.\n\n+ Visually simple, though in a good way. Clean graphics. For the most part, it is clear what tiles can be selected, whereas in other games it can be hard to tell. If you click on a tile that cannot be moved, there is a buzzing noise.\n\n- Timer winds down during gameplay, and successfully matching tiles will add time to the timer. I'd prefer there not be a timer at all or the option to switch it off for a more relaxed experience. Generally speaking, I did not have a problem with the timer until later stages.\n\n+ The music is decent and in some cases quite catchy, though not to the degree that I'd ever want a soundtrack DLC option. Maybe a little repetitive in each stage, but most games go quickly. Each stage and level has a different track. Would be nice to be able to manually select.\n\nPervy stuff (hey, since they're using sex to sell, I figure it makes sense to comment on this):\n+/- Voice acting. Really, mainly whimpering / moaning when making matches in every third game. Nicely done, developers; the devil is in the details. What ruined it was Kanon (the girl with the two long pigtails). Her moaning / whimpering was beyond annoying, and I had to turn it off during her stages. Change (or mute) Kanon's voice and this turns into a plus.\n\n- Character variety. Only five girls to beat. Three (first, second and fifth) are attractive, but the third girl is ridiculous looking and the fourth girl is beyond annoying.\n\n- Costume variety. Generally pretty disappointing. Most characters have five costumes (including the starting outfit), though one has only four. Some of the costumes result in the character having more clothes than what she started with. Once a costume is obtained, you can see that character wearing it from an option on the main menu.\n\n- Animation. Nothing. No stripping. Just a bar that lowers in each third match that reveals the girl with a different costumer. No zooming in the dressing room. No jiggling or movement. Just eyes that open and close. Seems pretty lazy to me.\n\nOverall rating - 5/10:Not sure I'd buy it at full price, but it was a decent time killer for a few hours, and I enjoyed the gameplay. If this rating seems low ... well, the pervy stuff was overly simplistic. Did it effect gameplay? Not at all, but if they're marketing the game on the basis of scantily clad girls, then the rating needs to take this into account. It's not terrible ... I'd rather have some sexiness than none at all, but it's obvious the developers could have done so much more.\n7/10 - Pretty solid in gameplay. Nothing special but does everything well enough.\n3/10 - Sexiness is disappointing. Super basic. Characters don't move or respond to clicks.

Similar to HuniePop's strategy of playing Match 3 games in order to progress a "date", PGMS utilizes Mahjong to progress a characters story. There are 5 characters with approximately 3 Stages each, containing 4 Rounds in each Stage, that must be completed in order to unlock all outfits for each character. The 4th round in each Stage will progressively undress the character, revealing a new outfit underneath. Every tile clear will make the character elicit some sort of response/noise.\n\nThe actual Mahjong gameplay is fairly similar to other games of its kind on Steam. Progressing to a point where no more moves are available will end the round prematurely - there is no shuffle feature. Running out of time will also end the round prematurely; however continuously matching tiles will add more time. You may save the round to return later, and pausing the game will hide the faces of the tiles.\n\nThere is only a moderate amount of difficulty faced to clear a round. Veterans of Mahjong will have no problems at all breezing through most of the rounds. The difficulty does increase a little bit further into the later rounds of each character. The game options are pretty basic: fullscreen and music/sfx sliders.

The idea was pretty straightforward.  I'm not the biggest fan of anime, but I'm always up for a good game of mahjong, so I decided to buy it.  Was it worth it?\n\nThe short answer is yes.  For the price I bought it ($1.50), I got my money's worth and then some.  I found a fun mahjong game that was short but challenging.  The anime girls were just a bonus, but they were worth seeing after each round.  Sure, some of the sounds the girls made were a bit strange, but at least the music was pretty catchy.\n\nA message to potential buyers: if you want this game, get it when it's on sale.  There's not enough content to warrant a $15 price tag.  However, for the price I got it for, it was an excellent casual game that any fan of mahjong (or puzzle games in general) should have in their collection.","December 30, 2015","true","12.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Each costume requires you to complete a set of 3 levels. You don't have to complete the 3-level set in one sitting. You can quit, come back and continue from the beginning of the level you were on.\n\nEach girl has a different personality and a couple of quips they will say as you are solving the puzzle. The puzzles have a constantly draining timer. You get more time on the clock by making matches. The level will instantly fail if there are no more matches you can make.\n\nThe general shape of the level is predetermined, but the placement of individual tiles seems random. Whether or not you manage to solve a level seems to depend heavily on luck, so completing the game was a bit of a chore. When you unlock a costume your only reward is being able to see the girl standing in said costume. Even though the art is nicely done, it isn't much of a reward.\n\nOverall, the game is barely worth playing even for those with a keen interest in anime girls.","January 16","false","7.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I thought they would have been a large distraction but they weren't at all.\n\nOverall, it's a fun game to play (though your friends may judge you for having it like some of mine did but it doesn't mater in the end as long as you like it I guess) but I will warn you that some of the levels are almost unwinable if not unwinable.

New opinions reflected accordingly.\n\nFirst off, if you're looking for nudity, look elsewhere. The devs even said in the product description this game has none, the nudity tag is a bunch of idiots assuming the girls will eventually strip fully naked for you. (They're USER DEFINED tags, after all.)\n\nSecond, I'm rating this game based on the game, not the women, because I feel like the game deserves a fair rating based on its merits and faults.\n\nThe game is basically Mahjong Solitaire, the probably more well known version of Mahjong as far as the United States goes. This type of thing has probably been remade a bunch of times in many different forms for Facebook and Flash. So what makes this one different? Not much, unfortunately, aside from every third round being a level where the girl to the left of the game field changes into a different outfit.\n\nIt still does Mahjong Solitaire properly. The rules aren't any different, so if you've played it before, you already know how. All of the stages are different, though none of them use the full tile set (only one season in play at any point). Originally, the game did not have a resume function, thereby forcing you to do all three rounds in one sitting. An update fixed this issue, as well as allowing you to see the girls in their outfits you worked to earn, so the game gets points for the devs paying attention to what we're saying. This makes some of the other issues less of an issue.\n\nPros:\n- It's the Mahjong Solitaire you probably know well.\n- Some of the outfits do pass off as sexy.\n- Ability to suspend play in the middle of a stage.\n\nCons:\n- Time limit prevents you from thinking about moves too long.\n- Limited music variety; everything gets repetitive before finishing the first girl.\n- Uneven difficulty toward the end.\n- Some of the outfits feel reused with minor aesthetic changes.\n\nOverall: 6/10. With the addition of the suspend mechanic, I can deal with not having an undo or reshuffle mechanic, as if I get frustrated and want to do something else, I don't have to redo everything I just did. It gets just enough of a score to allow me to recommend this game.","August 25, 2015","true","7.1"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

It's not. It's a Mahjong solitaire game, and apparently some people have no idea what that means. Sometimes, you're going to farckerberg your tiles to where you end with an unsolvable puzzle. Sometimes random generation can do this to you, same as any solitaire game (or so I understand it, because when I couldn't finish a puzzle in this game it's been wholly my fault for not playing different combinations, etc). The nudity title is wholly misleading, because there is no nudity, and having cleared all five stages I can tell you the most revealing outfit is a bikini. This is NOT a game to play if you're looking for nudity; it IS a fun Mahjong solitaire game though. Is anyone else old enough to remember Taipei? It's Taipei with anime girls. After clearing the five stages though it definitely loses appeal; I think a random puzzle shape generator would have increased the replay value for me. All in all, a fun game at a cheap price.\n\nTL;DR: For playing, not for fapping.

Antrider","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LFantrider/","426 products in account","I have mixed feelings on this game because of some design issues, but it is a nice pick-up at a discounted price.\n\nThe Mahjong aspect of this game is solid.  It is very challenging... to the point where you may rage quit once or twice during the game.  That being said, why would anyone rage quit during a game of Mahjong, which typically should be a very calming/meditative experience?\n\nThat brings in the number one complaint you are likely to hear in review of this game:  The timer. In a game of Mahjong, one would do well to make some informed decisions about which matches to "Pick", as choices you make in the game can ultimately become a factor in whether you win or lose.  Mahjong has a strong element of chance in it, but there is quite a bit of well-intentioned thought that it also requires... the timer albeit negates all of your efforts to make such informed decisions.  Ultimately, I think this game would have been adequately challenging from the tile lay-outs themselves and would love if the creators did away with the timer, but it's not necessarily a complete deal-breaker.\n\nAnother complaint I would add is perhaps an important one considering that this is a game whose main asset (at least from an advertising perspective) is its ASSETS.  And by assets I totally mean ♥♥♥♥.  As with a lot of anime-themed games, the paper-doll work is a little boring.  Well, very boring.  Instead of having different poses for the different character dolls, there is only one pose per girl that gets re-used, the artists just drawing different outfits on the doll (sometimes even borrowing the same lines from other outfits that don't always make sense).  A more important artistic criticism is that two of the dolls have chests that are very clearly misproportioned from an artist's perspective.  Not disproportioned in the sense that real women wouldn't have such large breasts... disproportioned in the sense that the right boob is bigger and at an awkward angle compared to the left.  I think it's unfortunate that anime artists responsible for only 5 characters cannot work in any dynamic aspect to their character art and are rather using these copy & paste method of art that we're seeing in most of these games...  The outfits aren't even that great for most of the girls.  They often seem more fully dressed after stripping, which is disappointing after the already crippling disappointment of there not being actual nudity in this game.\n\nDid I play through this entire game?  Yes.  Did I enjoy playing it?  Mostly :-).  Do I recommend it?  Yes... with the above stipulations added.  When you factor in the fact that there is no nudity--YES, I am disappointed as ♥♥♥♥.\n\n","November 21, 2015","true","9.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

I was hoping that it would last three or four times longer than it did. If this game is up for a sequel, try and add some replayability to it  by adding a custom or random puzzle mode, more levels in general or a scoring system based on time and tiles flipped. Any of those would have stretched my playing out a few more hours, and all of these would have me competing with my friends or family.\n\nI enjoyed the game play and difficulty curve between the levels, as it took me quite a few tries to get past the last few "Final Round"s","November 14, 2015","true","9.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's a very challenging and solid Mahjong title. Be prepared to be frustrated in a good way. The girls are a fun addition as each set of costumes is based around their given personality, as are the backgrounds for the boards.\n\nThe only downsides I have found to the ladies thus far are just typical anime problems: one lass I wanted to belt in the face due to her irritating voice (thankfully, you can just turn off the sound effects) and some questionable porportions that gives one the ladies massive man hands (probably to hold her ♥♥♥♥ better? The world may never know). I also love the inclusion of the Monkey King flying around and helping the ladies costume change. It's a nice touch :)\n\nThe soundtrack is bouncy without being too repetitive or annoying. I can have it playing in the background as I go do other things and not feel affronted by it.\n\nThe final question: Will you see your waifus nude? Well, no. We all know the nudity tag is 10% actual nudity and 90% "tee hee, that's where her ♥♥♥♥♥♥ goes."","December 26, 2015","true","6.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There are five girls with 4 or 5 costumes each - note that we're not stripping the girls, just changing their clothes. There's no nudity here, and no patch to unlock it (unlike Hunie Pop) because it doesn't exist.\n\nThe gameplay is fun, but expect to have to replay the puzzles dozens of times in the later stages to solve them. It took me 90 minutes just to unlock Ayame's second costume. It's addictive, though, I couldn't put the game down until I did it!\n\nWhen you've unlocked every costume, which took me 7.5hrs, there's little reason to play anymore. And for that reason, I can't recommend the game unless it's on sale - I got it for 90% off in the Steam winter sale.\n\nSpeaking of price, it boils my balls to see Zoo Corporation mark up the price for customers in Japan, and I was THIS close to giving the game a negative review because of it.\n\nTL;DR\nAddictive, tile-matching game with pretty girls to motivate you.

Obviously the gameplay is still the same since it's based on a real, old chinese game but it's always a fun game.\n\nThere are not a lot Mahjong Solitaire games, especially on Steam so I bought it as soon as it was on sale. I would advise to do the same if the game interest you. It's a solid game but it's still simple with a few drawbacks, enough to give you a few hours of play.\n\nAs far as I could notice all the stages are in different patterns. The tiles are also randomised so each game should always be different. There is also a good progression of patterns, at the beginning it's hard to lose and at the end it takes multiple tries to win.\n\nThe music is entertaining and there are a few different tracks while background are diverse and the girls have multiple costumes. But it feels weird in a Solitaire/Patience game, it should be to relax but there is a time limit, the music is upbeat and the girls keep making noises while trying to get your attention.\n\n+Multiple Patterns\n+Good Art\n+Easy to Difficult\n\n-Not really relaxing because of a time limit and upbeat music.\n-Later stage are a bit too difficult and it can get annoying.\n-Only one game mode, can't play without time limit for example.","November 11, 2015","true","5.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I like pretty animoo girls, and Mahjong was a fun-sounding concept to me, so I gave it a shot.  The gameplay is addictive, and I genuinely loved the game's soundtrack.  It kind of reminded me of Shoji Meguro, the composer for the Persona series, and I love him so that was cool.  Honestly, as much as I love oversized anime boobs, I barely noticed the girls when playing this and I highly doubt I'd open the game again just to look at them.  The art is pretty good and the moany groany pretty girl grunts they make when you match tiles was... well recorded, I guess, but I'm 26 and I've been playing animoo sex games since I was 12 so I barely notice that ♥♥♥♥.  If you need some sort of incentive to play Mahjong I guess big boobed cartoon cuties works.  I wish they would have included more color in the tiles because staring at them for six hours made my eyes really bleary and it was annoying trying to find matches in the later stages.  But yo, if you want a fun mahjong game, I played it to completion and snagged all the achivements so it's probably worth your time... on sale.

Still, the game maintains a modicom of taste since the most "adult" images depict these girls in bikinis or one-piece swimsuits.  There's also the regrettable design choice that these girls give the impression that they're embarrassed by being undressed, almost to the point where they're feeling violated (you can see examples in the store page's screenshots).  It leaves one feeling kind of gross to play it...\n\nBut you know what?  It's actually a good game.  It features a total of 51 stages that are well paced in difficulty, interesting and varied board layouts, and a surprisingly GREAT soundtrack (IMO).  With the addition of a ticking timer, there's an implied impetus to work quickly and that tension goes a long way.  It's so solid that it's easy to overlook the baudy theme and instead focus on the mechanics.\n\nI went into this game expecting something completely gross and barely playable.  Turns out it was merely SOMEWHAT gross but still super enjoyable.  Hooray for small surprises (and J-cup grooties)!\n\nYou should balk at the normal retail price, but if you can get it on sale I'd recommend it to anyone that wants to dive into some mahjong solitaire.  At the time of writing it was 90% off, so I'd expect something similar during the semi-annual Steam sales.

There is a fair amount of challenge here in this game, and that is balanced with the boobs.\n\nThe soundtrack is not too bad at all - it blends well with the gameplay, and does create a casual and fun environment.\n\nThe only drawback I can see in this game, is there are not a lot of levels. That sounds weird to say, as there are over 50 patterns in this game, but I personally think they could've increased that to 100+. I do love a vast array of patterns in Mahjong Solitaire. But that's just me.\n\nIf you are a fan of Mahjong Solitaire, like I am, then Pretty Girls Mahjong Solitaire is worth a buy. Don't let the fanservice scare you off.

But it is what it is.  The girls are really just there and they shout random Japanese things at you.  No real use for them at all, outside of collecting outfits to say I beat this level.  But, that's what achievements are for, right?\nThat said, this game goes on sale for 80-90% off quite often and 3$ vs the price of Huniepop is adequate.  You get what you pay for so to speak.\nIf you like solitaire style mahjong to relax, and don't mind being called a "hentai" every time you succeed at round 3 of a stage this is pretty good.  As the puzzles actually provide some difficulty and failing puzzles due to poor choices or random chance can happen (which is common in complex layouts in mahjong).\n\nVery good solo game to stress relief.  No innuendo implied, but the music is genuinely upbeat, repetitive, but the focus for my brain at least goes to racing the clock (which isnt really a big deal in honesty) and finding the best move possible.\nIt's not overly perverse at all, outside of some J-Cup style girls, most of the outfits are cute and at most role play for the imagination.\n\n\nI would NOT buy this game at full price, and the fact it costs more than huniepop and offers LESS (in adult content, storyline, unique puzzles, more girls, easter eggs, unlockable characters) is quite honestly a big mistake.  Worth it completely on sale, the cards are cute, and if you like crafting badges, consider it.\n\n\nOverall verdict: Generic boobs to sell mahjong solitaire game.  But the puzzles and layouts are actually difficult. A solid 6 of 10.   If you like the girls add a point, if you expect more content remove a point.  But 6 for me is quite high praise for anime girls used to sell a game.  It could have been made into so much more.\nPS: I would love a dating sim mixed with more girls, a bit of plot, and "plot", and mahjong puzzles it would have drastically added some sort of use and meaning for the girls in the game besides a "sex sells" point.  Would have easily made paying more for this game worth it, and would up the recommendation at least 2-3 points.","November 13, 2015","true","3.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

To Show their appreciation the girls dress in skimpy outfits after each level has been completed.\n\nPros\n-breasts\n-outfits for everyone\n-easy achievements\n-backgrounds to make a mother wonder where she went wrong\n-the soundtrack is suprisingly fitting and didn't get annoying to me\n\nCons\n-game is hard if you haven't played Mahjong before\n-the time limit is annoying\n-the moaning is annoying, sounds fake and more like if you were beating them and giving them the good, however you can turn this down so it's not a problem\n\nOther then that, the game doesn't promise anything it doesn't give. It's fun and challenging.","November 1, 2015","true","5.2"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

However there is no full nudity as some people obviously expect.\n\nThe difficulty of the puzzles varies from absolutely easy to |I-think-the-game-is-♥♥♥♥ing-with-me.\n\nSadly the Last two girls kinda disappoint with the clothes they reveal. The rounds that lead up to them changing are more challenging that for the previous girls, yet aren't that sexy at all.\n\nI'd recommend the game to anyone who likes mahjong and is interested to see 5 anime girls in a few anime girls in some cute and sexy outfits. - 7/10\n\nFor everyone else ~4/10","November 1, 2015","true","11.3"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

The timer is an interesting and arcadey component to beating the puzzles, but I find it largely unnecessary by the end. I don't feel like the amount of time you have to solve puzzles scales to the increased size of mahjong boards. I only once found myself losing to the timer, but in a game where you have to strategically make your matches, the timer doesn't allow for much thought and deliberation on which tiles to match.\n\nThere was one game where I made exactly 1 move at the start and the board had to reset because I had no more moves to make. It happens in solitaire games (very easy to see in Pyramid among others), but it didn't help any more with the annoyance I had started to have with the game.\n\nOf the girls, 1st girl Rin was best girl, but the rest were meh. Ayame's character didn't seem to have the polish the other girls had, like her art was done at a different resolution from the rest but scaled up.\n\nI got to 5-2 second round before I decided that I'd had enough and deleted the game.\n\nEdit: removed an unnecessary "with" from a sentence.","April 30","false","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You match tiles and get to see anime girls in progressively more revealing outifts. It's not complicated in the slightest. Every round is randomly generated so there is some replay value. The random generator can spawn some very complicated sets that some might say are impossible. I can't speak in definites but I would think that every set of tiles can be solved, they're just very tough. Other than that possible negative, there are positives. The art is great, the music is fantastic (if not a bit repetitive), and ultimately, it's just silly, sexy fun. Lastly, i want to say two things: Don't take this game seriously, you'll ruin it for yourself if you do, and buy it only when it's on sale, unless you want to really support the developers or something. If you decide to buy it, have fun, if you don't, I don't think you'll be missing that much.","May 7","true","10.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
