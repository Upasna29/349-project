Bullet-hell? Actually, its more like a mix of all of them, plus a bit of driving game with a crazy storyline. Yeah, story is about aliens invading the Earth and you - some driver shooting the hell of them. Oh, and I'm gonna spoil it, you will me meet a big alien boss at the end of the game ;).\n\nDrive to Hell has all elements what makes this genre so immersive - solid gameplay and good balance. Shooting is satisfying and the interesting part of gameplay is that it enforces player to pick and use different power-ups, because they are freaking powerful, while the main gun, in most cases, is weak and requires much more effort to succeed. Varied enemy types adds up to a great experience. As I mentioned, balance is suprisingly good, normal difficulty is suitable for anyone, while higher difficulties and survival mode really test your skills, but in a good way and is never impossible.\n\nGameplay feels good and features many cars to choose from, which can be fast, but without much of firepower or a complete opposite. Completing levels with good score earns money, which can be used only for different cars. Length is just right, there are 5 levels with 5 waves each and a boss at the end of level. Along with 4 difficulties, many achievements and survival mode it can easily immerse for at least 5 hours. For such a low price its amazing how meaty the game is.\n\nWhat really separates Drive to Hell from others shoot'em ups is graphics. Its made with Unity engine and features very crisp colors, which makes it so easy to notice every enemy or bullet.\n\nWell, there is some some problems too, coop mode works, but it can be hard to make your controller work, also music and sound effects lacks variety.\n\nDrive to Hell really shows how indie shmups improved recently, with its slick gameplay and some inovations. True bang for your buck!\n\n9/10","May 3, 2015","true","17.7"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","16","16","0","0"

The game is filled with weapon upgrades, boss monsters, and a visual style that brings me back to the 16-bit era. The game plays great with either keyboard/mouse or a controller, and the tone of the game (you are driving through hell - like in a car, capable of firing missiles, because a demon blew up your favorite bar) is really fun and doesn't take itself too seriously, which is refreshing.\n\nI guess one could read into it a bit too much and glean a point about who is really the monster: the demon, or the couple willing to hunt him down because they couldn't get a drink, but I'm too busy blowing stuff up to care about morality in games. I have demons to kill, so pour me another!\n\nA really fun game, and definitely worth the asking price!","January 30, 2015","true","3.6"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","16","17","0","0"

Unlike a number of similar retro shooters in this genre this one smacks with freshness.  Don't expect much of a story but the controller (on a mouse and keyboard for me) were suprisingly fluid.  Also a bonus to many in this genre you have health rather than life--something i much prefer.  The power up weapons are great, though a bit too short lasting for how fun they are. Their are other pickups useful as well to your journey through hell--much more campy than grotesque or frightening.  Has a great 80-90s vibe to it especially with the unbelievably awesome soundtrack (at least to me).  No 15 second endless loops that get repetive.  These are quality songs that smack of a bit shoegaze 80-90s rock in the genre closest to the band the Cure.\n\nI would definately recommend this for the modest price of $5 if you like any of the above listed.","January 30, 2015","true","0.8"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

Really great twin-stick conrol scheme makes it easy to get into and lets you do some pretty fancy moves. Animations are good, has a fun style to itself, and plays really well in co-op! Played great right out of the box, worked with my controller without having to fiddle with anything. Good number of unlockables to keep you coming back. Lots of weird enemy designs that feel unique. Cool powerups. What else can I say?\nFeels like a long-lost coin-op arcade shmup.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/recommended/334840/","pepsimanvsjoe","pepsimanvsjoe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/","1281 products in account","Typically, my recommendation is dependent upon whether or a videogame exceeds my expectations. Went I started Drive to Hell, I wasn't expecting much if any quality. Devils just destroyed this guy's favorite hangout, so he's gonna get revenge. I mean...really? That's just totally gag-worthy. Also when the title screen has "Like us on Facebook/Twitter/Other Networking Sites!" I begin to wonder why I even installed the game. After all, idlemaster works as long as a game is in your library.\n\nBut, I played through the game a few times, and it's legit.\n\nDrive to Hell is a vehicular twin-stick shooter. You're on a highway (to hell) and devils approach from every direction. Some simply home in on you, others circle around the screen, and some prefer to harass you from the sides. Also since you're in a vehicle, your mobility tends to be limited. Most of the play-field either slows you down, or is blocked off entirely. Twin-stick shooters tend to get claustrophobic, so one where you have maybe 1/3 of the screen to actually work with gets pretty ridiculous.\n\nWhile shooting everything that moves is fine, you also have to consider your vehicle. There are a handful to unlock, all with their own strengths, weaknesses, and special abilities. While you can drive a heavily armored tank, you'll find that it is slow, and its bulk makes weaving in-between bullets a bit too difficult. Alternatively something light and weak is liable to be much smaller and more maneuverable. The special abilities can be anything from a bullet-absorbing shield to proximity mines.\n\nIt's also important to look out for weapon and item power-ups. Weapons are just that, more powerful (but temporary) methods for bringing death to minions. Items are a bit different, since they can held onto for the right situation. This might be a good reason to choose a heavier vehicle, because they can carry more items. Being able to crack open a shield or a bomb when the situation gets out of control is really handy.\n\nThat's pretty much the extent of it I believe. Even though there are boss-battles, this isn't the type of game where you have to memorize patterns or develop strategies. Choosing the right vehicle for your play-style and your reflexes will get you very far. There are four difficulties though, and the later settings can get really intense. Thankfully, the difficulty doesn't do anything cheap, like force one-hit kills on you, or make it so you can't continue after dying. However, if you're the type that plays for score, you can't take damage at all, because it'll kill your multiplier. All in all there's a good difficulty balance for every kind of gamer.\n\nDrive to Hell gets my recommendation because it exceeded my (admittedly low) expectations. I'd even go as far to say as I'm pretty impressed with it. Once I got over my initial "What is this hunk of.." reaction, I discovered that this is a solidly-designed game with satisfying controls, playability, and even a touch of depth. My only real complaint is that there are some annoying foreground objects that block a good portion of the screen. This hasn't led to any deaths (yet), but I've gotten hit once or twice. Otherwise this game is pretty decent, you might want to give it a try.\n","February 12, 2015","true","4.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Four levels of difficulty (and yes: it gets hard, then harder, then absurd) and various vehicles that unlock as you progress (collect in-game coins and spend them on new cars at the garage - all ingame functions), as well as survivor modes for all difficulties, makes this a game with a solid couple of hours of potential, or more.\n\nIf you're looking for easy achieves, this has a couple that unlock easily through game play (kill this, beat the game, don't use a certain gun, etc), but some are going to take time (kill 200 bosses, for example).\n\nConsidering how many quarters I've pumped into games not half this good over the course of my life, this game is easily worth the cost of a decent pint of beer, and will give you loads more in return.\n\nWell done, Ghost Crab Games!","March 12, 2015","true","18.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
