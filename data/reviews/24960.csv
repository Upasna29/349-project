Battlefield: Bad Company 2 has it all.    Gameplay  9  At times, it feels like there are some frustrating balance issues. But those are few and far between. Bad Company 2 is a fantastic game to pick up and go to town with. You'll find glee in causing buildings to crumble around you, planting that charge of C4 on a tank and blowing it up, nailing that perfect headshot from across the map. However, where Bad Company 2 really shines is when you log on with some friends and get coordinated. Communicate and work together to outgun, outflank, and outdo the enemy team.    Story  4  I'll be honest with you. If you are playing Battlefield games for the story, you're going to be really, really disappointed. While there is a storymode here, it honestly isn't worth much of your time except as a glorified tutorial. The characters do give a few good laughs though.    Multiplayer  10  As mentioned earlier, Bad Company 2 really shines when you play with friends, but even alone you're going to have a blast with this one. Hours and hours of fun and destruction await you, with several different modes of multiplayer available to choose from. Be warned though, if you join up this late in the game you're going to face some very, very good long-time players.    Replayability  9  You're going to keep coming back to this one. The peak of the Battlefield series so far, it never gets old racing out of a building as it crumbles around you, covering your team on a withdrawal from an overrun area, or being at the front of a charge to capture a point. Don't miss out on one of the most enjoyable Battlefield experiences yet. The only struggle here is that most your friends will probably have moved on to the new battlefields.    Overall  9.2/10  Though not as popular as it once was (due to the new battlefields) Bad Company 2 still stands at the top of the Battlefield mountain. The Frostbite engine really shines in this iteration. Multiplayer is fast-paced, brutal, and spectacularly fun. Don't like those trees? Mow them down with your LMG. Don't like that building? Blow it up. Your team being overrun? Call in an artillery strike and give them some relief. All in all, an absolute must have for any Battlefield fan.\nIf you liked this review, feel free to check out my curator page:\nThe Tipster\n\nYou are also welcome to join our group and play/discuss games together, here:  The Tipster","October 26, 2014","true","186.6"," 637 of 695 people (92%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","92","637","695","28","18"

NA - Eu/Russia - Oceania)\n\nBought it 3 times:\n- Disk: 20€\n- Steam: 2.5€\n- Origin: 2€\n\nTime in-game > 3000 hours:\n- Disk: +- 2500h\n- Steam: 350h\n- Origin: 350h\n\nThe SP\nNot that important to me, but even so I finished it three times (2x normal and 1x hard). I thought the chars were pretty great, certainly had a few laughs. The gameplay was OK, but like I said I'm not really a sp kinda guy.\n\nPros (Multiplayer)\n+++ The gameplay is just... really this game has a soul people!! The feeling guys, it's amazing :D\n\n++ Brilliant map design. (flanking possibilities etc)\n++ Huge terrain variation. (jungle/ snow and desert)\n++ Almost everything is destructable.\n++ Class system is great and rewards teamplay!\n++ Separate level and class unlocks.\n++ Vehicles are fun and rewarding when mastered but still balanced.\n++ Does not force battlelog or origin on its users.\n++ It can be soooooo much fun :D\n++ It goes on sale for 2.5€.... seriously?\n\n\n+ You can change FOV in settings file.\n+ Decent amount of graphical options.\n+ Imo the graphics (maxed out) beat a lot of 2014 titles to it.\n+ Requirements are pretty low.\n+ Never had issues that couldn't be easily fixed (like crashes etc).\n+ I found the amount of attachements a bit overwhelming in bf3, not the case here.\n\nCons (Multiplayer)\n-- The hitreg isn't always as it should be.\n-- The community (players). Many of the players play like total scrubs and talk ♥♥♥♥ all day long.\n-- The community (admins). If you're a decent player, they might kick/ ban you from their server.\n-- Some balancing issues with weapons like mg36, explosive perks, autoshotguns and shotgun slugs.\n\n- Level unlocks only last till lvl 22.\n- There are some hackers. 1/40 rounds or so. (people who claim there are cheaters in every round have no idea what they're talking about)\n\nConclusion:\nThis game is amazing. The graphics and gameplay create such a unique atmosphere, I can keep playing it for hours and hours and just keep coming back for more. The only reasons why I don't play it 24/7 are the hitreg and the community. It's only 5€, seriously guys what are you waiting for :D!!\n\nNote for new players - It all comes down to one simple question really:\nDo you like spreading your cheeks and getting farmed/ baseraped by better players?\n\nYes --> snipe from your main or use improved demolitions on 40mm/ rpgs, use chat to vent your rage, don't drop ammo/heals or repair vehicles, don't join squads, connect to 32 slots fast respawn (preferably hardcore) servers.\n\nNo --> Use your primary weapon + pistol (+ magnum ammo perk - lvl 15), play the objective, use your audio, support your team, flank and backstab, change your FOV in the settings file, play on low ping 24 slots servers (no hardcore) , play SQUAD RUSH/ conquest/ rush, try playing with friends.\nYou will still get ♥♥♥♥♥, but less frequently and you might even have fun.\n\nRespectable players --> don't use autoshotguns, mg36, mortars, rpgs/40mm tube on players, long range shotgun or improved demolitions perk.\n\n\n--Edit-- : How to find populated servers. (Since you asked)\n1. Boot the game.\n2. Click 'Login'. (right - center)\n3. Enter Email and PW of your EA account.\n-->Some people can't login when the boxes for remember PW/ Auto login are checked.\n4. Select or create a soldier and click 'Login'\n5. Click 'Multiplayer' (top center) and select 'Server browser' (2nd option).\n6. Look at the 'Filter Options' (right center).\n7. Select 'all' for game mode/ maps and region.\n8. Check the box next to 'Ranked' (right center) --> 'Punkbuster' gets autochecked.\n9. Now click 'Search' (right bottom).\n10. To rank the found servers according to population click on the 'Players' tab (center - right).\n\n--Edit--: Best way to register your CD key and prevent problems in mp!\n1. Buy BC2 on steam.\n2. Go to your steam library. (top left)\n3. Right click on 'Bad Company 2'.\n4. Select 'View CD key' from the list.\n5. Copy the CD key.\n6. Go to: https://www.origin.com\n7. Click 'Login' (top center) or 'Register' (if you don't have an EA account).\n8. Enter the email and password of your EA account.\n9. Click 'My account' (top center).\n10.

It was worth it.\nIn no other game (accept Call of Duty) you will need so long to reach the motherfu*king top - General of the Army. 280 hours (for me)\n\nThe historical background is the Cold War between the United States of America and Russia. That is the campaign. Very simple.\n\nTo the facts!\n\n++ many people play it\n++ huge arsenal of weapons and vehicles\n++ realistic\n++ the best sounds (weapon etc.) I ever heard!\n++ nice explosions!\n++ nice map design\n++ maps and game modes - big variation\n++ awesome graphics\n+ everbody can play this - tactics, camper, rambos etc.\n+ the campaign is ok\n+ gameplay is smooth and fast\n+ every weapon has dis- and advantages\n+ normal sized maps (not like in BF3)\n+ don't rush - play with tactic\n+ no arena shooter (like Call of Duty)\n+ earn dogtags by killing an enemy with the knife...hihihi\n\nYes. Also BF:BC 2 has a dark side... not really\n\n- EA\n- many "pros" and camper are playing this now\n- many children play this..with a microphone\n- ruined my life\n- often connecting problems or problems with "PunkBuster"\n- it isn't easy at the beginning, but you will find in\n\nIn my opinion it is the BEST Battlefield in history! Everything you want in a shooter is in this game! For 5€ or 20€ you can buy this. Please. I swear you will love this game!

The only Battlefield game on Steam but also the best.\n\nThe good -\n- The guns feel powerful and fun to use and sound so loud and scary you'd think satan was farting in your ears.\n- A ♥♥♥♥ ton of weapons and gadgets to unlock.\n- Fun single player with likeable, memorable characters. Everyone remembers Sweetwater and Haggard, who honestly remembers the names of shouty marine #2 and #3 from the other BF games?\n- Destructible cover, walls and buildings  gives you so many different ways to play and works a lot better than in later BF games. In Bad Company 2 you can level whole buildings and laugh like a maniac as enemy players are crushed to death inside whereas in BF3 and 4 you can mostly only blow holes in (some) walls.\n- Doesn't require Origin to play!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n- When the ♥♥♥♥ really kicks off there is nothing else like it on PC.\n- The sniper class looks like Chewbacca.\n\nThe bad:\n- You can't go prone which is a little annoying in some situations but no one else can go prone either so it's no biggie.\n- You unlock magnum ammo at rank 15 which increases your weapon damage by 25%. It's pretty dumb and pointless, you will suffer many unfair deaths until you unlock it.\n- That's about it.

Real high replay value aswell, i always come back to the game quite frequent for the amazing multiplayer experience that it has to offer. I highly recommend any FPS fan to get this game, you will not be dissapointed. The game is of course a bit old so the game is no longer supported, so somethings may still be a bit annoying/buggy like for example the "zoom out while ADS(aiming down sight)" which can be annoying. But overall its fairly balanced(except for the OP Saiga 12). So i'd suggest you get the game, either if its on Steam or Origin. I'd recommend Origin since its cheaper there(price depends on where you live, for example in Norway its cheaper on Origin and more expensive on Steam, but its the same price on both Steam and Origin in the US).","November 26, 2013","true","51.0"," 216 of 241 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","216","241","0","11"

Whereas CoD has you sprinting off by yourself, drop-shotting, and camping with some twitch-shoot mechanics. Battlefield encompasses the features that made people play First Person Shooters to begin with -- the feeling of being in a battle. Several factors contribute to this. The graphics are not the best out there, but they're very solid, much better than the first Bad Company which suffered from a grainy effect and low view-distance. Atmospheric effects (sand, debris, smoke) are done brilliantly and are wonderfully varying. One second you can looking down your scope in the desert and see everything laid out clearly. The next, looking in the same exact spot, your vision can be distorted by a rogue burst of wind and sand. The sound quality is even better, arguably unrivaled in gaming. Distant sound occurs a second or two after the event, giving the impression of a larger battle.\nThe campaign is about standard for modern FPSs, which is why I didn't go into detail, but the multiplayer has no equals -- Bad Company really is in its own category.","January 4, 2015","true","364.4"," 81 of 91 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","81","91","3","0"

I love Vietnam War movies, games and music and this game just happens to have a Vietnam War expansion pack. It really nails the expansion too. The weapons, the scenarios, maps, music, vehicles...it's all so very well done. The expansion pack is multiplayer only and it's epic!\n\nSingleplayer campaign is pretty "CoD-like" linear most of the time.  There are some sandboxy areas but for the most of time it's your simple corridor shooter.\nMake no mistake tho, the campaign is very enjoyable. It's not a serious shooter. It has a bunch of good humour in it, fantastic characters, pwetty graphiczzz and a vast variety of locations: deserts, snowy areas and jungles - I love me some jungles and xmas areas, man.\nIt's about 8 hours long. Nothing special...no replay value, really. But it is fun for what it is and i guess you could go and replay it just for the heck of it.\n\nThe Multiplayer is why people play Battlefield. Battlefield used to be a multiplayer only game. The first time it had a singleplayer campaign was back in 2007 in Battlefield: Bad Company. That game is a console exclusive tho.\nSo this is actually the first Battlefield game that features a singleplayer campaign on the PC Entertainment System.\n\nMultiplayer is just awesome. Everything can be destroyed. Now don't get me wrong, i do love me some BF3 and BF4. I don't hate on them like other "hardcore" Battlefield fans. The hate is childish and quite ignorant to be honest. Nothing wrong with Battlefield 4 (it had a bad launch but it's OK now) and Battlefield 3...nothing bad to say about that game...but back to the point: Bad Company 2 lets you blow up everything! In later BFs you can only blow up certain walls or buildings. In here there's no boundaries!\nBlow up trees, blow up houses, blow boats, blow up water...explosion! EXPLOSION! EXPLOSIOONN!! EXPLOSIOOOOOOONNNNNN!!!!\nPROMOTEEEEEEED!!!!!\nKhm, as i was saying, the multiplayer is quite fun. Especially epic with friends but you can do very well when playing alone too.\nJust like in singleplayer, there are quite a good variety of locations: jungles, forests, xmas, deserts, plain fields. + The Vietnam expansion which adds A LOT to the epicness. Feels like a totally new game.\n32v32 player multiplayer, 5 people squads - Lots of shooting going on, lots of explosions, lots of raging.\n4 different classes: revive/heal your teammates, give them ammo or bring down tanks by yourself - Teamwork is rewarded. Don't ignore your teams needs...or ignore them. I'm not your daddy and you're a free kiddo. Do whatever you want in this virtual world of ours.\n\nBattlefield: Bad Company 2 is worth every single penny. If you're looking for a massive multiplayer game where you could destroy everything you see...man, look no further!","December 28, 2014","true","101.5"," 47 of 52 people (90%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","90","47","52","12","4"

This battlefield was made right before DICE become money hungry s***heads. This battlefield had a ton of work put into it and meaningfull DLC. All the guns are balanced except for the M60, but that made it all the more better. Maps that would take you on a journey or tell a story. A singleplayer campaign that felt more like an Indiana Jones movie, or singleplayer maps that were so huge, you could free roam forever. Not to mention that everything can be completely obliterated. Quick loading screens and can quickly play another game without having to join another server or wait a ridiculous amount of time.

(usually 500+ people online in day time)\nreally addicting and a really good game, environment and the atmosphere of this game is astonishing, the maps are the best from small close quarter maps to big huge fields with tanks and helicopters, and especially the snow maps, they are my favorite beacuse the winter theme in a battlefield game adds a lot into it and makes it feel so good, the frostbite 1 engine is really good, game destruction is top notch, when you play online, every map has something that can be destroyed and collapsed, and after 5 years game is still having people playing it, the game has something really powerful in it, if you play it, it just feels like battlefield, no nonsene hardline or battlefield 4 sh*t, the game game is entirely focused on the gameplay, and doesn't have any sh*tty battlepacks, millions of weapon attachments and skins that doesn't add anything good to the game, it really feels like a war game its 50% of causality and 50% of realism meaning the game is balanced imo, it's not exactly a complete casual shooter nor it's a simulation shooter which is perfect and how every game should be so it won't get boring, and rush game mode is the best, not a single rush game mode has been this good since bad company 2, but hey maybe it's just me. i just really like to play the game, and will play it until maybe one day Dice and Ea gets their sh*t together and actually makes another good battlefield, makes a game that their fans want and make it the way people want it, not with their own way with unenessecary dlc, premiums etc and just actually focus making the game, take their time and years to make a good game, not pull out a new game from their asses every year and charge us with extra dlc and premiums, what older battlefields never had, only dlc bad company 2 had was vietnam and was the best dlc ever, again amazing maps and a really good environment, weapons, vehicles. but yet again, i am a person and that is just my opinion maybe others have different thoughts about the battlefield franchise but i just think that the franchise will die if ea will go on like this. i just really miss the old battlefields where battlefield games actually were enjoyable. and if you have the money then buy the bad company right now, before it's too late. i rate this game 10/10 and this is not a generic 10/10 joke because i actually mean it, just deserves it, everytime i play the newer battlefields i will always end my day playing bad company 2 because it's just simply that good, you have to try this game and keep the community alive people! plus you don't need a beast of a pc to play the game. i really hope to see a similar game like that. if any of you dice people are reading this please listen to the community feedback, okay?\n\nPS\nthe only thing that bothers me in this game you can't do "W+A" OR "W+D" Sprinting and you can't go prone that's it all the rest is perfection in this game. and i really hope to see another game like battlefield bad company 2 was.","August 13, 2015","true","47.7"," 24 of 27 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","24","27","2","2"

DLC felt like another game (even tho it is poorly balanced)\n+Good map design, dedicated rush/conquest maps\n+Gamemodes that make sense: Conquest, Rush, Deathmatch & SQrush. Each of them aiming at another playstyle / skill level\n+Not so many 'fire and forget' & lock-on weapons\n+Immersive sound from both map/game/players\n+Personality: Map progression in rush and characters.\n+Destruction that matters, unlike in BF3&BF4 you can basically destroy everything\n+Funny physics: ragdolls all over\n+Vehicles that take skill to master and to take down\n\n\n-10Tick, so once again pretty bad hitreg.\n-Basically no recoil on most guns, or easy to control. Which turns some 1v1 fights in sprayfests.\n-Like every Battlefield this game has some balance issues with guns like the mg36, shotgun slugs and explosive perks for rocket launchers\n-Community can either be the best one or the worst one ever (rocketspam/noobtubes/lame gameplay/whining)\n-Badmins: good players arent welcome anymore, you get banned if you win vs admins or if you just play on a level above the casual players.\n-Graphics are kinda outdated by now but still glorious on high settings. however, low graphics settings gives advantages such as looking through textures.\n-Obviously no more DICE support","December 21, 2014","true","103.7"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","20","21","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/h0lyheretic/recommended/24960/","h0lyheretic","HolyHeretic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/h0lyheretic/","209 products in account","tl;dr: HIGHLY reccommend getting this game. Ignoring the mediocre campaign and occasional server frustrations, this is probably the best fps I've ever played.\n\nEven though I moved to a rural area and can no longer play it's muliplayer, I still regard this game very highly. If you have the money to spare, I can almost guarantee that you won't be disappointed. I have no idea what the servers are like these days, but back when I played it, the minor hiccup with the punkbuster service was overshadowed by the dedicated server support. Even the campaign is a fun playthrough for the first couple of times.\n\nWhat it does right: Where to begin. This is what an fps should feel like. The guns are satisfying to shoot, and kills are an amazing gratification in multiplayer. Everything is smooth and works well, with nothing seeming out of balance if you know which situation to use it in. The massive maps and inclusion of vehicles pretty much necessitates that every match of conquest or mcom needs to be a team effort, and makes this easy with the squad system. The endless unlocks and medals in the multiplayer ensure you always have a goal to work for, and make sure you never stick with one playstyle long enough to get bored with it.\n\nThe multiplayer was the most fun I think I've ever had with an fps. The maps are always just the right size to ensure that you can't miss out on the action if there's a full lineup on the server, and with all the variables on each map there's never a dull moment, and every match is a different experience.\n\nMoving away from multiplayer, the singleplayer campaign was surprisingly enjoyable as well. The typical 'russians invading the world' plot bores me to death, but with the likeable characters at the forefront, and throwing out the traditional sense of taking everything way too seriously, this campaign was much more enjoyable than others of the same type. Most COD or even later battlefield games just take themselves too seriously, and the constant quips from the characters and such make it so that's never a problem.\n\nWhat it does wrong: EA has never been very good at dealing with customers, and the punkbuster service is no exception. Not only is it an extra account that has to be logged into every time you want to play multiplayer, but sometimes it doesn't even work for multiple attemtps. It can get really frustrating when I just want to play the game. I've heard it was to curb piracy and hacking in the game, but all it really does is inconvenience the actual paying customers. It wasn't a good design choice, especially if EA stops checking up on the servers entirely. I would hate to see an entire game broken because of the lack of consideration by the publisher, but with who we're talking about, it wouldn't be surprising.\n\nAnother complaint might be the campaign. I know I said it was good, but especially on later playthroughs it can get really repetitive at times. The varied locations are nice, but there's really no reason to play through the campaign to find intel or something once you've beaten it once. This game really shines in the multiplayer, but that doesn't mean some features couldn't have been added to the offline side to make it more enjoyable. Like, you know, a skirmish mode to play against bots. That would've been nice. I don't get how earlier games had this, but DICE just decided to stop doing it all of the sudden. It would've been a godsend when the sign in service was acting up.\n\nThe campaign could've done with some weapon customization or unlocks or something to make it worth playing more than once anyway.\n\nSo overall, it's a really great game in the multiplayer side of things, and even still enjoyable in singleplayer. I would definitely recommend that everyone give it a try. It has definitely been one of the best experiences I've had in the gaming world.","November 16, 2014","true","323.9"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","20","22","0","1"

There is lack of customization weapons wise but the gameplay itself very well makes up for it. The multiplayer is so different from Battlefield 3 & 4. This of course very good. If you will be making this purchase I also highly recommend the ''Vietnam'' DLC.\nThis game is still highly active with many people still playing it.\nThere is about 50 Levels to achieve on the multiplayer. The unlocks last til Level 19 and after that it is pretty much even ground. The levels themselves take some time to get to so the game is a time sink and very worth the every dollar/euro/Your local currency. Now let's get to the game itself.\nGraphics are pretty good in my opinion. Do mind the game came out 5 years ago *From time of writing the review* and if you're playing games for graphics it's very much like watching Porn for the story.\nGameplay wise the soldier has some weight when he's running so it doesn't feel like you glide like in Battlefield 3 & 4. There is no health level indicator which is nice for the people that like it.\nCampaign is here too. Pretty good one at that. And then there is Vietnam DLC for the history nut.\n\nTL;DR\nBuy this game it has decent graphics.\nFeels better than the newer counter parts\nYou will most likely spend loads of time on it\nNot dissapointed at all\n\nThank you very much from me.

The game features both a team-based multiplayer mode and a singleplayer campaign. The singleplayer campaign has you playing as Marlowe, a member of an elite American special ops team. You start the game,however playing as Thomas Wyatt, coincidentally also a member of a U.S special ops team,though this time you play back in the WWII era instead of in the future. You start out going on a secret mission to meet up with a Japanese Scientist who wants to defect and claims to have valuable information on a new super weapon. Things quickly go to hell and your entire team is wiped out after the Japanese discover you and proceed to make you bear witness to the test firing of the weapon,killing you and your team.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=562538348\nYou begin the real campaign after that and you start playing as Marlowe,though the campaign is in a futuristic setting now instead of the bleak hell of WWII. The campaign features 13 full levels with each one ranging from 10-20ish minutes to complete,with some more long or difficult missions being around 30-40 minutes at most. For the most part the missions are all quite linear,although they give you open fighting grounds to fill with corpses as you make your way to the objectives.If you came to Bad Co. 2 for a story that would blow your socks off you will be suprisingly (or maybe not suprisingly,depending on how you feel about Battlefield) dissappointed. The story isn't poorly made nor is it poorly done at all really. Problems arise when you have a story that is incredibly average and is only being held up by the unparalleled gunplay. When you get into the thick of fighting it's easy to get lost in the heavy smoke of the fresh gunpowder and the whump of your rifle as you mow down entire squads in your quest to save America from Soviet invasion.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=562508176\nInto the Fire . . . With Some Help\nThe campaign may not be anything special but i'll be damned if this isn't one of the most fun MP modes I have played in quite a while. The destructibility is astoundingly fun to play with and actually has some serious strategic value. Enemy sniper hiding behind a window? 40MM Grenade launcher solves that real quick. Enemy soldiers crossing a bridge into your base? Blow that bridge to hell and back! Being able to just destroy pretty much anything at anytime you want is an incredible idea in both the campaign and the multiplayer. The multiplayer itself consists of 5 different game modes each with varying degrees of difficulty. The first one is Conquest,a mode where each team has a set amount of tickets,dying will of course drop this ticket total by 1 per death,and the goal is to drain the other teams tickets before they drain yours. There are also multiple flags you can hold that will give you a constant ticket drain if you hold the majority. Other than that you just need to kill them faster than they can kill you.The next mode is Rush,a gamemode where you have two teams,attackers and defenders each trying to attack or defend multiple M-COM stations respectively. Attackers are tasked with setting C4 charges on the stations then defending them until they explode. Defenders,of course are charged with defending the stations until they finally bring the attackers' ticket count to zero.After that you have Team Deathmatch which,if you have ever played a multiplayer FPS before, just consists two teams each trying to end the game with the most kills. Next you have squad rush which is just normal rush but with no vehicles,smaller maps,and a max of eight players.Finally there's onslaught,a co-op DLC mode where you try to play against AI and capture flags. Vehicles spawn at certain points and there are multiple levels of difficulty to fight against. Generally all the MP modes seem fairly balanced and there were no glaring problems with the mode that I noticed during regular play. The matchmaking system is completely broken and will either not find you a match,even though plenty are available,or it will put you in a match with just yourself; so make sure you just use server browser.The Multiplayer is what you really would be buying this game for as the campaign was pretty much overlooked due to more people wanting MP than SP.\n\nTL;DRAn excellent game for the price. Astoundingly well done MP component with an overwhelmingly average SP campaign. Solid gunplay and unparalled destructability make this a game you wont want to miss.\n\nIf you enjoyed this writing and want to read more of such reviews,check out my steam curator page at Mudkips Gaming","November 25, 2015","true","23.2"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","14","16","2","0"

I bought this game for almost 5 euros, when Summer Sale 2013 was going on.\nThis game totally gave me another view upon FPS games, concerning graphics, physics, environment and so on. What is unique about this game is what DICE has been developing for good years>FROSTBITE. A cool thing that makes a good interrelation between Cause and Effect(s). Look for some gameplays/playthrough on YouTube, you will get it easy. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVPu0F8kDTM\n\nPro:\n- great environment feeling;\n- teamplay;\n- variety of weapons which you can customize afterwards;\n- variety of vehicles, choppers, tanks- not talking about their particular model of vehicle, but their usage;\n- large maps(it's not a 'cozy's camper paradise'- it just fits to all 4 classes available in the game);\n- again great teamplay courtesy of each classe's duty;\n- great graphics;\n- astonoshing real sound.\n\nCons:\n- can't find any at the moment;\n- just to fill this space, the price should be lowered.\n\nAll in all, I would recommend it to my friends, fact that I already did it. It still diserves attention even if its successors have domninated the FPS games market. I would have played more but, I don't have that much time left for videogames because of school.\n\nIt's a must-have game!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrluchador/recommended/24960/","mrluchador","Chris","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrluchador/","1587 products in account","Where Battlefield 2 was about that slower paced Squad based Teamwork, Battlefield: Bad Company 2 went in the complete opposite direction. Sure if you work as a team you'll overcome and win as you'd expect, but the pace is ramped up and the craziness is all the way up to 11!\n\nThe singleplayer campaign has it's moments, but as with any Battlefield game that has a singleplayer campaign it's not what you'll ultimately be buying the game for. It's the multiplayer - as it should be and as it always should be. Whereas the original Bad Company was tongue-in-cheek and entirely selfaware of how over the top the franchise was at times (as well as the FPS genre in a post-Modern Warfare world), Bad Company 2 tones it down slightly (much to my own personal disappointment).\nI personally didn't mind the Bad Company spinoff from the Battlefield series, it was it's own thing and that was entirely fine with me. However, it appears as if Bad Company 2 is almost ashamed of it's original brother and returns to a more 'grounded' root, and almost tries to ape Call of Duty: Modern Warfare's fast paced Michael Bay OTT action... while keeping a straight face.\nWhich is a shame.\n\nHowever... that's not what you're interested in in this game... to the multiplayer!\n\nThe multiplayer aspect offers you almost everything you'd ask for in a Battlefield game - big maps, crazy weapons, tons of Armor and memorible moments of madness. This was one of the first Battlefield games to really try and push the envelope visually as they ramped up the Frostbite Engine to a whole new level of insanity. I remember feeling 'My PC can actually play this?!' to great surprise and glee too.\nSo don't undersell your PC if you're unsure on the specs. The minimum specs will still give you a good visual experience.\n\nAs for the gameplay, I think this was my favourite. I can't really put my finger on what it was exactly, but everything just seemed to work well together. Teamwork, classes, weapons - land mines. Land Mines. C4. Land mines. Airstrike. Land minds. C4...\nOK, so it's the explosions. Planting landmines, hiding around the corner and giggling like a Japanese schoolgirl as that big burley tank came lumbering around the corner to go down the narrow street time and time again. Yup, it's the land mines.\n\nBuy this game.\nPlant land mines.\nLaugh like Japanese Schoolgirl.","December 27, 2013","true","32.7"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","2"

There is a known issue with this game: EA, upon converting this game to Origin, reused CD keys that paying customers had already been assigned on Steam.  I was effected by this, as were many others (just go through the negative reviews).  I contacted EA four separate times about this issue, and was told that there was nothing they could do.  Mind you, I also have an Origin account on which I have two EA games.  Doesn't matter to them.  This company is absolutely abysmal and I will not be spending money on any game that they have had their hands on or in.

It was really, really hard. The AI seemed too smart, too capable, too deadly. And then, because Windows 7 64-bit was giving me trouble at the time, I downgraded, switched back to good old Vista, and lo and behold, suddenly, I beat the campaign with no issues. Since then, I have played on Windows 7, which has none of the teething problems it used to, and not experienced this problem.\n\nWeird, right?\n\nI have no explanation for this. None whatsoever.\n\nThe campaign is short--you know how people always accuse multiplayer campaigns of being like four hours long? Well, me, I generally play them in two to three times that much. Only a small handful of games have ever proven to me to be super short, and Bad Company 2 is one of them. It's not a particularly well-designed campaign, either. Fun, I guess, but limited.\n\nThe multiplayer was where I spent all my time. Never before or since has a game gripped me as much. I'd be willing to argue it's the best multiplayer in the Battlefield series--it doesn't use that stupid web-based Battlelog like BF3 and BF4 do, after all.\n\nOther than a lack of maps--that were eventually added in, a lack of multiplayer modes (people only ever seem to play Rush or Conquest, a far cry from the dozens of multiplayer modes that ship with other games, like Unreal Tournament or Call of Duty), and a frequent re-use of map assets (which were first seen in BFBC1 and reused in BF3), it's just... the best. It's tweaked right, the classes feel balanced, and the maps themselves are my favorites. I wouldn't say everyone should play this game, but I will say that if you like team-based multiplayer shooters, Battlefield: Bad Company 2 is something you'll enjoy.\n\nThe Vietnam expansion was pretty cool, by the way.","November 26, 2013","true","113.9"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","15","21","0","0"

I wonder...\n\nVery worth it, doesn't use the crappy 'battlefield facebook' system either, uses the classic menu system. It is, by far, the best of the new Battlefield games. Quite different than say the original battlefield games, but in a good way, whilst doing what the newer games are trying to do, but better.\n\nAnd less network lag, so rounds will register more often.

To find out why follow me... I'll be reporting from inside the fight! (Races off towards distant towering explosions erupting over the war-shattered horizon, stubs toe, cries.)\n\nIf you're after single player Bad Company 2 brings some fairly smart level design with a sharp, fairly witty script that approaches like a Shane Black movie. It's not screen-writing brilliance or anything, but it has a far greater sense of fun and playfulness than its increasingly tedious sequels and the latter Call of Duty games. No dark and gritty moping about here, purporting to show the 'horrors' of war whilst quivering with lust over the latest sniper scope attachment, nope. Just four Bro-Force men (or rather three and a mandatory smart-aleck quipping Shane Black staple) taking down the bad guys like out of some Kelly's Heroes meets Commando movie. So yeah, not genius, but fun. Battlefield 3's snooze-inducing 'arty' debriefing scenes framework nearly made me break my nose on the computer desk, so lethargic they made me. I cannot really recall Battlefield 4's at all. Plus the game is a lot less linear than subsequent outings, where you get to use the completely destructible scenery to its fullest advantage to forge new paths in completing a level.\n\n("The stretched twig of peace is at melting point...")\n\nGraphics! Well, they're very nice. Sure, Battlefield 3 & 4 have slightly shinier, more detailed graphics with slightly more convincing character animations and lens flare coo-worthy prettiness. But really, these graphics more than do the job. Dust clouds from descending helicopters, litter blowing in the streets, shockwaves rippling, shrapnel flying through the air... it's all here. And it won't tax your modern day computer too much neither. And there isn't too much going on to distract from the gunplay and everything runs smooth, so you won't be visually overwhelmed whilst trying to pick off the bad guys so much.\n\nAnd this game has the joint best audio of any game ever. The co-achiever of this award goes to The Long Dark, and its tremendously atmospheric sparse soundtrack and wonderful environmental sound. But Bad Company 2 has something magical called 'The War Tapes', activate it and feel like 1990's CNN war correspondent Peter Arnett fired by the NEWS CANNON of an Abraham Tank into the SOUNDS OF A WAR MIXED BY THE DERANGED PHIL SPECTOR HIMSELF. Ahem. Basically it's just a rather fantastic mix of panicky crackling intercom messages, wonderful bass-rumbling cannon fire and the sound of bullets zipping past your ears. You need headphones to really do it justice.\n\n("...people here are very much bursting with war...")\n\nSo, you all know the basics of how it plays, no doubt. But how's the multiplayer? Well, it's the best in the series. This is beautifully balanced shooter created before kill-streak bonuses and landfill-stuffing +0.2% shotgun-accuracy unlocks smothered fun like a big statty-based tidal wave of squinty misery. There's four classes performing the roles of assault, medic, anti-tank and recon sniper. The recon sniper is the smartest tweak of the set, as the game encourages snipers to move closer to the action with such toys as C4 and movement sensors. The game gives them fun close quarter pistols and ways to support the team from the front lines. You can also snipe too, and have fun doing it, but you can no longer prone. This encourages movement, and forces snipers to quit camping and instead rove the buildings of a battlefield, picking off hapless players and then fleeing the area as enraged victims bring the upper floors crashing down upon their noggin.\n\nYes, crashing floors. Practically all the buildings in Bad Company 2 can be blown apart piece by piece until the entire edifice comes a-tumbling down in a avalance of masonry-mayhem. It makes for great tactical play too. Using a grenade launcher to create a new entrance point never gets old, especially if Johnny-Foe is caught on the other side of the impromptu door opening. Yup, by the end of the battle few structures remain unscathed.\n\n("...this very much is a country about to blow up in it's own face."\n\nThe maps are very good, with shout-outs going to Panama Canal, Arica Harbour and Oasis as to my mind the best three. I also have a fondness for the atmospheric snowy levels. The only maps I don't like are Harvest Day and Heavy Metal, which are vehicle dominated. I find it very hard to get a good footing on either of them, and the lack of cover makes trying to get around an abject misery. Not much room for tactical play either. Predictably, they seem to be the most popular on the servers. Gngh and argh.\n\nWhat else? Well, it all seems a bit more fluid and smoother than the latter Battlefields. Wiser and more knowledgable heads might nod knowingly and mutter the words, 'netcode', or something, but I've got no real idea why. All I know is it feels more fun to me. And I guess that's the important thing. SO. If you're itching to buy a military-themed multiplayer shooter with lots of vehicles and explosions and scenes unfolding like the best bits of Apocalypse Now, then get this one. It's pretty much the only one you'll need and is far less depressing than the 'mature' ponderous tosh forced on us nowadays.\n\nIn Summary:\n\nCOMPLETELY BANG! BAD COMPANY 2 IS SO ENTHUSIASTICALLY WAR IT'S BRINGING YOU ANOTHER TEAR ON THE FACE OF THE WORLD'S MOTHER. 9 / 10\n\nP.S: Apologies for the excess of The Day Today references.","May 16","true","6.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

(see my video's)\n\nSome of my thoughts of the game:\n\nTank machine guns can snipe you accross the map.\nSnipers on hills can be seen very easily.\nYou can be flanked and killed very easily.\nTanks have little to no health and die very easily by rockets.\nTank shells are VERY easily avoidable. A tank without a machine gunner is effectively useless.\nSnipers have to be extremely accurate anything other than headshot is a hitmarker.\nFlying a helicopter is like trying to fly a private jet upsidedown in GTA V It's hard as hell.\nHelicopters are like tanks and die REALLY easily.\nJet's don't appear to be present which is sad as they were their in BF:Vietnam and BF:1943\nA bug with the connection with EA will require customized launch options in order to remain connected. EA must fix.\nThe game needs more individual graphic settings apart from "High,Medium,Low"\n\nand one final thing.\nIt needs more new players to allow more balanced gameplay as many of the players present are at level cap and have all the best weapons unlocked.\n\nthe community is alive it only needs a new influx of new players to balance the gameplay.","September 6, 2014","true","6.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It has fully destructible environments and balances enough between fast paced action and using tactics/strategy to accomplish your mission.  Also provides enough option to be a lone wolf or function as part of a squad/team.   Graphics are still really good.  I am able to crank everything up and it doesn't look as shiney as some of the new games with ooooooo' wow factors but still does a great job of creating the environment to play in.   The weapons, vehicles, and soldier classes all offer fun and varieted styles of gameplay, all while being still balanced enough that there isn't any given setup thats OP.\n\nIf you enjoy fast action with some strategy and tactcis, I would 100% recommend this game.     I would pay full price if this exact game was re-released with just a graphics engine update to current standards.

The map design is excellent; it prioritizes fun engagements above all else. Maps are largely built around prefab, destructible, 2-3 floor buildings, which buffer the flow of combat and compartmentalize individual encounters. This means that you can actually breathe and make meaningful decisions in between all of the twitch-based watch-every-corner assaults. You know that segment in every battlefield scene where two soldiers duck behind cover and banter, using the moment of calm to rest and survey their surroundings before leaping back out guns blazing? This game is all about that moment. Front lines move back and forth in a perceivable way, you can get caught in epic holdouts with your squad, and buildings take a LOT of damage before they collapse, with each blown-out wall potentially changing your tactics. And despite how dynamic things get, you never burn out. Because you can breathe.\n\nOh, and there are NO JETS, which means that A) Infantry can meaningfully engage every vehicle, B) no player has to  dedicate themself exclusively to countering air units, C) air units are easy to keep track of, and D) air combat remains cover-based and low-flying. The whole "battlefield" experience is much more tightly woven together as a result.","June 13, 2015","true","167.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Released in 2010, this game still outdoes nearly every single other game out of the Battlefield-series, and nearly no-one knows why.\n\nThe singleplayer is one to be played (though it is a little weird... played it 4 or more times and didn't really understood of what was going on), and the multiplayer has become more than friendly to new players, as there are multiple High-XP-servers on which you can unlock all the weapons within about 3 hours, depending on how you play. You do not need to have Origin started in order to play this game, which is another laaaaarge plus-point.\n\nWith the Vietnam DLC, it brings a more historical touch to the game, sadly without a singleplayer campaign, which I imagine would have been the cherry on top of the cake.\n\nBeing both brutal and atmospheric at once, this game is a must-have for every Battlefield-fan out there, and a game to be played for every non-Battlefield-fan. ;)\n\n\nDid I already mention that Battlefield: Bad Company 2 does not require Origin?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pvtparrot/recommended/24960/","pvtparrot","Pvt. Parrot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pvtparrot/","60 products in account","I bought this game by accident. When it was on 75% sale, I bought 3 or 4 copies of it to resell later for TF2 keys, and then sell them on the steam market for profit (yea, I know that's lame). But instead of buying all of them as gifts, I accidentally bought one copy for myself. And now, when I finally got a new computer and can play it normally, I can say that I don't regret it at all.\nI heard a lot of ♥♥♥♥ about EA and origin, so I didn't expect much from this game, yet it turned out to be really addicting and surprisingly fun.\n\nI'm not going to say too much about the campaign because this game is much more multiplayer-oriented. It's pretty good for getting a grasp on how the game mechanics and weapons work, but I didn't like it TOO much. The plot and characters seem ok, but actual combat is a bit frustrating because your squadmates are downright dumb and you'll  have to kill 90% of the bad guys yourself (another reason for that is that they usually wait for YOU to go first and take all the fire while they sit in some cover). Duh, at least they are immortal, because it would be EXTREMELY frustrating if the game would restart when someone from your squad is killed. And finally - the enemies usually outnumber you by 4-5 times, do the US military commanders really expect THAT much from 4 guys? Unlikely.\n\nThe multiplayer, on the other hand, is really awesome. You'll probably get stomped in the beginning though, because crucial unlocks for your soldier are received after not too much, but noticable playtime - for instance, in the beginning your medic loadout will be MG+pistol, that's all; medkit and defibrillator is easily unlocked later, but still kinda frustrating when your teammates expect you to throw some first aid at them and you, well, CAN'T. That being said, at least most WEAPONS you get at the start are pretty good, most notably sniper rifle and assault rifle.\nThe overall balance is great, no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ specializations (not meaning to start a flame war, but CoD's "martyrdom" comes to mind), no OP weapons (in my opinion; many people seem to hate carl gustav AT, but I have no problem with that), and each of 4 classes can contribute to the team - medic heals and revives, assault can use smoke grenades to cover his teammates and gives ammo boxes, engie repairs tanks and recon, well, can at least spot and throw motion sensors (btw, the spotting mechanic is really good, allows you to communicate with your team + if you're being shot by a camper, instead of frantically trying to write something in chat, you can simply press "q" and your bloodthirsty teammates will kill him).\nVehicles are also great, a tank in skilled hands with an engineer repairing it can be devastating, but can be just as  easily destroyed with some teamwork.\nThe community... Let's just say it's ok, like in any typical multiplayer game. Even then, the chat takes up a small area in the corner of the screen, you can very well ignore it (I haven't met any people who use microphones after 55 hrs of total playtime). But generally most people are willing to cooperate (medics revive and heal when you ask for it, assaults drop ammo boxes etc.).\n\nOverall, this is a great game with a lot of variety, never gets boring and has surprisingly never made me mad even when I got killed a lot. Worth buying, wait for a sale if you don't want to spend too much money on games.","July 28, 2014","true","75.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","5"

You don't need an Origin account to play, there is no Battlefield Premium, free DLC maps, and the best expansion ever: The Vietnam DLC.\n\nI remember playing the beta for Battlefield: Bad Company 2. Upon it's release for Xbox 360, I've put countless hours into multiplayer with my friends and we had a blast throughout all the modes and maps. Bad Company 2 is still well populated on the PC. The single player campaign is alright, but I liked Bad Company 1's campaign more.\n\nThere aren't many cons I can point out about the game.. The Progression system- It takes a bit too long to reach the max rank level 50 in this game, unless you play on modded servers.\nNo Onslaught mode for PC- This coop mode was so fun on the 360. I'm not sure why this mode was not included for PC.\nNow this last one isn't really relevent to the review. No Bad Company 1 port- I liked the original Bad Company just as much, If not, more than Bad Company 2. More classes, classic gold rush, Acta Non Verba, The Legionaire, the humor, golf carts, Serdaristan, and just the classic Bad Company feel. If there is a chance EA can port the first Bad Company to PC, I hope they do it.\n\nBattlefield: Bad Company 2 earns a 9/10. When Bad Company 2 goes on sale, buy it; it's $10\n\nThat's my review for Battlefield: Bad Company 2 and I will see you guys on the next review.

I have written very few reviews on Steam and am not the greatest at them, but here goes.\n\nBattlefield Bad Company Two: I myself have been playing Battlefield since 1942. I own a copy of every battlefield there is. I own physical copies of Battlefied 1942, Vietnam and Modern WArfare (Not the greatest of the series but the first to hit concoles) I also own a copy of Battlefield 3 on Origin ( 4 was a complete joke due to EA forcing Dice to rush the production in under a year, thus I speak not of it).\nBattlefield Bad Company 2 comes with a high reccomendation from myself as a veteran of the series. Coupled with graphics that have aged extremely well over the past 6 years, solid gameplay and amazing destruction for its time. This game offers an experience no other Battlefield has yet to do. With a sound engine that supports 7.1 Surround, graphics that look and still feel real, and large maps with balanced classes and vehicles. This game is still to date my favourite of the series.\nNow for the sad part... Battlefield Bad Company 2 is slowly dieing out. Servers are become ghost towns as players are drawn to the c**p that EA forces its development teams to pump out. I beg this of thee, please purchase this game, come experience it with me, bring back the life that was one so bright, join us in keeping this game aloft in our quest for giant and beyond fun battles. Show EA that a great game does not come from its amount of DLC. But from the love of a lasting community that is will to pay for a single product, and continue to play it even decades after its release. Help us keep this game going, come join us...

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/currencyacquirer/recommended/24960/","currencyacquirer","Kresh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/currencyacquirer/","110 products in account","Battlefield: Bad Company 2 is a first-person game having both single player and multiplayer modes.\n\nIn the campaign you play as 1 of 4 U.S. soldiers and complate missions mainly fighting against Russian forces. Over the course of the game you will shoot shotguns, assault rifles, snipers, man turrets and drive vehicles. Personally the story wasn't that interesting to me, but it got kinda better near the end of it.\n\nMultiplayer has several gamemodes which you can play. The maps are pretty big allowing for not only infantry combat, but also the presence of tanks, helicopters, ATVs and APCs and that differentiates it from other FPS games. You can choose between 4 classes which each specialise in something.\n\nThere are usually a couple of servers with players, but most are empty. Sometimes you will get killed by an Apache while at spawn. Vision on lowest graphics at least is kinda bad and the size of the maps doesn't help at all. You can get killed by a hundred different things and you might not even understand what was going on.\n\nI'd recommend this game if its on sale.","June 2","true","8.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tyrenberg/recommended/24960/","tyrenberg","tyrenberg","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tyrenberg/","106 products in account","Shortly;\nBattlefield Bad Company 2 was over my expectations. Even though my expectations weren't set that high, DICE really delivered yet another solid shooter. It's a great game for anyone who enjoyed the previous Battlefield games.\n\nThe long version;\nIn perspective to the Battlefield series;\n\nI know many people complain about this game, and I've even heard DICE themselves say that it wasn't the best they've created. And on the last point, I need to agree, it's not the best game in the Battlefield series, not according to me. I've been along since the beginning (1942) and played all the games released in the series. The most unappealing to me was the 2142, somehow I couldn't accept the futuristic side of a Battlefield game.\nThat said, Battlefield 2 is to me the best game in the series (Yes, even now with 3 and 4 out.), to me, it was a more ground-breaking game than the rest of the series later have been. But, I shouldn't speak to highly of it, a big part of it now is nostalgia I've got to admit.\n\nSingleplayer;\n\nI played BFBC1 through the main story, and though the missions and all maybe weren't the best. I liked it, it was fun, and for BFBC2 I have to say the same. Note though that it was the characters and the story that sold me into it. If you don't appreciate the humoristic side of it, I don't think it's that much to aim for.\n\nMultiplayer;\n\nHere is where it excels (Remember, I only speak for my opinion.);\n\nI didn't get the chance to play that much multiplayer on BFBC1 so I can't compare it much to that.\nHowever, teaming up with some of your friends and jump into a squad with them, and play tactical (Okay, we didn't take it that serious, but we still teamworked.) I don't see how you can't like it. It's a great FPS, it's a really great FPS. The majority of the maps feels designed with care. The classes are fairly balanced, even though you'll be swearing alot about snipers taking you down a little bit too often. (This of course varied from patch to patch.). And the vehicle play was a treat.\nWith the Frostbite engine, everything looks great.\nThe level and weapons system is neatly created, even though it took almost to fast to unlock all the weapons considering how many levels there were left after having them all. Alternatively, you can see this as maybe there could be some more weapons thrown in the game.\n\nOn the bad side though;\n\nThe team-balance feature didn't really worked as you wanted it too. (Some of the options we're up to the servers admins, but not everything. And besides, it's not like there's always an admin online to help with the issues at hand.) If one team managed to claim a essential capture/spawn-point early in the game, it was not unusual it quickly became a so called base-♥♥♥♥ game. And then you're stuck in the rest of the game at your homebase not daring to even peak around the corner because then you'll get a snipers bullet between your eyes.\nBut find a good server (Or host your own!) and admins can help with this issue, at least a little bit.\nI myself tried to tell my team to give them one of the spawning points if it were my team that had captured them all, to give them a fair chance, and it worked at least sometimes.\n\nI also have to give credits to the server system, it is, according to me even better than the sequel, Battlefield 3.\nI rarely had problem adding servers to my favorites or joining friends in just a click and getting into the same squad as them.\n\nBottom line;\nIf you liked the previous Battlefield games, I don't see why you wouldn't like this one. It's a different feeling sure. But according to me, that difference was a nice change to freshen up the series.\nSometimes I even preferred to boot it up instead of BF3.\nIt's a game I warmly recommend. And there's a numerous ways to experience it, you can play really fast and all-out-action, or you can just lurk around the small ways to find around the enemies trying to take them down one by one, it's really easy to just jump in and press play, for 20 minutes, or 5 hours.","October 18, 2011","true","631.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

It is a direct sequel to Battlefield: Bad Company and is part of the Battlefield game series. The game is primarily a squad-level first-person shooter based in a contemporary modern warfare setting. Additionally, the game includes a single-player campaign, where the player re-assumes the role of Preston Marlowe, the protagonist of the original game. The game's Frostbite 1.5 engine now allows for destructible environments. Multiplayer maps, which allow for five different game modes, contain a wide selection of vehicles, aircraft and emplacements. While Bad Company 2 is primarily a first-person shooter, it follows other games in the series by allowing the player to control certain vehicles, including ATVs, APCs, tanks, and helicopters. On foot, players are given access to a variety of real-world small arms such as assault rifles and machine guns. Players can also jump, crouch, and sprint. Bad Company 2 heavily emphasizes destructible environments. Large sections of most buildings can be destroyed by explosives, and some walls and fences break down under barrages of bullets, with the game's physics engine realistically simulating the destruction. Bad Company 2 features a story-driven single-player campaign. For most of the narrative, the player takes control of Preston Marlowe, one of the members of the titular "Bad Company". Multiplayer is class-based, with four classes: Assault, Engineer, Medic, and Recon. Each class has a variety of unique weapons and equipment, and serves a specific role in combat. There are also some weapons that can be used by any class, such as pistols and shotguns. Each class gains experience and levels up separately. Overall I rate this game a 8/10 although, the campaign may not be the best it's the multiplayer that makes me play this game. After 5 years there are still lots of people playing on the servers and it's very addicting to keep playing until you've got every single unlock in the game. I really recommend this game I am absolutely 100% sure that it will not disappoint you in anyway!.","October 7, 2015","true","99.7"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","9","15","2","0"

There's a lot of hate on this game, but I feel that it is perfect in what it tries to accomplish.  The single player campaign is not meant to be super serious.  The humor makes the story fun and keeps everything light.  The tone really helps with a sense of comradery and made me feel like one of the company.  The multiplayer began the destructable environment revolution.  It's incredibly fun and super awesome.  You like FPS's?

I moved on to Battlefield. First thing I want to say: this game is fun. The story might be a little chessy, but the mutiplayer what's up. Before I on moved to this game, people say it's hard to drive a helicopter and jet, and heck yes it is. Everytime I try to use it, I always end up crashing and fliping side ways. The mutiplayer maps of this game are BIG, and they have vehicles.. It's something CoD should have done, but they've move on with the money road now.\n\nThe campaign isn't bad. It's actually good. I just didn't feel emotions within the characters. But that's not all to say, they do have a couple of humor dialog into this as well, and it is funny. The Vietnam pack is fun aswell, of course you don't have some equipments that the modern Bad Company 2 has, becuase it is set in the 60's. The game is fun for me, and mutiplayer is awesome.\n\nI'm going to give Battlefield: Bad Company 2\n8/10.","December 1, 2013","true","25.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BroadloomAll/recommended/24960/","BroadloomAll","BroadloomPie687","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BroadloomAll/","530 products in account","Bad Company 2 is a first person shooter game created by DICE and published by EA in 2010. The game features both a team-based multiplayer mode and a singleplayer campaign. The singleplayer campaign has you playing as Marlowe, a member of an elite American special ops team. You start the game,however playing as Thomas Wyatt, coincidentally also a member of a U.S special ops team,though this time you play back in the WWII era instead of in the future. You start out going on a secret mission to meet up with a Japanese Scientist who wants to defect and claims to have valuable information on a new super weapon. Things quickly go to hell and your entire team is wiped out after the Japanese discover you and proceed to make you bear witness to the test firing of the weapon,killing you and your team.\n\nYou begin the real campaign after that and you start playing as Marlowe,though the campaign is in a futuristic setting now instead of the bleak hell of WWII. The campaign features 13 full levels with each one ranging from 10-20ish minutes to complete,with some more long or difficult missions being around 30-40 minutes at most. For the most part the missions are all quite linear,although they give you open fighting grounds to fill with corpses as you make your way to the objectives.If you came to Bad Co. 2 for a story that would blow your socks off you will be suprisingly (or maybe not suprisingly,depending on how you feel about Battlefield) dissappointed. The story isn't poorly made nor is it poorly done at all really. Problems arise when you have a story that is incredibly average and is only being held up by the unparalleled gunplay. When you get into the thick of fighting it's easy to get lost in the heavy smoke of the fresh gunpowder and the whump of your rifle as you mow down entire squads in your quest to save America from Soviet invasion.\n6\nInto the Fire . . . With Some Help\n\nThe campaign may not be anything special but i'll be damned if this isn't one of the most fun MP modes I have played in quite a while. The destructibility is astoundingly fun to play with and actually has some serious strategic value. Enemy sniper hiding behind a window? 40MM Grenade launcher solves that real quick. Enemy soldiers crossing a bridge into your base? Blow that bridge to hell and back! Being able to just destroy pretty much anything at anytime you want is an incredible idea in both the campaign and the multiplayer. The multiplayer itself consists of 5 different game modes each with varying degrees of difficulty. The first one is Conquest,a mode where each team has a set amount of tickets,dying will of course drop this ticket total by 1 per death,and the goal is to drain the other teams tickets before they drain yours. There are also multiple flags you can hold that will give you a constant ticket drain if you hold the majority. Other than that you just need to kill them faster than they can kill you.The next mode is Rush,a gamemode where you have two teams,attackers and defenders each trying to attack or defend multiple M-COM stations respectively. Attackers are tasked with setting C4 charges on the stations then defending them until they explode. Defenders,of course are charged with defending the stations until they finally bring the attackers' ticket count to zero.After that you have Team Deathmatch which,if you have ever played a multiplayer FPS before, just consists two teams each trying to end the game with the most kills. Next you have squad rush which is just normal rush but with no vehicles,smaller maps,and a max of eight players.Finally there's onslaught,a co-op DLC mode where you try to play against AI and capture flags. Vehicles spawn at certain points and there are multiple levels of difficulty to fight against. Generally all the MP modes seem fairly balanced and there were no glaring problems with the mode that I noticed during regular play. The matchmaking system is completely broken and will either not find you a match,even though plenty are available,or it will put you in a match with just yourself; so make sure you just use server browser.The Multiplayer is what you really would be buying this game for as the campaign was pretty much overlooked due to more people wanting MP than SP.\n","December 31, 2015","true","6.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

I thought it was pretty enjoyable. The gunplay very tight and satisfying, the vehicles fun to drive, and lots of weapons to discover and switch around.\n\nThe COD games and BF games all have the same approach to their single player campaigns where you feel like your hand is being held and you're moving from setpiece to setpiece. Everything is so staged, linear and orchestrated. But as long as you choose to accept that, this game is pretty fun. You can up the difficulty if you feel it's too accomodating.\n\nthe Bad Company games are beloved offshoot of Battlefield because the characters that accompany you during the campaign are fun to listen to, and the story is sometimes funny. I like the idle conversations that take place if you stand around with them, too.\n\nIn short, definitely worth getting for the single player, if you don't mind the "theme park ride" campaign.","October 12, 2015","true","10.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

I like the destruction and even the way you blend in with the environment. You can actually HIDE in a bush and be overlooked. Also, if you run your squad tight and well rounded you can be very effective online. A good squad is very important. I don't like how COD or even some of the other BF games are just "run and gun". No cares given kind of play style. This CAN sometimes happen with this game but seems to be with TDM mainly. Most of the time with this game you need to give your movments a little more thought.

I think they should put a bit more time into developing the Singleplayer, at least as much time as they have spent on the multiplayer.\n\nMultiplayer: It seems to me that the Multiplayer was really worked on in this game because it was more refined and more interesting than the Singleplayer. There is a great variety of weapons and weapon addons in the multiplayer for you to chose from. There are also different classes that focus on your playing style. Suppose you want to kill people with a sniper rifle. You can easily choose the recon class that allows you to have a sniper rifle, a pistol, Mortar strike and a motion censor.You can also add a red dot scope on to your Sniper Rifle for close range combat.

Vehicles such as gunships aren't indestructible, but with teamwork and cooperation (Going solo in a tank or chopper isnt as rewarding as having teammates by your side) , they aren't useless either.\n\nMaps are pretty well designed. Some of the maps for rush could be built better for defending teams (eg taking MCOMs out of destructible buildings) but none will disappoint. Some maps are designed solely for one game mode, while others are made for all game modes. The latter works suprisingly well.\n\nThe game looks fab, and even rivals BF3 in some areas (COLOUR). The destruction in BC2 still stellar and watching buildings topple never gets old. And its more than just eye candy-its always modifying a map, in terms fo where you can/cant go. Its a big part of gameplay.\n\nApart from the single player campaign (which isn't awful, but not amazing either), there's little thats bad about BFBC2.

I think they should put a bit more time into developing the Singleplayer, at least as much time as they have spent on the multiplayer.\n\nMultiplayer: It seems to me that the Multiplayer was really worked on in this game because it was more refined and more interesting than the Singleplayer. There is a great variety of weapons and weapon addons in the multiplayer for you to chose from. There are also different classes that focus on your playing style. Suppose you want to kill people with a sniper rifle. You can easily choose the recon class that allows you to have a sniper rifle, a pistol, Mortar strike and a motion censor.You can also add a red dot scope on to your Sniper Rifle for close range combat.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cosmic_Pretzel/recommended/24960/","Cosmic_Pretzel","Cosmic Pretzel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cosmic_Pretzel/","9 products in account","Developed by DICE, and published by Electronic Arts (EA), Battlefield: Bad Company™ 2 is truly a worthy game of the Battlefield game series. Having played 12 hours without-end already, Ladies & Gentlemen, I present to you my review for Battlefield: Bad Company™ 2.\n\nLet's split this up into "Categories"\n\n1. The Campaign.\nThe Campaign is pretty decent, from start to end. It has a lot of fun experiences and activities, and I'd definitely consider it one worth of the Battlefield series. By far one of the best Campaign-Experiences I've ever had.\n\n2. Multiplayer\nThe Multiplayer on the other hand is 50/50. It's populated, but honestly too much bullsh*t for my taste. The team balance is so "one-sided" it's annoying, honestly I rather play CoD 50% of the time.\n\n3. Graphics & Audio\nThe graphics detail in Bad Company™ 2 are excellent, running on max settings with an AMD Radeon HD 5700 series Graphics Card, the game is beautiful. The audio is excellent as well, the far-distance audio quality to close range, it's amazing.\n\n4. Destructible Environment\nWe all have a dream... And that dream, is to destroy everything we see. Because we can't do it in the real world, why not do it in the virtual world? Battlefield: Bad Company™ 2, as well as it's insanely beautiful graphics, offers a gorgeous destructible environment. Want to hide in a building? Not so fast, soldier. You're not safe. ;-) Explosives such as Grenade Launchers, TNT (C4's) or even Tank Shells, can and will blow buildings open.\n\n5. Weapons\nBattlefield: Bad Company™ 2 provides a healthy arsenal of weaponry, such as Assault Rifles, SMG's, LMG's, Shotguns, and even Snipers. Of course, no game is complete without effective pistols, and RPG's. The weapons are highly effective when used right, it doesn't take 100+ bullets to kill a single man, nor is it always 1-shot like Call of Duty, or Red Orchestra 2.\n\n6. Vehicles\nWe can't simply run around the map, armed with our primary weapons as infantry, right? Of course not! Bad Company™ 2 provides a decent amount of controllable vehicles, such as ATV's, AFV's, to MBT's! Death From Above? Oh it's real. Battlefield: Bad Company™ 2 also comes equipped with Helicopters!\n\n$19.99? Do yourself a favor, and buy this game. You won't regret it.\n\nThank you for reading, and I'll see you on the Battlefield soon.","December 2, 2015","true","163.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

This is my review of Battlefield Bad Company 2!\n\nYou take the roll of Private Preston Marlow. 1 of the 4 guys of the squad Bad Company alongside the pyromania Hags, technerd Sweets and retirement-whining sergeant “Sarge” Redford. But before that, we go back in time during WW2 where you are part of a squad for operation Aurora in October 1944 extracting a Japanese scientist with vital information on a mysterious weapon.\n\nThe game plays like your traditional First Person Shooter(FPS for short) but with a little twist compared to the other shooters, thanks to DICE’s FROSTBITE engine you play in areas where you can literally DESTROY your surroundings (buildings at least but it’s still amazing) there is a big amount of weapons at your disposal as you progress the game, you got your classic Assault Rifles, LMG’s Snipers and Shotgun with regular and explosive ammunition.\n\nThe looks AMAZING, it has aged extremely well and actually stands up pretty good compared to BF3,4 and Hardline and I’ve encountered no bugs or glitches during my playthrough,\n\nThe only complaints I got about the game are the personalities of Marlow and Sarge, Marlow is your generic soldier who doesn’t speak outside of cutscenes and Sarge can be a whiny ♥♥♥♥♥ at times when it comes to his retirement.\n\nThis game is a definite Must for any shooter fan with one of the best campaigns i've played in a shooter","November 23, 2015","true","11.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

It was solid for a game built that was a multiplayer shooter from day one. It's pretty funny and the characters do have a backstory if you played or watched some clips from the first BC installment. It's your usual funny buddy scenario. Four characters with four personalities. You know you can expect some fun!\nThe destruction in the campaign is as great as it is in the multiplayer, thanks to Frostbite. It looks wonderful even on lower details. The only ♥♥♥♥ thing is the amount of bloom sand and snow have in the game. Besides that, everything is spot on! It took me, like the usual, 6-7 hours for the game but without any of the collectables and whatnot. It has a great campaign for what it is; your multiplayer driven shooter.\n\nThe multiplayer is what packs the punch. Servers are still healthy looking even today. As every Battlefield game, it does have it's glorious moments. Wether repair-tooling Recons on Arica Harbor, driving downhill with a tank and losing 40 HP, or getting quad kills with C4 on completely fair and balanced Rush maps. You got your 4 classes with own weapons and gadgets for each situation. Be the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on a hardcore server with Carl Gustav and Explosive MK2, or the 12x .50cal Recon ♥♥♥♥, it's all up to you!\nAll modes are up and running besides Squad Rush. That mode is dead. For the most fun I would recommend Conquest for some big battles, and Rush for some ♥♥♥♥ and giggles. Never play the map Heavy Metal. No one likes that ♥♥♥♥!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cosmic_Pretzel/recommended/24960/","Cosmic_Pretzel","Cosmic Pretzel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cosmic_Pretzel/","9 products in account","Developed by DICE, and published by Electronic Arts (EA), Battlefield: Bad Company™ 2 is truly a worthy game of the Battlefield game series. Having played 12 hours without-end already, Ladies & Gentlemen, I present to you my review for Battlefield: Bad Company™ 2.\n\nLet's split this up into "Categories"\n\n1. The Campaign.\nThe Campaign is pretty decent, from start to end. It has a lot of fun experiences and activities, and I'd definitely consider it one worth of the Battlefield series. By far one of the best Campaign-Experiences I've ever had.\n\n2. Multiplayer\nThe Multiplayer on the other hand is 50/50. It's populated, but honestly too much bullsh*t for my taste. The team balance is so "one-sided" it's annoying, honestly I rather play CoD 50% of the time.\n\n3. Graphics & Audio\nThe graphics detail in Bad Company™ 2 are excellent, running on max settings with an AMD Radeon HD 5700 series Graphics Card, the game is beautiful. The audio is excellent as well, the far-distance audio quality to close range, it's amazing.\n\n4. Destructible Environment\nWe all have a dream... And that dream, is to destroy everything we see. Because we can't do it in the real world, why not do it in the virtual world? Battlefield: Bad Company™ 2, as well as it's insanely beautiful graphics, offers a gorgeous destructible environment. Want to hide in a building? Not so fast, soldier. You're not safe. ;-) Explosives such as Grenade Launchers, TNT (C4's) or even Tank Shells, can and will blow buildings open.\n\n5. Weapons\nBattlefield: Bad Company™ 2 provides a healthy arsenal of weaponry, such as Assault Rifles, SMG's, LMG's, Shotguns, and even Snipers. Of course, no game is complete without effective pistols, and RPG's. The weapons are highly effective when used right, it doesn't take 100+ bullets to kill a single man, nor is it always 1-shot like Call of Duty, or Red Orchestra 2.\n\n6. Vehicles\nWe can't simply run around the map, armed with our primary weapons as infantry, right? Of course not! Bad Company™ 2 provides a decent amount of controllable vehicles, such as ATV's, AFV's, to MBT's! Death From Above? Oh it's real. Battlefield: Bad Company™ 2 also comes equipped with Helicopters!\n\n$19.99? Do yourself a favor, and buy this game. You won't regret it.\n\nThank you for reading, and I'll see you on the Battlefield soon.","December 2, 2015","true","163.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

With huge maps and detructable levels this game can be a blast! Several classes with many weapons and upgrades with an emphasis on vehicles and large battles. I cannot recommend this game enough, by now everyone is playing battlefield 3 and 4 so its not really worth it for multiplayer at this point and the single play is not very good but it has some fun monents but idk why dice even bother with singleplayer in battlefield games because it gets worse everytime lol but the multiplayer is spot on and tons of fun, i will recommend because it is a great game to play with friends or even strangers but at this point i dont think its worth buying since not many people play it anymore and those that do are really really really good with maxed out characters so if you want the battlefield experience then go for battlefield 3 or 4. 8/10","November 15, 2014","true","175.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

And the money for the Game worth it realy, even too for 20€.\nI didn't checked the Single player, because I prefer Multiplayer modus.\nAbout the Multiplayer: The servers are still fresh, alot of players, and over 20 servers 24/7 with 32/32 players.\nI didnt expectet that, so it get's a big Plus on this.\nThe game engine in the Multiplayer is too legendary, you can destroy almost every house, every tree, and the Game still works with high FPS. The keyboard settings are little bit different, like other games. I tryd to set the Keyboard on other keys, but got alot problems, and didn't got it. Also the menu is not flexible.\nThe teamplay is too awesome on this game, not like COD everyone for his owne. Ther is real teamplay on the Battlefield.\nThe register to EA was too very smart, you dont have to run somethink else. Anythink smart and fine, how gamers want it.\nThe level system is extremly slowly, you have to play alot to reach levels, but it's okey. Maybe the weapon system is a bad, you dont have much weapons to choose at the begin, and even after hours. You have to play your classes up, to get weapons for this class only. Ther are too All class weapons, this weapon can be used for everyone's class, so you got a little bit weapon choose. Maybe you get a higher level you got more weapons to choose. The audio is too very good, surround audio works fine, and it sounds like a war.\nMultiplayer servers / players: ★★★★★\nGame Engine: ★★★★★\nGameplay: ★★★★✰\nWeapons / Level system: ★★★★✰\nAudio: ★★★★★\nAlso the game is at all awesome, and worth it to buy!","March 8, 2014","true","32.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Real high replay value aswell, i always come back to the game quite frequent for the amazing multiplayer experience that it has to offer. I highly recommend any FPS fan to get this game, you will not be dissapointed. The game is of course a bit old so the game is no longer supported, so somethings may still be a bit annoying/buggy like for example the "zoom out while ADS(aiming down sight)" which can be annoying. But overall its fairly balanced(except for the OP Saiga 12). So i'd suggest you get the game, either if its on Steam or Origin. I'd recommend Origin since its cheaper there(price depends on where you live, for example in Norway its cheaper on Origin and more expensive on Steam, but its the same price on both Steam and Origin in the US).","January 11, 2014","true","26.5"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

Battlefield: Bad Company 2, is by far the best Battlefield game released thus far. The game continues on from the previous Bad Company title with the same characters and they are just as hilarious and fun to play as they were in the previous Bad Company title. When DICE released the Vietnam addon, the community went crazy because it was just... Something that all Battlefield fans, hell all shooter fans had wanted it for a long time and DICE was happy to deliver.\n\nIf you want a fun story to play, with awesome characters, gorgeous visuals and great Multiplayer, then Battlefield: Bad Company 2 is your game.\n\nNote: As of 3/8/14 the Multiplayer is pretty much dead, which is extremely sad because this game is just amazing in every way however you will occasionally find some fellow players, who love the game just as much as you will.","March 8, 2014","true","1.1"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

I never played BC:2 until now and wasn't sure how it would compare. About 2 minutes into my first game, equipped with the basic M24, I sniped the gunner out of the chopper that was lighting up our team. This is almost an impossible shot when playing BF3/4, in BC:2 it's not quite as 'sim' like and makes it that much more fun. After that I was hooked.\n\nBC:2, as many will tell you, is the last great Battlefield for so many reasons. No more grinding for (or buying $$) the best guns! This game is all about skill, and if you are reasonably experienced with FPS games you will play competitively from level 1.\n\nThis game is so much more balanced than BF3/BF4, and best of all NO Origin! The only DLC you can buy (other than the camo pack) is Vietnam, which I picked up because of the great reviews, but I'd skip it. It's online only and the servers are empty.

The movement is a bit clunky compared to that of bf3 (nothing game breaking), the fov is odd (especially when using iron sights on some weapons such as the AEK), some of the guns seem pretty weak (some of SMGs especially, I'm looking at you M1A1 Thompson) and as with any multiplayer game, especially one that is getting older your options for servers is sometimes limited if you are Australian, or infact, not American (What is so good about hardcore mode dammit). All those complaints mean nothing however as this game is fantastic, better in ways than bf3/4 with better map designs, teamplay and ofcourse Vietnam.

This was the introduction into the Battlefield series for me. Once I played this rendition of Battlefield, I was instantly hooked. BF3, and BF4 are both amazing shooters in their own right, don't get me wrong, however, in my opinion, DICE has yet to match the amazingness that is Bad Company 2. When the Vietnam DLC was realeased for BC2 the game became even more amazing than it already was. How that is even possible, I don't even know. My best memories of a shooter game will definitely involve BC2 Vietnam and the original version of BC2 as well. Vietnam was amazing because of the awesome setting of the DLC (Duh) but also because of the mood the DLC gave off, it seemed just all pure fun and didn't take itself too seriously. One example of that is the music playing when you launch the DLC some awesome classical rock music including, my favorite classical band Creedence Clearwater Revival. Overall I would definitely give this game a 10/10 for an awesome campaign, and just a pure fun multiplayer. I believe whenever DICE decides to make a sequel to BC2 they must do so with care. And remember, to not have the game take itself too seriously and of course, destuction, because what would a Battlfield game be without destruction? Oh, and bringing back Vietnam in the next rendition would be nice too, along with the awesome music! :P","December 4, 2014","true","12.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It was pure fun all along for the 300 hours or more I put into this game. Contrary to a lot of other fps, or any other battlefield game for the matter, I never really felt frustrated playing bad company 2. It was always fun, fast paced and never felt linear. You can see players from across the map if you look carefully and that's something I liked about this game. The maps were nice, not too tight, not too big and all around really well balanced. There was always a lot of action going on too. The squad death match mode was the only squad death match mode in a battlefield game that I ever felt was balanced and fun. I played other battlefield games before that and Battlefield 3 and 4, both for more than 300 hours, and I can tell you BC2 Fun Factor was off the charts compared to those other titles.\n\nHope DICE comes out with another gem like this in a near future.","June 27, 2014","true","200.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Running around a cornor killing a sniper with your squadmates distract him. That is what makes it good. BUT!. conquest is terrible. Never in my whole life have i been spawn killed that much. Once, i actually started death. And i fell like every time i spawn i instantly run for cover under enemy sniper fire. Thats my second issiue, when the enemy have a desent sniper or two, your entire team are useless, the so called kill cam, dosen't help at all. When it only shows his head and some grass. Now i don't say that the multiplayer is bad, i'm just saing that the snipers are a bit overpowered. MW2 intervension + stoping power + FMJ overpowered.\nI'll give the multiplayer a 5/10\n\nThe game mechanics are great. Nothing else.\nI'll give the game mechanics a 9/10\n\nFinal opinion\nThis is a good game overall. Sadly it falls a bit short (mainly because a sniper just put a bullet in its knee). The game has its moments but there is far to long in between.\nMy final verdic is a 7/10\n\nLet me know if you found it usefull in your purchase or cancelled purchase.","March 19, 2014","true","14.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Battlefield: Bad Company 2 has it all.\nGameplay\n9\nAt times, it feels like there are some frustrating balance issues. But those are few and far between. Bad Company 2 is a fantastic game to pick up and go to town with. You'll find glee in causing buildings to crumble around you, planting that charge of C4 on a tank and blowing it up, nailing that perfect headshot from across the map. However, where Bad Company 2 really shines is when you log on with some friends and get coordinated. Communicate and work together to outgun, outflank, and outdo the enemy team.\nStory\n4\nI'll be honest with you. If you are playing Battlefield games for the story, you're going to be really, really disappointed. While there is a storymode here, it honestly isn't worth much of your time except as a glorified tutorial. The characters do give a few good laughs though.\nMultiplayer\n10\nAs mentioned earlier, Bad Company 2 really shines when you play with friends, but even alone you're going to have a blast with this one. Hours and hours of fun and destruction await you, with several different modes of multiplayer available to choose from. Be warned though, if you join up this late in the game you're going to face some very, very good long-time players.\nReplayability\n9\nYou're going to keep coming back to this one. The peak of the Battlefield series so far, it never gets old racing out of a building as it crumbles around you, covering your team on a withdrawal from an overrun area, or being at the front of a charge to capture a point. Don't miss out on one of the most enjoyable Battlefield experiences yet. The only struggle here is that most your friends will probably have moved on to the new battlefields.\nOverall\n9.2/10\nThough not as popular as it once was (due to the new battlefields) Bad Company 2 still stands at the top of the Battlefield mountain. The Frostbite engine really shines in this iteration. Multiplayer is fast-paced, brutal, and spectacularly fun. Don't like those trees? Mow them down with your LMG. Don't like that building? Blow it up. Your team being overrun? Call in an artillery strike and give them some relief. All in all, an absolute must have for any Battlefield fan.","April 20, 2015","true","9.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The downfall to the game is that it has a swearing problem and drops the F- Word alot. If that kind of stuff doesn't bother you, then you might find it kind of humorous to play with other American teammates in game. The achievements in game are fun to get and sometimes a real challenge. The secret to ranking up fast is getting stars for weapons. To get stars fast you can find a pistol only server or just play each weapon till you get a gold star for each. Its a great game and a hard game to put down when starting.

The movement is a bit clunky compared to that of bf3 (nothing game breaking), the fov is odd (especially when using iron sights on some weapons such as the AEK), some of the guns seem pretty weak (some of SMGs especially, I'm looking at you M1A1 Thompson) and as with any multiplayer game, especially one that is getting older your options for servers is sometimes limited if you are Australian, or infact, not American (What is so good about hardcore mode dammit). All those complaints mean nothing however as this game is fantastic, better in ways than bf3/4 with better map designs, teamplay and ofcourse Vietnam. Great game must play.","December 26, 2014","true","124.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But with all EA titles... there are kickers that will make you think twice.\n\nThe game is the best when you look at it from a technical standpoint. Blow up cover that enemies might be hiding behind... that has to be the most satisfying thing to do. No more camping is to be seen when the whole building is gone.\n\nAs the game progressed through it's cycle, it seems to be left in a buggy state. Almost by reason. Fences and grass can be seen in houses, coming out of the floor. After countless hours, I had only found this later on. Maybe a new title had something to do with it?\n\nNo real point in getting the game. Just like Nuclear Dawn, the game has come and gone. There's no real community, it's moved on to BF3, now BF4. Look at this game as a collector's item, nothing more. Story for single player isn't worth the time. Quick and painless, get's you ready for multiplayer which no longer exists.\n\n7.5/10","November 27, 2013","true","110.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Skullboy99/recommended/24960/","Skullboy99","Skullboy99","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Skullboy99/","99 products in account","Battlefield, probably one of the best multiplayer games out there. I remember playing Battlefield 1943 on the Xbox 360, thinking that Dice had to make more games like this. and they Did. and they are all great! I also like Battlefield 3/4, But I personally think that BF 3/4 and BF: BC2 is good in their own ways.\n\nBattlefield 3/4's multiplayer is all about the Big wars, 64 players. The feeling of running in Huge maps with 63 other players, hearing jets and choppers fly near, hearing gunshots and explosions all around you, is such a great thrilling experience. You feel like you are in an actual war, unlike COD for an example, where its only like 12 players in a small map.\n\nBattlefield Bad Company 2's Multiplayer is pretty much the same, except with 32 players, and its not as hectic as BF 3/4, but its still fun, and you still get that War feeling. and Yes, there are still lots of people playing this game, lots of servers are still full, as of September 2014. Although I dont think Battlefield Vietnam has much players anymore.\n\nThe recommended Gamemode for any of the Battlefield's is Conquest. Conquest is mainly about capturing bases and protecting them from the upcoming enemies and vehicles. Usually the bases are A,B,C,D. It is possible to kill people, not everyone is hard, so you dont have to worry about being a newbie. There are a couple of classes to choose, on BF: BC2, I like the Medic, mainly because of his huge Badass guns, but for games like BF 3/4, I use the Engineer, since there is always tanks roaming around on those games.\n\nThere is a Singleplayer story for all the Battlefield's of course, and Probably Bad Company 2's Campaign is the best, because Comedy plus War is a pretty great combination.\n\nOverall, its Battlefield, if you had second thoughts about getting this game, Dont, JUST GET IT! ITS A GREAT GAME AND YOU WONT REGRET GETTING IT! 10/10","September 14, 2014","true","13.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

If you don't have a good team and they don't know how to back each other up then don't plan on winning alot of games. Its a great game with awesome special effects. The downfall to the game is that it has a swearing problem and drops the F- Word alot. If that kind of stuff doesn't bother you, then you might find it kind of humorous to play with other American teammates in game. The achievements in game are fun to get and sometimes a real challenge. The secret to ranking up fast is getting stars for weapons. To get stars fast you can find a pistol only server or just play each weapon till you get a gold star for each. Its a great game and a hard game to put down when starting.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Skullboy99/recommended/24960/","Skullboy99","Skullboy99","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Skullboy99/","99 products in account","Battlefield, probably one of the best multiplayer games out there. I remember playing Battlefield 1943 on the Xbox 360, thinking that Dice had to make more games like this. and they Did. and they are all great! I also like Battlefield 3/4, But I personally think that BF 3/4 and BF: BC2 is good in their own ways.\n\nBattlefield 3/4's multiplayer is all about the Big wars, 64 players. The feeling of running in Huge maps with 63 other players, hearing jets and choppers fly near, hearing gunshots and explosions all around you, is such a great thrilling experience. You feel like you are in an actual war, unlike COD for an example, where its only like 12 players in a small map.\n\nBattlefield Bad Company 2's Multiplayer is pretty much the same, except with 32 players, and its not as hectic as BF 3/4, but its still fun, and you still get that War feeling. and Yes, there are still lots of people playing this game, lots of servers are still full, as of September 2014. Although I dont think Battlefield Vietnam has much players anymore.\n\nThe recommended Gamemode for any of the Battlefield's is Conquest. Conquest is mainly about capturing bases and protecting them from the upcoming enemies and vehicles. Usually the bases are A,B,C,D. It is possible to kill people, not everyone is hard, so you dont have to worry about being a newbie. There are a couple of classes to choose, on BF: BC2, I like the Medic, mainly because of his huge Badass guns, but for games like BF 3/4, I use the Engineer, since there is always tanks roaming around on those games.\n\nThere is a Singleplayer story for all the Battlefield's of course, and Probably Bad Company 2's Campaign is the best, because Comedy plus War is a pretty great combination.\n\nOverall, its Battlefield, if you had second thoughts about getting this game, Dont, JUST GET IT! ITS A GREAT GAME AND YOU WONT REGRET GETTING IT! 10/10","September 14, 2014","true","13.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

But is fine once you've gotten used to it.\nClass balance overall is very good as well, you'll find yourself switching kits on a regular basis to help your team depending on the situation, which makes for a lot of variety in gameplay. Vehicles are powerful, (as they should be), but can be taken down with teamwork.\nAs for game modes, I highly suggest you play rush, the maps were designed around this particular gamemode (map design is excellent overall) and flow really well. If you have two decent teams facing off against each other its quite frankly exhilarating to play.\nOverall its the best Battlefield I've played yet!","January 4, 2015","true","126.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Game runs on Frostbite 2.0 engine which features completely destructable buildings unlike the one from BF3. I am not sure how BF4 will perform, but I think that I will stay on this title.

The graphics are beautiful, and the realism is pretty amazing.  This is definitely one of, if not the only, game that I might keep a copy of Windows around to play since Valve ported all the Source engine-based games to Linux.  This any maybe Battlefield 4, if I ever decide to buy it.\n\nThat said, it throws in a touch of RPG, forcing you to play hours and hours of gameplay to "level up" your soldier so you can be competitive in both single-player AND multiplayer games.  If I hadn't pre-ordered it and had it the day it came out, I could have seen myself getting angry about not having the same weapons available to other players, and it did cause me to only ever play Recon class (sniper, basically) because I never had a chance to level any other class up while trying to keep up as the class I really enjoyed best.\n\nIn the end, though, I had a lot of fun playing.","July 26, 2015","true","41.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

If you don't have a good team and they don't know how to back each other up then don't plan on winning alot of games. Its a great game with awesome special effects. The downfall to the game is that it has a swearing problem and drops the F- Word alot. If that kind of stuff doesn't bother you, then you might find it kind of humorous to play with other American teammates in game. The achievements in game are fun to get and sometimes a real challenge. The secret to ranking up fast is getting stars for weapons. To get stars fast you can find a pistol only server or just play each weapon till you get a gold star for each. Its a great game and a hard game to put down when starting.

It was pure fun all along for the 300 hours or more I put into this game. Contrary to a lot of other fps, or any other battlefield game for the matter, I never really felt frustrated playing bad company 2. It was always fun, fast paced and never felt linear. You can see players from across the map if you look carefully and that's something I liked about this game. The maps were nice, not too tight, not too big and all around really well balanced. There was always a lot of action going on too. The squad death match mode was the only squad death match mode in a battlefield game that I ever felt was balanced and fun. I played other battlefield games before that and Battlefield 3 and 4, both for more than 300 hours, and I can tell you BC2 Fun Factor was off the charts compared to those other titles.\n\nHope DICE comes out with another gem like this in a near future.","June 27, 2014","true","200.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Just plain old "run along set path-shoot-run-shoot". In some missions I tried to think creative, like. Maybe i can get a jump on them from that ledg- "WHAT ARE YOU DOING, WE HAVE ENEMY MORTARS POINTING AT YOU". That killed it for me. The Lush jungle were i would have loved to attack from above, or the city were i tried to flank a maschinegun.\nI'll give the campaign a 6/10\n\nThe multiplayer was interesting, squad teamdeathmatch (or something like that) was great, same goes for rush. Running around a cornor killing a sniper with your squadmates distract him. That is what makes it good. BUT!. conquest is terrible. Never in my whole life have i been spawn killed that much. Once, i actually started death. And i fell like every time i spawn i instantly run for cover under enemy sniper fire. Thats my second issiue, when the enemy have a desent sniper or two, your entire team are useless, the so called kill cam, dosen't help at all. When it only shows his head and some grass. Now i don't say that the multiplayer is bad, i'm just saing that the snipers are a bit overpowered. MW2 intervension + stoping power + FMJ overpowered.\nI'll give the multiplayer a 5/10\n\nThe game mechanics are great. Nothing else.\nI'll give the game mechanics a 9/10\n\nFinal opinion\nThis is a good game overall. Sadly it falls a bit short (mainly because a sniper just put a bullet in its knee). The game has its moments but there is far to long in between.\nMy final verdic is a 7/10\n\nLet me know if you found it usefull in your purchase or cancelled purchase.","March 19, 2014","true","14.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The single player story line is okay but only lasts about 6 too 8 hours the first time through. Multiplayer is where this game really shines with huge battles consisting of over 30 players you can blow the crap out of each other in four different game modes on a slurry of maps. Hardly anyone uses a mic so don't expect much co-operation from your team-mates though unless you're part of a clan or guild. I've logged far more hours on this game then any other and paid the full price of 60 dollars when it came out, completely worth it. Since then I've bought five additional copies ranging in price from 6.80 to 60.00 dollars for friends and family. It now retails for about 20.00 dollars and is completely worth it. Battlefield 3 will be coming out soon though so keep that in mind (if it's not already that is).","June 21, 2011","true","362.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If your computer can handle the graphics (they're intense) than you will not be disappointed. Although some may prefer the mindless fast-paced killing that exists in the Call of Duty Modern Warfare franchise, I find that this game provides a much more fulfilling experience. It requires more skill and foresight to fully enjoy, but if you are willing to put the time and effort (it takes patience - not running and gunning) into learning how to play you will appreciate the difference in gameplay and style. Although there is a single-player campaign, this game is primarily a multiplayer game. The single player campaign is mediocre but enjoyable (nothing like COD's excitement) but the multiplayer is where the game really shines. The fully destructible environments create an experience where every match can be different and you can surprise your opponents at the flip of a coin. 10/10 stars.","May 24, 2011","true","227.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I sense that you're evil presence has set it's eye on the Bad Company games, as they are SOOO much more fun to play than flipin Hardline, or even BF4. Please don't try to kill this. I will never buy a game because the publisher used it to replace something they didn't want people sticking to because they know it's not borderline broken, and arguably more fun.\nI also have nothing against DICE. Just felt like I'd say that, but the only thing that's wrong with them is that they've unfourtunatley become a corporate pawn for EA, just like visceral and bioware.

There are 2 major down sides to this game and the rest is basically great. The biggest issue for me would be the lack of online players. It has been 5 years since the game has launched so the loss of the community is no suprize, but it's still a con. Another one would be it's optimization. From what I have noticed is my game gets a constant 10fps on minimum graphics with a GTX 750ti, now this is the first 20 minutes after starting the game up. After this point the game gets 60fps fine on max graphics. I don't know why this happens, but it does. Of course now for the pros right. Well I find it hard to specify specific parts of the game that make it as good as it is. The driving and shooting fell good with little to no aim assist. The campaign is pretty well put together and has some weird glitches starting and finishing a cutscene, but nothing gamebreaking. The actual campaing has 2 main areas a snow desert and a jungle which both look very well for 2010. The Jungle reminds me of Halo 3 the mission sierra 117 persoanlly. The button layout isn't ideal at start, but you can configure that so who cares. I do reccomend playing with atleast 1 friend because then you can play on a serrver alone with your friend/friends. This can be a lot of fun and will allow you to do fun glitches or just d**king around. I reccomend this game if you enjoy the battlefield series, have a group of friends that will play with you, and for nistolgia of course.","November 26, 2015","true","10.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"
