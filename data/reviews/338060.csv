If you want to play Riichi Mahjong on your PC/Steam then this is the game, and the ONLY game to get. (You can get the Japanese tenhou client and play mahjong on your PC that way but... tenhou requires some work the complex UI can be intimidating as everything is in Japanese and is filled with bots, its mainly for and used by the Japanese and Chinese community)\n\nIf you're expecting something fancy then you've come to wrong place. The translation is absolutely horrible, nothing makes sense in English, I've just turned the UI into Japanese because now I'm not going get annoyed from the engirishi.\n\nThe feel of the actual play, the game play is nice, it’s what to be expected from a Mahjong game released on Steam by one of the big Japanese companies, it’s just very sad that the game is singe-player only and there are no current talks or plans for online support.\n\nWith all that said the game supports a huge roaster of characters, you only have 4 unlocks at first the rest are unlocked by your progression. Hm… well yeah that’s sums it up I guess, worth mentioning that some users are reporting issues with the game (crashes, missing graphical objects) you might want to wait before making a purchase although it seems the developer of the game is active on the Steam forums so I guess they're on it and chances are these issues are going to handled quite nicely.\n\nUPDATE:  http://steamcommunity.com/games/338060/announcements/detail/243527024526691800\n\nRunning on Win7 64bit 8Gb Ram 1600X900 5850HD Graphics.\n\nEDIT: A lot of people seem to be confused on what this game actually is, there are no hot anime chicks in this game, you don't talk to anyone, they don't say anything, its JUST Mahjong. With the addition of anime cardboard box cutouts as your opponents whom are almost NEVER ON SCREEN. (They show up to say Pon ,Ron, Kan, Chi, for a MICRO SECOND during the game, you're also shown the cardboard box image of the winning character at the after game score screen)\n\nI would personally give this game a +12 rating for its sexually? suggesting cardboard box cutout anime girls, that's it, it wouldn't even qualify for a +15 rating.\n\nPS. If you’re interested in learning Riichi Mahjong I highly recommend you to watch this 4 part series.\n\nI’ll put the link for the first part here.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh0brmqq4sk\n\nEnjoy\n\nYou better look and memorize these as well.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_Mahjong_yaku","January 21, 2015","true","23.4"," 440 of 483 people (91%) found this review helpful 35 people found this review funny","91","440","483","35","15"

Also, different voices!\n\nNeutral Remarks:\n- Only those who already know at least the basic rules of Japanese mahjong can play this game, yet it still translates some of the terms these players should be familiar with into English which IMO puts me off. ALTHOUGH the translations of the winning configurations (yaku) are welcome.\nExamples:\nCall → Riichi\nPung → Pon\nChow → Chi\nWin (appears if you draw the tile) → Agari/Tsumo\nAlso the names for Mangan, Haneman, etc.\n\n\nCons:\n- No multiplayer! ← EMPHASIS ON THIS!\n- The interface itself is clunky and not smooth as compared to other games.\n- It's missing a lot of features already present in other games (albeit those games are in Japanese):\nShowing what tiles you're going to win with\nIdentifying if a person's tiles are discarded right after draw (tsumogiri)\n\n\nEssentially, the game is single player mahjong on a PC platform. I don't know about you, but for me playing against CPUs gets considerable boring over time. If you want to practice playing, I guess you could buy this game, but in terms of features, it is a bit pricey (considering there are free web versions of this).\n\nAll in all, this feels like an old Japanese mahjong game that has just been ported to Steam. It's lacking features for its price.\n\nIf you're a veteran: just stick with web clients like Tenhou.\nIf you're trying to get into this game: I would also recommend the above as you'll probably improve more playing elsewhere.","January 22, 2015","false","2.8"," 53 of 72 people (74%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","74","53","72","4","0"

However, I cannot recommend this game unless you already have at least a basic understanding of how to play the game - because this game just dumps you in there like a crazed scout leader, and if you don't know what you're doing, you'll lose quickly before you figure out how to play.\n\nThe game does toss you a few life-rings here and there, however. It will prompt you if you can call to pick up, or declare preparedness (it makes sense in context), and it will auto-sort. It won't let you move the cards around manually though - most won't mind that, but I, and the guy from Hong Kong who taught me how to play, often depend on doing that, so yeah...\n\nThe rules are actually extremely varied too - you can set all sorts of rules, such as your starting bank, what bonus cards are active, and even certain melds and hands. For a simple execution, it's very detailed in its guts.\n\nThe camera angle is stupid - set it to over-head or you'll miss what's being discarded - also, you can't ever see the whole table, so you need to move it around - it's not difficult, but it's very annoying to have to continuously do\n\nAnd yeah, the boobs. ...If the reason you're buying this is to look lewdly at girls, I'd recommend getting something different.

It is a port of the best android riichi mahjong game (trust me I have played every android mahjong game), "Nagomi Mahjong," but it has kawaii girl-chans added in. Fair AI, there are about 20 characters with different AI but you must unlock the characters. Progression is good, it is not a grindfest for unlocks like other Japanese games (eg. get 1st 3 or 5 times with character).\n\nIn the bundle the two games are exactly the same except for the characters, however the schoolgirls characters are not as good. Still worth getting the bundle.\n\nGame can go up to 1440p but is locked at 20fps. Does not made a difference because the game has no fluid motions. Game is singleplayer-only.

However, I wasn't aware that two versions existed: the solitaire one, which is the version I love, and a sort of poker one, which I don't understand anything despite trying to decypher the rules in the help of the game.\n\nTrue, I could have searched elsewhere but for me, the version presented here isn't interesting me. My brain isn't really strategy-oriented, which is why you don't ask me to play poker or other cards games if you're more interested by winning than to pass a good moment.\n\nMahjong Pretty Girls Battle could have been a good game for me if the rules were clear (they're not well translated) and if there was a real tutorial included. However, I ended up to play by instinct, which reserved sometimes a good suprise but almost all the time, I got defeated by the AI.\n\nI suppose that for anyone used to this version of mahjong, the game is very enjoyable, though your only real visual is a board with the tiles. However, the characters are girls drawed for fanservice: some have big breasts (not really realistic), others are normal.\n\nBesides, the soundtrack isn't remarkable but after a while, you'll get used to girls screaming because they have a winning move and you don't understand how they arrived to that.\n\nMy three hours ingame reflect mainly idling for cards, but I've giving up pretty quickly to try to understand the rules. I'm pretty happy with my solitaire version, which isn't requiring to plan carefully your next move (well, yeah, you have sometimes to plan carefully your move but you don't have adversaries in front of you, ready to take advantage of your discarded tile).\n\nI should probably thumb down the game, however, I will not: the fact that I didn't really enjoy came from my lack of willingness to learn more about this version of Majhong. In that case, I recommend the game only for those that are understanding the rules of it.","March 6","true","3.2"," 22 of 31 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","22","31","2","1"

If I go into the options menu however, I get a DirectX error, and it crashes the game completely. It's still fully playable though, I just can't see what options there are.\n\nIt's four player mahjong, and moves at a satisfyingly fast pace. I say this because a lot of four player mahjong video games are excrutiatingly slow.\n\nThe default setting in this game is for four rounds (east only), rather than the eight (east and south) or sixteen (east, south, west, north) variants you usually get in these games, so games fly by really quickly.\n\nThe sound effects are great, and to summarise, the actual mahjong gameplay part is fun!\n\n---\n\nUnfortunately... there's not much else to say about the game other than things that can be perceived as downsides.\n\n- When you lose, it dumps you back to the title menu.\n\n- When you WIN, it dumps you back to the title menu.\n\n- There's no kind of 'reward art' that tends to be common in these kinds of games.\n\n- There's no character dialogue or in-between-game scenes, just different voices during the mahjong gameplay.\n\n- Characters unlock on an achievement basis, ie. 'Win 100 games!' or 'Win 5 games as this character!' This isn't bad in itself, but when it's the only thing in the game to work towards (getting different voice samples and a character icon), it's not too motivating.\n\n- It's single player only, but honestly, that's usually the norm for these kinds of anime-themed mahjong games... except all the other single player mahjong games usually have a storyline, dialogue, reward art, endings, occasionally heart meters, and so on. This game has none of those.\n\nIn short, it's great for a ten minute burst of polished fast-paced mahjong gameplay, but don't expect anything more than that. There's no goal to aim for other than unlocking all the characters, and those characters are nothing more than a single picture when choosing them on the character select screen, and then you never see them again.\n\nPurely because it's the only way to play mahjong in English on Steam, and the gameplay part is solid, I'm clicking 'Recommended' for this!  But if you are able to play Japanese console games, there are hundreds of better titles out there in this genre.","January 21, 2015","true","1.6"," 44 of 72 people (61%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","61","44","72","3","0"

The girls talk in japanese but they all have 3 or 2 lines total, which gets pretty repetitive and the fact that some of the girls sound pretty annoying too, doesnt help either. The music doesn't really fit the whole game either. Thankfully you can mute every sound or the two individually in the options menu if you want to.\n\nOther "minor" problem with the game is that the translation is pretty bad....yeah...never would have thought that I'm  ever going to mention translation issues in a mahjong game...but on the upside, it can make you chuckle for the first time you read it.\n\nSince there is no multiplayer in the game (Which is a real shame) the only thing you can do is to unluck all the different characters in the game, which is just like unlocking different AI behaviours.\n\nOne last thing I want to mention is that there is no tutorial in the game. So if you are new to mahjong, this isnt where you wanna start getting in to it, or download a manual from the internet before you hop in to the game.\n\n\nOverall, the game lacks originality. The girls it self are nothing more than different AI's with different behaviours. It would have been cool if all the girls would have different special moves like I dont know, switching tiles, super mega lucky draws etc. but no unfortunatelly all you have is a basic mahjong game with anime stickers on it.\n\nAs for do I recommend it or not, well.....it deppends on why do you want to buy it. If you want a solid mahjong game with  some basic anime skin on it, than yes. This game is good to sit down for an hour and play a few rounds than get back to your life.

If you're into riichi mahjong, and you like laughing at bad translation, and you like pretty anime girls, then this is the game for you. It's only worth it for the novelty value. Even the girls themselves are pretty laughable, with their utterly ludicrous outfits, but some of them are kind of charming and the voice acting is... something. Though I find myself wishing that they'd just say 'pon' and 'chi' rather than spitting out the same long line over and over again.\n\nIt's as barebones as it comes. It has a good amount of rule options, but it's just 4-player mahjong with 2, 4, or 8 rounds. Moderately challenging, but that's it. It's completely spartan. Nothing else to it. The only thing that makes it even halfway compelling is the staggering requirement for unlocking characters; you have to place 1st a certain amount of times with the one before them in the column, meaning that overall you have to win something like 84 games to get all the non-goddess characters. The Goddesses themselves are much harder, with one requiring you to win with 20 different types of hands, and one requiring you to place 1st a hundred times, though their offensively absurd skimpy outfits limit their appeal.\n\nOkay, so that doesn't really make it sound very good. Because it isn't. But for all of its bad translation, lack of key features-- yeah, no multiplayer, which makes it utterly pointless as a steam game, /especially/ for the outrageous $15 price tag-- and ridiculous designs, I can't bring myself to hate it. It's just so strange and funny that it's oddly charming. The music's not bad, the art is pretty nice, there's lots of voice acting and what's more, I got a really funny stream out of it. I'm really hoping that this release will pave the way for more mahjong games on steam in the future.\n\nTL;DR: IF YOU LIKE MAHJONG, PRETTY GIRLS, AND BATTLE, AND YOU DON'T MIND IT BEING RATHER SILLY AND LIGHT ON FEATURES, THEN... WAIT UNTIL IT'S ON SALE.","February 17, 2015","true","26.4"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","11","15","2","0"

Unfortunately this is pretty much a tablet/phone app translated to PC and not a whole lot of effort made in the conversion.  If you haven't learned the basics of Mahjong then you're going to be clueless (e.g. Dodger's video on Youtube of this game).  If you have the basics down, you're still kinda playing blind but at least you have an idea of how to win.\n\nFor those who don't know: The game is pretty much like Rummy.  You have to build "melds" that consist of 3 of a kind (Pung), 4 of a kind (Kong) or a run of 3 tiles in sequence (Chow).   So you need 4 sets of melds (Kong, Pung, or Chow) and 1 set of two to win.  The last tile you draw is not discarded and needed to "go out".\n\nYou can take tiles from the person to your left to make a "Chow" meld or you can be take from anyone to make a pung or kong meld.  The other players can do the same (naturally) so you really need to be thinking about what you throw away as much as what you take.  There's also a bonus to be earned from NOT taking any tiles from anyone, winning on a self-drawn tile rather than taking from someone else, and also a bonus if you call "riichi" and then win the hand (it's like throwing an extra 1000 points into the pot saying that you're about to win).\n\nI've probably got some of the rules wrong because I'm not a hardcore player, but if you had no idea how to play and you're reading this, you now at least know a bit more.  I hope you bought the game for the mahjong because the characters are pretty bland.\n\nI learned how to play Mahjong from watching Akagi (an anime) and from playing a few other freebie mahjong games.  While the presentation on this game is better than the freebies in some ways, in other ways it's lacking.\n\nThings that could have made this game better:\nmultiplayer\nmore characters to start with\na basic ruleset to teach beginners\nan advanced tutorial to teach intermediate players\nan interface that does NOT seem like it was made for tablets or phones.\nbetter voice acting/less annoying voice acting.\na slower pace so you can see what's going on (for the beginners)\nTL;DRThat's just a short list of things they could do to improve this.\n\nDon't buy this if you're not a fan of mahjong.  Even if you ARE a fan of Mahjong, you may want to rethink this.","January 23, 2015","false","24.4"," 20 of 34 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","20","34","2","1"

Actually if you are the kind of prude that is ignorant of the fun modern popular 2D culture of Japan's nerds, you are probably already making fun of this game and its players and calling it a hentai without knowing anything about mahjong or etc; so oh well why are you reading this on this store page in the first place?\n\nthis game looks like it is made by/published by the same people that put out "Nagomi Mahjong" on the iOS and android stores (as well as most likely using the same engine).

Putting "Call" instead of "Riichi" (which doesn't really have an English translation, but sounds like "reach") for example, or the Chinese "Chow", "Pung", and "Kong", instead of the more Japanese "Chi", "Pon" and "Kan". It also says "Slam" instead of "Mangan", or any of the other hand value names.\n\nMy favorite feature is that when you have declaired riichi, the game will play itself until someone wins, or the game ends in a draw. Auto-discard is nice and speeds up the endgame. It is also nice that the tiles are big on the screen.\n\nI usually play a free flash game, when I want to play single-player Mahjong, but for $1.50, this was a nice purchase.","October 6, 2015","true","35.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I bought it as a bad joke and wasn't disappointed, but I still need to recommend you save your money.\n\nThis game will help you learn the professional art of "one-handed Mahjong". Yyyeeeeaaahhhh.....\n\nOk so basically this game has like 4-5 normal characters and a lot of chicks who honestly should not be able to stand up with watermelons like that. This game becomes a lot better if you don't take it seriously, think of it as a parody of all those dumb "online strip X-game" things. The art and UI are all really polished and you can tell a lot of effort went into them, regardless of how that effort resulted.\n\nIn terms of actual mahjong the games pretty good. You can alter the rules to the best of my knowledge within most typical variations. The AI takes it's turns very quickly which is good since it makes this game feel more like a small time waster and less like a board game simulator. Note that this uses Japanese mahjong and not solitaire mahjong or Chinese mahjong.","December 31, 2015","false","0.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lovesparkle/recommended/338060/","lovesparkle","LoveSparkle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lovesparkle/","66 products in account","Warning:  This game is simply Mahjong vs bots, who kind of gang up you as a way to compensate for average AI.  There is no multiplayer mode nor is there a tutorial in the game.\n\nHowever, if you are looking to practice the game, and learn about Mahjong or just play a casual game vs the comp this is fantastic, if you know the rules.  I am a novice at Mahjong, and pretty much keep a list of the "yaku" or qualifying hand types.  It will help you out drastically.  Think gin rummy but your hand has to have a "theme" or "role" to it.  Again there is no tutorial.  You just gotta learn them.\n\nSome of the girls voices, are downright annoying, and you either got A cup Lolis or JJ cup monster shirts.  But in reality, you really don't see the girls very much inside the game, as much as HEAR them when they make a call.  But some of the girls just scream everything.  Sucks when the random challengers game puts them into your match.\n\nGame has been on sale for up to 90% off (1.49$).  At this price it's an absolute steal.  I think I paid 80% off in Autumn Sale and felt like I was committing theft.  However at full price, you will feel cheated.  This game is missing quite a lot for the normal 15$ price tag it requests.\n\nGreat companion to people who want to get into Mahjong casually and liked the Saki anime.\n\nGreat for practice and learning in a safe environment.\n\nIf I run out of tacos, I can no longer maintain my human form.  I will, myself, become the taco! ~ Yuuki\n\n6.5 outta 10 Sparkles.","December 25, 2015","true","16.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Anyone can make the badges and the profile backgrounds are good and very expensive some of them so if you buy the game you HAVE to profit with it, otherwise it is not worth to play.\n\nBy the other hand if you know how to play mahjong and enjoy to play alone this casual game is worth if and only if it has a discount and this is my final review.","May 16, 2015","false","2.4"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","5","0","0"
