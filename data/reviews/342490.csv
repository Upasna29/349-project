And actually it's pretty good at it, though sadly not in every aspect.\nThe game itself is pretty simple: Shipwrecked on an island that has troubles with the frequent storms. You'll need to defeat the entity that causes this by collecting 4 special seals.  Each seal is in a dungeon with different biome, with unique bosses.  (There are 6 dungeons - 1 tutorial, 4 seals + final boss' dungeon) The dungeons are pretty good - enemies are different, there are some nice traps, and a puzzle here and there. Sadly the enemies doesn't respawn at all, so in my opinion this turns the dungeons a little too easy. Bosses are also varied, for example the guardian of Earth Seal gave me a really hard time (wanted to kill it without using healing food)   Speaking of food, you'll get LOTS of gold in the game, and in my opinion you will only want to buy food, maybe a few arrows - so if the game is hard for you, you can simply stack up with food between dungeons making fights and dungeon-lurking easier.\nI mentioned arrows (maybe bolts, as you'll use a crossbow): you'll need to complete a minigame to prove you're good enough at fighting to use the crossbow. It's a really nice idea! Sadly this is the single minigame or activity you can do between dungeons - the world is utterly empty on the surface. Trees, bushes (smack them for possible loot!) and butterfies.\nThe slight negatives of the game:\nIt's quite short ( Please don't look at my time, I was idling a lot while playing it) - I'm sure it can be completed to 100% in less than 5 hours\nIt's lacking content and "life" in surroundings - feels like the whole island's purpose is only to get the seals (no roaming enemy, just empty desert/forest/rocky parts on map)But don't forget it's positives:\nNice, atmospheric retro graphics\nNice music, different for biomes/locations\nSome nice puzzles (could be a little harder though, IMO)\nEasy to 100% if you're into that\nGreat price: 3$ at full price - I think it will be around 1$ on sales. If you want your retro adventure fix, Shipwreck is a good choice for an adventuring afternoon for a low price.","March 31, 2015","true","21.6"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","19","20","0","0"

The game features 6 dungeons total, each of which has puzzles, keys, and a boss. Items include a bow, sword, shield, and healing items. The game is developed primarily by two brothers and it shows as a labour of love; this is the kind of independent PC game that was being made before Steam became a big thing. At $2-3, the game is priced to reflect the short length. I don't think it's going to displace any of the Zelda games in the pantheon of gaming greatness, but it's a fun little game with a lot of charm and some enjoyable puzzling. I had a great time and ran through the game in one sitting. If short, simple, and sweet is what you're looking for, I think Shipwreck is worth a look.\n\nGame has achievements and trading cards, although Steam recently changed trading cards so that they don't drop until 2 hours of play so you might not get any unless you take your time or idle the game afterwards.\n\nEdit: One other thing worth mentioning. The music, while a little repetitive, has the feel of the late 90s-early 2000s PC tracking scene (.mod, .s3m electronic music). This really contributed to the feeling of playing something that would have been a cool shareware or independent game I would have stumbled on a decade or more ago. Really nice.","June 20, 2015","true","3.5"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","15","15","0","0"

The whole thing felt like a Game Maker tutorial project.\n\nIt's short. Really, really, really, really short. You can get 100% in less than 2 hours.\n\nGraphics and screen size are built to be remeniscent of a Game Boy Zelda, but the high-quality sound effects and music clash with the 8-bit graphics.\n\nOverworld is just a big empty maze with no enemies, no secrets, and no interesting puzzles. It's just a bunch of shrubs and dead-ends, like the developers simply forgot to add monsters, or decided there was no point.\n\nSwordplay is painfully awkward, and enemies don't make a satisfying "crunch" sound when they take damage or die.\n\nDungeon puzzles amount to nothing more than "You have to go through hallway X before you go through hallway Y." There are only about six types of enemies to fight in the entire game, including bats with the most irritating flight patterns I have ever seen in any Zelda-like.\n\nThere's practically no story. No unsettling themes, no NPCs who tell you anything relevant, no huge conspiracy or plot twist. The bad guy is exactly who everyone says he is, and you kill defeat him to stop the storms and sail off the island just like everyone tells you to. The game makes no effort to hide the fact that you're just going through the standard motions of a Zelda game, but with none of the parts that make it fascinating or addicting, like using new items to solve puzzles or finding secret areas.\n\nAny positives? Well, a few. In this game, instead of enemies dropping hearts, they drop apples, which you can collect and eat later when you need them. Alternately you can buy bread from the shop which heals four hearts at once. I thought that was very good idea.\n\nThe desert dungeon was a total blast. It was huge, had great atmosphere, and had some actual puzzles. It was the only time when the game felt like it was reaching its full potential. The Lighthouse was a bit annoying, but it was also a very well-designed and challenging final dungeon.\n\nThe soundtrack feels too overproduced to fit in a retro Zelda game. Nevertheless, it's quite pleasant to listen to.\n\nOverall, I give this game a giant "Meh." It's not terrible, it just felt uninspired and pointless. Achievement hunters looking for an easy 100% should get this game. People looking for a homage to Link's Awakening should get this game, only if they're willing to lower their expectations to the absolute minimum. Otherwise, try Anodyne, which is a much more involved and heartfelt take on the same concept.","June 17, 2015","false","3.4"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","14","17","0","1"

Unfortunately the gameplay here is worse than where it is borrowed from and Shipwreck has no mechanics that it can really call it’s own.\n\nI respect what this game is trying to do. I’m just disappointed how little it actually does with it. I’m going keep my eye on Brushfire Games though. Making an homage game for something over 20 years old takes a certain kind of passion.

They're complex and involve puzzles, but not unreasonably so.\n+ The boss fights manage to be unique and engaging even though you're mostly just fighting them like you would normal enemies. However, some of them are awfully short.\n+ Gorgeous pixel art. The game never stops looking good.\n\n- The item selection you're given throughout the game feels uninspired. The crossbow sees very little use outside of combat (and it tends to be impratical in combat, too), and the pick becomes worthless the instant you're done with the mine dungeon. There could've been done a lot more with riddles involving clever use of your items.\n- The overworld is maze-like, empty and boring. There are no enemies to fight, no secrets to discover, and on your search for the various dungeon entrances you'll often have to backtrack a couple of screens because you'll run into arbitrary dead ends with nothing in them.\n- Combat has hitbox issues and as a result feels very rough and somewhat un-fun. The game often registers a hit on you when the enemy/projectile didn't even visually touch you, and some enemies (the small slimes are the most obvious offenders) will sometimes not register as hit even if your sword clearly went through them.\n- There are several points in the game where you're forced to take damage to progress, something I've never been a fan of.\n\nOverall, I did have my fun with this game, but... So much more could've been done with it. I'm a little disappointed.\nIs it worth getting? At this price, yes, if you like the genre.

Seems like a loveletter to the GBC/GBA top-down action-adventure titles. The only issue is it is too short and as another review said it can feel a bit empty at point. About 2hrs to 100% it. But it feels like a playing a well set-up emulation of a GBC/GBA Zelda which is high praise from me. The controls are customizable if the default X, C, and arrow keys does not float your boat.\n\nThe music is pleasent and the gameplay is very Zelda-like. If you liked Link's Awakening and you have a couple bucks (on sale at time of writing) or 3ish bucks when it is full price then buy it.\n\nThe story is a tad simplistic like in the older Zelda's. NPC dialouge is a bit limited at time (Some of them will repeat stuff). But is overall fun. I do like the stun function of the sheild and there 2 time trial mini-games you that could give you some replay if you want to hone your skills. The game tracks progress and Play time which can be nice if you like speed-running.\n\nHas a nice fullscreen mode that plays the game at it's native resolution but applies a "Frame" like the Pokemon GBA game used to when played in Stadium's emulator. A nice touch, especially if you want to record it in full screen without distortions and are too lazy to craft your own frame. X3\n\nLike some other users have said, the game is cute, and worth it at this price. Brushfire was also super nice and reponsive in getting me the key for owning the game on Desura which while is a plus.","February 18, 2015","true","3.0"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/allthegoodnamestaken/recommended/342490/","allthegoodnamestaken","Allthegoodnamestaken","http://steamcommunity.com/id/allthegoodnamestaken/","452 products in account","Maybe I'm expecting too much for a game I paid barely a dollar for, but games that wear their inspirations this openly have to be compared to their source material. As much as Shipwreck desperately wants to be Link's Awakening, it mostly accomplishes highlighting how brilliantly that game (and the similar A Link to the Past) was designed by doing everything markedly worse.\n\nThe first and most prominent issue is that the hit detection simply doesn't work. I've stood next to an arrow trap and been hit by alternating arrows despite not moving and the arrows all theoretically hitting the same spot. I've been hit through my shield. I've been hit by a boss that wasn't even close to me. These issues are compounded by a combat system that gives enemies entirely too many invincibility frames and sometimes no interrupt/knockback at all. The fact the devs give out on-use healing items so frequently and cheaply suggests to me that they knew the combat was fundamentally flawed and opted to work around it by effectively increasing player health by as much as 30 hearts rather than attempting to fix it.\n\nNext, the game world is over-designed. There are loads of screens that serve no purpose whatsoever except to pad out the overworld, town, or dungeon they're part of. Some of these screens don't even have anything to interact with - they're literally just time-wasters. The game's characters were designed in a similar fashion. There are loads of NPCs, even compared to the far larger Link's Awakening, but many are recolored versions of eachother (even important ones!), none have any character, and almost none even have unique dialogue. Almost all of the NPCs will say the same few lines if you talk to them enough times, one of which is along the lines of "There's not much to talk about on such a small island." It's true, but if the devs knew that, why did they make 30 different characters to talk about it?\n\nNext, and somewhat confusingly, the game is also under-designed where it matters. The dungeon puzzles aren't interesting or difficult. There's no Big Key equivalent and maps are missable, so you may unknowingly walk into the boss room for the biggest anti-climax ever. Houses feature no interactive items and are almost always empty. Items that are always interactive in games, like gravestones, aren't. The world feels like a rough draft of a Zelda-like based on a second-hand account of Link's Awakening rather than an attempt to recreate the character or detail of those games.\n\nFinally, some minor complaints: Moving diagonally (needed for shield usage) is unreliable with a gamepad. The soundtrack is largely inoffensive, but lacks combat music, meaning boss fights are occasionally done to gentle ocean music. The enemies are overwhelmingly clearly derived from existing Zelda enemies. The game inherits Zelda's issues with meaningless money - there's nothing to buy except bow ammo and healing items.\n\nShipwreck would be a perfectly functional game in a hypothetical world where Zelda or other imitators like Anodyne and Ittle Dew didn't exist, but unfortunately for it, they do. If you've played those games, Shipwreck will likely be as disappointing for you as it was for me. If you haven't, I'd strongly recommend doing so instead of playing this. I can only really recommend Shipwreck if you're desperate for a new Zelda-like and you're choosing between it, broken games, or flash games. It's not a particularly bad game in the grand scheme of things, but it commits the cardinal sin of being a below-average game in a crowded genre absolutely loaded with better options. I don't see much of a place for it.","January 11","false","1.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/recommended/342490/","Twistorian","Twistor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/","4382 products in account","TL;DR: A short but okay hack 'n slash adventure with minor puzzle elements.\n\nWhile a spawn of a genre pretty much defined by Legend of Zelda games (specifically NES and Gameboy versions), Shipwreck left me with a feeling of barely positive "meh". Let's get down to details.\n\nIn the beginning of the story there is a shipwreck that leaves everyone else but the protagonist dead or missing. It is a stormy night. You find yourself stranded on a beach and as the luck would have it, there's also a sword on the shore near you. You can swing it at a wide angle to attack monsters or bushes. Curiously but traditionally, both are filled with money and apples.\n\nMoving, sword swinging and other item use is easy enough, even familiar if you have played other similar titles like the aforementioned top-down Zelda games. You've got only two slots for items, presumably because you have two hands and the interface has space for pretty much only two items at the time because of the art style. Considering that particularly in some boss fights, albeit also in some dungeons, you need to juggle three or four items in short succession, the limit of two items is rather inconvenient.\n\nContinuing the story, after wandering around the beach for several uneventful screens you finally find yourself in a cave, a dungeon. The dungeons are by far the best part of the game: there are monsters, traps, locked doors and even some nice puzzles. If you are a completionist, you generally need to solve the puzzles to acquire all big hearts that increase your maximum health.\n\nIn later dungeons, the puzzles become mandatory, and this effectively makes those dungeons the best (especially the sand dungeon and the lighthouse). You can be stuck for a short while when pondering where to go, only to notice that you can fall to an unvisited room by jumping down a hole on a higher floor. Rooms could be dark requiring you to carry a lantern (in my concern the only valid reason for having mere two slots for items) to see around and some walls or boulders can be smashed broken with a pickaxe. Bow is used regrettably little being useful only in one or two boss fights.\n\nSpeaking of which, every dungeon has a boss fight of varying difficulty. Some are ridiculously easy, like the first crab boss (admittedly the first one should be easy) and the worm boss that just goes in circles and you can beat him without much resistance. Others are way more difficult and require you to study their attack and defense patterns closely. I especially liked the rock and slime bosses, the rock guy actually managing to kill me twice.\n\nMonsters are only found in the dungeons. There are only few different ones and all of them die by swinging them twice - exactly twice. Sure, the slimeblobs split into smaller slimeblobs, but every slimeblob dies with two strikes regardless of their size. Same is true of every snake, ghost, spider and bat you see. Consistency might be the key but it's peculiar with monster healths. Monsters being rather boring it's a good thing that they actually stay dead after killing them, even if you leave the dungeon.\n\nThe cool twist of Shipwreck is that you can only heal (in addition to staying at the inn) by eating apples (and the occasional bread) that are found lying around in bushes and carried by monsters. Before the boss fights it is a good idea to stockpile food for additional health. Unfortunately, as money is found basically everywhere and there is a shop for food, this renders health a trivial matter later on.\n\nI spent a long time exploring the small world after the first dungeon. The storm was still going on, but the world was empty of any other activity: no enemies, no people, basically nothing happening anywhere. When the storm finally ended, the town sprang to life (of motionless villagers but at least they talk to you) but there was still nothing going on in the wilderness. The wilderness is really an untapped opportunity for exploration and monster whacking for the developers. Just a couple of farm houses and a cemetery (where nothing exciting happens, as realistic as that is) doesn't really cut it.\n\nIn Link's Awakening you wanted to escape the island, and Shipwreck snatches basically the same storyline in that respect. There's a big bad boss that stands in your way but has hidden in the most inaccessible place possible: lighthouse is locked by four magical seals for some nefarious reason. In the case of Shipwreck though, let's just say that I was refreshingly disappointed that sometimes the bad guy is just the bad guy. With no special twist of any kind, I was nevertheless mostly disappointed, even though the boss was rather difficult and for once I almost ran out of food.\n\nLasting only 4 hours (even 2 hours for the faster players), I can tell that it's worth its cheap price. To me it was not a very special experience, but it was not all bad either, so I would score it as something between mediocre and decent. It might help with your Zelda itch but afterwards you'd need to fire up your old console anyway.","August 12, 2015","true","8.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","1"

I don’t throw out that comparison easily, as that’s one of the best handheld titles ever made, but the game is clearly heavily inspired by this in terms of setting, story and gameplay.\nI feel I have to downplay the expectations when I drop a name like that, as it’s not as perfect as a Nintendo game - but what can you expect from a game made by two brothers.\n\nIt follows the protagonist as she tries to uncover what is haunting the island she stranded on, and in a true Zelda-like fashion you crawl through a number of increasingly difficult dungeons to gather the Seals of Elements needed to unlock the final ‘castle’.\n\nAgain, as it’s heavily inspired by the earlier Zelda games, I have very little to complain in general. The dungeons are varied and very well designed, accompanied by a nice soundtrack for each of them. The puzzles aren’t very challenging, and while some of the bosses are hard as nails the others fail to test you in any way.\nThis doesn’t really hurt the game though. The only thing that does affect the game negatively are the sluggish controls, which you may not even notice until you reach one of the aforementioned harder bosses. All in all it’s good game with some flaws that can be forgiven considering how powerfully nostalgic it is as a whole.\n\nTldr: If you’ve been looking for a Zelda clone on Steam, look no further.\n\n\n+ Fun game heavily inspired by Link's Awakening\n+ Great level design\n+ Catchy soundtrack\n+ Low price\n\n- Sluggish controls\n- A bit short\n\n8/10","February 29","true","4.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's a fun experience. Basically, your ship gets wrecked on this island, so you need another to leave. You adventure to get one, but the only way to do so is to use the one ship on the island once the mayor allows it. So you end up having to help the mayor solve the island's problem. A ghost showed up recently, locked itself away in the island's lighthouse, and has been causing storms which disrupt the people's way of life. You must stop this evil ghost. To open the lighthouse, you need to obtain four seals, each in their own dungeon protected by monsters. Typical adventure stuff. Go to the dungeons, get new items, use the items to complete the dungeons and fight the bosses. Get the seals. Do the final dungeon, beat the final boss, and win the game. Also, you more than likely will be able to get all the achievements just by playing normally, which is good if you care about getting achievements I suppose. The music is alright. The retro style is nice if you're into that. And you get to run around hitting things with a sword. What can I say? It's fun. However, I feel this game has some rough downsides. While it's clearly inspired by Zelda games, it seems to lack a lot of what makes Zelda games so entertaining.\n\nThere's not much story in Shipwreck, instead just surviving on a main plot. That's fine by me, but some people will see this as a point of disconnect. My point of disconnect was moreso from the fact that there's a distinct lack of characterization. The main character has no personality or lines, but that's because it's YOU. The part that bugs me is that none of the people in the game have any real personality. Everyone is rather bland and most of the townspeople will simply say something random from the same pool of phrases as everyone else. It makes them feel very forgettable and doesn't motivate you to help them. All the villain does is cause storms, so there's not a lot there to make you really hate them or understand them as villains, which is sad for the main villain of the game. So your only real motivation to beat this villain is to leave the island and beat the game. Kind of a weak motivator.\n\nAnother strange thing is the overworld. Zelda games have overworlds, but... they have things in them for you to do. In Shipwreck, there are a decent number of screens on the overworld to explore, but there's no point in exploring those extra screens. There are no enemies to fight in the overworld. No secrets to find. I believe there are one or two houses to enter. One has an item you'll need, the other might just have some treasure. But there's a desert, a swamp, a forest, even a graveyard in the overworld that are all empty. There are dungeons in four of the areas, a town in the center, and the final lighthouse to the North. That's it. The areas leading to the dungeons are just small mazes. I can understand this being cool for one, possibly two areas. But all four? It feels a little bit like padding. Why not put some enemies in here? Thow in some puzzles or terrain I need my new item from the previous dungeon to overcome. Something more than just a change of scenery would've been greatly appreciated and give the overworld more purpose.\n\nThe dungeons aren't too bad. I just can't help but feel like the dungeon bosses could've been cooler. Maybe that's just me. The puzzles in dungeons were also a bit lacking. There could've been more or just trickier ones that required more thought. Still, I will admit the dungeons were probably the best part of the game. I think having more items would've opened up a lot more possibilities here. You can equip any two items at a time, but there are three empty item slots. I can't imagine why. Perhaps I've missed something, but it just feels like there was supposed to be more items than what we ended up with. Plus, none of the items were that creative. Sword and shield are basic. So is a bow. Having two slots for healing items, one for each specific one, is a bit silly since this is the only way to heal on the go. I like that you keep all the health you pick up because of this, but switching to the healing item every time can get tedious. And the pickaxe is probably the saddest item because, while it's cool for the dungeon you get it for, it serves no putpose outside of that. Why wasn't breaking rocks to get to new areas or breaking walls in other places part of the gameplay? Why was the pickaxe a one and done dungeon item? It just seems like such a missed opportunity. Also, while I liked the retro look, I wasn't too fond of some of the art and color choices, but that's not a big deal.\n\nOverall, Shipwreck is a cool little game. It just could've been so much more. There's lots of good ideas here, but they need to be explored. The adventuring in this game isn't much, even though the gameplay that IS there is solid. It is also fairly short, as I beat it in one sitting.  It's only three bucks at full price. I'd say that, if you're a Zelda fan, or want to get into Zelda games without the stress of learning all the references or paying full game prices... this is a good start. But if you're a Zelda fan... don't come into this expecting Link's Awakening 2. It takes the basics of Zelda games and cuts to the chase, sacrificing most of the charm. If it was more expensive I wouldn't recommend it, but it's not bad for the price. If you're looking to test out Zelda basics, or if you're already a big Zelda fan, you'll probably appreciate this game. Otherwise it might just be too bland for your taste. Shipwreck gets a 5/10. Make a sequel expanding on these ideas and I'm sure I'd give it much more praise. I'm easily suckered into Zelda type games so make those improvements and you have sale right here already.","March 23, 2015","true","5.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It will not take you long to complete and guides you along a fairly linear path, but the time you spend is relaxing and enjoyable.  There's not much plot.  The mechanics are easy to grasp.  The puzzles will stop you for, at most, a minute toward the end, requiring little more than the use of your in-game map.  It's gentle.  It masters the basics.\n\nAs I played through, I wrestled with these elements, viewing them as shortcomings and missed potential.  Everything is so cleanly executed and the areas demonstrate that the developers have a good grasp of the genre, so why not include more items or more complex dungeons?\n\nThen I considered this:  What if that's the point of it?  If you think of it that way, this is an excellent adventure game for younger players new to video games.  When I think of it in that light, it's just perfect the way it is and the content is right for the price, especially if you add in a coupon or a sale.  Take it for a spin!\n\nI hope the developers will continue to create, as what's here is an excellent model for more complex games suited for a wider range of audiences.","August 21, 2015","true","3.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/teeare/recommended/342490/","teeare","Rascalnicough","http://steamcommunity.com/id/teeare/","155 products in account",""Shipwreck" is a game I had left on my wishlist for a long time before I finally picked it up on the cheap. I am prone to getting the "Zelda itch" for top-down action-adventure games with atmospheric dungeons, challenging puzzles, memorable characters, engaging story, and -- maybe most importantly -- secrets and treasures. Playing "Shipwreck" has left that itch virtually unscratched.\n\nI hate to be too hard on "Shipwreck", though. The developer -- Brushfire Games out of Seattle-- is obviously a small independent operation, and I am sure they put tons of love into their product. There is a lot of effort on display here, but not enough for me to recommend this game.\n\nControls for "Shipwreck" are pretty responsive and intuitive, and I dig some of the soundtrack. However, spritework, story, writing, environments, goals, and that ever-elusive "game feel" just don't cut it.\n\nI was unable to feel immersed while playing "Shipwreck", which is disappointing, as it is in the same style as some of my favorite games. Perhaps I have been spoiled by similar titles from producers with bigger budgets and greater pools of creativity and experience, but I still think "Shipwreck" walks an awkward line of wanting to experiment while trying to pay homage to its predecessors.\n\n"Shipwreck" is certainly not worthless and is far from junk. I think there is a lot to learn -- for both Brushfire and other aspiring game designers -- by playing this game, dissecting it, and reflecting upon it. If you have the time and means to play "Shipwreck" and are interested in making games, I recommend you do so. I also think this game could be rewarding to new and younger players. However, if you are an experienced gamer looking to lose yourself in an exciting new world, you may want to steer clear of "Shipwreck's" unpolished and sometimes choppy waters.\n\nThere are not many games on Steam like "Shipwreck" that I would recommend. One exception, however, is "Anodyne", another game that is not perfect but was, to me, shockingly immersive. Off of Steam, "Link's Awakening" would be my go-to, and is most likely what inspired "Shipwreck".","April 4","false","0.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

More like trainwreck, heheheheheheheheheheh...\n\n... Kek...\n\nOkay, well it's not that bad, or even really bad at all in my opinion, but the opportunity presented itself and I couldn't resist. Really this game is more of a meh, which is difficult to convey with Steam's limited "Yes/No" review labels. Then again I do 'spose they say Recommend/Not Recommended rather than Good/Bad, which is a little more open ended, uh, but that's a conversation for another time.\n\n\nWhat I am here to discuss is my thoughts on this little adventure game. Shipwreck is a Zelda-like dungeon crawler, reminiscent of Link's Awakening to be specific. To be frank, it seem to just be a less interesting clone of Awakening, with not a whole lot to stand out or make itself interesting.\n\nNotice!----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This Review has been cut short thanks to Steam's character limit, and thusly will be summed up with short descriptions and bullet points. To view the full review as it was intended, follow the link below.\n\nhttp://pastebin.com/eWXRpJrc\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Good -\nCompetent, if not outstanding, bright and colorful sprite graphics.\nBasic options menu, but has rebindables and controller support. Does this neat thing with a border when going into fullscreen instead of having a solid black border or scaling to fill the screen, thusly distorting the pixels.\nHealth upgrades are hidden in the dungeons as opposed to dropping from bosses like in other Zelda-likes.\n\nThe Bad -\nNothing particularly interesting when it comes to mechanics, enemies, or items, all of which are pretty basic. If you've played a Zelda, you've likely seen most of what this game has to offer on all fronts.\nStory isn't anything to write home about. You crash your ship, there's a ghost that's causing the storms, go fight the ghost.\nVery basic dungeon design, usually consists of a maze-ish layout where you walk somewhere to press a button that opens a door to continue.\nMuisc is again pretty competent, but sometimes it gets kind of loop heavy. Might annoy some players.\n\nThe Ugly -\nBarren overworld. There's a dungeon in each corner, you get told to go there, you walk to it through a land almost entirely not worth exploring. NPCs most likely have nothing noteworthy to say, and some say the exact same things as other NPCs.\nNo real challenge, and any challenge you might encounter is likely to come from extended invincibilty times on bosses or being thrown down a pit to reset a fight. On the other hand, challenges are easily quashed with abundantly dropped health pick-ups.\n\nShipwreck just, like, really doesn't have anything that'll make it stand out, and is only juuuust competent enough to keep me from saying it's awful. I mean, it does it's job, but only just well enough on a technical standpoint. Otherwise, Shipwreck is a fairly short, uninteresting game. It's super cheap though, only 3$ at full price, so if you're willing to skip out on your morning Starbucks coffee in order to fulfill a Zelda-related itch rather then a caffeine-related one, it might be just enough to pick it up, 'specially at a discount. Though I think there are far better games to be playing, like, I dunno, Zelda?\n\nBut hey, that's just my opinion. Cross reference mine with others and see if this is a game for you. But to me, Shipwreck just isn't interesting, unique, or even good enough outside of it's technical aspects to warrant purchasing it.","January 27","false","13.1"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

This might have been a proof of concept at one point that somebody turned into a "full" game for whatever reason.

And for some reason the devs decided to put massive amounts of empty screens between you and your next destinations. I spent more time looking for the dungeons out in the wild than I spent exploring them. All of it is just so uneventful and there is no lasting impression - not via story and not via fights or dungeons, anything Shipwreck offers has been done in a better, more memorable way before.\n\nIt is not super-bad or anything (music is actually very good), it just feels so entirely pointless to spent time with it - especially when you have access to better alternatives through a 3DS or something.

This game has great music that fits the mood from fighting bosses to exploring the village. Well done!\n\n2. It's a fun adventure that is challenging but at the same time fun to play. Finding that balance is hard and i commend the developers for achieving that.\n\nNow for the not so great.\n\n1. Great games MAKE you care about the characters and the story. Unfortunately this game fails to provide any background on any of the characters (including the main hero and the antagonist). This makes for a game with no purpose. Since the game is also very short (took me 3.5 hours with all achievements), it makes you feel kind of empty watching the end credits. I thought to myself "that was it? What did i accomplish? What was the point?"\n\n2. Another downfall of this game is that it has ZERO replay value. Since i beat it and got all the achievements there is no reason for me to ever play this game again. There is no challenge mode or time-trials or anything to make you want to go back and visit this game again. So you are going to spend 3 dollars on a game that you will only get 3.5 hours out of....period.\n\nI think that the developers could think about some of these things when making their next game. A good story with characters that you get to know can change an ok game to a great game! Some form of replay value also makes gamers very happy. I would reccomend a game like that for sure.\n\n\n\n\n\n","September 21, 2015","false","3.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The only challenge is the that the enemies are untouchable for one second after each hit, only then they will hit you because they lack any AI to be challenging, they never attack you directly.\nThe bosses have paterns but they are really easy and beating them gives zero satisfaction.\nThe game showers you with useless coins that can be used in the only shop of the game for food to replenish your HP and arrows, but you find plenty of those inside the dungeons.\nThe story is barely there and there are absolutely zero interesting characters.\nFurthermore the game lacks any secrets or collectibles, there are 7 heart containers to find that are incredible easy to find and 2 minigames that offer a time trial, but once you complete them you will never want to play again.\nThe 8-bit graphics sometimes feel ok and other times feel soulless. Their point is to mimic the classic gameboy zelda games and they achieve that, offering that retro feeling and nostalgia.\nThe only decent part of the game is the music that offers a couple good tunes, the overworld music is actually pretty good.\n\nStrangely, while the game is the definition of boring, i did not had a bad time, mainly because i bought it to "scratch that itch", but it barely scratched it.\nIf the devs had put more content in it, better and more complex dungeons, a real overworld, more monsters, better boss fights (even a nice destruction effect after you beat them) and a real story (even a simple one but with a vilain and a few other characters just to exist) it would be actually decent. But in the end the game lacks all those that make a game enjoyable and memorable, there was potential.\n\nBuy it only if you want some "zeldaish" action, to boost your game completion (you can "perfect it" in 3 hours) or if you find it really really cheap.","November 27, 2015","false","2.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I read the synopsis and watched the trailer and thought it looked pretty cool. Plus, it would only cost me a dollar and change so I figured, what the hell ? One of the best games I've ever played. The storyline is about the unamed character who gets shipwrecked on an island. The initial text says: "You have landed on my island. I'll make sure you'll never leave!". You find a sword and get right into battle by entering a cave (I won't spoil). To take refuge from the storm, you head into town where the mayor debriefs you and enter a small land of fantasy, adventure, puzzles, monsters, and a tiny island tormented by storms that are definitely not just high air pressure fronts. I've never really enjoyed games of this type of gameplay. It reminds me of Pokemon, which I never liked. I am now considering "To the Moon" and "The Escapists", both of similar gameplay.

I wouldn't ultimately recommend this game unless you got it for super cheap and wanted to get a game to easily up your perfect games and completion %. Here's a few good things and mostly bad things:\n\nGood\n- Easy Perfect Game: The game will take you down all the necessary paths to get every single achievement and I got all of them fairly easily, with maybe only 2 dungeons giving me a little trouble on getting the extra hearts.\n- Music: The music isn't extravagant by any means, but it is charming. Every place will have its own music and though it's composed very simplistically, it fits the game well. I actually would rather have the soundtrack than the game.\n- Short: Can be beat in a reasonable amount of time. It took me about 3 hours, while it may take some a bit less or a bit longer, but you don't have to be too committed to this game to beat it, so it helps your overall perfect games and completion %.\n\nBad\n- Story doesn't really matter: I found myself not really caring about the story. I don't think they ever gave the main hero a name and the gender is neutral. It could be a dude with a ponytail or a girl with a ponytail, you never really know. Either way, though it's only a $2 game, the story is pretty much non-existant and therefore, the game is just not worth investing your interest in.\n- Overworld is barren: The devs must have focused all of their time into the dungeons for this game. While there is terrain in the overworld while you're walking around, there are absolutely no enemies. Just bushes that you can slice to try to find items and occasional butterflies that did nothing to deserve the deaths that I so swiftly gave them. Anyway, it makes running around the world uninteresting and tedious.\n- Enemies: All enemies are pretty predictable and don't have much to them. The monsters during the dungeons all die in 2 hits from pretty much anything, but even the bosses are extremely predictable. They don't have much variety to their move set. It's easy to never die in this game, but also makes all these encounters extremely boring.\n- Items: Most of the items in this game are pretty non-rewarding. I found myself using pretty much only the sword, bow, and shield. Everything else is kind of just there as an excuse to add content to the game.\n\nI don't want to say this is a terrible game, because it at least gave me something to do for a few hours, but the bottom line is that I just didn't care about the story, characters, the mission, etc. Not because i'm complacent, but because the game seems like it doesn't care either. Get your ♥♥♥♥ done and get out of the game is the sort of rushed feeling I got from it.","June 28, 2015","false","4.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Legend of Zelda is, at its heart, about puzzles and exploration. This game is pretty much just about action. And what works for an action-puzzler doesn't work for a nearly pure action game.\n\nThe combat is fairly bland, run up and swing your sword. Being able to shield-bash enemies is sort of interesting, but overall it doesn't do much new. There are other weapons as well, but I admittedly lost interest towards the end of the first 'real' dungeon.\n\nThe puzzles are... well, honestly, they feel tacked on. They're mostly of the 'step on this switch, open that door' variety.\n\nThe exploration is non-existent. Oh, sure, you can go off the path, but you just wind up on a completely empty and useless screen. The game feels like it punishes exploration rather than rewarding it.\n\nOverall:\n\nGraphics: 9/10. Probably the only really good thing about this game.\n\nMusic: 6/10. Not really good, not really bad. This might be skewed down a bit due to me playing this game very shortly after finishing Undertale.\n\nStory: 4/10. It's an excuse plot. Not the worst I've ever heard, but not the best either.\n\nWorld: 0/10. Full of empty screens, and almost all of NPCs draw from the same dialogue pool. Even the NPCs that don't do so have very little personality. Makes it feel like talking to anyone or going anywhere is a waste of time. If the devs were going to do this, they might as well have just put all the dungeons directly adjacent to the town and made the NPCs unresponsive.\n\nGameplay (Action): 6/10. Decent, nothing to really write home about. The combat is basically identical to the old 2D Zelda games, except your shield and boomerang are fused together. Killing enemies is basically mindless busywork. The first boss was okay, the second boss is basically a more frustrating version of Moldorm that takes up an eighth of the screen and summons minions.\n\nGameplay (Puzzle): 2/10. The puzzles just aren't good and leave almost no impression.\n\nGameplay (Exploration): -3/10. Yes, negative three. The game passively punishes you for trying to explore by presenting you with empty dead ends and backtracking. The worst part is, there actually are two health-ups discovered by exploring. They're inside peoples' houses, but give the impression that maybe if you go down enough dead-ends you'll eventually find something interesting.\n\n---\n\nOverall: 2/10\n\nA quick note:\n\nAs I mentioned once or twice, I have not completed this game. Maybe it gets better towards the end, I wouldn't really know. However, I doubt the improvement is enough to warrant playing through the beginning of the game.\n\n\nSome comments for the devs:\n\nDon't be disheartened by this review. While I didn't like the game, it was well programmed and fairly well put together. It's clear that you guys are passionate about games, and even if this game wasn't great, it shows potential. It just maybe needed to be cooked a little longer before being pulled out of the oven. If you're looking to make a game like this in the future, here's some observations I've made about where I feel this game fell short and how to fix it (which is admittedly subjective, but no harm in mentioning it):\n\n1. The most obvious issue is the lack of point to exploration. If you give a player an option to go somewhere, there should be something in that place, even if it's just an NPC saying 'why are you on the roof of my house?'. You clearly have a talent for good looking graphics; even including some interesting landmarks could be good. If I wander down a side-path and come to a dead end, my reaction would be a lot better if that dead end is the edge of a canyon looking down into a rushing ravine than if it's just a wall of the same trees that are everywhere else. That strategy tends to work better in 3D games than in 2D games, however, and I admit to still being frustrated upon going north from the village due to not being able to interact with the headstones or enter the windmill (mostly since I didn't know it was and wasn't expecting it to be the final dungeon). Honestly, the bit about the windmill could have been solved by putting a visible lock on the door, which would change it from an annoyance to an objective. In general, expect that a player will try to interact with anything that looks unusual, and will always go in every single direction except towards the main quest until there's no other option. If there's a way to leave the road, you can't just make the road pretty and ignore the places off the path.\n\n2. The second most obvious issue is the NPCs. Generally speaking, it's better to create individual dialogues for each separate NPC. I'm not trying to be condescending, there are reasons to program global dialogue pools like the ones in your game. However, dialogue pools like that are generally more of use if you have NPCs that might spout off a single line of dialogue on their own before walking away, or situations where NPCs are chatting with each other in the background. Random pedestrians, in other words. For situations where the NPCs stay in one place, giving them even one line of unique dialogue would make them feel less generic than drawing from a universal pool.\n\n3. With regard to the puzzles being bland, I again admit that I didn't get very far, and that the later puzzles might be better. The shield doesn't really seem to lend itself as much to puzzling as the boomerang from Legend of Zelda does, but that itself might be a reason to do things a bit differently. If you're trying to make a Legend of Zelda style game, all required items should generally have a use in the puzzles. The player will want to play with their new toys, and if they don't do anything beyond granting an advantage in combat, it makes them less interesting.\n\n4. The story honestly is probably fine. It's an excuse plot, and nobody really expects an excuse plot to be great. It would be nice if the antagonist actively tried to prevent you from progressing somehow though.\n\n5. A bit more enemy variety would be good. The first dungeon had one enemy type, the second dungeon had two. Not really that high a priority, but it might be nice.\n\nI am genuinely looking forward to seeing what you're next game is, for what it's worth. You guys do seem to pay attention to feedback over on the game's forums, so I imagine that your next game will be a bit less empty.","October 11, 2015","false","0.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Lots of little things that should have been caught before this was released or were noticed and the devs didn't care.\nPros\n•The music is very nice and like the rest of this game borrows heavily from Legend of Zelda (not a bad thing)\nCons\n•All sprites are comprised of the same size boxes so even if you see a clear path between objects you can't go through it and you will constantly find yourself getting hung up on the invisible square that the sprites occupy\n•Tall sprites (trees, houses, anything taller than ground level) are set so that you cannot walk behind the second level of the sprite.  If you are going to do this why not just have only single level sprites as proportion clearly wasn't a concern\n•Pickaxe swings from the right while facing three directions and from the left while facing to the right which seems like someone just didn't want to animate this the correct way\n•Personal preference but the attacks have no impact to them and either it was subtle or non-existant because I can't recall an impact sound effect again the enemies\n•The controls don't know if they want to be NES/Gameboy or something else.  I have no problem with an older control style to go along with the retro graphics (Oniken did this and the controls were great) but when you have three buttons and the start button mapped out why not just let us map an item to every button, or have a dedicated healing item button so we aren't constantly jumping into the item menu and out of the game?  Doing this you are no longer following a theme and it gets in the way when it comes to playing the game.\n\nTo summarize there were a lot of stupid mistakes that drove me insane while playing.  Brings nothing to the table but a watered down zelda with some good music and some lazy programming.","July 26, 2015","false","0.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

As others have stated, this is VERY similar to Link's Awakening (LA) in various elements of the game.  While it doesn't have the 2D platformer that LA did, it has a similar menu system with the ability to swap out what item is on what button.  Throw in the usual "explore these dungeons, get these items, and unseal the final area with them" you've got a nice little Zelda clone here.\n\nIt feels like the game is a bit lacking in some areas.  What I mean is, the inventory has some open spaces even AFTER I got everything.  I'm not sure what that's about.  The overworld feels empty as there are no mobs to fight.  This is both good and bad as sometimes it does get annoying to fight things in the overworld, but at the same time it just feels too empty without them.  Still, the fights and puzzles in the dungeons were rather enjoyable and weren't hard at all to figure out.\n\nSteam says I have 2.8 hours spent in game.  I actually completed it 100% in about 2.4ish (see my screenshots, heh).  The rest of the time was just waiting around for the card drops.\n\nIf you're one that likes to equate hours to money spent to see if the game is "worth it" (I can see the logic in it myself), then I'd advise to wait for a sale.  Regardless, I definitely enjoyed the game and recommend it if you enjoy Zelda clone type games.","June 20, 2015","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They aren't much to look at, and honestly they never were, but in the 80s that was all we had.  You don't simply slap pixels onto a 2D map, add clunky controls and call it "retro" if it doesn't actually evoke memories of a classic while you play it.  That said, if you ever played any Zelda games on the GameBoy Color, you will likely enjoy the top-down dungeon exploration in which you avoid traps, find chests with keys or giant hearts that add to your health meter, and fight bosses with a sword or bow.  The music is definitely better than anything the GBC ever chirped out, and it's short enough to complete in an afternoon or two.  There isn't much replay value and the achievements are all fairly easy to get, but clearly the developers had a very specific experience in mind that they wanted to emulate, and they totally nailed it.  9/10.","May 31, 2015","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game has some decently catchy music, The island theme reminds me of the main theme from Dark Cloud, the PS2 game? THAT GAME WAS AWESOME! But we aren't talking about Darkcloud. The Bosses of each Dungeon are pretty easy except for the last boss who can be a bother, the other bosses are basically " Hit him enough times and boom you win" almost no strategy but there is slight strategy. Another problem I have is the pre hit invincibility for ENEMIES, Yes, you hit an enemy and you have to wait about a second to be able to hit them again, I have backed a bat into a corner, hit it, tried to hit it again quickly and it goes through my sword and it hits me once, thankfully however, the game counters this with oversaturation of health items (Apples). There is barely any secrets in this game, getting the "Big hearts" (Heart containers...cmon...that's basically what they are xD ) are very simple to get in dungeons, getting health items is a breeze, and the enemies are not a problem unless there are many but your sword swing is rather large, in fact, if you are standing at the edge of a tile (A game pixel tile) Then your sword can reach two tiles of the game space, basically, hug a bush with another bush behind it, swing your sword and you hit the bush in front of you and the bush behind that bush. All in all with this, the dungeon I had most fun with is the last two dungeons, the desert dungeon and the lighthouse. So is the game worth 3 bucks? I think...yeah, A dumbed down zelda game? of course! It's a bit boring, but it has it's moments, Some of the dialoge is a bit sixth grader-ish, the bosses are pretty easy, the puzzles I wouldn't call puzzles except for a couple of them, and the story is short, I mean, I beat this game in like, a few hours, WITH a 100% rating. Easy achievements, decent game, I wouldn't be surprised if this was someone's first attempt at making a game, it's not terrible, it's just....Simple, Thats the best word I can use to describe it, the game is VERY simple, it will keep you busy for a few hours until you beat it, and that includes collecting the "Big Hearts" and stuff, my serious main complaint, NO MONSTERS OUTSIDE OF DUNGEONS! The topside of the island is barren of enemies to kill. So is the game worth 3 bucks? Yes, you get what you payed for, a short and sweet game, nothing complicated, nothing over the top, SLIGHTLY boring, but it kept me interested for a short while and that is what it was set out to do, and I like that. So I recommend this because this game knows what it is, a Zelda clone that is stripped to the most basic level, and it's short, the end. Worth the money for a quick play.
