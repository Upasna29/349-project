I'm late-40s and I still like cute things. I also love RPGs, so you can see why I looked at Recettear and liked the look of it.\n\nThe game wasn't quite what I thought it was though.... but in a good way. I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nYou'd probably be forgiven for thinking as I did - this is a typical JRPG with the theme being centred somehow around a shop. Well, yes it is... and it isn't. The game essentially has two parts to it. The RPG part takes the form of a fairly typical top-down dungeon crawler a la Chocobo's Dungeon, Pokemon Mystery Dungeon and a host of other similar ones. That's about as standard as it gets though.\n\nRecettear does things rather differently - you are a young girl who has inherited her father's item shop which serves the local townsfolk with equipment for their day-to-day use and more importantly, stuff to go a-dungeon-crawling with. You also have a guardian of sorts (who also turns out to be a debt collector too) who's a fairy. Well, this is a Japanese game - 'nuff said. The relevance of this is that Recette (you) have also inherted some burden of debt too, who naturally you owe to your ward. So, the crux of the game is to run the shop, and earn enough each day to enable you to pay off your monthly debt payment.\n\nI know, that might sound a little boring, but it isn't. It's actually where the game really shines. Your day is divided up into a maximum of 4 sections, which you can "spend" by either visiting town for certain things, visit the adventurer's guild (more on that later), or open the shop. Your shop has certain shelf spaces laid out, and arranging the stock so your best stuff is visible from the window is an essential trick. Put the boring, common and cheap items in the window and you'll attract less passers-by. Put the really expensive stuff in the window and you'll also attract less passers-by. It's a balancing act.\n\nOnce customers come in, they'll flit around looking, and approach you with items they want to buy from the shelves. As with any real-world store, the trick is to maximize profit, while retaining custom. So, sell higher than you bought it, but low enough so they don't get annoyed and never return - another balancing act. Some customers will ask for certain special orders in advance, which you almost always never have the stock at the time to fulfil, so you make a gamble on whether you can acquire the stock they're asking for - accept and fail, and they'll get annoyed, but refuse and they'll get annoyed too. You can't please everyone...\n\nSo where does the stock come from? This is where the adventurer's guild and the dungeon crawling comes in.\n\nInstead of opening the store, you can toddle off to the adventurer's guild where all the adventurers hang out. You can recruit them, for a fee to go and dungeon crawl with you.  There's a great element of risk/reward here, as at the end of each level, you can choose to duck out with the loot, or proceed onwards with the chance of more and better loot, but with the added risk of costly failure. As Recette, doesn't fight (well, she's only a girl), you take the role of the adventurer here. Her role is to tag along and store your part of the loot.\n\nSo, you fight, you level up your adventurers, you gain better loot to sell for better prices, you get money to pay off your increasing debt, and so on.\n\nThere's also some added little nuances such as it being wise to look after the adventurers you are hiring by selling them stuff cheap when they visit your store, as they'll use that stuff when crawling the not-so-murky depths. As the game progresses, you'll need to get a bit inventive in how you manage your stock and customers, but I won't elaborate on that as that would be spoiling things!\n\nIt's not an easy game to describe, and it probably sounds a bit dry on the face of it, but if you like the straight up old-school action-RPG dungeon crawler, I wouldn't hesitate to grab this - it does that part of it very well, but the light startegy side of shop management and how it dovetails so very, very nicely is what makes this game utterly unique. I can't recommend it highly enough.\n\nSo I have no hesitation in saying this is easily worth £15 on my value-for-money scale.","October 12, 2014","true","16.7"," 835 of 859 people (97%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","97","835","859","18","15"

Y'all can keep your Poorly-Lit Life Forces 2 or whatever the f♥ck it's called, Recettear blows that all out of the water.\n\nOk first of all you play as a loli. Don't be deceived--beneath her cute, naive exterior lies a heart as black as coal and a mind as shrewd and cunning as they come. This little sh♥t will bleed you for all you're worth with mark-ups that would make Best Buy blush. And she will love every minute of it as she watches you carry your broke ♥ss out the door with a ham sandwich. Thank you and come again mother f♥cker.\n\nRecette's rise to power begins when her piece of sh♥t dad racks up a dickload of debt and skips town or dies or something I dunno I kind of spaced out at that part BUT THE POINT IS he's an ♥sshole and Recette don't need that sh♥t in her life.\nSo Tear, this really unprofessionally dressed loan shark fairy with a personality as vivid and exciting as a piece of corrugated cardboard, comes up and is like "yo I'm takin your house."\nLong and short of it is that Recette has to open an item shop and earn some money to keep her house from being seized, because Tear is a soulless harpy.\n\nThat's how the story begins. And there's a decent amount of depth to the economic aspects of this game. I mean you can't check on the DOW or whatever but this is f♥cking Recettear, not Wolf of Wall Street: The Video Game (someone should get on that tho c'mon nintendo).\nThere's buying, selling, taking specific orders, taking orders IN ADVANCE (take some time to collect yourself, I know this sh♥t's amazing), and upgrading and changing up your shop.\nThe fun comes when you can take advantage of a crash in the price of goods to stock up, then wait until their value's jacked up later to sell them off at 250% of their price or higher. I basically gave up masturbation because making bank in this game feels so good.\nDifferent customers have different purchasing behaviors, including limited funds and a certain percentage mark-up they're willing to deal with. Common visitors to your shop include: Finicky House Wife from Hell, Crusty Old Man, Rich-♥ss Regular Guy, and the lovable Broke-♥ss Little Girl.\n\nThere are also dungeon crawling segments which you need to hire adventurers for, and to hire them you need to get their card by doing some specific sh♥t to make friends with them. The first dude you get is a lovable street urchin named Louie, and he's....ok I guess. He uses a f♥cking sword like a scrub but whatever you can unlock other people.\nDungeon crawling is how you get free sh♥t and ingredients to make even cooler sh♥t, but you can't really bring much back with you because apparently a f♥cking knapsack is not considered standard issue gear for adventurers.\n\nOverall, this game is exactly what the title tells you it is, and maybe a little more.\nI highly reccommend it. Play this sh♥t.\n\nalso f♥ck this steam censorship we're all adults come on","May 1, 2014","true","23.8"," 475 of 505 people (94%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","94","475","505","12","18"

The art and characters are absolutely adorable, the protagonist is even more so, and the gameplay is incredibly addictive. You not only get to spend plenty of time squeezing every last possible cent out of your customers, you get enormous dungeons to go adventuring through and plenty of amazing spoils to bring back to the surface, craft into amazing items, and sell right back to the adventurer who helped you acquire them. And once you pay off your loan, you unlock Endless Mode and get to finish exploring those dungeons and becoming a billionaire. I have 225 hours of this game under my belt, and I STILL haven't finished finding every item in the game. The plot(that is, the plot that isn't related to your loan - yes, there's more!) is definitely fun, although you won't be able to see the whole thing during your first story mode, but since Endless Mode allows you to pick up right where you left off, it's not a problem.\n\nBasically, what I'm getting at is that Recettear is an amazing game, I love it, and you probably will too. Base price for hours of entertainment? It's a bargain.

But sometimes a bratty little girl would come into the shop and say that she wanted to buy a murder weapon for stabbing kids on the playground, and you think that's pretty cool, so you sell it to her at a discount. Then other adventurers start selling you THEIR loot to resell. And you can even set up your shop to keep running and selling things while you are out getting MORE things to sell. And old men will come in and haggle with you over the price of a sweet roll. And there is an actual fluctuating economy that effects the demand for categories of items and what people are willing to pay for them, which you have to work around but can also exploit! And if your shop makes a lot of money, you can INSTALL FANCY CARPET.\n\nBest loot loop ever. If you thought you were a constantly-encumbered hoarder in Elder Scrolls, just wait until you play recettear. I MUST SELL EVERYTHING. IS THAT A ROCK?

See Conclusion\nNOTE:I'm reposting some of my old reviews because I adopted an easier to read format (and because for some reason I can't edit my old reviews)\n\nINTRODUCTION:We all played the Armored Knight, the Raging Barbarian, the Wise Wizard or the cunning Rogue, going into a glorious quest for honor, wealth or fame. But have you ever wondered what's the life of the regular citizen of the fantasy world, specially the all important Item shops who sell you armor, weapons and potions? Well here is Recettear, a game who will answer just that.\n\nRecettear its a retail simulation game with an RPG twist to it. You'll have to maintain your shop, restock your supplies and go on quests along side adventurers and receive items during the adventure. This is, for me, a pretty fresh new take on the genre.\n\nPROS:+ Lots of Items to sell, both generic shop items and special custom made items by you\n+ Well implemented crafting system\n+ Customizable and upgradable store which directly affects how many people visit and what kind of people visits. (People who are rich and pay more, or people who will haggle)\n+ A lot of interesting characters with varying personalities, traits and abilities.\n+ Good time management system where you are constantly under-pressure to either open your store or go raid a dungeon.\n+ A surprisingly advanced economy involving supply and demand.\n+ Easy enough learning curve.\n+ High replayability. Different modes are unlocked after the initial story campaign as well as a new game plus.\n\nCONS:- Campaign (Story Mode) is short, although New Game+ and other game modes are unlocked later on, it should not be an excuse to totally limit the Story Mode, specially in an RPGish game.\n- A bit too simple combat mechanic\n- Art Style is not for everyone. This game is clearly made in the Japanese Anime art style which means some people love it while others hate it.\n- Character sprites are low resolutions\n- No Widescreen Support\n- Limited enemy and npc designs: Some of them were clearly just reused and palette swapped\n- Restrictive map: There are different areas of the town you can visit but activity in those places are limited and only event triggered. Meaning, visiting a place (ex. Pub) without an event will just be a waste of time.\n\nCONCLUSION:FUN GAME. Highly recommended to JRPG fans who is looking for a fresh new take on the genre, or those who are genuinely curious what an Item Shop is like.\n\nAlthough I feel like, given enough time or funding, the developers of this game could have expanded the world and given more complexity on the mechanics that this game is based on. Still, as it is, the game is good and well worth its price.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nLike my Reviews?

A capitalist shop manager with a unique storyline of a girl who is forced to open a shop and to make profit out of hundreds of items and objects in order to repay her missing father's debt or otherwise, her house is taken away from her.\n\nAn interesting cute looking game with unique content and gameplay capable of taking players to show off their persuasive skills and fighting abilities during challenging and entertaining dungeon exploration!\n\nSome good and not so good aspects of Recettear\nIt isn't just another store or shop management game where you simply obtain profit through the act of selling, or buying stuff. Recettear is maybe one of the most unusual store management games out there that mixes in a good catchy main storyline along with some RPG freedom outside of your store.\n\nWhy choosing Recettear?\n\nRecettear is an appealing cute looking game, but don't be mistaken by its looks, because Recettear is a game that highly values the importance of your skills as a trader depending on each customer and events currently going on. Recettear manages to successfully mix both simulation and cuteness into one without lacking one another.\n\nGraphics\n\nThe weakest point in Recettear is probably its 2D graphics that simply looks too plain, leaving a lot to wish for... and the Japanese anime looking graphics might also be a problem for those who don't like anime.\n\nMusic and voice acting\n\nDespite the game being located in the European medieval time period, characters especially the main one, which you will be controlling, say different phrases in Japanese with a cute tone that will enchant you with its loveliness and cuteness!  If not, then you might find it annoying or childish.\n\nGame play\n\nDespite the challenge and the cuteness this game has to offer, its game play is extremely interesting with a big diversity of events that occur with the addition of the RPG touch into it. Although, it may become slightly repetitive over time and players will find themselves doing the same thing over and over again for a long period of time without many changes which will make you waste time without reason.\n\nUnless you get attached to the game, this game may become slightly repetitive over time.\n\nUser interface/Game Mechanics\n\nBoth user interface and game mechanic are simple and easy to learn either by the player self experience within the game, or by the initial tutorial that greatly explains how the game works.\n\nAlong with the addition of a business partner that can be used by you to access whatever information you require about your in-game progress and to view your stats resulting in a refreshing way for players to access information they require in the middle of the game.\n\nDifficulty\n\nThe difficulty in this game is mostly measured by how well you can persuade your clients into paying the projected price that you have given to them for an item they have requested or vice versa. Most of the times it will be a surprise until you get the hand of it resulting in a pleasant challenging experience.\n\nPrice\n\nDespite how unique Recettear can be in mixing multiple genres into one, I personally believe that the current price of 14,99€ is slighty too much due to the simplicity this game has to offer and its low diversity and variety.\n\nConclusion\nI would rate this game 65 out of 100 or 3,3 out of 5,0. A funny cute-looking challenging simulator game capable of pleasing a huge variety of players from completely different game genres.","May 18, 2015","true","10.8"," 88 of 100 people (88%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","88","88","100","9","4"

It's worth even the full price of $20.","October 20, 2015","true","11.1"," 64 of 66 people (97%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","97","64","66","7","0"

What a fantastic journey it has been, exploiting every poor soul that has dared to enter the hellish realm of lust and greed, also known as "Recettear". You, "Recette", are set to manage the finest establishment in the depths of the town slums, and together with your obligatory assistant-tsundere fairy, "Tear", the two of you seek to put the common folk in as much debt as YOU currently are.\n\nDoes the idle life of multitasking an item shop not sound appealing to you? Fear not, for it is the "adventurers" that roams the Adventurer's Guild, that you will be sending to a certain doom, with the simple aim of personal profit. These adventurers are the lowest of the low. Forced into a life of servitude at the snap of their employer's fingers, they also have to buy their own equipment for what money they may not (or at least, soon will not) possess.\n\nBut, where would an adventurer purchase their gear? Why, at your shop of course! You see, like any good patron, a shop tends to have regulars, these being a select handful of adventurers you are introduced to throughout the story. So not only are you the hand that feeds them, but you also are their liege and go-to person when poverty hits. Ironically, this works the same way around, as your business would be somewhat weakened without their patronage. Be good to your regulars (non-independed individuals), and they will be good in return. A minor occurence of Stockholm-syndrome may be present, as they are bound to your will, yet seem to have a somewhat carefree mind of the things they choose to do (such as purchasing lower-quality adventuring gear, replacing their already suffiecient pieces).\n\nRunning a pawn shop (this is a very accurate term), you (the player, "Recette") will come to meet the variety of generic NPCs willing to buy whatever you may have on display or they ask for.\nThese townsfolk are: Old man, Man, Girl, Woman; which all have their own unique threshold as for how high/low you can haggle with them.\nLower the price?

I mean this game has the lowest quality-to-addiction rating of any game I’ve ever played.\n\nSetting\nYou play as Recette Lemongrass, a young girl doing her own thing when suddenly, a fairy named Tear (get it? Recettear) pops up and tells you that not only is your dad missing, but he’s also left a humongous debt that you have to pay off. The fairy then comes up with the bright idea of turning your house into a shop, so that you can earn money to pay off the debt in instalments. Of course, the shock of your missing papa and the huge debt does absolutely nothing to dampen your spirits and enthusiasm. You open your shop without any semblance of despair and carry on earning money for the rest of the game.\n\nThroughout your journey, you’ll meet some very odd and annoying characters that will either help or ridicule you, none of which are particularly memorable or likeable. Thankfully, the game gives you the option to skip all the dialogue (or at least scroll through it really fast).\n\nGameplay\nThere are two main gameplay modes available in Recettear – the terrible plain item shop simulator and the repetitive randomly-generated dungeon crawler. Let’s examine these two portions separately.\n\nFirstly, the shop. This is really mundane. You display a bunch of items in your shop and throughout the day, assuming you choose to have your shop open (which takes up ¼ of the time you have for each day), people will come in and buy it. A bartering system exists that allows you to adjust the price depending on how much profit or loss you’re willing to take. If your price is too high however, the spoilt morons in town will get unhappy and leave you without a sale. Successfully selling stuff to the idiots in town will reward you with experience that goes towards your “merchant level”, with bonuses experience awarded if you’re able to chain a few successful sales in a row. Increasing your level opens up additional features that you can play around with. For example, whilst at the very beginning customers can only purchase the items on your (limited) shelves, higher merchant levels will allow customers to request an item from your inventory, sell you items or even order multiple items that they want to pick up on another day. Other bonuses include larger shop sizes, wall/floor/counters/layout customisations and even the option to put a vending machine down, to make all the hassle of selling items just that little bit easier on you.\n\nThere are several factors that influence which kinds of customers and how many customers enter your shop. The first way is through your showcase display, also known as the “table-next-to-the-window-that-people-can-see-from-outside”. You want people to look at the junk on your table and think “Damn, I wanna go in there!” So your first instinct is to put all your expensive, high-in-demand stuff on that table, but by doing so you risk alienating the poor little girl that can’t afford anything. So in the end I have no god damn clue how you’re meant to attract the most people. The second way to influence everything is by changing the walls, floor, counters and so on in your shop, which is collectively referred to as the “store atmosphere”.  I’m not 100% sure of how it works, but I imagine light and gaudy things attract little girls that can’t afford anything and call you a big meanie poo for marking up the price even slightly, and the more plain and dark ones stores some other weird population. Who knows?\n\nSo where do you get the items that you sell? Well there’s two ways to get your hands on some goodies. The first one is to buy them in town, either from the Market or the Merchant’s Guild. It works just like real life – buy low, sell high. Every so often you’ll hear a news bulletin saying that the cost of this is temporarily decreased and the price of this other thing is increased. It doesn’t take a genius to figure out how to approach the situation.\n\nThe other main method of obtaining items (which incidentally also makes up the remainder of the game) involves dungeon-crawling. Rather than having your useless little girl go out and magically have the ability to fight, the game allows you to visit the “Adventurer’s guild”, in which you pick from a number of heroes-for-hire who will go do the dungeon-crawling for you. Once you’ve made your choice, you take control of whichever hero you pick and embark on what has to be the most monotonous and tedious dungeon-crawling game in existence. If repeatedly killing incredibly inspired and original enemies such as slimes, bats and bunny rabbits appeals to you in any way then, boy, you’re in for a treat. Each level is set out so that there’s a number of chests, enemies and a goal to get to, which takes you to the next level. Every 5 levels, you’ll generally encounter a boss battle.\n\nDid I say it was monotonous and tedious? Because it is. You’ll encounter the same enemies over and over again (with slight variations from time to time). None of the boss fights are particularly interesting or challenging and although you do eventually unlock a handful of different adventurers to choose from, all of them are limited to a maximum of three abilities, none of which are particularly impressive.\n\nWhilst torturing yourself in the dungeons does reward some goodies for you to sell, the main purpose of dungeon-crawling is actually to collect ingredients, which can be used to craft (or “fuse”) better items or equipment.\nEvery week or so, you’ll be forced to pay off a part of your loan. This begins at 10,000 pix (the currency used in the game) and increases exponentially for every week that passes. If at any point you fail to pay up, the game is over and you’ll restart. This would be horrible except for the fact that you restart with all of your items and upgrades. As a result, losing the game just makes it infinitely easier next time.\n\nFor those that have paid off their debt and want more for whatever reason, you’re in luck – The game allows you to play on in endless mode, start again in New Game + mode or even a survival mode, where the debt keeps becoming exponentially larger until you get overwhelmed.\n\nAll in all, there’s a lot of “game” to be had here, although whether or not you enjoy what you’re playing is another matter altogether.\n\nPresentationTo be honest, the game looks like an early PS2/Dreamcast-era game. There’s no support for wide-screen or any resolution higher than 1280x960. The aesthetic is certainly cute, but otherwise unremarkable. Also worth noting is the fact that alt-tabbing appeared to glitch the games graphics so that one half or more of the screen is completely whited out when selling items. I can’t say for sure if that happens to anyone else though.\n\nThe music is adequate but also unremarkable. I’d liken it to a poor man’s version of the music in Pokemon games.\n\nOverall\nDespite crapping all over this game in this review, it’s the intangibles that really matter. For whatever reason, despite all its flaws, Recettear was a stupendously addictive game that I just couldn’t put down. It takes a bunch of repetitive, unoriginal and uninteresting ideas and meshes them into a unique game I both love and hate simultaneously. All that said, I do recommend that you give it a try, because if nothing else, it really is a unique title and one that you should experience for yourself.","January 9, 2015","true","21.6"," 35 of 39 people (90%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","90","35","39","9","0"

What it does, it does well (minus a few gripes) but somehow manages to both drag itself out and rush you to the "end" of the game. The problem with the end-game is that, while it has plenty to offer, it arbitrarily bars you from it with unnecessarily padded goals.\n\nSo the shop sim is the meat of the game. There's no point detailing the mechanics, so I'll just point out the failings and oversights I didn't care for.\n\nPatrons have a finite amount of money when they enter the store. This value is influenced by how much they "like" you, or what "patron level" they are. The maximum amount of money they have when entering your store is a very important number and it is also completely invisible to the player. So when a patron says "I don't have that much money!" there's no option to say "Well how much do you have?"\n\nBuying items: some patrons will sell YOU things. You have no option to politely decline; you either make a reasonable offer for something you may or may not want, or you make a terrible offer and ♥♥♥♥ them off. Patrons also have their own dialog style, and occasionally it is unclear whether you're buying an item from them or selling an item to them.\n\nThe goal is to do a capitalism until you pay off all your debts. This happens rather rapidly and they kind of rush you through this section of the game so that your time limit is over and you can go at your own pace. This is particularly good for the dungeon-crawling portion of the game, as entering a dungeon will consume most of an entire day and leaves little opportunity for vending.\n\nThe dungeon crawling plays very smoothly and each of the playable characters has enough uniqueness to their playstyle to give them all a wholly different feel. There's a considerable number of dungeon and environments. And they're all the same randomly-generated box rooms and hallways given fresh paint at regular intervals. After a short while, it gets stale, and as much as I enjoyed the gameplay, I did not feel compelled to complete even the Obsidian Tower. They just don't keep it fresh or interesting, and that kind of killed the game for me. There's lots of end game content and no motivation or reason to experience it.\n\nAll said, I'd still recommend the game if you can nab it for a few bucks because the first 5 to 10 hours are a pretty fun ride.","October 4, 2014","true","15.8"," 28 of 32 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","28","32","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thesmolder/recommended/70400/","thesmolder","Akihiko Sanada","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thesmolder/","105 products in account","Introduction: If you’re the sort who enjoys whimsical and innovative games featuring various RPG elements, Recettear is for you… Unless you dislike anime and/or gaming, in which case: what are you even doing here? Recettear is a commerce simulator, rich in story, and inventive in its own entertaining way. While the story itself is short, it is highly addictive and extremely entertaining. Just remember to maintain your stock and prices when you find yourself on a questing spree.\n\nStory: Recettear is a charming tale revolving around a little girl, and a fairy loan shark. Recette Lemongrass is confronted by hardship when her father mysteriously vanishes, leaving her accountable for settling his debt. With the help of a fairy named Tear, Recette takes the necessary steps to pay back her father’s loan by turning her house into an item shop. She quickly learns that a lot of work goes into maintaining a shop: From interior design, to questing, to restocking, and to haggling prices. Recette must pay off a certain amount of the debt each week in order to keep everything that she knows and loves.\n\nGameplay: There is a lot of ground to cover in this category, as Recettear is an extremely well-developed game. As stated previously, this gem has introduced both RPG elements and commerce simulation in an innovative style.\n\nLet’s start with the RPG elements. As a store owner, it is Recette’s responsibility to keep her shelves stocked for her customers. As a result, she has the option to accompany a dungeon crawling adventurer once a day, in order to acquire items and ingredients. While the dungeons can become a bit tedious, they are extremely worthwhile - and profitable. It should be noted that these particular ventures take more time than actually managing the shop. Did I mention that these dungeons are randomly generated? Guilty pleasure. After a dungeon crawl, don’t forget to check in with the Merchants Guild to fuse some new items. Recipes for these fusions are unlocked by your Merchant Level.\n\nThere is a time management system in place, so Recette will only be able to do a certain number of things per day.\n\nBack to managing the shop, though. Eventually, Recette will learn to take orders in advance, and the player will need to ensure that the items are available when the customer returns. The haggling system in this game is worth mentioning, as Recette will be able to barter with her clientele. Much like the real world, if the price is set too high, the buyer will lose interest. Don’t fret too much over lost orders though, there are always more fish in the sea. Apart from purchasing random doohickeys from her customers, Recette will also be given the option to utilize vending machines for quick sales with set prices. It should also be noted that different aesthetic customizations made to the store will attract different pools of people.\n\nAnother really cool feature in this game is the shifting economy. While this won’t occur instantaneously in your first playthrough, you will eventually be alerted to certain goods becoming more valuable. When this happens, Recette can stock her shop with the rare goods (for instance candy), and sell it for ridiculous amounts of profit.\n\nWhile the game might seem overwhelming at first, rest assured it is easy enough to learn, and quickly (if not instantly) becomes enjoyable.\n\nMy favourite feature of this game is its diverse set of characters. Too often in games, we’re subjected to multiple characters of the same flavour. Not in Recettear. Each character is unique, offering different lovable quirks.\n\nControls: The controls are pretty smooth, and there’s not a lot to complain about. The only problem I found was almost exclusively during dungeon runs. Sometimes the camera angle will deny you visibility, but it seems like such a small problem in the grand scheme of things. This game does offer controller support, which I recommend taking advantage of.\n\nGraphics: One thing that really stood out to me was the artwork in this game. Sure, it might seem a bit outdated if put in a side-by-side comparison to a few new releases, but overall the aesthetics are equally as cute as the game. I seriously doubt that the visual aesthetics of this game would be distracting to anyone who enjoys a retro feel.\n\nSound: I might be one of the strange ones, but I found the music to be oddly addicting. The OST is the perfect fit to emphasise the extremely pleasant atmosphere of Recettear. Unfortunately, for some, there really is no option for widescreen.\n\nReplay Value: In my opinion, the replay value for this game is extremely high. Once the game has been cleared once, the player will be faced with three choices: New Game +, Endless Mode, and Survival Mode. Just be mindful not to play it if you have other commitments, this game is so hard to put down. Good luck finishing out your Item Encyclopedia!\n","May 26, 2015","true","17.9"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","23","26","0","0"

The rabbi of the city's quarter, Isaac Schlomo Goldstein Shekelburg ben Levi Abraham Cohen, on behalf of the Goyim and with the help of the cult of Satan and the blood of seven gentile children, then invokes the Kabbalistic Sephirot to summon a Jew fairy, of whom is promptly dispatched to Recette, both to collect the outstanding debts according to a strict timetable, and to teach her the art of counting shekels, stowing gold bricks under the floorboards (and in the walls), acquiring the role of an extremely convenient scapegoat, and shortchanging customers like a proper Le Happy Venetian Merchant.\n\nLoli Jew Recette learns to contradict basic merchant guild regulations in 17th-century France, engages in the unholy act of ritual blood libel during Passover, exploits her incompetent Swiss mercenaries by paying them to risk their lives picking up valuable consumer goods in the dangerous wilds (and then reselling said items to those same people at a profit), and invents the free market and 9/11 in the process. You'll have hours of fun wondering where in your house you hid all those millions of shekels (called "pix" in the English translation) prior to the game's start, as well as by selling candy to the goyim girls and that one Irish elf for the equivalent of a small fortune.

That's the catchphrase of the main character. It's also this entire game in a nutshell.\n\nEDIT: I always forget that it censors my words. Replaced censored words with the cute stuff Recette says.\n\nRecettear: An Item Shop's Tale is a game about running an item shop, as the name suggests. Meaning, y'know when you're playing an RPG and you find a city with a shop that's full of high powered items so you sell your car and put a mortage on the house so you can buy everything and be really powerful, and then it ends up the next dungeon has a ton of items way more powerful than all of the things you just bought? Well, fear no more! Now it's your job.\n\nRecette, our main protagonist, and half of the name of the store Recettear, is on a quest to pay her father's debts by running an item shop (as running an item shop (even though she's like, ten years old) is the best way to pay off debts, and doing so would prove Recette a strong, independent woman of color). Tear, the 'Pie-kay!' fairy/debt collector who's forcing Recette to pay for her father's negligence, is the other half of the name of the store. As Recette is ten and has no idea how the economy works and how to pay back debts, Tear decides to help her start and run an item shop, acting as an advisor and a tutorial teacher. Other than that, she's just a jerk, which is pretty typical fairy behavior in Japanese games, so I'm not that surprised.\n\nThe game is entirely about finding items in dungeons (you dont do any of the fighting yourself, but we'll get to that) and selling them for around 120%-150% of the original price, depending on the person you're selling it to and how much they like you. There are also daily and weekly economic changes, so food prices might go up and weapon prices go down, things like that. The way you organize your store is very important, and you wont be able to stock everything on shelves,  which is important to note, because even if you cant stock something on your shelf, there will still be that one 'Yayifications!' who's like "Hey, do you have this thing, I didn't see it on your shelves." You better be happy this isn't the real world, because most of the time, if it's not on the shelves, we dont have it. Lucky for you, Recette has infinite coffers to hold all of her capitalism, so yes, I do have that back scratcher you wanted so much. And back scratchers are listed under the 'treasure' category in this game. So that's a thing, I guess.\n\nAnyways, to the dungeon thing. You dont do any fighting yourself. You're ten years old. Sorry, but you aren't Tengen Toppen Recette Tear. Though that 'Yepperoni!' would be 'Easy as pie!'ing radical. I'd do a review of that fanfic. You pay explorers and let them use your equipment, and in return, they give you items from dungeons that you can sell in your store. It's easier to just sell them the equipment you want them to have so you dont have to equip it every time, but most of the time the 'Capitalism, ho!'ing dungeoneers come into your 'So! I have an item shop! And stuff!'ing store, they dont buy the 'And it's cool and awesome!'ing weapons you put on display for them to buy. Instead, they'll 'Stained-glass yayness!'ing buy a 'Aww, but I wanted to leave through the window, like an action hero!'ing orange or some stupid 'Holy Carp!' god dammit why dont you just let me give them the items. I dont want this 'A HOODLUM'S GONNA STEAL MY CUUUUUTENEEEEESS'ing knife. I'm not gonna go shank some '...I sold stuff. Like. To people.'. TAKE THE KNIFE YOU DRUNK HOE. Every dungeoneer is different, starting off with a poverty-striken swordsman, and moving on to wonderful characters like an alcoholic rogue who's constantly trying to sell you '...I wonder if I can survive with only two internal organs?' she stole to a creepy-but-hot golem chick who has big fists that she fists things with like Vi from League of Legends. Oh man, I know I'm going to get '...Maybe if I eat a lot of spinach, that can replace my blood' for talking about League of Legends on Steam. Come at me.\n\nOh, and by the way, you actually play as the characters in the dungeons. Yes, there is actual gameplay, folks. You get to play as poverty and alcoholism. In perspective, it sounds like a metaphor for capitalism, but hey, it's just a video game, and I'm too shallow to read in to that kind of stuff.\n\nI do have some tips for you, though, as it might help your first play through:\n\nThe man (there's only like, four NPCs in the game. He's just a normal looking dude) usually buys for the highest, typically being around 125%, but you can go a bit higher, like 130%. The old man does 130% occasionaly, too.\nWhen buying, paying 30%-40% is usually a safe bet. If not, go up to around 60% just to be safe.\nAlouette is a girl much like you, who also runs an item shop. She a hoe. She has a fairy, too, named Prime. They'll both occasionally come in and buy things from you. Alouette is willing to go up to around 140%-160% typically.\nDont worry about deadlines. They'll catch up to you and 'You need to pay me some money y'know!' you over, most likely. And if they do, you restart the game from the beginning. Dont worry, though, you keep all your items, so you have a pretty big advantage. My first run through, I restarted around 3 or 4 times.\nOh yeah, there are cash deadlines in the game that require you to have a certain amount by the end of the week. Should have probably mentioned that before.\nThe little girl is an 'Totally a tree' and typically wont buy anything over 110%. Just hope she doesn't go for anything expensive if she goes into your store. When she sells, you have to go around 60%-80%. She a crafty 'because I'm bigger, I'm the big sister, right?'.\nWhile your usage of the dungeoneers depends on your play style, I pretty much exclusively used Louie (the swordsman you start out with) and very rarely ever played the mage character because he's fairly difficult.\nThere are some resolution problems, as it was originally a Gamecube game, so I recommend playing in windowed mode and keeping it in a square instead of full screening. Otherwise it looks kinda 'But I don't wanna be a sailor!'. But that's up to you.\n9/10. It's a solid game, and I got a lot of play time out of it. It's an honestly surprisingly fun game. You don't really expect an item shop sim to be fun, but hey, it is. I dont have much else to say about it.\n\nKeep on capitalizing.","January 15, 2015","true","32.5"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","94","17","18","12","2"

America runs on Dunkin’ so I know you have because no civilization exists outside of the borders of this great nation, trust me. I visited England once, there was nothing but football hooligans and CCTV cameras. Anyway, back to the dunkin’ analogy, when you start drinking it it tasted bitter, unpleasant, there’s too much milk and it’s bovine creaminess threatens to choke the breath out of you. If you manage to survive that stage you’re near the end, it’s starting to to sweeten a little and you think: ‘Maybe this is what victory tasted like.’ With only the dregs left you throw your head head back and down the last of the liquid, knowing that you’ve won and nothing will be able to stop you today.\n\nAfter you’ve thrown up the sickly sweet goop that slid down the back of your throat along with the the tooth enamel it grabbed on the way past you realise that the jerk behind the counter didn’t even give the cup a shake to dissolve the sugar.\n\nThat’s kind of the inverse of this game.\n\nIt’s all a game of deception, you see, it fools you into thinking you know what you’re in for: Here’s a homeless little orphan girl, here’s her fairy manager, set up shop and do business. But hold on there, Ken-Sama, get your nose out of that doujin! That stuff will get you arrested if one of those British CCTV cameras catch you with it. They’ll sentence you to life imprisonment with nothing but American tea for sustenance. Once you get past the saccharine sweet character designs and voicework  there’s some bitter, milky gameplay to get familiar with.\n\nThere’s no fantasy here aside from the setting, you’ve got to start setting prices for your various wares won through old-fashioned dungeon crawling along with the various stupidly loyal or dangerously self-interested cohorts you’ve set loose to murder the peaceful inhabitants of said dungeons. Try as they might to defend their homes and loved ones, let none stand against your (Simplistically controlled yet still enjoyable) bladework, their property WILL be yours to peddle to the various citizens of your town.\n\nAs in real life, of course, this is the far more difficult proposition. Convincing someone to kill for you is a simple matter, maintaining domination of even a relatively docile population from behind the scenes via market control is a more trying task, just ask the Reptilian overlords deciding our fate. All I can say to that is watch out for the little girl, she may play innocent but she knows far more than she’s letting on.\n\nGet that money, little merchant.

In the lore of the game, 130% of base price is a 'respectable' sell price, which is assumed to mean, fair.\n\nI set my constant initial offer to 120%, and that was that.  70% of customers didn't want to pay that, they believed the guild who ran 130% baseline were cheaper.  This went on for three days, until I was ripping my hair out, wondering how the customers couldn't see the fair deal they were being given constantly.

The only difference between the games is that in Recettear, you hire manservants to fight for you while you remain safe, take the goods they find for you, and sell them to the uneducated masses with your superior loli bartering-brain. The game has many funny moments as well as important life lessons such as, "Don't let the little girl in your store. She doesn't have enough money for anything and will ruin your bartering streak."

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/espurple/recommended/70400/","espurple","ユキ✭ツキ","http://steamcommunity.com/id/espurple/","141 products in account","I can remember when this game first came out on steam, I saw it on the sales page and thought 'eh, this looks cute, and it's fairly cheap, why not', I got it on a whim. What I DIDN'T expect was for this game to be a gem among all the indie games on steam.\n\nSo the premise - you are a Recette Lemongrass. Your father ran off to go adventuring, left you with all his debts. and the loan Fairies are after you to collect. What's the logical solution to this problem? OPEN AN ITEM STORE. Cue the start of the day-to-day antics of trying to repay your debts, hiring adventurers to beat up giant crowbar-weilding mice, and selling a book that comes with free Alcohol to small children.\n\nWhen it comes to the buying/selling system, the mechanics are easy to pick up and the game gives you plenty of information on which items are hot and which are not, and even if you do fail to pay back an installment, your only punishment is a CG of Recettes new house (THE BOX) and then you are thrown back to the start with all the items you had when you Game Overed, which makes it easy to get going again.\n\nMy only issues with the shop part of the game are that as you might expect, there are certain tactics you can employ to rake in the cash far faster than the game really intends, removing all challenge, and the way you can more or less ruin your file by playing badly and have no idea that you've done wrong, as the story often requires you to have certain characters visit your store to trigger story events or unlock new dungeons, and if you end up giving your store the kind of atmosphere that a character you need doesn't like and/or annoy them by failing to provide them orders or overvaluiing items so they leave without buying, you can end up getting stuck without any indication that you're stuck.\n\nIt's also not really a criticism per-se, but it's a little annoying that you can't directly offer equipment to your adventurers-for-hire - it's annoying when you spend hours hunting down all the ingredients to craft an ultra-laser cannon, then having to sit there hoping that the character that can use it comes into your store, then hoping they want said cannon and not one of your 10 ham sandwitches, THEN hoping that them and not one of the 20 generic villagers in your shop decide to buy it...the randomness factor there is a bit of a pain.\n\nAs for the dungeon sections of the game...I would say they are good, but a little bit standard. Each adventurer plays a lot differently to the rest, and most are fun to play, but you'll probably end up using Charme or Tielle for most of the game when you unlock them, since they're much better than the rest. You do get an extremely versatile character that some might consider the best, but only after clearing the entire game, so I can't really count that character in there.\n\nThe dungeons themselves are as I said, fairly standard rougelike affairs. Each dungeon has a set number of floors, and there are different themes throughout most of the dungeons, with randomly generated maps, loot and traps (BEWARE THE TUNA). There's a decent variety in the bosses even if they are a little simplistic for the most part, but the game does  repeat a little bit (Like King Slime? Now fight TWO King Slimes!). There's also a good range of enemies throughout the dungeons, enough to keep things fresh, but your enjoyment here really depends on whether you like these kinds of 'Rouge' mechanics. There isn't permadeath, but dying in a dungeon means you lose all but two items of your choosing, which means you can end up losing items that you brought into the dungeon if you fail.\n\nOverall, the game is a unique little adventure. The story is cute and amusing for the most part, and the mechanics are generally quite fun overall. At the time of writing, the game is £12.99, which I would say is a reasonable price for what you get, easily worth it if you do end up enjoying it. If you still aren't sure, there IS a demo available, which should give you more of an idea if this game is worth the asking price for you. Just be warned bargain hunters, this game deosn't go on sale very often.\n\nCAPITALISM HO!","December 23, 2014","true","46.0"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

It's adorable, it's fun, it's interesting.  Recettear is indeed an Item Shop's tale; you take on the mantle of your father's incredible debt as Recette, an earnest and sincere young girl who's eager to preserve the house in the name of her father and facillitate the alleviation of said debt by turning it into a nifty little item shop at the behest of an authentic loan shark Tear, the fairy representing the people Recette's adventurous father owes all her money to.  To do so, she needs to sell items and make weekly payments while balancing other economic decisions, such as buying stock, and time itself is also a commodity.  There're truly different faucets of gameplay to this wonderful gem: dungeon crawling and making dough (not literally, she isn't Alicia and thus doesn't work in a bakery.  There is another guide for that kinda thing.)\n\nTime is important as it determines what you can do.  You only have X amount of time to do things each day, and certain activities, like going to the pub (no the girl won't get drunk, don't even think about it) for some reason or another, or going dungeon crawling, or operating the shop, or going to the park; interactions with other characters will often happen in places that don't serve an obvious purpose.  Operating the shop involves managing the general ambience, as well as determining item placement (window shoppers should be taken advantage of folks), and involves attracting customers to investigate your stock and then haggling with them to get a better price.  People will come in and ask for things you have set out, as well as things you have in storage.  They'll also try to sell things to you, in which case you haggle for a lower price.  Don't be like me and confuse the two, resulting in a loss of product or blowing all your money on a soggy loaf of bread.  Successfully haggling and other things improves your rank and what not, increasing your access to X benefit and Y item, etc.  Haggling in and of itself is mostly intuitive; you'll quickly realize that different people, like in real life, are malleable to different degrees when negotiating price, and they'll let you know if the price you selected bothers them (or walk out flustered.  And beware of the little girl, she's stingy).  The items themselves come in a wide variety, from food to clothing to weapons and the expensive dish thingy I found that people ignore in favor of chocolate.  Why chocolate?.  It's a blast to run through a cave picking up all these weird things and assembling your flying circus of a collection at the store to reintroduce them to society via CAPITALISM HO!\n\nTo get items, you can buy stock, but it's best to get it through dunegon crawling; over the course of the game, Recette will encounter various characters, many of whom will become available as dungeon buddies who will slaughter hordes of strange bouncing goopballs to get you chocolate (and a plethora of other items; there's some RNG thrown into the whole thing).   You crawl the dungeon, hacking and slashing and using special abilities and picking up items and eventually finding doors to let you exit the dungeon, for if you succumb to the horrors within your ability to leave with all the nice loot you got is severely limited.  Boss fights are interesting and fun and the integration of action adventure hack and slash combat with the rigors of running the weirdest store ever provide a unique and delightful game play experience that actually, despite being a mashup of entrepreneurship and super spelunking, works quite well and delivers something I haven't really been able to compare to anything else.\n\nTL;DR\n\nAdventure RPG with hack and slash mechanics, as well as business simulation.\n\nLoli kawaii shopkeeper and friends slay baddies to get goodies and sell them for $ to save the world her livelihood.  Cute, fun, unique, I totally recommend this, it's a great experience for me, and hopefully it will be for you too ^_^","December 5, 2014","true","11.4"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

However, there aren't many games that come to mind which result in handling stock and trying to make a profit off them (or at least try to do better than break even). Your starting week will probably end up being pretty confusing, even with the 'tutorials' and tips given to you by Tear as you go along, but it's generally a game that doesn't really want to hold your hand, which makes the game more enjoyable when you do realize how the market works.\n\nYou attain goods through "second party" sources, which you then must sell at your own accord to customers that will buy what they desire. As a footnote, each character has their own threshold of how much of an increase over the base price they will generally be content with. It's mostly about experimentation, and knowing what your customers want to fulfill their window shopping into actual purchases (adventures will rarely buy anything outside of weapons/armor etc. but do sometimes request other goods), so having at least one of each selection will help your store and profits as the weeks pass.\n\nGenerally, your success for each week may or may not be enough to pay the debt, but one thing to note is that Recettear has no true end. If you do happen to fall on the payment, you still maintain everything you have, which allows you to keep trying new approaches to making good on each weekly payment the next time around. It's not a particularly challenging game, but it does require you to think about your investments, and what to sell. That said, if you consider Recettear as a stock market... it should give you a push in the right direction if you follow through.\n\nWhile Reccetear does have an anime theme style, it doesn't really detract from the game itself. You can even turn off the voice acting cuts that crop up every now and then. You'll be reading text boxes throughout anyway.\n\nAn enjoyable and interesting experience, for sure. Give the demo a try. Highly recommended purchase if it ever goes on sale and/or if you like the concept of buying/selling.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jadziatuvok/recommended/70400/","jadziatuvok","Nicholas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jadziatuvok/","763 products in account","The appeal of Recettear is not immediately obvious. Gameplay which is a lite mesh of dungeon crawl and economic sim, limited and cutesy graphics, irritating sound with untranslated voiceovers… However, it is definitely a case of the sum being greater than the parts.\n\nIt is certainly a game which you can jump straight into – well, once you figure out how to get past the menu. For keyboard users, the select button is not obvious (for the record, it's 'z', which was only discovered after a minute of keyboard mashing…). There is regular and in-context help through the game which establishes the basics. Success, however, requires a lot of experimentation and awareness of what works.\n\nSome parts of the game feel a bit like a cross between Majesty and Diablo. While you control them directly in the dungeon, they buy equipment and make themselves available at their own initiative. It's quite possible to go through the main storyline with several adventurers never becoming available. Also, while you can loan them items, this takes valuable loot space. It's much better to sell to them, but since that's something you can't control, it takes a lot of manipulation (or luck) to get them properly equipped.\n\nThe game's key storyline – paying off a debt weekly through profits from the item shop – lends purpose to the gameplay without completely restricting it. Indeed, the tight time limits provide much of the game's fun and challenge. Choosing to go for a last-ditch dungeon run to pick up high-priced items and risking not having enough time to sell them and make up the debt is just one example of the agonising strategic decisions to be made.\n\nIndeed, weighing up choices is a big part of the game. Stick with an expensive and high-levelled adventurer who can work the tougher dungeons or sacrifice the bigger rewards to build up another who may prove to be more powerful in the long run? Sell a useful item to an adventurer at a discount, or get every possible bit of money from a non-adventurer? Attract a certain type of customer with a dark store, or keep things light and draw another? Sacrifice several items to forge one? For what looks like a very slimmed-down mesh of two types of game, it presents a lot of challenges.\n\nThough failure is very possible, especially on a first run, it's possible to carry on with some of the assets you have collected. This makes the next attempt easier, eliminating a potential frustration.\n\nThe writing is generally good, with some entertaining, and occasionally quite heart-warming, dialogue. The setting is interesting enough, though there is not that much to learn about it. Bring on a sequel! Sound is probably the least impressive aspect, and it gets downright annoying in dungeons. Switch it off and put on your own music.\n\nJust look at the hours played - that's the best endorsement I can give it.","July 4, 2011","true","125.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

To give a brief summary of the gameplay, you are a shopkeeper selling villagers and adventureres items in order to pay back debts. So basically it is the other side of the gameplay in most RPG games which makes it entertaining. The game is rather easy to understand and get a hold of and is realitvely short once you understand it. Paying off the debt isn't actually that big of a challenge, but its fun to work to that. There is also an ARPG mode where you can explore dungeons and get items back to sell.\n\nAlthough the game is pretty fun, it starts to get repetitive near the end. However, due to the shortness of the game, unless you continue on in endless or survival, it is the perfect amount to keep you interested. Overall, fun game to play especially if you like the feeling of making profit (like me. I always go play the role of merchant in games I play and try to horde and maximize profit haha).\n\nRating: 8.6/10\nRecommend: under $5","May 5","true","6.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","4","4","2","0"

Without them, you’d be a nobody – you’d have no sword, no armor, no healing products. Confined to a live of standing behind that counter, all for your benefit.\n\nExcept that, thanks to satirical shopkeep-em-up Recettear: An Item Shop’s Tale, we now know the truth – RPG shopkeepers lead an even more exciting life than their customer heroes. It can be a little too difficult to begin with, but stick at it and you’ll find one of the best RPGs of the year.\n\nWith its delightful mixture of store simulation and dungeon crawling adventure RPG elements, Recettear is a refreshing twist on the usual adventure style RPG.

That's the official story.\n\nWhat Recettear: An Item Shop's Tale is actually about is a young girl abandoned by her father at a young age who is quickly conned by a 'well wishing fairy' who loans her an extraordinary amount of money to allow her to start a tiny business and extorts her with exorbiant amounts of interest. Taking this deal with the devil, she begins earnestly to start this tiny business.\n\nShe begins bright eyed and innocent, only selling items at a fair price and buying items from others for a fair price. However, due to the huge repayments that she is required to pay back, she eventually is driven to profiteering over other people's suffering by charging exorbiant amounts of pix (gold) for simple items during times of famine or desperation.\n\nIn her greed she starts to hire young adventurers to raid dangerous dungeons and taking everything they find. Often putting their lives in dire danger over a few trinkets.\n\nBy the end of the game she has turned from what was a young girl trying to keep her small business afloat to a fraudulent conwoman, taking advantage of the unfortunate townfolk who happened to wander in and revelling in their misfortune.\n\nRecettear: An Item Shop's Tale is an artistic masterwork detailing the temptations of financial immorality.

This game cuts out all the extraneous crud, leaving you with only the very best: treasure hoarding, buying and selling. All the cackling with glee, none of the frustration. Nothing to stand between you and the rapidly increasing numbers, the juggling and sorting of a thousand little items, the excitment and joys of haggling and customer service. It's the game you never knew you needed but always secretly wanted in your heart of hearts. You might stare at the screen in disbelief, thinking no game about just buying and selling items has any right to be so dang fun. But I never stop loving the ring of that cash register, or high-fiving the nearest living human or cat or whatever's nearby when I amass 500,000+ moneys in one day because sweets were on sale, and just sitting and smiling as I enter dungeons with my wizard friend, exploding enemies in bursts of beautiful fire so we can gather more items. It's addictive and fun and basically the best thing ever.\n\nOf course, because this game truly knows the joys of the methodical and obssessive item seller, it knows you'll get burnt out if all you do is sit behind a counter and watch numbers roll, no matter how satsifying and enjoyable that may be for a while. So it's the delightful writing and characters, the brief but highly enjoyable story events, that truly make this one of the best games I've ever played. You've got a lovely cast of truly charming characters keeping things interesting, and stories of just the right size, scale, and length, that add to the game without detracting from it. You've got simple but fairly fun dungeon diving that manages to not be too tedious. And the game is drowning in humor, and some inexplicable, surprising things that can be delightful to stumble across (fish? FISH?!). The game is laughing. You're laughing. We're all laughing. It's even got a corny theme song. How can you not love it, I ask you!? Only some fiend who hates items would hate this game. Begone, fiend! Stick to your mountains and troll slaying, why don't you! Ride away on your dragon! We'll be rolling around on our mountains of cash, partying with our customers, buying awesome new decor and counters and books about DOOOOMSDAAAAY. You won't be missed.\n\nOne thing I was worried about was replay value, and just how long this thing could actually go on and still be fun. My fears, however, were soothed! There is a surprisingly large amount of story content, enough to last you for months (mabye even years, I don't know, I'm not there yet) if you don't binge-play the game too intensely. There's more than one game mode and lots of items to collect and dungeon diving to do and you can just keep trying to get better and better at haggling and learning all the characters and basically there's all sorts of goals you can strive for and stuff that'll keep you busy and invested. So that's good! I was dreading that it would all come to a halt or wind up boring but nope, it just stays awesome forever. Dream come true.\n\nI also like that it's casual enough that I don't have to invest huge amounts of brainpower to it, but deep enough that I can dive in and have fun and it's still a satisfying experience. If you're a busy person you can devote a few hours to it (or even thirty minutes, fifteen minutes, you can save whenver you want) and it probably won't suck your life away. YAY\n\nTL;DR: play this game if you like items and/or selling stuff and/or numbers/moneys","May 21, 2014","true","24.9"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

The fact that it looks like some Peggle level casual game glazed in Moe and sprinkled with babies first market simulator should be more than enough to keep someone away from it were they to just skim the surface of it but believe it or not this is surprisingly immersing.  There are more than enough items in the game to make you have to put in effort to get a hold of all of them and in some cases causing you to work for hours to get  a single item (That's right folks, the dreaded RPG grind is present). Every sale will net you "Merchant experience" which will help you make it further into the 50 levels required to unlock all 29 level bonus which are expansions to your store, dungeon backpack and range of items available for you to buy or craft along with new abilities such as buying items from customers and taking orders in advance.\nBut buy and selling items alone wouldn't make the game all that much fun would it? There are also Six dungeons for you to adventurer into with one of the eight adventurers you've managed to acquire. The floors in the dungeons range from 5 to 100 and the monster vary from dungeon to dungeon and floor to floor making each of them feel different from the last.\nThe dialog is quirky and cute and the gameplay is usually simple but fun.

At times you'll feel filthy rich, and other times, completely helpless. As you run the shop every day, the game teaches you very early on that you must be as efficient as possible to maximize profit and not lose the game (and your home). Even though collection day seems like a far-off hurdle, you must not remain complacent with your business. All it takes is a haggle taken too far, or purchases made too carelessly to ruin you. As Tear counts your 80,000pix fee only to count 79,860pix....\n\nWell, game over. Your payment is void.\n\nMuch like running a business, this game is difficult. You have get it right once. When you lose you have to start over from day one. Fortunately, you and your adventurers retain all levels, experience, and materials you've acquired, except starting with 1000pix again. Unfortunately, you have to run through all the dungeons from the beginning.\n\nThere's a lot to stomach when you first run through the game. Eventually you have to keep track of orders and making sure you have a wide variety of stock. I have notes scribbled on my desk about how one customer never purchases anything at 115%, and how this customer buys at around 125~130% of cost. It can also feel grindy at times when you're in the dungeons fighting enemies.\n\nBut what makes Recettear so warm and inviting is the fact that you are so much a part of this world as much as the next NPC. No matter how hard it is to make ends meet in your store, you are still a participant in the town around you. Your business, customers, and explorations are as real and as stressful as you want them to be. To paraphrase Tear, "It's more of an art than a science. There's no map to follow."\n\nThere are so many variables to take into account. Recettear is not so much a simulation, than it is an experience.","December 31, 2015","true","5.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Forced into opening a shop by a loan shark fairy to pay off your father's huge adventuring debts, you need to pay off increasingly huge installments each week or lose your home as collateral.\n\nThe game starts of simple enough, but as you progress the game will introduce new features, such as customers placing orders for you to fulfil later, and market fluctuations that will allow you to both buy low and sell high, increasing your profits significantly given the right situation. You can even sponsor adventurers to explore dungeons for you, and during these sessions you'll control them as they fight monsters and explore ruins. The main reasons for doing this is to give you ingredients to combine to make better equipment for the shop, and to unlock more adventurers to play as. Some of them will even come to your store and buy better equipment and weapons for themselves, increasing their effectiveness in the optional combat sections of the game. You'll probably even end up giving huge discounts to the adventurers you hire the most just so they'll be powerful and keep coming back for more deals. It's this kind of thing that really adds to the game's charm and helps you care about the side characters as you learn more about them.\n\nThe game is actually very forgiving and failure to meet a payment will send you back to the second day with your inventory, adventurer levels and store reputation intact. This makes something that could have been a very frustrating experience stay fun and oddly relaxing, although it is possible to beat the game in a single run if you feel up for the challenge. Completing the game unlocks the ability to start a new game +, survival mode where you need to pay off increasing amounts of debt each week until it becomes impossible to pay back, or simply carry on where you left off without needing to worry about a deadline each week. Combined with the large amount of items you can discover and create this results in a good replay value, especially for completionists.\n\nAs for downsides, the game is bad at explaining itself from the first tutorial. Tear will start the game off by telling you to set the prices for around 130%, but this will actually anger most of the customers and will cause less people to come to your store from the very beginning. You're actually better off selling for 106% - 112% until the public start liking you more, causing the shoppers to eventually warm up to buying the later and more expensive objects you can unlock, and raising your combo to speed up leveling. Neither the level combo nor town reputation are mentioned in the tutorials, which is strange considering they're actually very important to succeeding at the game and it can be frustrating until you realize they are both major factors in your progress.\n\nThe dungeon exploration is also very repetitive after a while, but is necessary in order to unlock more of the side stories and characters to come to your store. Since merchant levels are more important to success than your adventurers' combat levels you'll probably ignore the dungeons after a certain amount of time to play the markets, especially after you unlock items in the market that make the payouts from these sessions seem small in comparison.\n\nIf you're looking for an original take on the traditional JRPG setting and like the idea of running a store in a fantasy realm then I'd strongly recommend picking Recettear up.","January 16","true","20.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I have to admit that when I bought this game, I did it purely on a whim one day when it was on sale, and I really was not expecting much. But this game really ended up surprising me, and in a very good way.\n\nYou are Recette, a young girl who ends up being forced to repay her fathers debts and are accompanied by Tear, the fairy who was sent to recover the debts payment. Together the two of you open up a store, Recettear, so that you can make enough money to repay what you owe. The gameplay can be roughly divided into two parts: store management and dungeon crawling.\n\nEach day in the game is divided into 4 time slots and you can choose what to do for each one: go to town to hit the market to stock up on goods, visit the guild to grab an adventurer for some dungeon crawling or tend to your store. Store management is the main aspect of the game and in my own opinion the most fun. It also has a surprising depth to it. Make sure to buy stock when price is low and sell items when their value is higher. Choose what to put up for sale. Barter with you customers and fulfill their special orders. Change the look of your store to suit it to certain customers preferences.\n\nThere are several adventurers you will meet and that you can take with you to do some dungeon crawling. There are several dungeons with multiple levels and bosses in the game, and exploring them will get you several items you can sell at your store or use in recipes to create better items. Exploring the dungeons also serves to advance the story which, without spoiling anything major, actually continues far beyond when you have finally managed to pay your fathers debts.\n\nThe game has a really interesting story and likable characters. Cute is really the best way to describe the way the game looks. A special mention must be given to the games english translation which is really well done. Once your debt is paid for the first time, some new game modes are unlocked, and the game has a considerable replayability value if your goal is to get all items in the game (doing so will require starting a new game once for each adventurers loyalty item). It should be noted that it is possible to start a new game and carry over all the money, items and store upgrades from your other saves. This is helpful when only trying to get each adventurers loyalty item since you do not have to worry about making enough money to pay off the debt in the early phase of the game.\n\nThere are two things I feel I should mention though: in my experience, dungeon crawling can be very tiresome and repetitive which is why I feel this is the least interesting aspect of the game. This is especially problematic if you want to get all items, which requires doing A LOT of grinding. The shop management aspect can become something you can do almost mechanically once you've upgraded the shop to the max, unlocked all possible items in the market and have gotten used to each customers characteristics when bartering. In my opinion this doesn't take any of the fun away from this aspect though.\n\nFinally, to end this review. If you do not like anything with a cute/anime aesthetic, or if you are looking for an action packed game do not buy this. To everyone else looking for a nice little way of occupying your time, I can only fully recommend it.","January 31, 2014","true","68.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

If so, then Recettear: An Item Shop’s Tale is what you’ve so desired. And it IS an indie game, which again shows that, as usual, the AAA games industry can’t be counted on to touch the part of us which wants to play as a pretty little girl.\n\nOne of this game’s taglines is “Capitalism, ho!” Recette, the protagonist and girl, says it with a big smile, and her eyes closed. Or maybe that’s how I remember her. With her open, maroon vest, green tie, belt buckle, and those two, large, red beads, maintaining strands of her caramel-colored hair in a tail beside her head. Plus that mortified facial expression of hers, whenever she hears opinions disparaging her business. She is so young.\n\nThe game, though. There’s more to it than those tan sleeves, over arms which she keeps parallel to her sides, with her palms wide open, giving the appearance of an angel. There is, indeed, more to the game. For example: does she live alone? Sort of. She lives with a fairy. Her mother seems to have passed away. And as for her dad, he seems to have abandoned her, and with lots of debt. You must be the godlike father she evidently never had. You must take possession of her body and ensure she pays off her dad’s debt so as to avoid being dispossessed of everything except, perhaps, her clothes.\n\nAlas, that form of losing leads to one of the game’s weak points. For if you do lose (if you can’t pay your in-game debtors), you start from the “beginning,” with many of the advantages you’ve accrued in your defunct playthrough. This has you suffer what was already an uninspired dungeon crawler even more, as you’re sort of playing it all over again. It is by this and other means that you get to see little Recette running around, pit pat pit pat. By these you get to see her buy valuable items at low prices and sell them at high prices. You get to watch her go to sleep and awake, and reveal her innermost thoughts to her fairy friend.

Your dad is a low-life who left you with his loan having to pay it off with large sums of Pix (game currency) otherwise you're homeless. This snarky Fairy (Tear) bosses you around and you have to pay her so much money at the end of each week (if you don't have the money at the end of the week, "Game Over"). You have to go out which means your shop will have to be closed for a period of time, going to town to buy/delve further into the story takes up some time but going dungeon diving takes up a lot of time and the number of things you can carry are small... Don't Die (kind of die).\n\nOnce you beat the game... beat the game? You don't beat the game, you still have to make money to keep food on the table and logs in the fireplace, you keep your shop running and you progress through the story on Endless Mode, heck you can go through it again on New Game+. You most likely won't get all the Adventures your first time through (did you think you were fighting, you're way too dainty for that). Just a note, if you notice you're not going to make the loan payment by the end of the week get all the stuff you know will sell and go dungeon diving like crazy, you'll keep those things when the game pretends you were just dreaming you did all that. You'll also keep your Merchant levels and 'basically' everything else except your money. You're able to change the look, size, and layout of your store, plus vending machine so you can sell more items during the day.\n\nI absolutely love this game, I wish I could play more and hopefully soon I will have a chance to get the rest of the adventurers. It's rather short if you play it hardcore like I did, it feels like I played a lot but the number of hours I played doesn't match up to the number of days that sped through my mind (talking game time, not real). At first, I was surprised by the amount of Pix I needed each week but I managed to get the game clear after the second go through. The game is cute and sometimes Recette can be annoying when she repeats the same phrases or a customer says things that is rude to her then she's all upset with herself but it was the customer who was in the wrong, 'Sell something to you for below it's base price? Woman, you don't risk your life for me, get out of my store!' I do believe Tear will tell you this also, if one of your adventurers come to buy an upgrade sell it cheaper than you would to someone else. You can't just give them gear, you can buy gear and put it on them while in the dungeon but they have to come to the store and purchase it themselves to own, giving it to them to wear while in the dungeon swaps what they currently have on for the new gear which takes up space in your bags.\n\nSo go now, build your item shop for the townsfolk and adventurers, be the person they turn to to get everything they need, send people into battle to fight for your items, and for goodness sake don't forget to save!","July 18, 2014","true","22.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game has very anime stylized aesthetics that will, In my mind somewhat unfairly, turn some people off to it right away, and the graphics remind me of the latest 2D Final Fantasy games. The game breaks down to you becoming a shopkeeper unwillingly and needing to buy/find/sell/and haggle in order to pay the bills and stop the bank from taking your family's house. The game feels to me like animal crossing in a way, as you can customize your store/item layout often placing things in the window to draw the attention of the people on the street, that and the fact that you start out having to repay a massive debt. The game has a very interesting dungeon system where you can hire adventurers that you take control of to go into these dungeons and fight monsters/bosses in order to obtain rare items for your store, the dungeons play out like the original Legend of Zelda game with that kind of fighting, and a  randomized dungeon each time you enter, making it less tedious if you fail the boss fights and or fail to escape. The game plays solid and starts out quite easy but almost immediately ramps up the difficulty making you have to be more cautious with haggling and be more efficient with your time if you want to keep playing. The game is fun and has very few drawbacks other than the rather sharp learning curve after your first few payments (and the dumb little girl who always tries to haggle you down below your bottom line), but even that doesn't detract from it too much as you keep your stock when you fail so you can start over with a leg up next time. My experience with this game was rather positive and it is VERY addicting, just like the games it seems to take inspiration from. If you can get it for a good price it's definitely worth your time.","March 9, 2014","true","17.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Recettear tells the story of Recette, a young girl whose dad disappeared leaving behind a massive debt for her to deal with. In order to pay the debt back and save her home from being claimed by the bank, she converts it into her own shop to earn the money.\n\nThe game combines two main gameplay elements: operating your shop, and dungeon diving to find items to sell or use to craft something even more valuable. Running the shop is very fun, surprisingly so even, and personally I found the dungeons to be fun, at times fairly challenging, and a great to mix things up from time to time. The characters of Recettear are also loveable, with some very charming and quirky personalities, which make for some seriously funny moments. Overall a great game, and definitely worth the price (especially if you buy it on sale)!\n\n","April 22, 2014","true","168.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

What I found was not only a most excellent simulator of that strange and wonderous machine known as the marketplace, but also cleverly interwoven simulations of the murder-and-riches-filled hole in the ground and the confusing morass that is society. Recettear is a game for our era. It explores all the great questions of our era through the saga of that iconic hero of the West, the starving entrepreneur. It touches upon such themes as love, loss, homelessness and hunger while also seeking to transcend them through good and honest capitalism. Yet most importantly, it touches upon the most wonderous power of free exchange, namely that two people can each better their lives through the simple modicum of trade.

So your dad is out to save the world, cool right? WRONG! Maybe it would be cool, ya know, if his broke ♥♥♥ didn't get himself killed by a dragon trying to pay off a loan shark. Anyways, this leaves you alone with the choice of having everything you know and own reposessed, or working for a slave-driving fairy in an item shop she puts together in your house so you're not forced to live in a card board box. No really, if you don't pay back her increasing payment deadlines, you will end up in a cardboard box, enjoy the building pressure.\n\nRecettear in a nut shell is like I said before a bartering RPG. You constantly sell items hopeing to have enough to pay back your next deadline. The value of items constantly changes as time goes by and the story is fun with a 'special' kind of humor. I enjoyed it, but it's not for everyone. You work for the merchant guild, but there is an adventurers guild. The adventurers in said guild can give you a chance to go into short dungeons as a chance to gain more items at a 100% profit margine. You can customize your shop a little and there's other little neat optional things to do aswell, but you can discover those yourself.\n\nMy entire main story experiance took like 9 hours, I had to get the swing of things at first, but after I caught some momentum it was a breeze keeping up with every deadline amount including the last one before the deadline is a problem. I really only entered the dungeon twice, maybe 3 times. Just long enough to beat 2 bosses, which were both easy. I mostly just sold items at a great profit margine using increased priced items and did more then fine speeding right on through the game. Definatly worth the $10 I spent!

How did they get that magical "God-Slaying" Sword of Summoning Swedeish Super Models? Well Recettear, tries its best to give you an idea. You go from punching and slicing your way through a more traditonal randomly genereated dungeon crawl, to get better and more expensive items, But then you spend the rest of the time going through town, meeting new people (especialy new adventures to help you with said dungeon crawl), and most importantly barting and haggling with the best of them as you run your item shop.\n\nAnd the iteam shop gameplay is just as engaging as the combat, as would be expected for a game about an item shop.  The game gives you freedom to express however you want your iteam shop to be. You're the one to decied what goes in the shop window display case, if that old muffler is too tacky etc. And the game does not punish you either way, even providing a fancy little graphic which tells you how Plain/Guady, Dark/Light your shop is respectivly. Which of course attracts diffrent people to your shop and diffrent adventures. And then comes the sweet, sweet revenge that Recettear provides for long time RPG fans. It is up to you to barter and sell your items, no longer will you be the one to be rob blind by the crazy old man that needs 1,000 Gold Dragon's Feet to get your phoenix down, or potion, or stick of better hitting. Now it is you that is profiting from these adventures and excavations, not through life lessons learned but through gold and wealth! And the game does push you to be a good salesmen though, be too agressive with your bartering and you will lose costumers, be too leinent and try to make everyone happy? You won't make enough money by the end of your dead line to keep the shop open!\n\nAll in all though Recettear is a fun little game, does it have the best graphics, sound design, etc? No of course it does not, but it follows true to the type of game it is trying to be and these design elements help compliment the cute and yes even whimiscal feel about the game. In the end Recettear is funny, happy, cute and unbashfully selfaware of its self. But that does not stop it from telling you a story about friendship, and from being honest and real with you as well. What else can I really say? Try the demo, if you like the feel of it well then you got nothing to lose now do you? I belive firmly that the pricepoint it is it is fair, and well the rest is up to you.\n\nThis is Griffin reminding you something that Reccettear is proud to hold as its mantra;\n\nCapitalism Ho!","January 30, 2014","true","6.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you don't like one of the three, don't take part in it, that's what makes the game so interesting. If you simply want to experience the semi-complex sales and marketting system, by all means. If you just want to kill everything and earn money that way, that's fine too. Maybe you want to just delve into alchemy and fusion; by all means. Or maybe you just want to engage yourself with the deceptively unique characters that the game has to offer, you can do that (though it'd be rather difficult on its own).\n\nThis is the type of game that will definitely take a bite out of your life, and whether you are into Japanese games or not is irrelevant. Recettear is a game that is what you make it, and let's you play the way you want to play, and it is certainly worth a play.","November 11, 2015","true","14.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

But heroes are not alone; they need to find friends to fight with and shops to buy weapons, armor and healing items. This game dares to ask "what if you were the NPC standing behind the desk in the item shops?"\n\nYes, you read that right, in Recettear you play as Recette Lemongrass, the cute loli who runs an item shop to repay her father’s gigantic debt. So if you're looking for a big adventure you might want to look somewhere else, but if you're looking for a good administration game then you've come to the right place. Even though it's labeled as an RPG, Recettear is mostly a strategy game: you must know what to buy, what to sell, at what price, when to open your shop, when to buy items and when to go to dungeons. You must do everything to make sure you can pay the required amount of your father's debt by the end of the week. As you level up, you unlock new abilities such as taking orders, fusing items, customizing and expanding your store, so you won't be doing the same all over and over.\n\nIn general, Recettear offers a very plant experience and a good challenge; however it does have a few downsides. First of all, the dungeons despite being randomized will feel very repetitive after a while: in every floor you will be running in endless narrow corridors and square rooms, making the enemies and the layout (which are also repeated several times) the only variation. The postgame doesn't have much to offer either, aside from the survival and + modes all you will get is a 100 floor dungeon that continues the story but introduces no new enemies or layouts and a 30 floor dungeon where you'll be dead before you notice even if your adventurer is level 99 (but hey, at least the later offers a bit of challenge). After you clear the main quest you don't need to pay any more debts so running your shop, which is the main aspect of the game, becomes pointless.\n\nIn summary: despite the dungeon system not being the best, the shop managing is really well done and anyone who enjoys administration games should try Recettear.","October 18, 2015","true","84.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This Japanese Indie (doujin) game has been translated very well and with loving detail.  The voices are still in Japanese (left unsubbed, but their vocals basically match the dialogue text anyway), but it doesn't take away from enjoying the game at all.  The item shop mechanics are simple but engaging, with challenges such as a change in trends and item value during certain times.  The dungeon crawler mechanics are also simple, with a top-down view of your character as you explore and defeat monsters.  There is also a way to fuse items in order to sell things that aren't regularly offered in stores.  Graphics aren't glamorous but acceptable, which is great for my laptop (not optimized for gaming)!\n\nThe game is, overall, fairly simple and not very complicated.  I think it's perfect for it's price and quality.  There is even a replay value to it for all the completionists out there.

It's actually a really fun game that is done very well. The graphics aren't amazing, but they're definitely acceptable, and the game has a lot of humor and good design. It's kind of like a mix between Animal Crossing, Torchlight/Diablo, and that Lemonade Stand game you might have played in elementary school. Anyways, it's an interesting blend of genres to me, and the game has a lot of personality. I've found myself playing it for hours a day the last few days. I'm not sure I'd strongly recommend it at the suggested $20 price point, but if you can find it on sale, pick it up. Also, you might want to check out the demo. You might find yourself pulled in by its charm like I have.\n\nAlso, disregard the time played on here.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Xanaset/recommended/70400/","Xanaset","Caketown","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Xanaset/","225 products in account","Ah... what to say about this.\n\nSome good dialogue?  I mean... the game is about an item shop, and you'd hope that the designers would come up with some kind of mechanic to make that more interesting than it sounds?  Except they don't.  You're an item shop owner, and you sell things.  Initially that was enough for me, because the writing was pretty good and funny, and there was this sort of bare-bones dungeon-crawling side quest that helped spice things up.\n\nThe problem I had with the game is that it flat-out lies to you.  There is a tutorial at the beginning of the game that actually tells you what the sweet spot for sales gouging is, in terms of price percentage.  So you set out on your epic quest of consumerism only to find that eventually people dont have enough money to buy the items you need to meet your monthly financial goals.

I mean... the game is about an item shop, and you'd hope that the designers would come up with some kind of mechanic to make that more interesting than it sounds?  Except they don't.  You're an item shop owner, and you sell things.  Initially that was enough for me, because the writing was pretty good and funny, and there was this sort of bare-bones dungeon-crawling side quest that helped spice things up.\n\nThe problem I had with the game is that it flat-out lies to you.  There is a tutorial at the beginning of the game that actually tells you what the sweet spot for sales gouging is, in terms of price percentage.  So you set out on your epic quest of consumerism only to find that eventually people dont have enough money to buy the items you need to meet your monthly financial goals.  This is because if you are not really generous in your pricing, your customers never "level up" (something the game never tells you can occur).

You can't really summarize this game; it's got too many great things going for it, and attempts to do so generally result in disbelief that a game like that can be as entertaining as claimed.\n\nThe game's about running an item shop. Initially you have to pay off your debt but once that's done you enter "Endless Mode" and can enjoy being a merchant (and also running through dungeons to get loot!) to your heart's content. Don't be disheartened by failure; even if you fail to pay off your debt, you'll still get a second chance.\n\nGood luck getting 100% completion; the post-endgame content is ridiculously beefy, and filling out your item encyclopedia requires at least six or seven playthroughs.

My cold cynical heart actually had a pulse when i made this realization that i was playing a game and enjoying it throughly. The games mixture of simple combat and simple store mechanics entised me to play on. Though the combat is lacking to simply push button 1 to light attack and button 2 to special attack it had a nice retro top down zelda feel to it. Not saying its perfect since the basic attack randomly crits enemys (should have a pattern or be user determined when activated -_-) but overall fun. Then theres the other core aspect of the game where you are running a store, not the most exciting thing in the world but lemonade tycoon feel. Sure you can sell stuff safely at 120% of the original price but trying to sqeeuze out that extra 1-2% out of your souless buyers feels good.

Every week you have to pay a debt so you do not get a game over.  After several weeks of paying the debt you win!

For me, this game is perfect collection of genres, combining a shop sim, a dungeon crawling action RPG, and visual novel style segments all into one game.\n\nThe basics of the plot is that you are Recette, a young girl who's adventurer father disappears and leave behind a crippling debt that threatens to take away your home and everything in it. So you along with Tear, the fairy loan officer responsible for you paying the debt back, open an item shop. From there on out you can go out into town to buy stock and meet people, or hire an adventurer to bring items you can sell back from dungeons.\n\nThe difficulty curve can be intense, with your payments going up exponentially. However, I would consider this to be a medium difficulty game. Neither the shop segments or the dungeons are too difficult, though they still can be hard and tricky.\n\nThere are 8 adventurers that you can unlock over the course of the game for the dungeon portions and each has a unique combat style and abilities from one another, so there is plenty of variety whether you want to change things up or find a style that suits you best. There are also 6 dungeons, each one harder that the first but providing better drops progressively.\n\nThe plot is presented in very cute visual novel style segments and is quite light and relaxed despite the goal to pay off an ever increasing debt. I find it fits the medium difficulty game play segments very well. To trigger most of the story segments requires you to leave the shop and waste a chunk of your time, but the characters are all unique, fun and quirky. It's also the only way to unlock some of your potential adventures, so it can be worth your time.\n\nAll in all, I love this game. It's not to difficult to pick up and has a lot of content available so you can keep playing for hours.","December 24, 2013","true","29.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I mean... the game is about an item shop, and you'd hope that the designers would come up with some kind of mechanic to make that more interesting than it sounds?  Except they don't.  You're an item shop owner, and you sell things.  Initially that was enough for me, because the writing was pretty good and funny, and there was this sort of bare-bones dungeon-crawling side quest that helped spice things up.\n\nThe problem I had with the game is that it flat-out lies to you.  There is a tutorial at the beginning of the game that actually tells you what the sweet spot for sales gouging is, in terms of price percentage.  So you set out on your epic quest of consumerism only to find that eventually people dont have enough money to buy the items you need to meet your monthly financial goals.  This is because if you are not really generous in your pricing, your customers never "level up" (something the game never tells you can occur).  If they never level up, they never earn a higher cash cap to spend in your store.  If they cant do that, they can't buy the items you need to sell in order to not lose.  I was about 95% of the way through the game when on the last month I came to the realization that victory was impossible (and sad to say the game does not have a tremendous amount of replayability).\n\nI was pretty irritated that the game instructed me in a method of play that was counter-productive given the hidden underlying system on which the game is built.  However, even having said that, I'd have to say I recommend this title, because it was different, and interesting, and well written, with several likeable characters.  I would simply recommend that if you are going to play this game, you look up a guide that will explain exactly how the system works before you embark on your capitalistic journey, and then simply ignore everything that is said during the mandatory tutorial.","June 3, 2013","true","10.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Every time you happen to fail your quest to save your store from bankruptcy, you get to keep your experience points from the previous go and the next attempt will be a whole lot easier afterwards. You simply cannot fail if you just keep failing long enough, so experts will complete the game in one go, while beginners will slowly learn by getting stronger from failure.

She originally created the shop in order to shoulder the large debt that her father had built up over the years.  Tear, the other character the game gets its name from, is a debt collector that helps manage the store so that you can maximize your profits.\n\nWhile this seems like just a boring management game from my description, it actually does have moments where you can go out and fight monsters.  Recette can hire heroes to help her collect items to sell in her store.  The game turns into an action RPG for those moments with gameplay that's not dissimilar to the top-down entries in the Legend of Zelda franchise.\n\nThis game has colorful characters that populate the city.

I wasn't sure what to expect when I saw this game, but I bought it because it was on sale and seemed moderatly interesting.. How wrong I was. Monderatly? This game is amazing! It's such a refershing change on typical RPG's!\n\nOwning your own store is pretty interesting, you have to keep earning an increased amount every week or you're screwed. Seems boring right? But somehow bartering prices for both purchases and sales with your customers is rather exciting (Except when a certain little girl tries shopping). As you progress in levels, new features are added like taking orders for item.\n\nFor item gathering itself, you have the option to buy items from the Market and Mechants Guild, aswell as items customers are trying to sell. However the best and obviously most fun option, is hiring an adventurer and going out to dungeons to slay monsters, find chests and collecting items to sell in your shop. The combat system is EXTREMELY basic, you have your movement keys, an attack button and a special attack button.. Thats it, but somehow the combat still feels great and rewarding. While you start out with a single adventurer, you eventually lock others of a different class, each with their own moves and differences. Whats cooler is these aren't just random characters you fight with, each one of them has their own personality. You see them at the town center, pub, church or even shopping inside your store.\n\nAnd these adventurers aren't the only ones with personalitys! There are quite a few characters in the game, and while not all of them have names, you can see a general personality and gain familiarity with them. The random man will typically buy goods for this much, while the little girl won't do it for more than this. You can see aspects of their daily lives in town, and with the familiarity you can actually get feelings towards people shopping, good or bad! You'll know this person likes to haggle, these people are cheap or these people will accept higher prices.\n\nThis is a great twist, and while the idea of it might not sound great, it is. It brings a fresh and great idea with excellent exacution, with an art style that never goes bad! Even $20 is a great price for a game!","January 16, 2014","true","8.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You can buy and resell items from the marketplace, or from people or you can go and do dungeons to get items without having to pay for them.  The idea of the game is to earn a profit while keeping your customers happy so that they will return for repeat business.

Recettear is about management, of both time and resources, and it's good at that. It also has an overview-grid action RPG-mechanic that isn't as interesting and at times gets pretty tedious, but it's still head and shoulders above average.\n\nThe real draw here is the store. Not only is the shopkeeping gameplay plenty addictive for its beautiful aesthetics and atmosphere, but it's also very understanding about difficulty. Every time you happen to fail your quest to save your store from bankruptcy, you get to keep your experience points from the previous go and the next attempt will be a whole lot easier afterwards. You simply cannot fail if you just keep failing long enough, so experts will complete the game in one go, while beginners will slowly learn by getting stronger from failure.

I'm not sure I'd strongly recommend it at the suggested $20 price point, but if you can find it on sale, pick it up. Also, you might want to check out the demo. You might find yourself pulled in by its charm like I have.\n\nAlso, disregard the time played on here.

I know a few people with this game, and wel all play it differently.  I tend to focus solely on my storefront, one person I know spends all his time in dungeons, and yet another has something of a 60/40 mix between the two, leaning towards dungeon play.\n\nOne of the things that makes Recettear such a great game is that all of these playstyles are completely viable.  The item shop really is yours, and you can do whatever you want with it, provided you make the proper payments on time.  Want to make a dark cabal, where ancient artifacts of mystical Lovecraftian horrors are traded behind closed doors?  Done.  Want to make a homemaker's paradise, with clothes and food and tools as far as the eye can see?  Easy enough to put together.  Or maybe you'd rather outfit adventurers to go expeditioning with you, offering them low prices on advanced gear?  Great idea.\n\nRecettear manages to give you more empowerment than most store simulation games, and that's only half of what it is.  Its dungeon-crawling aspect is, to me, a little contrived, and not as well executed as, say, Torchlight, but it certainly gets the job done, and if loot gives you joy, you'll probably find the later dungeons particularly pleasing anyway.\n\nAnd let's not gloss over the art and writing, both of which are some of the cutest available, anywhere, ever.  This is the game that coined the word "Yepperoni" which is probably the most important English word I know.  If you're not into cute stuff, however, or you think it's lame or contrived, you really should pass, because this game is cute before it's anything else.\n\nTo nitpick, my one gripe is that this game does not support any full-screen resolutions in widescreen aspect ratios, but that's essentially to be expected of doujinsoft.  For me, however, the game is nearly perfect in all other regards, so in my eyes it is all but a must-play.","September 14, 2014","true","21.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The gameplay is repetitive, the dungeon crawling requires excessive amounts of grinding to gather materials, and the light-novel/anime style is probably a turn off to some.\n\nIn practice though, Recettear is an unexpected hit, and a real hidden gem. Recette herself is adorable and everything she does just makes players want to love her more. The concept is fresh and unusual: run your very own item shop, pay off the loan-shark fairy! Play smart, watch for special deals, buy low and sell high to try to maximize your profit! Balance between the general approval of your customers and your profit margins to maximize revenue!\n\nNot only is the concept of running one's own item shop interesting on its own right, but the game can be unexpectedly challenging. Many players fail to pay off the debt and have to use the game's "mulligan" system to complete it (or mulligan by save-scumming) because they got too greedy seeing a deadline approaching, or because they failed to account for a potential drop in an item's value.\n\nEarlier I mentioned that the dungeoneering is pretty bad, and that's true to an extent: there aren't many dungeons, the loot is sporadic and it can take lots of materials to make just one item, and the combat is perhaps too simplistic. Yet there are a slew of characters available, each with their own quirks, and exploring the dungeons can help reward a player with new characters, thereby increasing the amount of interactions.\n\nSpeaking of interactions, these characters interact very frequently. The writing is light-hearted, and conversations do not feel like they drag on for any absurd length of time (they can all be skipped as well). Yet at the same time, there are little mysteries about the world that make players want to know more about the world and the people in it. The characters, all in all, are a huge part of what gives Recettear its charm.\n\nSure, there are a lot of fridge logic moments - areas where a player just wants to say "hey, that shouldn't happen because..." but for the most part, none of these obstruct the game's flow.\n\nOverall, Recettear is a charming little adventure. It's not the most adrenaline pumping adventure, but one can't help but admire how well put together and cute the game is. I highly recommend it for anyone looking for something light-hearted yet difficult enough to warrant paying attention to.\n\nSo go - with a little luck, hard work, and the spirit of capitalism, how hard can it be to exploit your friends and pay back the loan-shark fairy?","February 14, 2015","true","56.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

They probably either focus a lot or not enough about the sum of all parts. I'm going to only explain why I personally think this game turns from good into great.\n\nDungeon crawling is considered awful and/or boring for most people I know. They like shooters or some sports games. A few actually like RPGs. And Recettear is definitely a good RPG with a fair amount of simplistic dungeon crawling. It's also interesting how its simplicity aids the game's concept, because if you're anything like me you'll actually like more the character's shop management than going into dungeons to sell the crap out of what a monster unwittingly thought was fun to be lugging around for no reason.\n\nIn other words, I think the whole shop management deal is what makes Recettear a good game. If I were to judge it solely on the dungeon crawler aspect I'd tell you that I've played many considerably better dungeon crawlers. Heck, I'd even tell you that Rogue and a great part of it's infinite spawn of clones and wannabes is a better game on dungeon crawling alone. But the shop management, from what goods you'll display on that particular day, the kind of display furniture you're using, and even the little feeling of having sold the junk that some monster considered valuable enough to carry for astronomical values to the masses of curious customers... is only 14.99 away from you.\n\nLet me sweeten the deal here. Carpe Fulgur, the publisher, is one of those that normally has its games featured on discounts on Steam. It's not uncommon to drop around 60% of the price from time to time. And you can't say that the cute-as-kittens-and-fun-as-(games I suppose?) protagonist and its struggles don't capture your heart to the point where you will want to help her get the funds for the next loan she NEEDS to pay, and then see the story evolve gradually with the other characters she gets involved with.\n\nAlso, you get to see the witty translation of whatever the original game had in its original language of (I assume) Japanese into "Capitalism, HO!", Recette's happy money-making battlecry, among other instant classics. There's plenty of humour to read in the dialogues, and sometimes you'll think that you're also paying for a comic book with all of the grins, smiles and even laughter that you'll find yourself performing. Do you still think 14,99 is too much?\n\nThere's also a demo for the unbelieving masses to try. That's, of course, the safe approach. Try that demo and you'll see you'll want to buy the full game. If you're worried about the investment, wait for the sales, often Midweek on Steam, or maybe even the big summer or winter sales. You can thank yourself for the investment later.","February 10, 2015","true","44.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I wasn't sure what to expect when I saw this game, but I bought it because it was on sale and seemed moderatly interesting.. How wrong I was. Monderatly? This game is amazing! It's such a refershing change on typical RPG's!\n\nOwning your own store is pretty interesting, you have to keep earning an increased amount every week or you're screwed. Seems boring right? But somehow bartering prices for both purchases and sales with your customers is rather exciting (Except when a certain little girl tries shopping). As you progress in levels, new features are added like taking orders for item.\n\nFor item gathering itself, you have the option to buy items from the Market and Mechants Guild, aswell as items customers are trying to sell. However the best and obviously most fun option, is hiring an adventurer and going out to dungeons to slay monsters, find chests and collecting items to sell in your shop. The combat system is EXTREMELY basic, you have your movement keys, an attack button and a special attack button.. Thats it, but somehow the combat still feels great and rewarding. While you start out with a single adventurer, you eventually lock others of a different class, each with their own moves and differences. Whats cooler is these aren't just random characters you fight with, each one of them has their own personality. You see them at the town center, pub, church or even shopping inside your store.\n\nAnd these adventurers aren't the only ones with personalitys! There are quite a few characters in the game, and while not all of them have names, you can see a general personality and gain familiarity with them. The random man will typically buy goods for this much, while the little girl won't do it for more than this. You can see aspects of their daily lives in town, and with the familiarity you can actually get feelings towards people shopping, good or bad! You'll know this person likes to haggle, these people are cheap or these people will accept higher prices.\n\nThis is a great twist, and while the idea of it might not sound great, it is. It brings a fresh and great idea with excellent exacution, with an art style that never goes bad! Even $20 is a great price for a game!","January 16, 2014","true","8.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

One of which is a thief that starts out pretty much as a meanie-face, and another that's a worthless and penniless adventurer wanna-be that'll ask for your stuff for around 75% of the base price (meaning you lose money when you sell to him unless you dungeon crawl with him to get items, and he'll use the items he gets from you) when he shops at your store.\n\nEverything is cute to disguise the horribly realistic scenario of children being forced to pay their parents debts for the rest of their life, unless they're good with CAPITALISM, HO!\n\nIt's got an amusing dungeon system, though people complain about the hit boxes being bad (I haven't noticed it) or having to always attack in a linear manner (you don't, quite a number of the attacks hit everything in a half circle in front of you) they aren't real problems unless you're very, very rigid and perfectionist. It's tedious, yes, but what dungeon crawling game isn't? I have yet to run into one that doesn't become a tediously boring thing after a dozen or so floors, and this one has dialogue, plot, and new characters interspersed throughout it to keep things at least a little interesting.\n\nIf you don't like ditzy characters, cutesy dialogue, and a bunch of anime-esque plots then this probably isn't the game for you, but if you've been watching anime for a while and like to sink some time into dungeon crawling without it being the only thing to do in a game, then this game might just be for you.\n\nSome people complain about "having to do things over and over again" and I can only say one thing: too bad, so sad. Darn near every game is like that, and always has been.

This is why male heroes make up such a collectively large proporition of protagonists in video games and all mediums of entertainment; books, movies, lolcat memes (not the norm) are all forms of entertainment that attribute widely to the popular - and I emphasize popular- social stigma of society.\n\nExamples are here:\nFifty Shades of Grey: Super hot stuff\nWhite men can't jump: Self explanatory\nLocat memes: Desire to anthropomorphize ourselves into kittens.\n\nNow let's focus on Recettear again.\nLet's say 'hypothetically' that Recettear is 'different' from the norm. Instead of a strong male lead, you now have a female lead who starts off relatively inept (Not an opinion against females, just what the character starts off as). Her only benefits being that she doesn't need to eat, or atleast from what we can see, and that she can follow a schedule better than any student or adult in the known world. Also, she's an anime girl: the truest and strongest form of feminist pro propagandanism.\n\nSo what gives?\nHow are we supposed to connect with this game if there isn't anything remarkably 'interesting' to connect to?\n\nWell, that's the essential difference in video games; it doesn't need to because video games aren't all words or film.\n\nHere's why:\n\nRecettear is absolutely blossoming in charm from its art style (animesque) to the gameplay (finances 101). It's a mix mash of japanese tropes/culture,dungeon crawling and finances. Though, I wouldn't go so far as call it an RPG because it's remarkably hard to connect with the main character, but it serves well in its main drive of gameplay; the flesh of the gameplay is the retrieving and selling of products with a hint of dungeonesque elements, specifically you need to get sellable materials from the dungeon to sell. And boy, you want to sell, sell and sell because debts in game come in fast. In fact, never has procrastination on debt lead to such dire consequences where a little a girl gets evicted from her home to the doghouse, though if that's your thing...\n\nHowever, in the end, the frantic nature of gameplay makes each decision a calculated decision to maximize profits from retrieving and selling. Thus, you will want to haggle everyone despite your best conciousness;\na little old lady, how nice! Sell the bagel at 500% mark up. It's a deal she can't refuse, literally! (Starving old lady)\n\nIt's a game that will teach you how exploitative you can be and you know what? That's the best form of video game.\n","September 17, 2014","true","4.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The start is a bit slow and the combat could be better, but it picks up quickly as the days go by. The story of the game is all about you being the daughter of an infamous adventurer who left a massive debt in his name, and you're the only one who can clear it. With the help of the business fairy, Tear, you'll work through a month to pay off the debt... or you'll have to sell your house!\n\nGood things about this game:\n\n+Good music\n+Unique theme\n+Various items to find and a unique system for equipping your adventurer with items\n+Various characters to run through the dungeon with\n+Dialog is interesting, if not a little childish due to the age of the main character\n+Beating the game, or failing to do so, will allow you to 'restart' with all your items and 'Merchent Level' in tact. This lets you get up in money much faster than you would do so at the start, but you don't keep any of your money or your progress through events.\n+Decent end-game content that makes it worth while to try and get what you need\n+Haggling is a pretty neat concept, though it takes practice to get it down right.\n+Characters are interesting and have their own unique style, in dungeons and just in general.\n\nBad things about this game:\n\n-Combat could definitely be better, with hit-scan and certain abilities. Some characters are just notably better than others.\n-Events are picky. You have to know when you need to go to places in town to get certain chat boxes, which can affect how you get items, characters, or unlock a new location. This causes you to lose a 'block' of time, too, and not all events do anything.\n-One girl will come in and sell you something and refuse to buy anything. She'll always refuse to sell at 100% of the item's price, too. 200% is the minimum for her, and there's no way to get rid of her after she appears. You can refuse to buy it, but this messes up your combo and makes you level up slower.\n-Getting the 'true card' for characters takes too long. True cards let you use your adventurer without having to find them in the story, which can be helpful for clearing dungeons again. But getting the True Card requires you to beat the game and use that adventurer the most. (More than any other adventurer, that is, for that month.)  To get another one, you have to play the game /again/ and use a different adventurer.\n-There's little 'stats' to the game that you can see, at least in my experience. There /are/ stats, but you can't really see them except when your adventurer is buying an item that is better than what they have. You can't even see how much people like you to adjust your prices.\n\nDespite the lengthy part of the 'bad stuff', I really just offered more explanation as to what and why it was bad. This game is still amazing to play, especially if you like dungeon crawlers. The 'bad' things are just my opinion, anyways, and the good things weren't as descriptive because I don't want to spoil anything!","October 8, 2014","true","56.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are two major modes of playing: haggling with people and running your item shop, and adventuring in the game's procedurally-generated dungeons.\n\nThe Item Shop  is the game's primary mode of play (given that it's part of the title). You control your inventory, the look and feel of your shop, and spend a lot of time haggling about prices with your customers. The tutorials are more than good enough, and the cute characterization makes them worth doing. Playing as an RPG item shop's owner is a creative and refreshing idea (though not totally unheard-of. See Taloon's chapter in Dragon Quest/Warrior IV)\n\nThe Adventuring mode is a bit simplistic, but doesn't overstay it's welcome. The easiest way to describe it is a cross between one of the 2D Zelda titles (A Link to the Past comes to mind) and The Secret of Mana. It is responsive and does a good job of breaking up the buying/selling action of the Item Shop mode.\n\nNear the end of my playthrough I did find the buying and selling getting a little repetitive as I'd memorized the preferences of every customer. I was able to successfully finish the game before I got really bored of it, though, and had an enjoyable experience, especiallly for the money.\n\nI never finished all the adventuring dungeons, so there is probably more to the story I never saw. I might go back and do that at some point.\n\nBuy it if you like RPGs or "Tycoon" style games. It's cheaper than a fast food meal, and will entertain you for at least 10 hours.","January 26, 2015","true","10.1"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

It combines simulation elements with the RPG genre. In the game, you run an item shop in an attempt to pay off Recette's father's debt with the help of the fairy Tear, who also works for the company collecting the debt. In the game you will meet many adventurers, whom you can hire to go with you into dungeons to look for loot to sell in your shop. Micro-management is a big factor in this game, as you need to make sure to have enough money at the end of the week to pay off your debt. Each day is set into four segments, and each time you open the store or leave the shop costs a segment, while going into a dungeon will cost three. If you don't have enough money when your debt is due, then you will need to start at the beginning but with character progress getting carried over. Overall, this is a great game that JRPG fans should definitely not pass up.","March 31, 2013","true","21.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It allows the player to fully immerse themselves in the events of the game. Recettear does a phenomenal job at this task. I found the story incredibly enjoyable. I felt the emotions alongside the characters. The principle may seem basic, but if you really connect to the characters, this will be an experience you will treasure for al of your gaming life.\n\nThe Gameplay\n\nThe gameplay is amazing on its own. The active task of setting up a shop and selling your items is an invigorating feeling. Starting from the cheaper items, and steadily working your way up to the more expensive assortment of goods. It gives you a feeling of accomplishment that you have a hard time getting out of most other games. With the increasing difficulty of the game, it has both a challenging and a relaxed atmosphere. The other aspect is the Dungeons. You send out a hero you get from interacting with them either around town, or in your shop. In these dungeons, the more expensive variety of loot lies deep in them. The gameplay in these areas is a bit faster paced, but overall the game tends to be patient and relaxed.\n\nThe Personality\n\nThe game is very relaxed. It does take it slow throughout the whole experience. The games failure  mechanic is that you start from the beginning, only you still have your levels and items. The game has a feeling of accomplishment with everything in it. Whether it be gaining a level, or selling that expensive item. This game makes you work for it, but still guides you along the path enough so you don't feel lost.\n\nThe Rating\n\nIn The Oliver Rating system, this game has the Oliver Rating of\n\n4.7/5\nThis game has my recommendation to  Play and Replay","June 18, 2015","true","13.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

One of the best ways to make money is buying for 30% and reselling for 130%.\n\nOne of the best items to stock up I found was weapons, in later weeks they get boosts in value and can be sold for as much as 300% base. For me the last 3 days all weapons were increased in value, not sure if it was luck or game mechanics, but in the last 3 days alone I amassed over 300k pix.\n\nThe game does have NG+ as well as a survival mode, but for the most part there doesn't really seem to be a whole lot of replay value after you intitally beat it.\n\nI bought it on sale for 9.99, not 100% I got my moneys worth, but it was definitely a fun game. I have a total of around 7 hours in the game including offline time, and that's about the amount of time it took me to beat it with having to start over once. I'd recommend buying it, but definitely on sale for 9.99 or less simply because of how short the game is, and how little replay value it offers in my opinion.","June 14, 2015","true","2.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For me, this game is perfect collection of genres, combining a shop sim, a dungeon crawling action RPG, and visual novel style segments all into one game.\n\nThe basics of the plot is that you are Recette, a young girl who's adventurer father disappears and leave behind a crippling debt that threatens to take away your home and everything in it. So you along with Tear, the fairy loan officer responsible for you paying the debt back, open an item shop. From there on out you can go out into town to buy stock and meet people, or hire an adventurer to bring items you can sell back from dungeons.\n\nThe difficulty curve can be intense, with your payments going up exponentially. However, I would consider this to be a medium difficulty game. Neither the shop segments or the dungeons are too difficult, though they still can be hard and tricky.\n\nThere are 8 adventurers that you can unlock over the course of the game for the dungeon portions and each has a unique combat style and abilities from one another, so there is plenty of variety whether you want to change things up or find a style that suits you best. There are also 6 dungeons, each one harder that the first but providing better drops progressively.\n\nThe plot is presented in very cute visual novel style segments and is quite light and relaxed despite the goal to pay off an ever increasing debt. I find it fits the medium difficulty game play segments very well. To trigger most of the story segments requires you to leave the shop and waste a chunk of your time, but the characters are all unique, fun and quirky. It's also the only way to unlock some of your potential adventures, so it can be worth your time.\n\nAll in all, I love this game. It's not to difficult to pick up and has a lot of content available so you can keep playing for hours.","December 24, 2013","true","29.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I replied, "It is kind of impressive how fun it is being an NPC, isn't it?" And it is. You can't really summarize this game; it's got too many great things going for it, and attempts to do so generally result in disbelief that a game like that can be as entertaining as claimed.\n\nThe game's about running an item shop. Initially you have to pay off your debt but once that's done you enter "Endless Mode" and can enjoy being a merchant (and also running through dungeons to get loot!) to your heart's content. Don't be disheartened by failure; even if you fail to pay off your debt, you'll still get a second chance.\n\nGood luck getting 100% completion; the post-endgame content is ridiculously beefy, and filling out your item encyclopedia requires at least six or seven playthroughs. And even when you've got that sorted out, you STILL have Endless Mode to challenge yourself with.\n\nAlso it's an indie title, if you like that sort of thing.","December 25, 2010","true","21.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game revolves around running an item shop, and the challenges that brings. It also has adventure opportunities where you can play in some very basic Legend of Zelda-like game play (better example would be Neutopia on the TurboGraphics 16) from the original NES days, although with better graphics, in order to acquire rare and cool items for sale. There is a ton of content it seems for this game, but most of it you will likely not use during the main course of the game. The reason being that taking advantage of such usually requires risk, and since you have to meet monetary goals within a certain amount of time in the main story, you may choose to go a safer route. Nevertheless, this game offers quite the charming gameplay despite it being repetative at times. I highly recommend this game if you can manage to get it for $10 or less. If not, then it really depends on how many hours of gameplay you expect at minimum to get per dollar you spend.","July 23, 2013","true","13.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

One of the best ways to make money is buying for 30% and reselling for 130%.\n\nOne of the best items to stock up I found was weapons, in later weeks they get boosts in value and can be sold for as much as 300% base. For me the last 3 days all weapons were increased in value, not sure if it was luck or game mechanics, but in the last 3 days alone I amassed over 300k pix.\n\nThe game does have NG+ as well as a survival mode, but for the most part there doesn't really seem to be a whole lot of replay value after you intitally beat it.\n\nI bought it on sale for 9.99, not 100% I got my moneys worth, but it was definitely a fun game. I have a total of around 7 hours in the game including offline time, and that's about the amount of time it took me to beat it with having to start over once. I'd recommend buying it, but definitely on sale for 9.99 or less simply because of how short the game is, and how little replay value it offers in my opinion.","June 14, 2015","true","2.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's quirky, cute, and all around fun. The concept is simple: stock your item store to earn money and pay off a loan. However, it quickly becomes much more in depth. You can buy items when the prices drop and sell them for a profit later, or hire an adventurer and head off to the dungeons in search of treasure! If you've ever been a fan of games like Rune Factory, Harvest Moon, Summon Nights or other hand held games like those, you'll probably love this game. There's something about it that becomes truly addictive, trying to stock the store, get cool new items all while trying to earn (and keep) enough to pay off those weekly loan payments! Even more, it has some of the most interesting and entertaining characters, who you really begin to learn more about and see dynamics between them all, in and out of your shop. The game itself has personality, as off the wall phrases like "Capitalism, ho!" make their presence known in the game.\n\nHowever, there are some short comings: at my point in the game, it appears as the story is rather short, but I anticipate a lot of "end game" styled content (I'll update my review once I know for sure). As well, the combat isn't the most exciting thing, but it is still fun getting to use and level different characters. There isn't a whole lot of exploration feeling in the dungeons, either. They're randomly generated each time on entry as you search for an exit to the floor (however, so far they're pretty small in scale). If you aren't a fan of: JRPGs, cutesish anime characters/story/tone, addictive slightly repetitive mechanics/objectives, reaching unknown goals, grinding loot, selling items, or capitalism, then I wouldn't recommend this game to you.\n\nIf you are, even with some of the shortcomings, I can definitely say with confidence you'll enjoy it if you give it a chance, it's definitely worth it. If it goes on sale, grab it!","June 21, 2014","true","23.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I know a few people with this game, and wel all play it differently.  I tend to focus solely on my storefront, one person I know spends all his time in dungeons, and yet another has something of a 60/40 mix between the two, leaning towards dungeon play.\n\nOne of the things that makes Recettear such a great game is that all of these playstyles are completely viable.  The item shop really is yours, and you can do whatever you want with it, provided you make the proper payments on time.  Want to make a dark cabal, where ancient artifacts of mystical Lovecraftian horrors are traded behind closed doors?  Done.  Want to make a homemaker's paradise, with clothes and food and tools as far as the eye can see?  Easy enough to put together.  Or maybe you'd rather outfit adventurers to go expeditioning with you, offering them low prices on advanced gear?  Great idea.\n\nRecettear manages to give you more empowerment than most store simulation games, and that's only half of what it is.  Its dungeon-crawling aspect is, to me, a little contrived, and not as well executed as, say, Torchlight, but it certainly gets the job done, and if loot gives you joy, you'll probably find the later dungeons particularly pleasing anyway.\n\nAnd let's not gloss over the art and writing, both of which are some of the cutest available, anywhere, ever.  This is the game that coined the word "Yepperoni" which is probably the most important English word I know.  If you're not into cute stuff, however, or you think it's lame or contrived, you really should pass, because this game is cute before it's anything else.\n\nTo nitpick, my one gripe is that this game does not support any full-screen resolutions in widescreen aspect ratios, but that's essentially to be expected of doujinsoft.  For me, however, the game is nearly perfect in all other regards, so in my eyes it is all but a must-play.","September 14, 2014","true","21.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game is split into those two basic parts; selling the goods at the store, and hunting in the darkened dungeon to find lost treasures. This two part approach worked for me as I found myself playing to get my store awesome and my heroes to be ultra-awesome.

Hell, calling this Baby's First Management wouldn't be far off if the game wasn't so unforgivable on those that don't cater to their clients (Then again, it's not like starting from the beginning was a brutal punishment when you keep your things, but still).\n\nFans of dungeon crawling, on the other hand, won't be dissapointed as the adventuring feels very well done, and, more importantly, each of your mercenary pals not only plays differently, they really feel differently, right down to movement and battle mechanics. This might not seem strange in a game tailored around the theme, but in a game focused on store management this comes as a pleasant surprise.\n\nAlso, the ammount of content in this game is absurd: The story itself isn't exactly long, and as you struggle against the loan deadlines you may come to loathe the moment when no other shoppers try to buy something it may feel short, but trying to get all the true adventurer cards, trying to fill out your in-game glossary, and really, just trying to get the true end itself will feel like you're playing one of those JRPGs that have no end in sight after a hundred hours.\n\nIf the economics, the dungeon crawling and the collecting still haven't sold you into it, maybe you'll give it a shot for the sheer hillarity and referencing in this game. And remember, the demo is there to help you make a more informed decision than what the shopkeeper tells you, so give it a shot before buying. Finally, it's not like you can't haggle the price down, if you decide to buy it eventually, after all, that's what steam sales are for.

Selling/buying, money management, dungeon crawling and interaction with NPCs. The only thing some people may not like is that the audio speech is in Japanese and it is subtitled in English.

It took me a very long while to finish this as I had failed the last payment on my first time, and after finding out it sets you back on day 2, I got demotivated (that's not entirely true though, apparently you keep your end-game items when you reset so you get that extra boost on your next try, but I did not know that back then), but after giving it another go I was able to finish it with money to spare.\nThis game... Is AMAZING... this is something that costs like 10 bucks, I bought for something like 3 and I've already accumulated 44 hours and I intend to play even more for the post-game. The graphics are cute, the voice acting is great though it is not fully voiced, the dungeons are simple but interesting, though it is my complaint that they are too lengthy, depending on the character you choose it will take about 2 hours or something to clear unless you are rushing it (but then you miss out on phat lewt, who would want to miss out on phat lewt?). I guess if there was an end-game tier item that automatically revealed the map when you took it could cut out on some of that time as you'd only move to the treasure chests? I did not check if there actually is an item like that, though.\nI'd say the dungeons make up about 3/4 of the time you'd spend on the game (mainly due to how lengthy they are), and for the last fourth you'll be selling stuff in the shop, though it may be a bit awkward at start, you eventually get used to it. There are many numbers and percentages involved that you can only find out through experimentation or visiting the wiki, I'd say it's worth skimming over them or else you'll screw yourself over on your first run. Also, I'd say thank god that the text for when you buy or sell has a different color, because the speech before it sometimes sound a bit ambiguous.\nI really hope I can find other gems like this one in the future.

On the surface you are a sweet little girl caught in the throws of flash poverty after your deadbeat dad runs off with everything that will put food on the table, may or may not get eaten by a dragon, proceeding to leave you to pay off his enormous debts via an item shop.  In reality, this game is a corruption simulator in which you experience first hand how a little girl can become drunk with capitalism, exploit other small children for their goods then turn around to sell those same goods to the elderly at obsurd prices.

Interestingly, I found that the game's sound effects played a big part in making the game satisfying. Everytime a sale is made, hearing the powerful "ka-ching" noise is really good.\n\nThe story is really cute too, especially if you pretend the translation is accurate.\nEach of the unlockable adventurers have fun, distinct personalities.\nAs for the adventuring itself, it's very simple, but has solid mechanics and controls. In this case too, what really elevates it is the adventurers having distinct playstyles.\n\nAfter getting past the first phase of the main story, paying off Recette's debt, the game becomes very repetitive. I don't mind that but I know a lot of people will. I played a lot more of this game than Steam indicates since I also own the DRM-free version. But I know most people don't have as much autism as me.

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198026852317/recommended/70400/","76561198026852317","Weofparadigm","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198026852317/","23 products in account","TLDR version: Doesn't exactly reinvent the wheel and can get repetitive but for any fans of JRPGs or dungeon crawlers, this little gem does more than enough to justify the modest asking price (Pssst this game goes on sale often)\n\nStory and Characters: You play as Recette, a cheerful naive and only somewhat annoying little girl whos carefree life gets shattered when her father disappears and she's left to pay his debts to a fairy named Tear. Your goal is to open the store her father left in order to pay off weekly payments to Tear or lose your home. It's not exactly on the level of the Count of Monte Cristo but for a cutesy game like this it's all the motivation you'll need.\n\nThe characters are pretty simple anime cliche, but most are charming in their own right. Tear makes a great straight man to Recette's bubble-headed obliviousness. Charme the thief is a likeable rogue and kind of like a big sister to our lead. That being said a number of characters are very one note and that note is typically "rude and nasty for no particular reason". Still, you have the option to skip any dialog and if your anything like me your finger will fly to that escape key any time you see that irritating rich girl.\n\nGraphics: The visuals are decent, they do their job expressing the world but they aren't very inspired. Customizing your store is the most visually impressive part of the game. Expect to see a lot of brown and gray dungeons copy pasted almost to the point of frustration. Closeups during dialog convey a great sense of personality but the actual models only look OK. Animation is nice and smooth and the frame rate is pleasingly consistent throughout which is all that really matters in a budget title like this.\n\nAudio: Voice acting is all in Japanese and it's cute, if a bit unnecessary with dialog being mostly text. The music isn't really worth noting. It's mostly cute and bouncy MIDI tunes that loop over and over. By far the most awful thing about the game is the ear-bleeding harmonica track that plays when walking around your store. It didn't take long for me to mute the music, and you likely will too.\n\nGameplay: This dungeon crawling ARPG has just enough twists to the classic formula to really make it addictive. Your time will be split between selling items in your store and running down to the dungeon hoping to find loot to sell at said store. It's easy to assume the selling part would be the weakest but it's amazing how nail-biting selling stuff can be when your next payment is due tomorrow and your still 5000 short. Do you jack up your prices and risk a customer walking out on you? Will anybody buy that really expensive item you absolutely need to sell to make your payment? How much is too much for a chocolate bar? This game manages to make such a mundane idea quite exciting.\n\nThe dungeon crawling is also quite fun if a little basic. You start with just one swordsman to dungeon dive with but you later unlock a quick thief, a glass cannon mage, etc. They all have different items to equip, different abilites, and different special attacks so there's enough variety to keep it fresh.  Enemies are generic looking but each one has different attacks and movement patterns, such as knights being able to protect themselves with shields or the winged eyeballs shooting lasers at you. The only real issue I have with the controls is the momentum characters gain while moving seems a bit too much. I found myself walking straight into enemies I meant to avoid or having a hard time wheeling myself around to hit their weak spots before they moved.\n\nWhat really stands out is the way RPG conventions are subverted. This might be the only RPG I've ever played where my characters level didn't matter to me. After all, the game measures your progression almost completely with money, so while filling your merchant EXP bar grants new perks to make the money pile up, the combat EXP isn't nearly as important. Sure tougher dungeons usually have better loot but the only reason I was happy I leveled was for the HP refill so I didn't have to use any of the healing items I found. I didn't really know or care what level my hero was as long as I could carry out a huge bag of loot.\n\nAll in all, Recettear: An Item Shop's Tale is a fun, cute and simple ARPG well worth your time and money. It's not for everyone and it's not exactly the kind of game that will leave you glued to the edge of your seat but it has novel gameplay and lots of charm sure to appeal to the RPG crowd looking for something different. And hey, if you enjoy story mode and you can play challenge mode and fulfill your fantasy of fighting your ever-growing debt until the massive payments force you into bankruptcy!

The gameplay is very open-ended -- you're free to spend all your time playing with the economic side of things, or (if you're like me) you can focus on leveling up your various adventurers and slashing/blowing up/punching/shooting all sorts of baddies and neglect your shop entirely.

You can't ignore the shop aspect, which I think some might find as a negative, but that's the sell of the game, not the dungeons- you play as the shop keep, not the dungeon crawler, after all.\n\nAll in all, this might be my favorite game on Steam.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ClockworkMadoka/recommended/70400/","ClockworkMadoka","Clockwork Madoka","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ClockworkMadoka/","73 products in account","Recettear....an adorable little RPG that doesn't take itself too seriously, because it doesn't need to. While it may be short, with a story mode easily completed in 4-6 hours, there is a surprising amount of depth for those who seek it.\nFor completionists, the main goal is to complete the item encyclopedia, which seems simple enough...however, even after a playthrough of the story mode, you may only be left with <25% completion, especially if you never went through the dungeon. You may have also missed many cutscenes, and missed several potential unlocks. Luckily, the game provides an endless mode for you to clean up any loose ends, and start going towards that 100%!\n\nPros\n-cute art style\n\n-Dialogue is well-written, with many subtle jokes and references you may not get your first way through.\n\n-Recette and Tear are a very likeable pair, and they all have unique reactions to other characters.\n\n-Surprising amount of depth, with dungeoneering, crafting, and a small meta game of equipping your adventurers with the best gear.\n\n-Simple, yet effective game mechanics\n\n-Soundtrack is nice\n\n-Offers a fair amount of post-story content, including an endless mode (continue playing without having to worry about debts), New Game+ (With new content. Start over from day 1 with levels and items intact and repay the debt again) and survival mode (where you have to keep paying back the debt, and see how long you can last).\n\nCons\n-Art style, especially in dungeons, can be inconsistent. Some mobs are 3d, while your player characters are always 2d sprites.\n\n-Game will either be extremely easy to get through, or RNG will doom you into a situation where you are failing to pay off your debts\n\n-You don't need to do any dungeon'ing or crafting to complete story mode\n\n-Time management can be a bit troublesome, since going through dungeons requires you to give up almost an entire day in your schedule.\n\n-Small frustrating issues, such as being unable to see outstanding orders without speaking to Tear in the shop. (If you leave to go purchase wares, you lose a share of time, and you can only double check what items you need by returning and wasting another share.)\n\n-Dungeon combat is pretty simple, and can be very grindy\n\n\nNeutral\n\n-Game lies to you, and fails to tell you about important game mechanics. (do NOT sell for 130% base price)\n\n-Why are you selling knives to children...?\n\n-New Game+ is incredibly easy. The amount you must pay never increases.\n\n\n\nOverall I actually really like Recettear. It's cute, enjoyable, and can certainly be stressful sometimes. There are a few issues, such as major game mechanics being more risk than reward during the story mode. Still, I would recommend this game not only because it provides for a surprisingly absent genre of game (running an RPG store), but it provides it in such a way that is very appealing and cheerful.","January 4","true","13.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you're curious to find out what kind of game this is, It is a game about capitalism, and running your own little items shop as the title of the game implies. It has a decent combat system, a likeable protagonist, and very nice guidelines to learn how to play most effectively. Although the music does get VERY aggravating at times in my opinion. All in all, I have had an absolute blast with this game.\nPros: 1. Good shop customization\n2. Decent characters and storyline\n3. Rewarding combat system, addicting gameplay that keeps you occupied for hours.\nCons: 1. Wonky movement with the arrow keys when you're fighting in a dungeon. (It's tolerable)\n2. Repetitive music and voices. (I had to turn those off within the first hour of gameplay)\n3. THE BLONDE ♥♥♥♥♥ AND HER FAIRY THAT TRIES TO BUY ♥♥♥♥ FOR 3% OVER THE BASE PRICE, AND KIDS WHO COME INTO YOUR SHOP WITH THEIR LUNCH MONEY AND PICK OUT A 7,000 PIX SWORD AND WON'T PAY UP!\n\nOther than that.

The music is semi-retro SNES / early PS1 (in the best way possible i mean), the dungenons are fun and satisfying, and overall the game has a great personality. The japanese-only sfx dialog is a little irritating at times but it can be forgiven, especially with the great presentation and fun factor.\n\nTL;DR Highly recommended, very unique RPG that puts a nice twist on a basic dungeon crawler.","January 6, 2015","true","7.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","3"

But in this game, the roles are reversed and you're the owner of an item shop that sells items and weapons to adventurers.\nThis game is very fun to play, and I have put about 17 hours into it already, with the intention to put in more.\nI would reccomend this game to RPG fans, but I can see why some may not like Recettear. The enemies are not that diverse and the RPG elements are rather shallow. However, that is not where the true appeal of this game comes from. No, that comes from the buying and selling of items. It is awesome to buy say, a cake during a food shortage, giving you an excuse to charge extortionate prices (such as 300% of the original price) and make a but load of money.\nCharacter wise this game delivers well enough, giving you the doofy but likeable Recette, the stern but kind Tear, and many more characters (though I will admit to not remembering most of their names, just very prominant parts of their personality).\nIn the end, I would recommend this game...as long as you get it in a sale.","January 20, 2015","true","21.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

You take on the role of the Item Shop owner in an RPG based world and supply the adventurers and regular townies with much needed supplies of every nature.\nBut it's not just about stocking your shop - because of course no one's going to pay sticker price for your ♥♥♥♥; damn adventurers and their haggling. Warning: You may want to drown the Little Girl for never having any money ever.\nThe smart store owner stock piles items when they're cheap and sells them when they go up in value, and if there are ingredients you just can't buy from your suppliers, well then it's time to hire a sell-sword (whom you equip and level up yourself) and kill some monsters in a nearby dungeon, complete with multiple randomized levels and some fun bossfights.\nAdorable art style, great gameplay, so simple and yet so much fun, easy to sink a ton of hours into.

The town looks absolutely stunning on the PC. The story is rich and provoking, keeping you guessing and revising your theories as you play. The final scenes will haunt you, driving you (or at least many) to the forums to absorb and discuss thoughts on the plot possibilities. The music is captivating and enthralling, with all of its drama. With extra orchestral stabs to accent details such as how you finish an enemy, the experience really feels complete and integrated. The gameplay is familiar for fans of the previous Carpe Fulgur games, with new innovations to spice things up. Zipping around the town and dealing out devastating blows is both effective and immensely satisfying. No game is perfect, as no form of entertainment/art is immune to subjectivity but this game comes so close that it deserves a 10/10 for being worth every single coin spent on it.","December 30, 2013","true","13.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

Both the shop management and adventuring work well as separate mechanics and tie together in the way in which you sell items to the adventurers. The tranlations are good and other than the slightly shrill anime voice work the game feels very well localised.","January 10, 2015","true","6.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Who knew running the item shop could be more interesting than being the JRPG protagonist? Well-balanced game elements, in a fairly addicting little package. Kuwai japanese voices, but that could probably be assumed from the screenshots posted in the store. Not especially difficult, if you keep your eye on the market, but lots of aftergame content and challenge modes to give it replayability. Pretty standard action-rpg outside the shop, but a polished generic RPG is what you'd expect from a game that's really trying to hijack rather than be one. Slightly oddball charicterization keeps you in the right frame of mind.

There are many facets to this game that are on the surface missed, but appreciated after many hours playing the game.\n\nThe story is rather simple, you are left with the care of a shop and are required to pay back a debt that your father left you with, so capitalism and careful planning are your only means of digging yourself out of this debt. At first the requirements seem staggering, as each week you progress you're required to pay back more than the last, but the game is forgiving and if you miss a payment you'll restart in a better spot than when you first started your game.\n\nThis game truly shines if you enjoy item management (as I do, clearly), as well as RPG elements that aren't extraordinarily deep but yet very enjoyable. The shop management experience found in this game, as well as the bartering that you're required to do to excel, is something that I had never experienced before and found it delightful.\n\nSound for this game is so-so, and could be better but certainly doesn't detract from the overall appeal of the game. The graphics work well for what the game is looking to accomplish. Unfortunately, the supported resolutions require me to typically run the game in windowed mode (I have multiple monitors that are connected to my desktop, and it's a hassle to go full screen with Recettear). This is a minor annoyance, but certainly something that won't affect all players.\n\nFinally, the controls work well for the game, and I typically play with a connected controller. The support for the peripheral has proven to be one of the largest draws for the game, as I can kick back in my chair and play for a couple of hours with relative ease. I use a wired Xbox 360 controller, but I'm sure that other similar configurations from either the 360 or One will function just as well.\n\nOverall, I recommend Recettear for anyone looking for a new and unique experience. This game has a lot of potential, and while I have played the sequel a little, I find myself continuing to enjoy the original. Be forewarned, however, that this game is not for everyone. If you find item management in other RPGs tedious and a piece that you'd rather avoid, do not buy this game.

The main character is a grinning idiot doormat in debt slavery to a fairy who won't tell her the actual amount owed on the family shop. The shop-keeping system is kind of interesting (as I would hope) but quickly bogs down in randomness and odd design choices. For instance, for days on end armor was arbitrarily low-valued, making most of my stock basically impossible to sell at a profit even as a massive debt payment came up. About 1/4 of your customers walk in not to buy anything but to sell you random garbage with insane dialog: "Want this [bowl of stew] I found in the forest?" "It's time to sell this family heirloom, [a chocolate bar]!" (I'm disturbed by the little girl who keeps selling broken god statues.) You get berated if you don't buy these things and lose out on experience point combos. Haggling consists entirely of raising or lowering a number; there's no rhetoric, advertising, personal relationships, competition, offers of throwing X in, &c. Character interaction is entirely scripted and consists of your character grinning against insults and attempted murder.\n\nThere\'s an XP/level system for the shopkeeper, unlocking features like expanding the store. That's fine, but according to Internet guides, the actual rules defy both common sense and the actual tutorial. You're supposed to sell at a *minimal* profit because this somehow makes you more experienced and causes your endless array of generic customers and named, abrasive jerks to become richer. The two points I like here are that the shop can have a distinct light/dark or plain/gaudy rating (though this affects almost nothing) and that it's in your interest to give a good price to adventurers wanting to upgrade their equipment (though they also buy equipment they can't use).\n\nYou get some of your item stock by hiring adventurers to explore the random dungeons next to town, this being a generic RPG world. In this mode you control the hero while your own character and her debt-master follow passively. At first I liked this gameplay because there's a variety of enemy movement patterns to figure out, requiring some thought to avoid damage. But since you're fighting the same few enemies over and over (red slimes! yellow slimes!) and your tactics mostly consist of "hit with sword" anyway, the novelty wears off and you're back in random dungeon land, where everything is a meaningless grid of halls and rooms and you\'re hoping the random number gods will stop granting you bits of wooden armor when there's a 200,000 coin payment due Thursday. Besides "vendor trash" items you also collect random ingredients that fuel nonsense recipes for turning items into more valuable items. Eg. iron+bug traps to make a cute maiden's bracelet; adventurous clothes plus fur and walnuts or something to make chainmail. The rules don't make sense, there's no real plot, I don't like the characters, and there's not much to the gameplay.\n\nSo, at this point I think I'll abscond with my stock of used candy apples and discount armor. Hopefully the fairy won't see me sneak out.","June 1","false","7.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

The talking (and by talking, I mean reading) carries on forever as the stern midrif bearing librarian looking fairy lectures you on the ins and outs of being a child laborer/shop owner.  Then you finally get done with the lectures, you open your shop, you maybe go explore a dungeon for some items, and the next thing you now an hour has passed.\n\nIt's a steep price entry, all that slow reading to kick things off, but once you get to the meat of Recettear, it's kind of charming.  The dungeon exploring (which you technically odn't even have to do) is not too shabby, set in real time instead of your typical turn based combat that japanese RPGs' tend to use.  Once you load up on items, you had back to your shop, put them up for sale, make a little money.\n\nThe haggling system seems kind of pointless, but you know...whateveer.  It's still enjoyable.  Not something I'd power through in marathon sessions, but if you can get past the tooth ache that the oh-so-cute setup gives you, it's an allright game.","August 21, 2013","true","1.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Haggling with customers is surprisingly intense, since you have to balance the need to squeeze as much profit from them as possible to afford the next loan payment against the risk of them breaking your combo (robbing you of experience points for store improvements) by walking away from an insulting high offer.\n\nYou can also go Zelda-style dungeon crawling as the adventurers whom you're selling all the equipment to, but that's a dangerously low-profit waste of time during the story mode.\n\nBottomline, the game is worth it if it goes back on sale for $5 at the end of the Summer Camp sale... unless you're a capitalism-hating communist.

Story is fairly unbelievable. A little girls father who has disappeared leaves his daughter with a huge crippling debt. She's only 10 (I am guessing?) how is she suppose to repay his debt? Why the fairy Tear tells her to make a store so she can pay it back. The lil loli Recette gets help and turns her house into a store. While the story was fairly unbelievable and lacking there isn't much to do but if you do the RPG dungeon part more stories unfold and builds up more character for Recette and Tear and the Adventurers.\n\nCharacters in the game have a huge impact. Everyone is unique and different and the events that happen make them rememberable enough. The more you unlock the more events that will happen interacting with all the characters all together. It gives incentive to do the dungeon part of the game to unlock more of these characters with their corky bits and pieces.\n\nThere are two different types of gameplay here. Running the Store and the Dungeon Crawling. Running your store was great but a challenge. Everyone has a different budget and you have to learn that by personality and age. The little girl is well in fact a little girl so she doesn't have much money. Louie is poor but the more adventuring you do with him the more money he gets and if you sell to him cheap he starts to get a bigger and better budget. It's so crazy and complex that each character in the game has specific things and goals and all this other crap that it's difficult to explain! Combat was simplistic but each Adventurer has their pros and cons and a different playstyle required. Not much to talk about here but it kinda reminded me of Final Fantasy without the turn base thing.\n\nLong story short, scamming off little girls or spent your life living in a cardboard box.\n\nWhats your choice?","January 10, 2015","true","21.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This will take more time than just buying items, but can be a lot more lucrative. CAN be.\n\nThe game is basically divided into those two sections, but you could play the entire game without ever entering a dungeon, if you wanted.\n\nWhile the graphics and the game itself is quite cutesy, the gameplay is quite interesting. Figuring out how much you can charge each shopping personality type (e.g. Old Man, Young Girl etc.) can be a little annoying, but there's a pretty good Wiki for the game if you roll that way.\n\nThe worst thing is probably the ridiculously-long and unskippable intro.\n\nThe best thing is probably the way that Recette (the main character) and Tear (her fae overseer/friend) interact.

You might get 10 customers in your shop suddenly and think "This is great!" ... then you notice 5 of them are little girls who generally won't give you much profit whatsoever. You'll be nearing a payment dead line for your loan and suddenly your biggest selling product will become very common and will reduce in half for the price or you'll want to sell and instead you'll suddenly be pestered by dozens of people just wanting to sell you stuff instead or want to place orders for AFTER your loan date.\n\nIt's one of those games where if you get to day 30 and suddenly realise you only have like 50K, you pretty much aren't going to win the game. There is no real way to pull a rabbit out of the hat and you might as well just restart the game which is quite frustrating when you put 10 hours into the game and realise that you're pretty much screwed.\n\nThe dungeon fighting is fun but a bit repetitive after awhile, especially since there is honestly a very small selection of loot to pick from and you will soon get annoyed at how restrictive the game is based on the 'time units'.\n\nYou get 4 time units a day and lose these with certain tasks. Opening your store to sell is 1 unit, going to town to meet characters (which I enjoy but it seems a punishment since meeting a friend takes away a lot of your selling day which makes the game feel punishing if you try and enjoy their story) but going to the dungeons cost 2 time units. Sometimes you'll go to the dungeon and get nothing in drops and you're limited to only doing 5 dungeon floors at a time and these can be done in 5 minutes.\n\nI would certainly advise you to look through the wiki when you buy the game since honestly they don't give you much information in the game for tutorials and I didn't even hear about things like 'exp-chaining' until I looked through the wiki. It makes the games a lot easier.\n\nPretty much if you're playing the game on the first play through I would just advise you to grind out as much money as possible and ignore trying to make friends with the characters since it seems pretty hard to do if you're unexperienced.\n\nI would still recommend the game for a fun little time if you can look past these small annoyances.","April 5, 2015","true","17.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It starts simple and easy but the more you progress the more difficult it becomes and if you like truly finishing your games this can sink a whole monkey ton of time as well as getting to be difficult enough that you feel like your playing a bullet hell type of game.\n\nYour a bankrupt little girl who gets some help from a fairy and to pay off your huge debt you set up an item shop. It has a lot of humor in it and a lovable main character.\n\nMost people stop there I notice. But there is so much more after you pay your debt. Even I haven't completed the dungeon yet... I don't have the skills to get that far but I can say that the monsters start off with you one shotting them and them moving at a snails pace to hit you. At some point it turns into an enemy that can shoot lasers in all directions and can warp around the map that takes 1000 hits before they die. Then you realize you ♥♥♥♥♥♥ it off when it comes back to life... only angrier this time.\n\nGood times.\n\nYou also have the freedom to customize the way your shop looks, which is always fun.","February 5","true","75.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You run around a multi-floor dungeon, battling enemies with Zelda ALttP-Style controls, opening chests for loot, and selling everything you get from the dungeons in your shop. Customers get quite annoying and the tutorials are extremely lengthy, but it's nothing you can't tolerate.\nThe gameplay might not be everyone's cup of tea, so you might want to try this game out via some- other, more swashbuckling means- before you buy it.\n\nNOTEPIRATINGISBADBUYGAMESYOULIKEOKAY","October 26, 2013","true","3.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game starts out with a lot of reading, the story is cute in  its Sanker style. Its not something i would be bragging to my buddies on XBOX-360, for alpha cred. ♥♥♥♥ them though it was fun.  The game consists of two parts. The buying/selling aspect of the game, and the dungeon crawling part.\n\nThe game story is that you have to repay a debt, or Tear the Fairy, will throw you out on your ♥♥♥ to live in a cardboard box. I was a little shocked too at first, to see her throw away this adorable eight year old girl to live in a cardboard box,  the word ♥♥♥♥♥, came to mind.  So you buy low, sell high to earn money to pay back the loan.\n\nI'm sure that some people are so good at this game that they didn't even need to use the dungeons. However there are dungeons in this game , every fifth level there is a "boss" level.  Its nothing complicated, think of your ever other action SNES RPG. You keep going  deeper into the dungeon, looting what you can carry with you.\n\nSo if you enjoy dungeon crawling or store management simulator,   try it out. If you can't get passed the Natorness of the game, i understand. I bought this game by accident drunk one night, but i am glad i did.  Works Great with a Xbox 360 wireless controller.\n\n1 issue, is that for some reason if you turn it to fullscreen in the options, it causes it to crash, but other than that, solid game.\n\n8/10","January 12, 2015","true","42.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Getting the hang of the mercantile and combat mechanics was a nifty, goofy ride, and the characters and dialogue are adorable. By the end of the main story, however, I found that the store aspect of the game becomes rather trivial (buy everything under the sun, sell for moderate profit at the first opportunity, rinse, repeat). I also found it too difficult to finish the side quests necessary to recruit some characters before the end of the limited time frame. Still, I happily recommend it with thumbs up!","June 12, 2015","true","26.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Capitalism ho!\n\nSeriously, you play a shopkeeper of a stereotypical RPG, catering to both the regular townsfolk, as well as the occasional adventurer.\n\nOddly enough, the game actually has surprisingly good writing, with a unique and interesting assortment of eccentric characters set to a rather ridiculous plotline which works not just in spite of, but specifically because of how silly it is.\n\nA lot of various addictive qualities show up in Recettear, such as RPG-style leveling of your character/shop, an economy where you purchase materials and have to buy low/sell high, as well as witty and charming dialogue.\n\nYou'll find a modest variety of characters enter your store; a small girl, an elderly man, a housewife and a generic common man for the regular townsfolk, each with their own personal buying habits. Toss in the more unique characters such as your brattish rival with a cynical faery of her own, a runaway princess-turned drunken assassin, a cyborg who is kind of new to the concept of "money", and a down-on-his-luck wannabe adventurer, to name a few, and you'll find yourself entertained for quite long periods at a time interacting with them.\n\nHaggling is an artform, and you get significantly rewarded for giving an offer that will be accepted on the first try rather than just going back and forth until someone either gives in or they meet in the middle. As such, there's actually some pretty shrewd tactics to manage when trying to haggle with customers, and learning their personal traits and spending habits can be quite beneficial.\n\nAs a whole, it's a fairly unique game. There have been others vaguely similar to it before, where you buy low and sell high... but none which have have nearly as much polish and just sheer charm to the personalities you interact with in Recettear.\n\n\n\nFinal Verdict:\n\nIt's really quite enjoyable for what it is. If you like shopping, or even just anything similar to facebook or flash games, you'll probably adore Recettear. It's value for retaining a player's interest can be a bit less than ideal, however, as there is an "end" to the game. There are some nice options for increasing replay value, but you'll probably only find yourself doing one or two playthroughs every few years. It's a nice game to come back to once in awhile, but not on a consistent basis.\n\n\nOverall Score: About 80%. It's really probably the best game of it's kind out there, and the writing is great! The content duration's a bit short, though, and considering the game type... you might want to wait for it to go on sale; $20 is a little bit much. $15 is reasonable, and $10's a good, ideal price for it.","November 27, 2013","true","24.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"whats that Tear?" "that's a door." No really!?!?!? While the tutorial is very thorough, they treat the player like a child, they explain simple concepts like "you have limited amount of time per day" in long drawn out Dialouge.\n\nThe dungeons are where i was expecting a bit of excitement. Instead they're just long, boring, randomly generated dungeons with one exit every 5 floors. you can't call it quits in the middle, nope, you have to keep moving until you find an exit or die and lose everything. This would be OK, if the combat didn't drive me nuts. It's simple face target, hope you're close enough, swing mechanics will have you rage quitting on the first boss.\n\nDid i mention this game does not support any normal resolutions? all the available resolutions turn out stretchy and blurry.

Traditional to JRPG the story is going to be the most interesting part fo the game, unfortunately i'm downvoting because i found the game grindy and boring.\nI was constantly checking the marketplace only to be bored with zero encounters. The writing is silly cheesy fun, but can take forever and get on the nerves. The dungeons were painfully boring, dunno why they tried to shove an RPG into a perfectly good management game. Especially since the management itself isn't amazing, i feel like the game had a lot of interesting ways to innovate and explore. Instead EasyGameStation innovated a tiny bit, then all the dev power was put into the long dungeons enemies and loot art.\nI didn't come to reccettear wanting to play the dungeon crawly RPG elements, but i can tell that's where all the effort went, and it's the most boring part of the game. Though managing the shop is interesting and complicated I'd like a shop management sim with more refined features.","January 13","false","1.6"," 9 of 21 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","9","21","0","0"

I was looking forward to it so much after hearing all the hype and came away from it very dissatisfied with two half-baked systems that failed to engage me. The shopkeeping is fairly basic aside from a (simple but very fun, thought it was one of the best parts of the game) random price raising/decreasing. The combat is laughably simple.\n\nIn addition, if you fail to meet your debt, you have to repeat the entire game. While normally I like the idea of devestating failstates in a game (really enjoying XCOM, for instance), I didn't really want to sludge through another bunch of hours of this crap. In addition, it feels like the game was designed for the player to fail once- unless you can beat the game on your first try, the only benefit that doing well on your first runthrough is that you end up wasting more time playing this game. The second try is almost trivial since you keep you entire inventory after the first failure.","February 15","false","10.0"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","5","14","0","0"

By the time I had finished the game, I completely gave up on the RPG aspects and I had the numbers on the spreadsheet memorised. I also had a notebook open listing all the orders and the days on which to stock up items in my shop ... Essentially I was running an actual business. There's a few things to love and I genuinely enjoyed my experience, but when it comes right down to it, it's just not very fun for most people. Maybe if the spreadsheet was in-game and there wasn't a random NPC that breaks all your combos and you had more incentive to do the (surprisingly well-made) dungeon crawling, it'd be a great game, but as it stands now, it's just for the type to optimise numbers and people who love CAPITALISM (HO)!","February 7","false","15.7"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","5","14","0","0"

However after putting in a few hours with this game there is a fundamental issue with the mechanics that ruin this game for me and force me to not recommend it.\n\nNow although its fun setting up your shop and adventuring in the dungeon for items to sell the game neglects to mention a major mechanic in the game that can actually make the game unplayable at times. The tutorial simply tells you that what you wanna do is buy items from people at 50% and sell for 130%. Fair enough and pretty straight forward. After a while however i started to notice that 130% was out of the question and even 120% would drive customers away. I would lower and lower the prices and still drive customers away at 90% and even 80% of the base cost. BUT THE TUTORIAL TOLD ME 130% WAS THE MAGIC NUMBER! I took to the internet to see what i was missing and what i discovered was the game fails to mention there are two invisible stats that drastically effect gameplay. Customer loyalty level and customer budget. Customers would come in trying to buy items they didnt even have the budget for no matter what price i set them at and then would leave mad which lowered their loyalty and budget even more. By week three the game was unplayable.\n\nNow i could probably easily start over fresh with new found information about how the budget and loyalty stats work but do i really wanna have to take notes while i play. keeping track of invisible stats the game never mentioned to me to make sure i didnt try to sell items my customers will never even be able to afford. Invisible stats ruine this game for me.","May 8","false","3.2"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shodaiultraman/recommended/70400/","shodaiultraman","Cornflakes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shodaiultraman/","143 products in account","I had really been looking forward to this game... but after completing it, I'm sorry to say that I cannot recommend Recettear. You expect there to be more when really the game is pretty shallow.\n\nThe Ragnarok Online-ish graphics got me hooked at the start and I liked the no-nonsense dungeon crawling and the shop aspect.. but there's just not enough here to keep you engaged. Or if there is, the game is not organized in such a way that you can enjoy it without a guide.\n\nFirst of all, the dungeon crawling gets really repetitive. Fighting doesn't require you to be clever, because you're OP all of the time. After you unlock your fourth and final skill on a character.. you switch to a new one because they just get stale.\nWorse, dungeon crawling is actually detrimental to your progress, because you rarely find items worth the hassle, but you lose 2 units of ingame time that you could have spent selling stuff in your shop.\n\nThe shop system's got a tutorial that makes you haggle with your customers, although suggesting a price they'll like is the only way to get combo bonuses for selling, which are more useful than the extra buck from high sales prices.\n\nI also found it very, very difficult to survive the debt cycle (someone in the comments even asked "So did anyone survive the first round?"). When you can't pay back your debt on time, it's not a complete gameover, but you start again from the beginning, only you keep the items you have in stock and your merchant level (that gives you access to more stuff on the market + other stuff that helps). The second time around is too easy. I finished the last ingame week doing nothing but killing time and still had 1 million pix when I payed off the final debt of 500k. This should be more balanced.\n\nThe crafting system is a nice addition, but suffers from a lack of menu integration. You literally have to write stuff down you want to hunt for in the dungeons. Would have been much nicer to be able to pull up a menu and see "Aha. I need 2 more pieces of X to make Y." That's why I ended up using it just to make stuff I had randomly collected the ingredients for. It's very inconvenient.\nSure, I could have played it smarter and looked into a guide to make lots more money by crafting. But honestly? When hunting for the items isn't fun.. why would anyone bother?\n\nAll in all, I don't really want to drop a huge pile of dung on this game. It has its enjoyable aspects, but as it is, I just don't think it'll be fun for you. That's why I'm not recommending it. If you like, you can play the demo.

The game mechanics are horrible, trash infact. The game developers had a great idea or concept for a item shop game but the systems and implementations are utter garbage. The story made me genuinely laugh out loud at times, but I would have rather watched the story unfold like an anime tv show then play this game, in fact I ended up going to youtube just to see how it ends. Without going into details, the story is your usual young-teen-hero-anime show story with some fourth-wall breaking stuff about video games. However, the story is not good enough for me to want to continue to play the game just for it. The mechanics are so clunky, repetitive, and downright head scratching it makes me wonder why I bothered to put in 12 hours. I think I did only because of the overwhelming positive numbers making believe that this must be one of the best games ever...however it is far from even being an average title and I do not recommend this game at all.","November 28, 2015","false","12.1"," 6 of 22 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","6","22","0","1"

Every kind of customer buys pretty much anything, even the "poor versions" have not an issue to pay a ridicolous amount of money for an item if it's "trending" at the moment, same goes for the adventurer friends. That bothered me the most.\n• The dungeon traps keep repeating and are rather boring/annoying at some point instead of dangerous.\n• Not much going on in the town in terms of unlocking or additional mechanics, too bad.\n• Wished for more customization in the shop, since a good portion of the options is just ridicoulos looking - probably on purpose.\n• No dangers from the environment or competition, they are rather helping out - for whatever reason.\n• Annoying RNG while trying to upgrade an adventurer through the shop.\n\nIt's my first review, because I am heartbroken in a sense - I expected a lot more meat on the bones, and logic in the universe of that game. It had a lot of potential of being mindblowing and entertaining for a lot of hours, however it turned out rather short and unsatisfying, at least for me.\n\nBought it at full price, which is in my opinion too high for such an experience - therefore not recommending it, despite its age. It helps to know that there won't be any updates for it, most likely.","March 15, 2015","false","21.2"," 15 of 43 people (35%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","35","15","43","0","0"

It's cute, fun, and addictive. It's probably my favorite that I have in my steam library right now. That being said, this is one of those situations where I wish steam had a "meh" button instead of simply recommending or not recommending a game.\n\nSo here's the way the game works. (only game mechanics, no story-spoilers) The item shop gameplay is pretty simple. Buy low, sell high, try to make enough to pay off your debt each week. You're restricted on the amount of actions you can do each day. This whole part of the game plays like one of those in-browser flash games. That isn't exactly a bad thing as a whole. The art style is pleasing to look at enough to keep you playing and the game still feels rewarding when you actually figure out how it works. As the game adds more and more to the way the game works, it becomes much more interesting and challenging to play.\n\nThere's a kind of dungeon-crawling mode in which you can use to find new items to sell, and I'm betting this is where players really spend 80% of their time. Some commenters say it's too easy, but I disagree. It took me five failed attempts to escape from the first, easiest set of dungeons. You can only escape on certain floors, if you 'die' you can only bring one of your treasures back with you, and the monsters that spawn are very annoying. All of this creates incredibly difficult combat for such a pleasant game. Honestly I love that as well. The maps, simple enemies, and very simple combat system remind me of a top-down version of Dark Cloud. The dungeons are painful to get through, but it's  also nice to see a game that occassioanally throws sand in your eyes, instead of easing up. It's something I'd expect from a 10-20 year old combat game, rather than a modern seemingly-casual capitalism sim. It's still fair and I can't bring myself to blame the game for my failures in the dungeons.\n\nNow for the negatives. Once again, the combat is very basic, your enemies are very basic, and well even the shop management is simpler than it could've been. I think that do it well, but it does leave you wanting a bit more.\n\nA huge issue I have with this game is the translation company, and I originally intended to avoid buying this game for myself at all.\nFirst, the translations are just awful at some points. Maybe I'm just too aware of linguistic issues to overlook it, but there are *so many* moments where the word choices just scream "look at my creative translation, isn't it cool?", when many other translations would've fit better. The point of the translation is to draw attention away from the language use, to forget that the material even came from another language in the first place so you can focus on the story, but when they use obscure words like "♥♥♥♥♥" or made-up words like "yayifications", you're no longer experiencing the story of Recette but having it told to you through an amateur translator. It's really difficult not to get immediately pulled out of the immersion in the story. There's at least one positive aspect of the translations, in that however distracting their translations may be, at least it does fit the characters' personalities. Still, such a half-♥♥♥♥♥ job makes you struggle to maintain your investment in what's happening in the story.\n\nThe second issue is that Carpe Fulgur (the company that translated this into English) has a reputation of changing parts of the story in the translation. The idea of a localization is to best adapt the game to the target region, but the changes they make seem to concern things that have no real legal or social ramifications in the first place. The fact that these changes are unstated makes me lack trust in a faithful, in-tact representation of the game's story and dialogue.\n\nThis is why I was content to avoid giving them any of my money. I only bought it myself for two reasons.\n1: It was on sale.\n2: I'm learning Japanese so I might as well practice using this game on my own computer. I don't really plan to run it in the English version at all.\n\nTo sum it all up\n+addictive, fun\n+challenging yet simple and fair\n-shoddy translations work\n-questionable business practices of the distributor, thus untrusting that the game was localized as intended.\n\nIf it sounds like fun, more power to you. But the negatives, at least in principle, are enough for me to warrant a downvote. At least until Steam adds a "meh" button.","January 8, 2015","false","2.0"," 16 of 47 people (34%) found this review helpful","34","16","47","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JiveSoulBro/recommended/70400/","JiveSoulBro","Jive Soul Bro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JiveSoulBro/","85 products in account","Recettear: An Item Shop's Tale is probably the cutest worst game there is. Ill-conceived better covers it: you play half the game as a top-down dungeon crawler and the other half as manager to the eponymous item shop, with neither halves being properly implemented in the first place. I get the feeling that the developers, EasyGameStation, had very ambitious ideas for the concept of "Item Merchant Game" except that they've botched everything until what they made barely resembles a game anymore! I'll explain...\n\nYou are Recette, spunky little girl entrepreneur required by the faerie bond collection agency to raise enough money to repay her father's exorbitant adventuring debt. For this task you have your house located smack dab in the middle of RPG City, which you've converted into an Item Shop for the convenience of all. Sell items to the roaming adventurers, make a profit, repay your debt; simple enough, right? It all goes to pot with the whole bargaining system and the complete lack of player feedback other than win/fail.\n\nBefore that, an egregious crime in game development: having the tutorial LIE to you. When faerie sidekick Tear tells you that selling at around 121% of base price is a conservative strategy, she is flat out LYING to you. This is far above what many villagers can afford and will not increase important customer loyalty. This is especially villainous considering there is no other way than trial-and-error to determine a customer's comfort range.\n\nThe process of selling and bargaining for optimal profits and customer loyalty is stupid and punishes experimentation. Any experimentation in bargaining reduces important customer loyalty which reduces the overall money pool they're willing to invest in your products. Worse, it's all so incredibly MOOT!!! When you buy goods from the guild merchant, he sells it to you marked down from base price. Therefore if you sell those goods at base price, you make a (small) profit. Base price is a perfectly good baseline for most customers and you can repay your debts out of this practice! Otherwise, use a strategy guide to know optimal salesmanship builds as there's no rhyme or reason to the whole process!\n\nDungeon crawling is the second half of the game and although mostly innocuous, doesn't introduce any elements anyone would deem "fun". You hire an adventurer from the pool of friends you've made and go down randomly generated levels, looking out for monsters and treasures until you discover the exit. Inventory space (bag space) becomes the most annoying aspect as you're stretched between saving space for treasures at the expense of bringing food, rings and adventuring gear. Because the adventurers don't bring their own gear with them; no, that would be too simple! You have to sell them the stuff from your store, except you have no control over what they ask for and you can't "suggest" goods either. Egregious crime in gaming #2!\n\nAll that said, the Main Story is fun enough. You have likeable characters, humorous dialogue... You really can't fault the English publishing company Carpe Fulgur for anything. It's New Game + that becomes a pain because the challenge comes from grinding for rare items (in multiples, for completion of the Fusion Recipes) and the fact that the dungeons are just longer with cheaper boss fights. Oh, did I mention that you can't save inside of a dungeon? There's really nothing to gain from the New Game + experience except an increase in frustration and maybe two characters. I put a point in saying maybe because if you do unlock the final character, you've already defeated all the monsters and bosses the game has to throw at you. That's bad pacing right there.\n\nThe main problem with Recettear is that the item shop game, billed as its selling point, just doesn't work. It fails from lack of options for the player, lack of interface telling the player what he's doing right and wrong and arbitrary levels of contentment amongst the customers. It's not hard, far from it! It's that there's no gaming elements related to the experience. Recettear might as well be a visual novel with a dungeon crawler tacked on to it. It's cute and endearing but it fails at being a game to begin with. And I'm the idiot who gifted this product to so many of my friends. Just enormous waves of regret all around, don't be like me and get suckered in by a cute exterior...\n\nPS: I really wished that there were more "Adventurer" customers and less normal looking villagers, so you could really make this game about an ITEM SHOP SET IN AN RPG WORLD. As it is, you're really more of a goods store selling general products and knickknacks.","November 22, 2014","false","47.9"," 13 of 48 people (27%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","27","13","48","0","3"
